            <p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:CHAN1">Mr. CHANDLER</persName> the<lb/>House went into Committee (Mr. Lewis<lb/>in the Chair) to take into considereation<lb/>a Bill to repeal Section 4, Chapter 27,<lb/>Act 14 Victoria, entitled "An Act relat<lb break="no"/>ing the Public Burying Gounds in the<lb/>Town of St. Andrews."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CHAN1">Mr. CHANDLER</persName> said that an Act of<lb/>Assembly had been passed by which it<lb/>was declared that certain Public Bury<lb break="no"/>ing Grounds in St. Andrews should not<lb/>be used for the interment of the bodies<lb/>of diseased persons. The fourth section<lb/>of said Act contained a clause that the<lb/>Act should not come into operation until<lb/>certain things had been done. Those<lb/>things have been done, and they were<lb/>now in a position to have that section re<lb break="no"/>pealed. He then read a Petition praying<lb/>for the repeal of the section which he ob<lb break="no"/>served brought the matter clearly and<lb/>distinctly before the House. He said the<lb/>Petition was signed by all the clergymen<lb/>and almost all the inhabitants of St. An<lb break="no"/>drews. He would not make any more<lb/>observations further than to say that<lb/>burial grounds in the neighborhood of a<lb/>Town affected the health of its inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants. These burial grounds were at<lb/>the head of the town, which was situa<lb break="no"/>ted on a slightly inclined plain, and they<lb/>water running through those grounds<lb/>got into wells, and this had a highly<lb/>injurious effect upon the health of the<lb/>people of the place. He hoped there<lb/>would be no opposition to the Bill, but<lb/>that it would be allowed to pass.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName>. â A few days ago,<lb/>when I was advocating an incrrease of<lb/>representation for the County of Carle<lb break="no"/>ton, several members thought it would<lb/>be better to introduce a Bill to reduce<lb/>the representation on the floors of the<lb/>House instead of increasing it. That<lb/>coincided with my views, for I thought<lb/>in view of our altered circumstances<lb/>we should reduce our expenses as much<lb/>as possible. The basis upon which the<lb/>representation of the Counties now<lb/>stand is very unfair. In the County of<lb/>Carleton, which I have the honor to re<lb break="no"/>present, the have one representative<lb/>to 9400 inhabitants; County of Albert<lb/>one to 4722; Charlotte one to 5907;<lb/>Gloucester one to 7519; Kent one to<lb/>7927; King's one to 7761; Northumber<lb break="no"/>land one to 4700; Queen's one to 6600;<lb/>Restigouehe one to 2437; St. John one<lb/>to 3085; Westmorland one to 6311;<lb/>York one to 5810. This representation<lb/>is very unfair, and when I had a Bill<lb/>before the House to increase the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of Carleton it was generally<lb/>conceded that if a Bill was prepared<lb/>which would do justice to all sections<lb/>of the country it would receive the sup<lb break="no"/>port of the hon. members of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. Accordingly I introduced a Bill<lb/>which is now befoer the Committee,<lb/>which provides that there shall be one<lb/>member for every 7500 inhabitants. My<lb/>first idea was to make it for every 8000,<lb/>

     <fw type="num">62</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1867.</fw> 


     but upon considering the question I 
     <lb/>
     found some of the Counties had about 
     <lb/>
     15000 inhabitants, and the Bill would 
     <lb/>
     deprive them of having two represen<lb break="no"/>tatives. The principle of the Bill is to 
     <lb/>
     have one representative for every 7500 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants, but in no case to allow any 
     <lb/>County to have more than three re<lb break="no"/>presentatives. St John City should 
     <lb/>have two members, and the County 
     <lb/>should be represented the same as other 
     <lb/>Counties. According to this arange<lb break="no"/>ment there will be thirty members in 
     <lb/>the House, unless we give the City of 
     <lb/>Fredericton one, which would make the 
     <lb/>whole ntttnber thirty-one. I would con<lb break="no"/>fine the City of St. John to two mem<lb break="no"/>bers, for I do not believe cities should 
     <lb/>be represented according to population. 
     <lb/>It is not so in Great Britain, if it were 
     <lb/>so the City of London would have one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>sixth of the representation of all Eng<lb break="no"/>land. Having made these few remarks 
     <lb/>I shall be glad to hear tlte views of 
     <lb/>other hon. members on the floors of the 
     <lb/>House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:RYAN1">Mr. RYAN</persName>.âIf I am rightly informed,      
     <lb/>according to this Bill some counties will<lb/>only have one representative. I think<lb/>any Country, however small it may be,<lb/>should have not less than two members.<lb/>Suppose a Country should have but one<lb/>member, and he should absent, or<lb/>sick; who would attend to the affairs of<lb/>that County? We cannot give the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation exactly on the basis of popula<lb break="no"/>tion, but even if we did, it would remain<lb/>so only until the next census, because one<lb/>County frequently increases faster than<lb/>other Counties. I would suggest that<lb/>every County that has four members<lb/>should be reduced to three ; that would<lb/>take five members from the floors of the<lb/>House, and leave a representation of<lb/>thirty-six. I have frequently tried to get<lb/>an increase of representation for King's,<lb/>but unfortunately for some cause or other<lb/>âeither from want of being pressed pro<lb break="no"/>perly, or from a determination of the<lb/>House not to do justice to King'sâI have<lb/>never been able to effect it. The propo<lb break="no"/>sition I have just made is a good one,<lb/>and will do justice to all. We should<lb/>decrease our expense under any circum<lb break="no"/>stances, but particularly now when we<lb/>are going into Union, for the duties and<lb/>requirements of the Legislature will not<lb/>be so great as they have been hereto<lb break="no"/>fore.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIBB1">Mr. HIBBARD</persName>.âI fully agreee with<lb/>the Bill brought in by my hon. friend, if<lb/>he can carry it, but if he cannot carry it<lb/>I agree with the suggestion of my hon.<lb/>friend from King's. There seems to be<lb/>a dread around the floors of the House of<lb/>placing the representation upon the basis<lb/>of population. Suppose it does give but<lb/>one representative to some of the Coun<lb break="no"/>ties, is not the same provision made for<lb/>
       

  <cb/>
        

     
     the representation to the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and I do not believe but we will<lb/>get our rights at Ottawa. I have always<lb/>advocated the principle of representation<lb/>by population, and I still support it. This<lb/>Bill must be prospective, for the mover<lb/>has not power to dissolve the House. If<lb/>he carries it he should make it prospec<lb break="no"/>tive, because it cannot be carried out<lb/>until the House dies out by law, or the<lb/>Government tells us to go home. If the<lb/>Government would dissolve the House to<lb/>carry out the provisions of this Bill they<lb/>would meet with the approbation of the<lb/>country. This Bill brings us down to<lb/>thirty-one members. I believe ten mem<lb break="no"/>bers would do all the work we have done<lb/>here up to this time. I do not doubt<lb/>but five men would have done its Thirty-<lb break="yes"/>one men are amply sufficient to legislate<lb/>upon all the local wants we will require.<lb/>I firmly believe that if we husbanded our<lb/>resources. reduced our expenses, and<lb/>acted economically, there would not be a<lb/>Province in the British Empire that<lb/>would have as much for its local pur<lb break="no"/>poses as we would have. But if we re<lb break="no"/>tain forty-one members in the House,<lb/>create new offices, assist Western Exten<lb break="no"/>sion, while we have no revenue but what<lb/>we derive from our Public Domain and<lb/>what we receive from the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, there will be nothing before us<lb/>but direct taxation. Representation by<lb/>population is the fair, honest principle,<lb/>and however hard it may bear on some<lb/>Counties, we must take something as a<lb/>basis, and if that basis should reduce the<lb/>representation of the County of Charlotte<lb/>to two, I would agree to it. My col<lb break="no"/>leagues may have something to say about<lb/>it, but for myself I would go for it, be<lb break="no"/>cause I believe ten men could do all the<lb/>work we have to do. I hope the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government will give due<lb/>consideration to this question, regardless<lb/>of interested motives, and do all they can<lb/>for the reduction of the expenses of the<lb/>Legislature.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:STEV1">Mr. BABBIT</persName>.âI think justice should     
     <lb/>be done to all parties, but this Bill is go<lb break="no"/>ing too far for a good many of the hon.<lb/>members. I acknowledge I do not like<lb/>representation by population. (A mem<lb break="no"/>berâYou supported the Quebec Scheme.)<lb/>I never advocated the principle of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population, for I believe it<lb/>will eventually lead to universal suffrage,<lb/>(Mr. Tilley,âThat is not the principle in<lb/>this Bill, for it limits the representation<lb/>of Counties to three members.) I do not<lb/>think we have so many conflicting inter<lb break="no"/>ests in this Province to require a strict<lb/>adherence to this principle, and I do not<lb/>think it is right to deprive a county of<lb/>having two members because it has a few<lb/>inhabitants less than the required num<lb break="no"/>ber. I think those Counties which have<lb/>four representatives should be reduced to<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
      

     three, and this would lessen the expense        
     <lb/>to the country. It is not right to reduce<lb/>any County to one member, therefore I<lb/>cannot support the Bill, but I would sup<lb break="no"/>port a Bill to reduce the number in the<lb/>Counties that have four members.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LEWI1">Mr. LEWIS</persName>.âI think those hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who are favorable to reducing the<lb/>number of members must have their faces<lb/>turned towards Ottawa. We cannot do<lb/>with one member in each County, be<lb break="no"/>cause he might be sick, and the County<lb/>would not be represented at all. This<lb/>Bill will not answer unless we are going<lb/>to give up New Brunswick and go to<lb/>Ottawa. I would go for striking one<lb/>member from some of those large Coun<lb break="no"/>ties, for we must curtail the expense and<lb/>live within our resources. If our expen<lb break="no"/>diture is beyond our means bankruptcy<lb/>must ultimately ensue. I do not think<lb/>the hon. member was in earnest when he<lb/>brought in this Bill ; he only brought it<lb/>in to have a discussion, and had no idea<lb/>of passing it. I will go for letting the<lb/>representation stand as it is, although I<lb/>have no objection to have one member<lb/>taken from each of the large Counties.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName>âI will say for the<lb/>information of the hon. member who has<lb/>just sat down that I am in earnest. I want<lb/>to reduce the expense of the country,<lb/>and I want the country to know who are<lb/>willing to reduce them. I suppose there<lb/>will be some difficulty in carrying it, as<lb/>the members of those small Counties<lb/>which are likely to be reduced will go<lb/>against it. My hon. friend is very gen<lb break="no"/>erous ; he wants to take off of the large<lb/>Counties ; that is "take my neighbour<lb/>but let me alone." I believe the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House should do their duty<lb/>and have the interest of their country at<lb/>heart. My hon. friend said we should<lb/>not reduce a County to one member be<lb break="no"/>cause he might get sick ; if a man finds<lb/>he cannot attend to the duties of his con<lb break="no"/>stituents he should give place to another<lb/>man who can. My opinion is that we<lb/>must decrease the representation, or to<lb/>do justice to some counties we must in<lb break="no"/>crease it. My hon. friend from Queen's<lb/>(Mr. Babbit) said he did not like the<lb/>principle of representation in the Bill.<lb/>I would like him to introduce a Bill upon<lb/>juster terms. He said it would lead to<lb/>universal suffrage. I showed him how<lb/>unfair it would be to have population as<lb/>the basis of representation in large cities.<lb/>Hon. members will find fault with the<lb/>Bill, but I say if it is not right let them<lb/>prepare a better one.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BEVE1">Mr. BEVERIDGE</persName>âI can agree with<lb/>some things my hon. friend said, but not<lb/>with all he said. The County he repre<lb break="no"/>sents is only sixty miles in length ; my<lb/>County is one hundred and twenty miles<lb/>long, therefore it would be unfair to take<lb/>one representative from Victoria.

district territory should be taken into ac<lb break="no"/>count as well as population. If we had<lb/>but one representative, and he should<lb/>live at one end of the County, he would<lb/>never see half of his constituents. I<lb/>would be prepared to go for reduction in<lb/>the large Counties if it was necessary to<lb/>reduce the representation, but would<lb/>rather not have it reduced.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FERR2">Mr. FERRIS</persName>.âThere are always two<lb/>parties in every County, and if a small<lb/>County sent but one representative it<lb/>would give one man all the power. I do<lb/>not think a County with one representa<lb break="no"/>tive would get fair play in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, but those large Counties might be<lb/>represented by three members as well as<lb/>four. It is just throwing away so much<lb/>money to send four representatives, for I<lb/>think the Counties would be just as well<lb/>represented by two, and there could be a<lb/>reduction made of four or six in the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BECK1">Mr. BECKWITH</persName>.âIf a reduction<lb/>takes place it should be done by some<lb/>general rule which would do justice to<lb/>every County.

     <persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName>.âThe Bill does not

Although some of our best men<lb/>will be abstracted from us in consequence<lb/>of this Ottawa Legislature, yet I still be<lb break="no"/>lieve that forty-one good men will remain<lb/>in New Brunswick capable of doing the<lb/>business of the Province. We had forty-<lb break="yes"/>one members when our population was<lb/>but 170,000, and we have the same num<lb break="no"/>ber now when our population was 252,<lb break="no"/>000 five years ago. Some very import<lb break="no"/>ant features in the business of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, such as Education and the settlement<lb/>of the country, have still to be attended<lb/>to. Then again, one member cannot at<lb break="no"/>tend properly to the duties of his County.<lb/>It would be better to throw two Counties<lb/>into one than to have only one represen<lb break="no"/>tative for a County, but it would be re<lb break="no"/>trorgading to do even that. Carleton<lb/>County should have three members, and<lb/>King's four ; with those two exceptions<lb/>I cannot see any alteration we can make<lb/>which would be advantageous. We<lb/>should not go into this question now, as<lb/>ten or twelve of the members here will<lb/>legislate upon this who will not legislate<lb/>here again, for they will be in Ottawa.<lb/>Let us get through with all these changes<lb/>which must take place in consequence of<lb/>the General Legislature being at Ottawa,<lb/>and then those who are here years after<lb/>this, can take the question up cooly and<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         
deliberately, with ample time to consider<lb/>the question and do justice to the differ-<lb break="yes"/>end Counties. With these opinions I<lb/>must go against passing the Bill.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Hon. Mr. McMILLAN</persName>.âI am opposed<lb/>to the Bill, not because I happen to re<lb break="no"/>present one of the smallest Counties, for<lb/>I believe that that County, in consequence<lb/>of certain changes at hand, will contain as<lb/>large a population as some of the largest 
     <lb/>
     Counties in the Province, but because I 
     <lb/>
     believe there will be no saving of money 
     <lb/>
     effected by the reduction. If you are 
     <lb/>
     going to carry out the principles of Re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Government you will find they 
     <lb/>
     cannot be carried out in a small Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. If you leave nine man in the Exe<lb break="no"/>cutive and reduce the House to thirty-five, 
     <lb/>
     you could not turn the Government out 
     <lb/>
     at all. There will be talent enough in 
     <lb/>
     the House to carry out the principles of 
     <lb/>
     Responsible Government after the lead<lb break="no"/>ing men in this House go to Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     You will have the cleverest young men in 
     <lb/>
     the country come here to receive a politi<lb break="no"/>cal education, with a view to a higher 
     <lb/>position in the General Government. 
     <lb/>There will be sufficient talent left in this 
     <lb/>House to deal with all matters left for 
     <lb/>them. Probably fifteen in this House 
     <lb/>will offer for Ottawa ; is it fair for them 
     <lb/>now to pass a law which will not affect 
     <lb/>them at all, but will affect the party re<lb break="no"/>sponsible for it hereafter. We are on<lb/>the eve of great changes, therefore, those<lb/>who are left should decide with regard to<lb/>this reduction, and not those who are go<lb break="no"/>ing into another sphere, and who, in or<lb break="no"/>der to gain popularity, try to make it ap<lb break="no"/>pear that there will be a great saving of<lb/>money. I believe it is premature to dael<lb/>with this matter ; we had better leave it<lb/>to the parties who are to be af<lb break="no"/>fected by it ; they can determine whether<lb/>they can do with a less representation<lb/>than they now have, and they will be<lb/>responsible to the people for their de<lb break="no"/>cision.<lb/>

I do not suppose that<lb/>because a man is going to Ottawa he<lb/>should have no voice on this question, for<lb/>those who go to Ottawa still expect to<lb/>
    remain citizens of New Brunswick. In 
     <lb/>speaking upon the appointment of Dele<lb break="no"/>gates last year I moved that the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Councillors should reside in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, but no hon. member here except

     gestions of my hon. friend I gave him 
     <lb/>credit for, but he brought in a resolution<lb/>to get certain conditions, and if we could<lb/>not get them we could have no Union.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.âI wished to restrict the<lb/>power of the Delegates, for I did not<lb/>approve of the Quebec Scheme, and I<lb/>took many objections to it. Some of<lb/>those objections were adopted, but other<lb/>objections, equally forcible to my mind,<lb/>where not adopted. I took an objection<lb/>to the principle of representation by<lb/>population, but I find this principle is<lb/>laid down in this Act of Union as inflex<lb break="no"/>ible and immutable. The conflicting<lb/>opinions on this small Bill corroborate<lb/>the opinion I then took. It is wrong in<lb/>principle, and not recognized or adopted<lb/>in any part of the British Empire, but for<lb/>purposes peculiarly ultra Canadian that<lb/>principle was laid down and established<lb/>and becomes the governing principle of<lb/>the country. In the Act of Union it is<lb/>established, and I will venture to pro<lb break="no"/>phesy that in a few years Upper Canada<lb/>will have a numerical majority of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, not only over Lower Canada,<lb/>but over the Lower Provinces, too and<lb/>we will be at her mercy. They should<lb/>have agreed upon a certain number of<lb/>representatives and not increased them.<lb/>We cannot help it now, but what I have<lb/>seen here to-day in reference to this Bill<lb/>has satisfied me of the wisdom of the<lb/>course we took upon that question.<lb/>

            <p>
     My hon. friend, the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, is wrong to say we have no right to 
     <lb/>
     legislate upon this matter ; the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country expect us to legislate upon 
     <lb/>
     it. Was it not preached in every part of 
     <lb/>
     the Province that the expenses of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature would be vastly reduced ? 
     <lb/>
     Where is the reduction to be made ? Two 
     <lb/>
     offices created already, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     know how many more the Government 
     <lb/>
     contemplate to carry before the close of 
     <lb/>
     the Session. We resisted their measure 
     <lb/>
    yesterday, in regard to the appointment 
     <lb/>of Receiver General, and got the salary 
     <lb/>reduced from Â£590 to Â£400, and we had 
     <lb/>a section struck out which provided for 
     <lb/>the appointment of a clerk in the Re<lb break="no"/>ceiver General's office ; by this means<lb/>we saved the country Â£300 a year for all<lb/>time to come.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     I do not think it would be wise to have 
     <lb/>any County confined to only one repre<lb break="no"/>sentative, because he might have impera<lb break="no"/>tive business that would call him home,<lb/>and he could not attend to his legislative<lb/>duties.

dred pounds a year for all time to come.<lb/>That will appear very well in the Debates,<lb/>but we know the hon. mover of the Bill<lb/>stated that it would only continue for<lb/>some months, and then the Legislature<lb/>would have the right to legislate upon<lb/>that Bill again, and when the vote was<lb/>taken it was with that understanding,<lb/>and it may be that then the Legislature<lb/>will make the salary Â£500 and appoint<lb/>a clerk besides. While I believe we<lb/>should keep our expenses as low as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, I do not believe that you can get a<lb/>first class man to take the office of Re<lb break="no"/>ceiver General and act without a clerk<lb/>for $1,600 a year. I have heard it stated<lb/>here that the President of the United<lb/>States received but $25,000 a year. The<lb/>President, although his salary is $25,000,<lb/>gets from the Treasury Department over<lb/>$100,000 a year to pay his expenses,<lb/>The Chamberlain of New York gets<lb/>$70,000, and ladies in New York offices<lb/>get $100 a month. For the office of Re<lb break="no"/>ceiver General you must have a man who<lb/>understands the routine of office, and one<lb/>who will take the responsibility. To ask<lb/>a man to give bonds for Â£10,000 a year<lb/>and give him a salary of only $1,600 is<lb/>perfectly absurd.<lb/>

            <p>
     I cannot support my hon. friend's Bill, 
     <lb/>
     for I believe one man cannot represent a 
     <lb/>
     County. When Confederation was in<lb break="no"/>troduced, I took the position that by the 
     <lb/>
     consolidation of the British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican Colonies on this continent they 
     <lb/>
     would be advanced as an important part 
     <lb/>
     of the British empire, and we would have 
     <lb/>
     an increased population in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of the construction of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway. Why, then, should we go for 
     <lb/>
     reducing the representation in our Legis<lb break="no"/>lature when we expect such an increase 
     <lb/>
     of population ? I firmly believe that the 
     <lb/>
     construction of this road and branches 
     <lb/>
     will greatly increase our population. 
     <lb/>
     This is the position I took at the time of 
     <lb/>
     the election, and it is the position l would 
     <lb/>
     take again. You may call it Ottawa on 
     <lb/>
     the brain ; this is a new disease, but I can 
     <lb/>
     cure it. I can give you a recipe that will 
     <lb/>
     kill it dead, and I get it myself I will 
     <lb/>
     take the same remedy. I did not intend 
     <lb/>
     to say anything about this Bill, but I 
     <lb/>
     cannot vote for it. I believe we are to 
     <lb/>
     grow in importance and prosperity, and 
     <lb/>
     we will require just as many and as 
     <lb/>
     zealous men in the Legislature after these 
     <lb/>
     men go to Ottawa as we have now.

     <persName ref="pers:FLEW2">Mr. W. P. FLEWELLING</persName>.âI do not 
     <lb/>
     think this Bill is exactly what is required 
     <lb/>
     by the members ol the House. I do not 
     <lb/>
     agree with it, from the fact, which has 
     <lb/>
     been stated by some of the members here, 
     <lb/>
     that it will leave some counties with only 
     <lb/>
     one representative. I think the only 
     <lb/>
     way of doing equal justice to all the 
     <lb/>
     Counties is to reduce the number of 
     <lb/>
     members in the large Counties to three, 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     
     and there should be an amendment made         
     <lb/>
     to the Bill to carry out that arrangement,        
     <lb/>I cannot agree with the hon. friend from<lb/>Charlotte (Mr. Hibbard) that the whole<lb/>business of the House could be done with<lb/>fifteen members, for it would require<lb/>more than that to carry out the principles<lb/>of Responsible Government. We are<lb/>now going to change the constitutionâit<lb/>is a good time to make a reduction in the<lb/>number of members. I have always<lb/>advocated the necessity of economy, and<lb/>I think we can do very well with 36<lb/>members on the floors of the House to<lb/>carry out the necessary requirements of<lb/>the country. I should like to hear every<lb/>member present express his opinion in<lb/>regard to the best means of bringing<lb/>about this desirable result.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName>.âI think every member on<lb/>the floors of this House must be aware<lb/>that this country expects that there will<lb/>be a reduction in the number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers in the House, and a vast amount of<lb/>retrenchment practised here. The mul<lb break="no"/>tifarious matters connected with the<lb/>legislation of the Province are taken from<lb/>our hand, and there is no necessity for the<lb/>same number of members, the same ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, or the same length of Session.<lb/>Nova Scotia, with a population of one<lb/>hundred thousand more than we have,<lb/>and more numerous resources, has reduced<lb/>her Legislature some eleven or twelve,<lb/>leaving three members for Pictou, three<lb/>for the City of Halifax, and two for each<lb/>of the other Counties. The proposition<lb/>made to take one member from each of<lb/>our Counties having four members ap<lb break="no"/>pears reasonable, and ought to be taken<lb/>into consideration. My hon. friend from<lb/>Carleton (Mr. Lindsay) made out a very<lb/>strong case in regard to Carleton being<lb/>very badly used. I heard recently of<lb/>great injustice being done to the River<lb/>Counties in the appointment of Senators,<lb/>and we find they always vote together on<lb/>any question affecting their interest. Now<lb/>take the population of the five River Coun<lb break="no"/>ties, that is the five above King's, and di<lb break="no"/>vide them by the number of members, and<lb/>it will give you one member for every fifty<lb/>five hundred inhabitants. Then take the<lb/>four North Shore Counties, and divide<lb/>the inhabitants by the number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and it will give on representative<lb/>for every five thousand four hundred<lb/>inhabitants. This shows that each mem<lb break="no"/>ber from the North represents one hun<lb break="no"/>dred inhabitants more than each member<lb/>from the River Counties. Therefore, I<lb/>cannot see that so much injustice has<lb/>been done to Carleton as has been re<lb break="no"/>presented. I believe that the members<lb/>from Victoria feel so much interest in<lb/>promoting the welfare of Carleton as they<lb/>do in promoting the welfare of their own<lb/>County, and so <hi rendition="simple:italic">vice versa</hi> all through the<lb/>River Counties.<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     It appears to me to be very desirable 
     <lb/>that Counties that have two or three<lb/>members should be divided off into Rid<lb break="no"/>ings, as they are in Canada ; then can<lb break="no"/>didates would not have to run their<lb/>election through the whole County, and<lb/>this would save trouble, both to the<lb/>candidates themselves and those whom<lb/>they represent. Something should be<lb/>done, and the question if whether it is<lb/>advisable to do it in this short Session.<lb/>The Bill will not take effect until the next<lb/>general election, and until something of<lb/>that kind is looked forward to, it is<lb/>hardly desirable to legislate upon the<lb/>subject. We should approach the ques<lb break="no"/>tion with a determination to do justice to<lb/>every section of the Province. I believe<lb/>thirty members on the floors of this House<lb/>will answer all purposes for many years<lb/>to come, for our interests are not so varied<lb/>that they would not be able to manage<lb/>our affairs. We should either reduce the<lb/>numbers or reduce the pay. It is not so<lb/>much the number of members that should<lb/>be considered as the expense incurred<lb/>while we are here. We should be al<lb break="no"/>lowed pay for thirty days, and if we<lb/>stayed any longer it should be at our<lb/>own expense. People say, Why do you<lb/>remain so long at Fredericton, when you<lb/>might do your business in half the time?<lb/>Why do you not retrench your expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, in order that it may be applied to<lb/>the building of Roads and Bridges, in<lb break="no"/>stead of squandering it away in the<lb/>House of Assembly ? I have always<lb/>advocated the principle of retrench<lb break="no"/>ment, for I felt the necessity for it in<lb/>our public affairs. I am satisfied it is<lb/>the wish of the country that the rep<lb break="no"/>resentation should be reduced, more<lb/>particularly as politicians have been<lb/>stating in every County in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince that one of the great advantages<lb/>we would have by going into Con<lb break="no"/>federation wold be that we would<lb/>have more money, from the saving in<lb/>the expenses of our Legislature than<lb/>we had hitherto.<lb/>

            <p>
     I think the representation should be 
     <lb/>reduced very materially. If this Bill<lb/>before the House is not thought to be<lb/>a correct one, let some one bring in a<lb/>better Bill and I shall go for it, but if<lb/>another is not brought in, I shall go for<lb/>this.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MCQU1">Mr. McQUEEN</persName>.âWhen a Bill was 
     <lb/>presented the other day to increase the<lb/>representation of King's, we were told<lb/>that it was an annual offering. I did<lb/>not go for it, because I thought it de<lb break="no"/>sirable to reduce the number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers. I thought King's, Carleton and<lb/>Kent were each entitled to an additional<lb/>member, but as equal justice could be<lb/>done at all by reducing the representa<lb break="no"/>tion, I considered it would be better to<lb/>reduce the number on the floors of the<lb/>

     House. Some say they will go for 
     <lb/>
     reducing them one half. I would not 
     <lb/>
     go for that at the present time, for the 
     <lb/>
     simple  reason that I believe in a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative Government we ought to have 
     <lb/>
     a deliberative body sufficient to think, 
     <lb/>
     consider and weigh all matters that 
     <lb/>
     come before us.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STEV1">Mr.  STEVENS</persName>.â A constitutional 
     <lb/>
     change like this requires us to exercise 
     <lb/>
     mature  deliberation. There is  not a 
     <lb/>
     member around the House but would 
     <lb/>
     be inclined to give the question a calm 
     <lb/>
     consideration, in order that the best re<lb break="no"/>sults might be obtained. A great deal 
     <lb/>has been said in regard to the expres<lb break="no"/>sions of the people of the country. It 
     <lb/>is said they expect us to retrench at this  
     <lb/>time. If  retrenchment is necessary  
     <lb/> now it is necessary at all times. 
     <lb/>Whatever the people wish me to do in 
     <lb/>this question I would do, for it is their 
     <lb/>own business ; but I do not know the 
     <lb/>minds of the people of Charlotte, 
     <lb/>whether they want the representation 
     <lb/>reduced or not, for it is a question that 
     <lb/>has not been much considered. Should 
     <lb/>I, on returning home, find the people 
     <lb/>wished this reduction to be made, I 
     <lb/>would be well prepared to vote upon 
     <lb/>the amendment. I make these remarks 
     <lb/>because I do not see the reason for any 
     <lb/>hurry in passing a measure of this kind ; 
     <lb/>even if the measure was complete there 
     <lb/>would be nothing lost by the delay. 
     <lb/>What is gained by delaying it ? In 
     <lb/>another year you will ascertain the 
     <lb/>views of the people upon it.  I am not 
     <lb/>now in a position to know their views, and  
     <lb/>as the people sent me here to carry out  
     <lb/>their wishes I cannot say to them when I 
     <lb/>return home I consented to take away 
     <lb/>one of your representatives without 
     <lb/>knowing that you desired it. It would 
     <lb/>be much more gratifying to all to have 
     <lb/>the matter stand over until another ses<lb break="no"/>sion. It might be very well for those 
     <lb/>who no longer expect  to sit in the Local 
     <lb/>Legislature to vote upon this question, 
     <lb/>for they will not be affected by it, as 
     <lb/>they expect to go to Ottawa ; but it 
     <lb/>would be more graceful for  them to al<lb break="no"/>low those who come in after them to 
     <lb/>deal with the question, for they would 
     <lb/>then have the minds of the people upon 
     <lb/>it. The people may say we never asked  
     <lb/>you to reduce our representation. We 
     <lb/> would then feel that we had not been 
     <lb/>acting in accordance with their wishes. 
     <lb/>Then again, when you go to alter the 
     <lb/> representation you should  begin at the 
     <lb/>bottom and regulate the whole thing. 
     <lb/>You must make some arrangement in 
     <lb/>regard to the Executive, for if you al<lb break="no"/>low nine members to hold seats there 
     <lb/>it would give the Government such a 
     <lb/>predominance that you could not move 
     <lb/> them ; therefore, this matter requires 
     <lb/>mature deliberation, and this, I think,<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
         

     is apparent to every one. I desire all<lb/>economy to be used. The duties of the 
     <lb/>
     House will  be curtailed, and there will 
     <lb/>
     be no need for the House to sit so many 
     <lb/>
     days. Instead of sitting  two months 
     <lb/>
     the House will be able to discharge its 
     <lb/>
     duties in one month, and this will be a 
     <lb/>
     curtailment of expenses at once, arising 
     <lb/>
     out of the business we have to do, and 
     <lb/>
     there  will be no encroachment there 
     <lb/>
     upon the rights of the people. The du<lb break="no"/>ties that  remain for us to do still require 
     <lb/>
     as much deliberation as they ever did, 
     <lb/>
     for you cannot tell me wherein they re<lb break="no"/>quire less ; but it will only require half 
     <lb/>
     the time to attend to them, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of their number being less than 
     <lb/>
     formerly.

     <lb/> are in favor of this Bill we should go 
     <lb/>for it. ln order to do justice to the 
     <lb/>County of King's we should pass a Bill 
     <lb/>to reduce  the representation, for I do 
     <lb/>not think it would be right to increase 
     <lb/>the representation under the present 
     <lb/>circumstances. I think we should go 
     <lb/>for the amendment suggested by the 
     <lb/>hon. member from King's.

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:QUIN1">Mr. QUINTON</persName>.âI do not think it 
     <lb/>right to be  legislating so far  ahead, as 
     <lb/>there is no  necessity for passing this 
     <lb/>Bill at  present. It would be better to 
     <lb/>let it stand over until the House met 
     <lb/>next winter, and  not be taking up the 
     <lb/>time of the  House at this short session. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIBB1">Mr.  HIBBARD</persName>.âI do not like the 
     <lb/>idea of lopping a member off of a Coun<lb break="no"/>ty because it has four representatives, 
     <lb/>we should adopt a fair basis of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BABB1">Mr. BABBITT</persName>.âMy hon. friend from<lb/>Westmorland (Mr. Smith) in the course<lb/>of his remarks said, that in speaking 
     <lb/>
     upon the appointment of Delegates last  
     <lb/>
     year he had moved that the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Councillors should reside in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, but no member here, except the 
     <lb/>
     French  Brigade, sympathized with the 
     <lb/>
     proposition. In the  few remarks I 
     <lb/>
     made at that time I said. " I agree with 
     <lb/>
     the proposition made by the ex-Attorney  
     <lb/>
     General, that if the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cillors appointed to seats at Ottawa are 
     <lb/>
     simply to  have a property qualification 
     <lb/>
     here, it will not amount to a great deal, 
     <lb/>
     because some of them would remove to 
     <lb/>Canada, and instead of looking after our<lb/>
    interests they would be looking after 
     <lb/>the interests of the Canadians, for it is 
     <lb/>natural to suppose that a man would be 
     <lb/>most interested in the place in which he 
     <lb/>resides. We should instruct our Dele<lb break="no"/>gates in unmistakable terms that it 
     <lb/>should be provided in the Scheme that 
     <lb/>our  Legislative Councillors should both 
     <lb/>reside and have  their property qualifi<lb break="no"/>cation in this Province.  If this idea is 
     <lb/>not carried out I shall think it was the 
     <lb/>fault of our Delegates and not of the<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     Canadians, because  it is immaterial to 
     <lb/>
     them whether they reside here or there." 
     <lb/>
     My opinion then was plain and distinct 
     <lb/>
     on the question.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>.âMy hon. and 
     <lb/>
     learned friend (Mr. Smith) was wrong 
     <lb/>
     in  reference to the general opinion ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by  the House at that time. The 
     <lb/>
     general feeling  of the House was that 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Councillors should re<lb break="no"/>side in the Province. When the para<lb break="no"/>graph was read in  reference to the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of Legislative Councillors in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada there was a general 
     <lb/>
     concurrence in the opinion that the 
     <lb/>Legislative Councillors should be re<lb break="no"/>quired to live in the Province.

     <persName ref="pers:BECK1">Mr. BECKWITH</persName>.âMy hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Kerr) refers to Nova Scotia as hav<lb break="no"/>ing reduced her representation to two 
     <lb/>members for each County. This would<lb/>
    act very unfairly here, as it would give 
     <lb/>the small Counties all the advantages. 
     <lb/>Neither would it be right to take repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population, upon the terms  
     <lb/>of the Bill, as that would be doing great<lb/>injustice to the small Counties, for any 
     <lb/>County having  less than 1500 inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants would only have one representa<lb break="no"/>tive. It is the length of the Session<lb/>more than the number of members which<lb/>causes the increased expenses  of the 
     <lb/>Legislature. In 1851 when the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation was the same as it is now the 
     <lb/>expenses of the Legislature were $32,<lb break="no"/>000, whilst in 1866 the expenses were 
     <lb/> $41,000 ; no doubt but the latter session 
     <lb/>was much longer than the former, on 
     <lb/>account of the increased business they 
     <lb/>had to do. Our business will be much 
     <lb/>decreased, and we will have only local 
     <lb/>matters to attend to, therefore our ses<lb break="no"/>sion need not exceed forty days. There 
     <lb/>will be less  expenditure about the House 
     <lb/>for Coaches, &amp;c. ; there will be a less 
     <lb/>amount of printing done, and this will 
     <lb/>reduce our  expenditure very materially.

            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName>.â  Every hon. member 
     <lb/>says retrenchment is necessary, but no 
     <lb/>one is ready to begin. All have admitted 
     <lb/>that something should be done, but they 
     <lb/>do not tell us what that something is. 
     <lb/>Some people try to get all they can, and 
     <lb/>they have no conscience unless the law 
     <lb/>gives it to them. They have their $2,400  
     <lb/>a year, and then are off on their pleasure 
     <lb/>excursions at  $10 a day more. It is a 
     <lb/>regular grab   game all round. A man 
     <lb/>tries to hold on all he can get, and then 
     <lb/>get as much more as he canâthat prin<lb break="no"/>ciple is carried out in dual representation. 
     <lb/>One man wants to have one office here, 
     <lb/>and another in Canada, just as if there 
     <lb/>was not a man here fit for the  office except 
     <lb/>the present Attorney General. I never 
     <lb/>sought an office, and if I did I would not 
     <lb/>get it. So far as the Government is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, if they manage the affairs of the

There is another question which<lb/>the crown officers should answer, and<lb/>that is whether those who are appointed<lb/>from the Legislative Council and this<lb/>House can retain their seats now the<lb/>proclamation is issued. This is a point<lb/>of great importance. and should be well<lb/>defined, so that we may know whether<lb/>they are still in a position to legislate for<lb/>this country. I am aware that I have no<lb/>physical power to make the Government<lb/>answer the questions I put, but the<lb/>country will now know why it is the in<lb break="no"/>formation is not given, and with whom<lb/>the responsibility rests.<lb/>

It is a subject for the<lb/>Crown lawyers, and when the proclama<lb break="no"/>tion is received it can be looked into and<lb/>decided.<lb/>
