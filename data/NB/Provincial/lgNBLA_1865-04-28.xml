<!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

<!--<p> Brunswick, thank Your Excellency for<lb/>
your Speech at the opening of the Session.</p>

            <p> 2. We are gratified to learn that Her<lb/>
Majesty was graciously pleased to receive<lb/>
our congratulations on the occasion of<lb/>
the birth of the Son of their Royal High-<lb break="yes"/>
nesses the Prince and Princess of Wales.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> 3 We share with Your Excellency the<lb/>
feelings of satisfaction at the prospect
of<lb/>
the speedy restoration of peace
in the<lb/>
neighboring Republic ; and we assure<lb/>
Your Excellency that you truly express <lb/>
our sentiments, when you say that we <lb/>
fully share the feelings of
indignant re<lb break="no"/>probation which the murder of
the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent has excited in every honest and <lb/>
generous heart, and participate in the <lb/>
grief of a great and kindred people.
<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p> We thank Your Excellency for the as<lb break="no"/>surance that the Report of the Delegates <lb/>
appointed for the purpose of considering <lb/>
the practicability of effecting a
Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive and Administrative Union of
the <lb/>
Maritime Provinces of British North <lb/>
America, will be laid before us. We also <lb/>
thank Your Excellency for the informa<lb break="no"/>tion that the Resolutions adopted at a <lb/>
Conference of Representatives of the <lb/>
British North American Colonies, held at <lb/>
Quebec in October last, relative to a <lb/>
Union of British North America, will be <lb/>
laid before us.</p>
            <p> 5. We
will consider whether further <lb/>
facilities can be afforded for the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of Railways in this Province.<lb break="no"/>We are pleased to learn that the
comple<lb break="no"/>tion and extension of the European and <lb/>
North American Railway, from the
fron<lb break="no"/>tier of Nova Scotia to the
boundary of <lb/>
the United States, will be undertaken as <lb/>
soon as practicable : and we
regret that <lb/>
existing laws preclude immediate
action <lb/>
for the accomplishment of this work. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> 6. We will
give our attentive consid<lb break="no"/>eration to any measure that may be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted relating to the Postal Service
of <lb/>
the Province. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 7. We will give
our attention to such <lb/>
enactments as have recently expired,
or <lb/>
are about to expire. Any measure sub<lb break="no"/>mitted for the revival of the
Provincial <lb/>
Militia, and for increasing its
efficiency, <lb/>
will receive our most prompt and careful <lb/>
consideration. We thank Your Excel<lb break="no"/>lency for the assurance that the Corres<lb break="no"/>pondence between the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Your Excellency, relating to <lb/>
this subject,
will be laid before us. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 8. We are gratified
to learn that the <lb/>
Revenue of the past Fiscal Year
was <lb/>
largely in excess of the
Estimate, and that <lb/>
a surplus remained after all
charges on <lb/>
the Treasury had been defrayed. We <lb/>
regret, however, that the depression in <lb/>
trade has caused so large a
falling off in <lb/>
the Revenue of the present year, but we <lb/>
trust that the hopes of improvement ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by Your Excellency may be<lb/>
realized.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>9. We thank Your Excellency for the<lb/>
assurance that the Accounts of the In<lb break="no"/>come and Expenditure of the past year, <lb/>
and the Estimates for the present
year<lb/>
will be laid before us. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> 10. We agree with Your Excellency <lb/>
that notwithstanding the present depres<lb break="no"/>sion of Trade, the condition of
the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince is, on the whole, satisfactory, and <lb/>
that a feeling of contentment
and confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the institutions under which we <lb/>
live prevails ; and we assure
Your Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency, that whatever differences of <lb/>
opinion may exist on other subjects, the<lb/>
feeling of loyalty to the Crown, for which<lb/>
the people of this Province have always<lb/>
been distinguished, animates them still.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>11. We are fully sensible of the advan<lb break="no"/>tages we derive from our connection with <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
            <p> Great
Britain, and will cheerfully meet<lb/>
the obligations it entails upon us.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> On motion of Mr. OTTY, Saturday next<lb/>
at 11 o'clock was the time fixed for the <lb/>
discussion. of the Reply. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> On
motion of Mr. KERR, a Committee <lb/>
was appointed to confer with a
Committee <lb/>
of the Legislative Council, with regards to<lb/>
the Legislative Library.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> On motion of Mr. WILLISTON,
a Com<lb break="no"/>mittee was appointed to take into consid<lb break="no"/>eration the contingencies of the
House. <lb/>
            </p>

referred all matters relating to the Mining<lb/>
interests of the Province.</p>


            <p> On motion of Mr. NEEDHAM, a Standing <lb/>
Committee was appointed to whom
shall <lb/>
be referred all matters concerning
the <lb/>
privileges of the House. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. GILBERT moved a Resolution that <lb/>
the Rules in force in the late House be <lb/>
adopted in the present, until altered, <lb/>
amended, or repealed.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> After some discussion this Resolution <lb/>
was adopted. . <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> On motion of Mr. BEVERIDGE a Com<lb break="no"/>mittee was appointed to take
into consid<lb break="no"/>eration all matters relating to the Lumber<lb break="no"/>ing interests of the Province. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> On motion
of Mr. L. P. W. DESBRISAY, <lb/>
a Committee was appointed to take into <lb/>
consideration all matters connected with <lb/>
the Trade of the Province. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon.
ATTORNEY GENERAL brought in <lb/>
a Bill entitled, An act to regulate the sale <lb/>
of Spirituous Liquors. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. GILBERT brought

referred all matters relating to the Fish<lb break="no"/>eries of this Province. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. COMMISSIONER
OF THE BOARD OF<lb/>
WORKS, called the attention
of the House <lb/>
to the fact of the Reporters' seats
being so <lb/>
situated and occupied that it will be very <lb/>
difficult for the official Reporters to give <lb/>
satisfaction, unless they have a position <lb/>
assigned them in corner of the Ladies'<lb/>
Gallery, that being the most suitable place
<lb/>
in the House. This created some discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and the matter was finally dropped. <lb/>
            </p>

and papers.<lb/>

<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> On motion, the House was adjourned <lb/>
until to-morrow at. 10 o'clock. <lb/>

            <p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> leave was <lb/>
granted to introduce a Bill to provide for <lb/>
the fencing in of certain
intervale lands, <lb/>
and maintaining roads through the same <lb/>
in the County of Westmorland. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> leave was
<lb/>
granted to lay before the House the peti<lb break="no"/>tion of Rev. P. Callahan and others, of <lb/>
Shediac, to provide for the fencing in of <lb/>
certain intervale lands, and maintaining <lb/>
roads through the same. </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:WILL1">Mr. WILLISTON</persName> moved for leave to<lb/>
bring in a Bill for the protection of Moose.<lb/>
This Bill on motion was read a first and<lb/>

<cb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SCOV1">Mr. SCOVIL</persName> suggested the desirability<lb/>
of
having a law on the Statute Book

rabbits.")<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:WILL1">Mr. WILLISTON</persName> brought in a Bill re<lb break="no"/>lating to French property at Alma, in

County of Northumberland.<lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:WILL1">Mr.WILLISTON</persName>
on motion presented a <lb/>
petition from George Letson

of Alma, Northumberland, praying that <lb/>
the French may he required to support <lb/>
their own paupers in that

drawing from the poor law fund. <lb/>

Report adopted. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. Mr. HATHEWAY</persName> stated that he had<lb/>
been requested to inform the members
<lb/>
that they could, if they wished,
have the <lb/>
copies, if they desired to send it to
their con<lb break="no"/>stituents, done up and mailed
from the <lb/>
Publisher's office on
the payment of four <lb/>
dollars for the Session. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>
said the copies for the <lb/>
members ought to be done up and sent to <lb/>
the House, to be distributed by a person <lb/>
apppointed for the purpose. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DESB2">Mr. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName> presumed it <lb/>
was optional with members to do
as they <lb/>
pleased in the matter. He thought the <lb/>
idea a good one, and much preferable
to <lb/>
the plan adopted her? of
having <lb/>
them sent out from the House.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr. BOYD</persName> moved that the number of <lb/>
Debates printed be 6000, instead of 4,500 <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>
moved that the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Debates should be apportioned
<lb/>
according to population of 1861.
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName> moved an amendment <lb/>
that the distribution be as formerly— a 
<lb/>
definite number to each member. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr. BOYD</persName> said that in past years the <lb/>
distribution of the Debates by giving a <lb/>
certain number to each member had been <lb/>
very unequal and unfair. The small <lb/>
counties had received as many as
those <lb/>
with a population of 30 or 40 000, and he <lb/>
thought by carrying the resolution
a bet<lb break="no"/>ter order of things in this respect would <lb/>
be introduced, and much more general <lb/>
satisfaction given. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName> asked if the resolution <lb/>
contemplated representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName> said of course the Hon. <lb/>
ex-Surveyor General would go for the <lb/>
amendment, as'he represented a county <lb/>
with a population of some 4 or
5,000, and <lb/>
he would like to get as large a number as <lb/>
Carleton with its 17 or 18 000.
<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName> did not know where <lb/>
the hon. member got his information as to<lb/>
the population of the county he repre<lb break="no"/>sented, but he certainly had been
mis<lb break="no"/>informed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">Mr. CAIE</persName> asked
if two counties, each <lb/>
with about the same population, the one <lb/>having four members in the House and <lb/>
the other but two, would receive the same <lb/>
number of copies, or would one get double <lb/>as many as the other. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HUTC1">Mr. HUTCHISON</persName> thought St. John should <lb/>
not have as many copies according to <lb/>
population as the rural districts,
as they <lb/>
were well supplied with papers as
convey<lb break="no"/>ances of intelligence of  the doings of the <lb/>
House. With this exception he was fav<lb break="no"/>orable to a distribution apportioned ac<lb break="no"/>cording to population.<lb/>
            </p>






            <p> <persName ref="pers:WILL1">Mr. WILLISTON</persName>.— In Northumberland<lb/>
and Gloucester the people are
engaged in <lb/>
various employments, and require a larger<lb/>
diffusion of information than in counties<lb/>
         

            <pb n="3" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-04-28_Page_003.jpg"/>

 <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> <fw type="num">3</fw>
        
 where
the people were generally engaged<lb/>
in but one pursuit—King's, for example,<lb/>
where the people were mostly agricultur<lb break="no"/>ists?. In St.
John and some other places<lb/>
there is a larger amount of information<lb/>
imparted by the papers which cannot be<lb/>
the case in scattered districts. Then<lb/>
again, there is often more legislation re<lb break="no"/>quired for small constituencies than for<lb/>
larger ones, arising from the varied inter<lb break="no"/>ests involved. The object of having the<lb/>
Debates printed is to impart information.<lb/>
St. John is represented by a number of<lb/>
reporters of newspapers, who give to the<lb/>
people a synopsis of every day's proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, but in the North four counties had<lb/>
but one paper between them, from which<lb/>
to gain any information of what is going<lb/>
on during the sittings of the Legislature.<lb/>
I hope the House will fully consider the<lb/>
question.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr BOYD</persName>.—Charlotte has a population<lb/>
of twenty five or thirty thousand, with<lb/>
very little newspaper influence. The only<lb/>
way of diffusing information of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of the House is by making a di<lb break="no"/>vision of the Debates according to the<lb/>
population.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName>.—
I rise to adopt the<lb/>
principle of the resolution. If the divi<lb break="no"/>sion is made in any other manner than by<lb/>
population, then Northumberland will<lb/>
get about one-tenth of the Debates, while<lb/>
Carleton county, with a larger popula<lb break="no"/>tion, would get but about one twentieth.<lb/>
The principle of the resolution is equit<lb break="no"/>able and just, and shall have my support.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName> wished to explain. The<lb/>
only way to justify the expenditure of<lb/>
public money for this work was by using<lb/>
it for the benefit of those that required<lb/>
information. In St. John such informa<lb break="no"/>tion was not required, as they daily read a<lb/>
synopsis of the past day's proceedings. If<lb/>
the debates were to be divided according<lb/>
to the tenor of the resolution St. John<lb/>
would get about 1-6th of the whole, while<lb/>
other parts of the Province which have<lb/>
not newspaper advantages, will receive<lb/>
but very few. The resolution was adopt<lb break="no"/>ed.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr.
BOYD</persName> moved for leave to bring in<lb/>
a Bill authorizing the Trustees of Church<lb/>
in St. Andrews, to provide for the
sale of<lb/>
certain lands towards payment of the debt<lb/>
due on the church.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SCOV1">Mr. SCOVIL</persName> moved that 2000 copies of<lb/>
the Journals of the House be printed for<lb/>
the use of the Members.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName> asked if the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Journals was to be on the same<lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The SPEAKER</persName> replied : The resolution<lb/>
with regard to the Debates has no rela<lb break="no"/>tion to the Journals.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The SPEAKER</persName> informed the House<lb/>
that His Honor the Chief Justice was pre<lb break="no"/>sent to swear in a member. Whereupon<lb/>
His Honor administered the oath to John<lb/>

            <p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName> the re<lb break="no"/>solution on the distribution of the copies<lb/>

up for re-consideration.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr.

move reconsideration of the question<lb/>
again to-morrow, if now rescinded.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CORA1">Mr. CORAM</persName>
moved that the House ad<lb break="no"/>journ till 2 o'clock.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">Hon. Mr. BOTSFORD</persName> was surprised to<lb/>
hear the motion for adjournment, and<lb/>
thought the moving of a resolution for re<lb break="no"/>consideration, after the motion had been<lb/>
adopted and the House had become thin<lb/>
by members having left their seats, was<lb/>
not treating them with that courtesy they<lb/>
deserved.<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CORA1">Mr. CORAM</persName> withdrew his motion of ad<lb break="no"/>journment.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCELLAN</persName>
in reply to the re<lb break="no"/>marks of the Hon. Surveyor General said<lb/>
he was not in the House when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the distribution of the Debates by<lb/>
population came up, and on learning the<lb/>
result had moved for a reconsideration.<lb/>
He disclaimed any act of discourtesy to<lb/>
the members, inasmuch as he waited<lb/>
whilst a call for the House was made.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">Hon. Mr.
BOTSFORD</persName> thought when he<lb/>
spoke that the amendment to have the<lb/>
Debates distributed as heretofore, by each<lb/>
member receiving a certain number, had<lb/>
been carried, and under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances had characterized it as showing<lb/>
a want of courtesy to those members who<lb/>
had voted for the original resolution, but<lb/>
had been called away. He hoped this<lb/>
explanation would be satisfactory.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. Mr.
Hatheway</persName> said these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions and the lengthy talk upon them<lb/>
with regard to the Debates was the annu<lb break="no"/>al offering of the House. He thought<lb/>
when the resolution passed to make the<lb/>
apportionment by population, as unjust to<lb/>
those portions of the country which did<lb/>
not possess the advantages of newspaper<lb/>
reports. Carleton should not be placed<lb/>
in a better position than Restigouche or<lb/>
Gloucester. The people in those Coun<lb break="no"/>ties possessed little information and there<lb break="no"/>fore the distribution should be as here<lb break="no"/>tofore.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">Mr. CAIE</persName>
said there were always two<lb/>
ways of looking at the same thing. The<lb/>
County he had the honor to represent had<lb/>
about the same population as Northum<lb break="no"/>berland. The demand for copies of the<lb/>
Debates was as large as in that County,<lb/>
but whereas they had four members in<lb/>
the House, Kent had but two, and by giv<lb break="no"/>ing the Debates to the members as had<lb/>
been done in times past, they would get<lb/>
just double the number of copies. He<lb/>
was therefore in favor of distribution by<lb/>
population.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SUTT1">Mr. SUTTON</persName>
said that although he re<lb break="no"/>marks of the hon. member for Kent were<lb/>
correct, yet as the people he represented<lb/>
were mostly French, they would no re<lb break="no"/>quire as large a number as Northumber<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LAND1">Mr. LANDRY</persName>
said that the French were<lb/>
desirous to know what was being done<lb/>
and though they could not all read the<lb/>
debates yet some could, and these would<lb/>
read and explain them to others.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr.
MCCLELLAN</persName> moved that the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of debates be made by allowing<lb/>
an equal number to each member. This<lb/>
motion was not sustaine by the House.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr.
MCMILLAN</persName> moved that St. John be<lb/>
exempt in making up the estimate on the<lb/>
population of 1861.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. Mr. Hatheway</persName> begged the<lb/>
House to remember the position of the<lb/>
North. St. John boasted of a population<lb/>
of over 40,000, and she would get about<lb/>
one fifth of all the debates. The passing<lb/>
of the resolution would tend to lessen the<lb/>
number in the rural districts rather than<lb/>
increase them, and if it were pressed, he<lb/>
should vote for Mr. McMillan's motion<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr.
WETMORE</persName> said the people of Saint<lb/>
John, if better informed, paid for the in<lb break="no"/>formation they got through the news<lb break="no"/>papers, and the people in the country<lb/>
could obtain it in the same way if they<lb/>
saw fit to do so. He should certainly op<lb break="no"/>pose the motion to exempt Saint John<lb/>
from participating in the receipt of the<lb/>
debates.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. NEEDHAM</persName> moved a reconsideration<lb/>
of the question. On being requested by<lb/>
the Speaker to put his resolution in writ<lb break="no"/>ing he stated that as the House had not<lb/>
        
            <cb/>
        

 yet supplied him with stationary, he<lb/>
couldn't do it.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName> thought the motion un<lb break="no"/>parliamentary.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CORA1">Mr. CORAM</persName> again moved that the House<lb/>
adjourn till 2 o'clock.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ALLE2">Mr ALLEN</persName> said he had never heard of<lb/>
a motion of adjournment at that time of<lb/>
day ; if they wished to separate, the<lb/>
Speaker usually left the chair, and that<lb/>
ended the matter.</p>
            <p>Other Honorable members rose to<lb/>

<!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

          <!--  <p> SATURDAY, April 29th.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. COSTIGAN brought in a Bill to en<lb break="no"/>courage the exploration of vacant Crown<lb/>
Lands, and the discovery of elegible tim<lb break="no"/>ber berths thereon. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. WETMORE, by leave, brought in the<lb/>
following Petitions and Bills, viz : <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>A Bill to
amend an Act to provide for<lb/>
the erection of an Alms House and Work <lb/>
House, and to establish a Public Infirmary<lb/>
in and for the City of Saint John.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>A Petition from the Justices of the<lb/>
Peace to establish a Work House, Alms <lb/>
House and Public Infirmary.   <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> A Bill relation to the Grand Juries of<lb/>
St. John, and a Petition for the same.</p>
            <p>A Bill and Petition to provide for the<lb/>
better assessing of rates and taxes in the
<lb/>
City and County of St. John. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. WILLISTON brought in a Bill to<lb/>
authorize the Trustees of Schools in the <lb/>
Parish of Chatham, in the County of North<lb break="no"/>umberland, to sell a certain piece of land<lb/>
in the said Parish, and dispose of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds thereof. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. TROOP
brought in a Bill to provide <lb/>
for the relief of the sufferers by the late <lb/>
fire at Indiantown. <lb/>
Mr. OTTY moved the order of the
day, <lb/>
viz :—The consideration of the Address in <lb/>
answer to His Excellency's Speech at the <lb/>
opening of the Session.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> His Honor the SPEAKER then read the <lb/>
adddress by paragraph
; upon the reading <lb/>
of the 5th paragraph, <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. GILBERT said : This being a new <lb/>
Government it may not be amiss
for <lb/>
honorable members to express their<lb/>
opinion. The Speech being from the <lb/>
Executive, some members of whom are <lb/>
politicians of long standing, having a large<lb/>
amount of political knowledge, acquainted <lb/>
with the wants of the various parts of the<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
            <p> country, therefore, we must conclude this<lb/>
in their complete policy. Although the<lb/>
present administration has only lately<lb/>
come into power, yet when I consider the<lb/>
ability of the hon. gentlemen who compose<lb/>
that Government ; when I reflect upon the<lb/>
prominent position which some of them<lb/>
have occupied in the Legislature for a<lb/>
number of years, and the long experience<lb/>
they have had in the Government of the<lb/>
country, I must suppose that they have<lb/>
had a sufficient time to have matured the<lb/>
full and entire nature of their policy.<lb/>
This Speech does not mention the great<lb/>
wants and requirements of the country. I<lb/>
see nothing in it foreshadowing their poli<lb break="no"/>cy in regard to colonization. It is coloni<lb break="no"/>zation that has made the United States<lb/>
what it is. Take from them their system<lb/>
of colonization and emigration, and let<lb/>
them depend upon their own resources,<lb/>
and instead of having a population of 30<lb/>
million, they would only have about seven<lb/>
or eight million. i consider that a pro<lb break="no"/>per system of colonization so as to secure<lb/>
an increased population, is the most im<lb break="no"/>portant subject that can occupy the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of any Government. Without an in<lb break="no"/>crease of population, we cannot have an<lb/>
increase of labour, or an increase of<lb/>
wealth, for its is labor which makes wealth.<lb/>
There are no inducements presented to<lb/>
induce emigrants to come to this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince and settle. The Crown Lands are,<lb/>
as it were, blocked up ; the small capital<lb/>
which the poor man has, is wrung from<lb/>
him in the purchase of lands on which no<lb/>
roads are made. The late Government<lb/>
made no attempts to improve the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of the country, but I did hope the<lb/>
present Government would have made it<lb/>
one of the principle features of their ad<lb break="no"/>ministration. This is no sudden idea of<lb/>
mine, for I have announced it to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Westmorland, and it has met their<lb/>
approbation. Then there is a total ab<lb break="no"/>sence of a spirit of economy ; true, there<lb/>
is the suggestion to dispense with the Post<lb/>
Office Department, but I do not consider<lb/>
that by so doing we put a knife to that<lb/>
establishment. Why sustain the institu<lb break="no"/>tion ? There is now about ?6000
defi<lb break="no"/>ciency in that Department, and there ap<lb break="no"/>pears no intention on the part of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to abolish it, but merely that they<lb/>
would not require the Postmaster General<lb/>
to be an officer of the Crown. That is<lb/>
very well so far as it goes, and I think it<lb/>
meets with the approbation of the people<lb/>
of Westmorland, but why not abolish the<lb/>
office altogether ? Mr. Howe could do<lb/>
the duties of the office at his present sal<lb break="no"/>ary. If the Government intend to abolish<lb/>
the office, why keep nine members in the<lb/>
Executive ? Why not lessen the numeri<lb break="no"/>cal strength of the Government? I think<lb/>
it would be advisable and prudent to do<lb/>
so. The second paragraph of the Speech<lb/>
will, no doubt, meet with the approbation<lb/>
of the House, and be responded to through<lb break="no"/>out the country. In the third paragraph<lb/>
it is mentioned that a diabolical murder<lb/>
has been committed, and which we all<lb/>
look upon with feelings of disapprobation.<lb/>
The late President of the United States<lb/>
was not only an honest man, but a wise<lb/>
one, and I think his death will be deplor<lb break="no"/>ed throughout the civilized world ; so far<lb/>
the Government has expressed the honest<lb/>
feelings of the country. In the United<lb/>
States they were about coming to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion of a war, and it illustrated a pro<lb break="no"/>blem, which is, that a war can be sustain<lb break="no"/>ed and carried out, on a gigantic scale,<lb/>
without a previous standing army. I<lb/>
think the great powers of Europe will<lb/>
profit by their example, and learn that it<lb/>
is not necessary in times of peace to keep<lb/>
            </p>

            <milestone type="unknown"/> 

            <p>a great standing army for the purpose of<lb/>
carrying on war on a large scale. It has<lb/>
also been proved that war can be carried<lb/>
on without making a levy upon private in<lb break="no"/>dividuals, without ransacking and rob<lb break="no"/>bing churches, as was done in old times<lb/>
in Europe. It is carried on by the pro<lb break="no"/>mises of the nation ; this lesson should be<lb/>
valuable to other powers throughout the<lb/>
world. This Province requires that its<lb/>
resources should be developed by public<lb/>
works. This Province is interested in the<lb/>
welfare of St. John, it being its chief com<lb break="no"/>mercial emporium. When the trade of<lb/>
St. John is either prosperous or depressed,<lb/>
there is a corresponding degree of pros<lb break="no"/>perity of depression felt throughout the<lb/>
whole Province. We find a railroad from<lb/>
St. Andrews tapping the upper waters of<lb/>
the St. John, and gradually taking away<lb/>
the trade of that country from St. John,<lb/>
and carrying it into the United States.<lb break="no"/>Nova Scotia also having a road from
Hali<lb break="no"/>fax to Pictou, the trade of that part of <lb/>
Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy is ta<lb break="no"/>ken to Halifax. Thus the trade of St. <lb/>
John must become depressed, unless we <lb/>
do something to connect it with Nova <lb/>
Scotia und the United States. I cannot <lb/>
see why the Government cannot
take im<lb break="no"/>mediate action in regard to the
connection <lb/>
with the United States and Nova
Scotia. <lb/>
I expected this connection 
between <lb/>
Moncton and the Nova Scotia line would <lb/>
be prosecuted immediately, and
also im<lb break="no"/>mediate steps taken to connect St. John <lb/>
with the West. I want, and hope to re<lb break="no"/>ceive information from the hon. mover of <lb/>
this Address, what law there is to prevent <lb/>
the immediate undertaking of this work. <lb/>
There was an Act passed by the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, the fourth section of which is
the
<lb/>
only section I can find in which the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is pledged in any form.
lt says: <lb/>
" lf any company or body corporate, now <lb/>
possessing sufficient capital, shall offer to <lb/>
construct the first mentioned line of rail<lb break="no"/>way, and shall give such
assurance
of <lb/>
their ability, &amp;c." Now, I want to know <lb/>if any company having sufficient capital,<lb/>
have offered to construct Western Exten<lb break="no"/>sion ? I know of no such offer, and I<lb/>
know of no company that have offered to<lb/>
construct the line between Moncton and<lb/>
the Nova Scotia line. There is no reason<lb/>
why that gap in the line should not be<lb/>
filled up, as Nova Scotia intends to<lb/>

I rue there may be companies formed in<lb/>
St. John ; it may be that they have raised<lb/>
