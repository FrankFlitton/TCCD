               One very singular feature in this scheme 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> that every colony had got the

               in Upper Canada the politicians had made

               so good a bargain, that they could uﬂ'orrl 
               <br />
               to build several lntercoloninl Railroads

               have got the best ol' the arrangement and 
               <br />
               no party the worst. I cannot understand. 
               <br />
               lt might be considered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smart</span> to get the 
               <br />
               be=t of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bargain,</span> but if it were done 
               <br />
               knowingly. it could hsdl <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beninaidsred</span>

               One great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument,</span> and one which was 
               <br />
               used to good eﬁ'oot, was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railroad.</span> 
               <br />
               Now. I am free to admit. that the chances 
               <br />
               were that the rr ad wool-l have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> built
