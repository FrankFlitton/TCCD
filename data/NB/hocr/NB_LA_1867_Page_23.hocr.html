               my hon. friend should imagine that I

               <br />
               say is intended as un attack upon him. 
               <br />
               He has such an exalted idea of his own 
               <br />
               importance. and of what is due to him 
               <br />
               for his vast <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> attainments, that 
               <br />
               he seems to ‘imagine there is no one

               <br />
