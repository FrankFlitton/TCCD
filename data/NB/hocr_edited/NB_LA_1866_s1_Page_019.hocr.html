that they had all felt then that he should<br />
have it. But Mr. Wilmot had retired<br />
from the Government without the office. <br />
If it had been necessary to fill up the<br />
office immediately, the Government<br />
could have done it. But if the Govern-<br />
ment could show that the duties of the<br />
office had been conducted as efficiently,<br />
without an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Auditor</span> General. as
before,<br />
he believed the country, who did not <br />
care so much who ﬁlled the office as<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">how its duties were performed. Instead</span><br />
of four clerks being employed, as when<br />
the late Mr. Partelow (who, as they all<br />
knew, for several years, had not been<br />
able to attend to the office) was Au-<br />
ditor General, there have been only <br />
two. For years before the death of that<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman, Mr. Johnston, the chief<br />
clerk, had done all the duties of the<br />
office. He wished to do justice to Mr.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
Johnston, who had been most assiduous<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to his duty and had proved himself a</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faithful and efficient officer. He
chal-<br />

point out one single case where the<br />
interest of the country had suffered by<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the non-appointment of an Auditor Ge-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neral. It was all very well to quote<br />
despatches, but let him point to one fact.<br />
Would the non-appointment of an Audi-<br />

House to condemn the Government?<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Attorney Genernl proceeded to <br />
th charge against the Government,<br />
that they had not appointed a Solicitor<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General, and challenged the mover of<br />
the Amendment to show where the.<br />
public interests had suffered in conse- <br />
quence. During the absence of the <br />
then Attorney General (Mr. Allen) (and <br />
here he would remark that no appoint-<br />
ment had given more entire satisfaction<br />
than that of Judge Allen) provision<br />
was made for the conducting of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Criminal</span> and Crown business of

legal gentlemen to whom it was en-<br />

in the Province—he did not ask, and he <br />
did not expect their sympathy, when he<br />
made the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-US">—</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">had so many
diffi-<br />
culties and embarrassments of all kinds<br />
to contend against as the present Go-<br />
vernment had at its first formation. It<br />
was said that they had proscribed every<br />
one who was not an Anti-Confederate. <br />
But was it not absolutely necessary that<br />
it should be formed on an Anti-Confe- <br />

man who had taken a bold stand on the<br />
question that agitated the country, who<br />
resisted the Quebec Scheme that aimed<br />

it was absolutely necessary to form the<br />
Government on that basis? Then a cry <br />
was raised against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Government <br />
when they did not <span class="unclear" title="“letter" unclear”="">?</span>ill
up their numbers,<br />
when they did not appoint a Solicitor <br />

time of the formation of the Govern-<br />

was entitled to more representation and<br />
the office would have been filled by a<br />
representative of that district but for the<br />
basis on which the Government was<br />
formed. That was the fact, and all he<br />
could tell the House, and he thought<br />
the explanation sufficient, particularly<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">There was another thing. It was<br />
stated the Government were guilty of<br />
betraying the public trust and stealing<br />
the public property. When they heard<br />
the first account of the business, hon.<br />
members might have thought that it<br />
was a thousand times worse than the<br />
first great land stealing transaction.<br />
It had gone into the back settlements <br />
that the Government had been plunder-<br />
ing the country ; that they had entered<br />
into a conspiracy with Mr. Gibson to<br />
rob the land. A more diabolical at-<br />
tempt to injure a Government had never<br />
taken place. The mover of the Amend-<br />
ment knew well that the vilest injustice<br />
had been done to the Government by<br />
the accusations preferred against them.<br />
He knew the truth of the matter. What<br />
the Government had done was simply<br />
to carry out the intention of the late<br />
Government. When they came into<br />
power they found that an order of sur-<br />
vey had been made for which survey<br />
Mr. Gibson had paid $500 for a certain<br />
tract of land. It was said that Gibson<br />
got the Government to repeal the law<br />
in his favor, but the sale of the land<br />
was open and notorious. It was pub-<br />
lished in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Royal Gazette</span>,
and it was<br />
competent for every man who pleased<br />
to come in and compete. The hon.<br />
member of York knew all the truth<br />
about the transaction.<br />

ving access to the Crown Land Office,<br />
and he must have known when he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
heard the Government charged with <br />
collusion and fraud with Gibson, that<br />
they were charged falsely. Even if no<br />
repeal of the regulation had been made<br />
everybody must have seen in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Royal</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gazette</span> the advertisement of
the sale of<br />
the land in 100 acre lots, and that was<br />
as public a notice as could be made.<br />
Was it necessary to make repeal ? He<br />
wanted to show that the order, of<br />
which so much had been said, "that<br />
pending negociations for the construc-<br />
tion of the Inter-Colonial Railway, none<br />
of the Crown Lands of the Province<br />
shall be sold except with the condition<br />
of actual settlement attached," had re-<br />
pealed itself. Did not every one know<br />
that the law regarding the Inter-Colo-<br />
nial Railway had censed to be on the<br />
Statute Book—that it was the same as<br />
if it had never existed ? Did not every<br />
</span></p>
<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">one know that it had repealed itself and<br />fallen dead? The condition that ren-<br />dered the regulation necessary had<br />ceased to exist. The transaction was<br />open and above board. The sale of<br />lands was published in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Gazette,</span> and<br />every man must have known that it<br />
was the intention to sell these lands<br />publicly. He would ask the House<br />then if it was true that the Government<br />had given Gibson lands secretly—if he<br />had given him land without compe-<br />tition ? <br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. CONNELL. Did not Mr. Gib-<br />
son hold a three years' license of these<br />
very lands?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. So much<br />
the worse for the late Government.<br />You that supported the late Government<br />would wish to fasten their sins on us.<br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILBERT. How many acres<br />were sold to Mr. Gibson?<br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. Fifteen<br />
thousand in all. It it was necessary to<br />argue this question, he would say while<br />he would give every facility to the man<br />who desired to settle in the country,<br />they ought to look at the other side,<br />and consider that Mr. Gibson had<br />mills that cut twelve millions annually.<br />The whole country was interested in<br />that manufacture. Let them not look<br />at this question with hasty prejudice,<br />but let calm reason work, and let them<br />foster and cherish the manufacturing<br />interests of the country. He would<br />ask if the people of the Nashwaak were<br />not greatly interested in Mr. Gibson's<br />operations? He had besides been told<br />that the land was worthless for settle-<br />ment and not much worth for lumber-<br />in purposes, unless large sums are<br />spent to open up streams. Mr. Gibson<br />was a man that ought to be encouraged.<br />
He was informed his operations extend-<br />ed to Careleton and Victoria. The<br />
inhabitants of Carleton derived great<br />
benefit from those operations.<br />
