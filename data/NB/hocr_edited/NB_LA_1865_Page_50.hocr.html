<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This
memorandum was signed by Messrs.<br />
</span>McDonald, Howe and Tilley. That was<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a distinct proposition for free trade
made<br />
</span>by Canada, and declined by those gentle-<br />
men because it was thought unfair for the<br />
infant manufactures of these Provinces<br />
to enter into competition with the more<br />
advanced manufactures of Canada. What<br />
extraordinary change has taken place in<br />
the minds of these men that induces them<br />
now to think that we are to become rich<br />
by this free trade which was declined in<br />
1862. I did think this delegation which<br />
we propose sending to England could have<br />
been avoided, for these delegations should<br />
not exist except public interest require<br />
them ; but judging from what we see<br />
around us, I think this delegation is re-<br />
quired, for after the Scheme had been<br />
rejected by the people of this Province by<br />
an overwhelming majority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">— in Prince Ed-<br />
ward Island almost unanimously </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—

leading statesmen of Nova Scotia, afraid<br />
to submit it to the Legislature</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—referred<br />

her<br />
Legislature a memorial or petition to the<br />
Queen, asking the Queen and the British<br />
Parliament to take steps to confirm this<br />
Scheme. They have also sent a delega-<br />
tion to England for the same object, and<br />
these gentlemen are misrepresenting the-<br />
state of affairs in this Province. I think<br />
that statesmen of Canada have not treated<br />
us well, in sending a delegation to Eng-<br />
land to impress upon the Colonial Secre-<br />
tary the desirability of his using some<br />
measures to force us into this Union after<br />
we have rejected it. I do not think the<br />
Government of England will attempt any<br />
means of coercion ; if it does it will pro-<br />
duce a feeling of alienation from that<br />
Government with which we desire to live<br />
in connection as we have done in times<br />
past, as freemen and not as slaves; any at-<br />
tempt to force us into this Union we will<br />
resist even to the death. I regret that a<br />
delegation is necessary, but I am satisfied<br />
that it is our best policy to contradict<br />
those statements which are circulated in<br />
England that a strong reaction has taken<br />
place here favorable to Confederation.<br />
When I hear my hon. friend say that in<br />
six months after the people become en-<br />
lightened they will have a majority in<br />
favor of Confederation, and that we only<br />
represent the rabble and ignorance here;<br />
this has also been stated in the news-<br />
papers. In reply I can say that this<br />
House compares favorably with any House<br />
that has ever assembled here before.<br />
They say the public are not sufficiently<br />
enlightened. Some gentlemen say that<br />
they will spend two years enlightening<br />
the public mind. Do you think there is<br />
nothing but pure patriotism and love of<br />
country in this ? It is an arrogance which<br />
no man ought to assume ; to state that the<br />
people are steeped in ignorance, only one<br />
or two being able to grasp the mighty<br />
Scheme of Confederation, and it is neces-<br />

there are but few on the floors of this<br />

I am one of those who believe it is the duty<br />
of the Government of the day to initiate the<br />
various measures desirable and necessary<br />
for the country, and to bring them before<br />
the Legislature. I believe the Quebec<br />

that in 1862, this despatch was sent by<br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 190 628 325 685"><p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I have duly received Your Lordship's<br />
despatch, No. 47, of the 21st of May, ac-<br />
companied by a copy of a Resolution<br />
which was passed in the House of Assem-<br />
bly on the 15th of April 1861, relative to<br />
an amalgamation of part, or all, of the<br />
British Provinces in North America. The<br />
resolution points out that the question<br />
might be considered either of a distinct<br />
Union of the Maritime Provinces, or of a<br />
general Union of them with Canada ; and<br />
suggests that it might be desirable, upon<br />
so important a subject, to ascertain the<br />
policy of her Majesty's Government, and<br />
so promote a consultation between the<br />
leading men of the Colonies.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Your Lordship explains that, for vari-<br />
ous reasons, your Government were of<br />
opinion that it would inexpedient to<br />
act on this resolution last year, but they<br />
now wish it to be brought under conside-<br />
ration.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">No one can be insensible to the impor-<br />
tance of the two measures which are al-<br />
luded to : and I am far from considering<br />
that they do not form a very proper sub-<br />
ject for calm deliberation. They are,<br />
however, of a nature which renders it es-<br />
sentially fit, that if either of them be pro-<br />
posed for adoption, it should emanate in<br />
the first instance from the Provinces, and<br />
should be concurred in by all of them<br />
which it would affect. I should see no<br />
objection to any consultation on the sub-<br />
ject amongst the leading members of the<br />
Governments concerned ; but whatever<br />
the result of such consultation might be,<br />
the most satisfactory mode of testing the<br />
opinion of the people of British North<br />
America, would probably be by means of<br />
resolution or address, proposed in the Le-<br />
gislature of each Province by its own<br />
Government. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Beyond this expression of the views<br />

preliminary steps which might be taken<br />

contained in a resolution of so general<br />

either partial or complete, should here-<br />
