he con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demned the</span> Government for was
that they <br />
did not clothe that answer to the commu- <br />

considered it also highly indecorous and <br />
unp<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recedented</span> that, in a grave
dispatch <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference</span> should have been made
to a<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />would now speak on Confederation.<br />
He would much like to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> where the <br />
Government were. He should soon <br />
know, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> for he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">written</span> to a gentleman <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> Canada who knew pretty much all that <br />
was going on ; he should know before <br />
this debate closed what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> doing. This Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <br />
formed on an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anti-Confederate</span> basis—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
but where <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were they</span>
now ? We ﬁnd that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there was </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />put in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speech</span> a paragraph <br />about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> and that involved a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure of Union </span>to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> <br />
them. A year ago, they argued that the <br />
country would be ruined by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span>
ready to submit some <br />
scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves.</span> When <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />was ﬁrst mentioned in the Province, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span>
that opposition to it was a capital<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">piece</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span>
clap <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trap</span> to hoist them- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selves</span> into office. But where
were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <br />
now ? The Speech <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> that the
Govern- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment</span> were going to put forth a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> He would
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like</span> to <br />
know some. of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreshadowings</span>
of that <br />
measure. He would like to know at what <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hour,</span> what time or the day, in
what parti- <br />
cular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place,</span> they changed their
minds, in <br />
order that they might hold on to office ? <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But he</span> could tell them they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> <br />
allowed to hold on to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span>
much longer. <br />
