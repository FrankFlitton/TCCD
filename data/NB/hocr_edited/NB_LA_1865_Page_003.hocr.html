been carried, and under these circum-<br />

a want of courtesy to those members who<br />

had been called away. He hoped this<br />
explanation would be satisfactory.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. Mr.
Hatheway said these reso-<br />
lutions and the lengthy talk upon them<br />
with regard to the Debates was the annu-<br />
al offering of the House. He thought<br />
when the resolution passed to make the<br />
apportionment by population, as unjust to<br />
those portions of the country which did<br />
not possess the advantages of newspaper<br />
reports. Carleton should not be placed<br />
in a better position than Restigouche or<br />
Gloucester. The people in those Coun-<br />
ties possessed little information and there-<br />
fore the distribution should be as here-<br />
tofore.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. CAIE
said there were always two<br />
ways of looking at the same thing. The<br />
County he had the honor to represent had<br />
about the same population as Northum-<br />
berland. The demand for copies of the<br />
Debates was as large as in that County,<br />
but whereas they had four members in<br />
the House, Kent had but two, and by giv-<br />
ing the Debates to the members as had<br />
been done in times past, they would get<br />
just double the number of copies. He<br />
was therefore in favor of distribution by<br />
population.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. SUTTON
said that although he re-<br />
marks of the hon. member for Kent were<br />
correct, yet as the people he represented<br />
were mostly French, they would no re-<br />
quire as large a number as Northumber-<br />
land.</span></p>

read and explain them to others.</span></p>

of the resolution would tend to lessen the<br />
