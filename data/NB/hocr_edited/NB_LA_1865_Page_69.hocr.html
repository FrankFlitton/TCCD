<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Certain</span> exceptions as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education</span> are <br />
provided for in Canada, the ministers <br />
there are provided for in the arrangement. <br />
Why not provide for Catholic or Protes- <br />
tant ministers in other Colonies. if neces- <br />
sary in Canada ? Why not in New Bruns- <br />
wick, Nova Scotia, and all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span>
Provin- <br />
ces ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The Delegates</span> look with
favor upon <br />
this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme ;</span> but so far as the
people have <br />
had a chance to speak out it has been con- <br />
demned. The British Government, I re- <br />
gret to say, favors it, and as much as I <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> our connection with the
Mother <br />
Country and prize the relation, I do not <br />
choose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decide</span>
our desti- <br />
nies in this matter ; and it is because that <br />
I think matters have been wrongly repre- <br />
sented, that I think it important a Dele- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span>
home. There is no rea- <br />
son why this Union should be entered into, <br />
but there are strong reasons why it should <br />
not ; the time may come when a Federal <br />
Union will be necessary. The hon<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>
<br />
member for Carleton says, if we had this <br />
and if we had that we should be a won- <br />
derful people. If that gentleman's aunt<br />
had been a man, she would have been his<br />
uncle. The Hon. President of the Coun-<br />
cil, in reply to some hon. member, said he<br />
could not understand him, unless upon<br />
the principle that the more a man owed<br />
the less it required to pay his debts.<br />
That is really the case when men are not<br />
satisfied with living and doing business<br />
within their means ; they usually become<br />
involved in difficulties, and, in many cases,<br />
pay twenty shillings with five. There are<br />
certain principles which govern the<br />
growth of nations as well as individuals,<br />
which cannot be changed without great<br />
injury. We had better not try to put on<br />
false appearances, or pretend to be what<br />
we are not. If my hon. friend from<br />
Carleton was to sit for his photograph<br />
and try to look like the Duke of Wel-<br />
lington—for the Duke was every inch a<br />
soldier—he would try in vain to look like<br />
him ; he also had a frank and honest<br />
countenance, and in that the failure would<br />
be as great. I would not have spoken on<br />
these resolutions at all, but the time would<br />
have been occupied by others. Really,<br />
no good can arise on this discussion. The<br />
Confederates have failed before the peo-<br />
ple to make out a case, and I think have<br />
as signally failed here.<br />

only 17 hours from Moncton, a mnch<br />
shorter time than cattle on some of the <br />
long roads in the States are conﬁned. <br />
The cattle cars are well ventilated, and<br />
much more comfortable than the ordin-<br />
ary barns in which cattle are kept. If<br />
the cattle are crowded into the cars they<br />
may suffer, but this would be equally the<br />
case with any arrangement, and is the<br />
fault of the owners themselves. The<br />
sheep, calves, and pigs are carried in<br />
cars, the sides of which are formed of<br />
iron or wooden gratings, so that they are<br />
quite cool. They are not in nearly so<br />
bad a position as cattle, sheep, &amp;c.,<br />
brought across the bay in schooners.<br />
Moncton is the most distant station from<br />
which cattle are brought. They are put<br />
on board say at 4 30 P. M. and arrive in<br />
St. John at 9 30 the next morning, so<br />
that they are carried during the coolest<br />
parts of the day. For the shorter dis-<br />

objectionable.</span></p>
