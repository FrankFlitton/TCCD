<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could
attend to their local business with-</span><br />
out their being at so much expense. He<br />
could not see how members of this House<br />
could be so shame-faced as to attempt<br />
to do any thing of that kind. Some of<br />
them would never have had a chance to<br />
come to this House if they had not been<br />
anti Confederate, and why then should<br />
they turn traitors to the trust reposed in<br />
them ; in his opinion, it would be wrong<br />
and unjustifiable to do so. We have<br />
been here eighty years and the country<br />
has improved. We have got along very<br />
well, and all we ask is to be let alone.<br />
He believed that an affectionate feeling<br />
for the Mother Country was true Con-<br />
federation. It is said here, that they<br />
should enter into Confederation as a <br />
means of defence, but he considered<br />
that the money required for keeping up<br />
this great Parliament would be a means<br />
of defence in itself. It has been said<br />
that under Confederation, if an attack<br />
was made we could send our troops<br />
from one point to another. We can do<br />
that now. Did we not pass a resolution<br />
for putting all the available resources<br />
of the country in the hands of the Go-<br />
vernment, and could we not pass a re-<br />
solution to move all our available forces<br />
in or out of the Province, if we con-<br />
sidered it best to fight upon a foreign<br />
land. He was satisfied to see the Gover-<br />
nor appointed by the Crown. If he was<br />
appointed by the Government of Cana-<br />
da, in a short time there would not be a <br />
drop of loyalty left. If had been said<br />
that the Government had left things un-<br />
done, they had allowed a law to expire<br />
without being aware of it. This House, <br />
in former times, would have taken care<br />
of that, because a Committee of the<br />
House used to be appointed to see if<br />
any Bills were going to expire ; there-<br />
fore, the onus is as much on us as it is <br />
on them. A Bill has been passed to re-<br />
medy the omission, which was caused<br />
by the difficulties the present Govern-<br />
ment had to contend with, and the short<br />
time which they had for entering into<br />
details, as they ought to have done it<br />
they had more time. The result of the <br />
charges made against them is, that they<br />
have stopped things from being done that<br />
other parties wanted done. In regard to <br />
the appointment of Judges, he did not<br />
think they could have made better ap-<br />
pointments. The Chief Justice is a pious<br />
and just man, and man of high legal<br />
knowledge ; he has stood high as a man,<br />
and that is saying everything that is re-<br />
quired. He could not see that it was<br />
unfair to appoint Judge Ritchie to the<br />
office of Chief Justice. He had a high<br />
respect for Judge Wilmot, who was a <br />
man of great legal knowledge, but then<br />
if a person has a political bias, and the<br />
hon. gentlemen of the Opposition had the<br />
power of the Government, they would not<br />
appoint him. It was not human nature<br />
to do so, and it was not his nature. He<br />
then referred to Judge Weldon, whom he<br />
said was the oldest barrister in the Pro-<br />
vince, with the exception of Mr. Saunders,<br />
and they did not overstep the eldest per-<br />
son and put in a younger. He was a man<br />
of their own political opinion, and they<br />
should appoint him to office as well as<br />
any one else.</p>







<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">For the purpose of keeping up loyalty,<br />
a small colony was better than a great<br />
one, because they would have a British<br />
Governor, who would be a tie between<br />
them and the mother country. But in a<br />
large colony, if everything does not please<br />
them, they will say we are not going to</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> submit to this, and they do not feel that<br />
loyalty that a smaller colony does. This<br />
confederation scheme cannot benefit our<br />
trade. We have not a single article we<br />
can send to Canada. The fishermen in<br />
Charlotte County say they can send their<br />
fish there, but they have far more fish-<br />
eries on the Canadian shore than we have<br />
in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. We<br />
cannot take deals and boards there, we<br />
have no manufactures to send there, for<br />
we cannot manufacture our own bread.<br />
We cannot compete with them, they can<br />
get bread cheap, and can get labor for<br />
almost nothing. They say we have more <br />
coal here then they have in Canada, but<br />
coal is much cheaper there than it is here.<br />
We would <span class="unclear" title="“smudge" blocking="" text”="">?</span>on have all our offices
filled<br />
with the employees of the Canadian<br />
Government, while we would have to pay<br />
three times the taxes in proportion to our<br />
numbers for the French scarcely con-<br />
sume any dutiable articles, the very sugar<br />
they use they produce from the maple.<br />
Then, as regards the prosperty of some<br />
parts of Canada ; the people are going<br />
from the town of Hamilton by shiploads,<br />
you can get a house there by paying the<br />
taxes. If they had the control of us,<br />
they would tax us until we could not stand<br />
it. It would not be like a bad law passed<br />
this year and repealed the next, but we<br />
would be fixed there where we could not<br />
hope to get a reprieve. We would be<br />
worse than the slaves, for they have a <br />
hope of getting something done for them,<br />
while we would have none. If they could<br />
enter into some fair principle of union,<br />
such as was entered into between Eng-<br />
land, Scotland and Ireland, which was<br />
not the question of the day or a year, but<br />
here we had a scheme brought forward<br />
of which we knew nothing, and we were<br />
expected to pass it at once. He con-<br />
demned the act but not the persons who<br />
made it, and he though they could have<br />
free trade with the other colonies if they<br />
wished it without going into confedera-<br />
tion. This Quebec Scheme was framed<br />
upon the spu<span class="unclear" title="“blurred" letter”="">?</span> of the moment, and they only<br />
had a few days to consider it. It was not<br />
like the union between Ireland and<br />
England, for Ireland was an integral part<br />
of the kingdom, and if we could have any<br />
thing approximating to a like union, it<br />
would be to have at some future time one<br />
or two members to go home as our re-<br />
presentatives in the British Parliament ; <br />
in former times we could not have this,<br />
but now we could go over there in ten<br />
days, being one-quarter of the time it<br />
used to take the members to come from<br />
the nroth of Scotland by land. He would<br />
strongly suggest the propriety of every<br />
colony having a representative in the <br />
British Parliament. He did not think<br />
representation by population was alto-<br />
gether fair. A County with varied in-<br />
terests required a larger representation.<br />
The city of St. John of the County of<br />
Charlotte required a larger representation<br />
than the interior Counties. The question<br />
now was, whether they should remove the<br />
Government or let them live a little<br />
longer. His opinion was they had better<br />
let them live a little longer. (A member<br />
—How long do you go for.) That would<br />
depend upon their behavior, but he<br />
thought they should not condemn them<br />
so soon. We should give them an op-<br />
portunity to forsake their sins of commis-<br />
sion and omission, and allow them to go<br />
on and show that their conduct in the<br />
future will be such as will gratify the<br />
persons who now oppose them. We<br />
ought to have faith, hope and charity.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He had faith to believe they would do<br />
better. Where is the Government that<br />
has not been overhauled, more partocu-<br />
larly since the establishment of responsi-<br />
ble and departmental Government. He<br />
had made up his mind to go for the<br />
address as it stood. Let the Government<br />
live and breathe, and see wherein they<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER said he would make a <br />
few remarks, but had made no arrange-<br />
ments, and was not going to reply to any <br />
member. Certain charges had been made<br />
against the Government, but he believed<br />
those charges were mere sham. The<br />
real question was Confederation. Of this<br />
there could be no doubt. Why, then, did<br />
they not move the amendment on a para-<br />
graph that would test it. If they were<br />
going to agitate the country, let them<br />
do it in a fair, open, manly, straightfor-<br />
ward way, and not try it upon the question<br />
of Fenianism, or any other ism. He would<br />
ask the hon. mover of the amendment, if<br />
he did not believe, when he struck out<br />
that part which he feared would offend<br />
the United States, that he could not get<br />
the votes upon it. (Mr. Fisher,—I made<br />
it one of the grounds of my complaint<br />
against the Government.) He should not<br />
have struck it out. He could quote author-<br />
ity from the Speaker of the House of Com-<br />
mons. (Mr. Fisher,—That was a different<br />
case. In this I was not obliged to give
notice <br />
at all.) Very well, he would not say any<br />
thing more in reference to that. He did <br />
not wish to make any personal attack.<br />
His hon. friend and him agreed as well <br />
as any men in the country, but in matters<br />
of a political nature he had a right to<br />
take his side ; and his hon. friend could<br />
take his. He did not intend to make an<br />
attack upon him. He would merely ad-<br />
vance some arguments which could go for<br />
what they were worth. He charged the<br />
Opposition with intending to get up a reli-<br />
gious discussion in the House, by attack-<br />
ing the Government. Why did not they<br />
attack them on the clause relating to<br />
Confederation?</p>




<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER.—I thought this was<br />
the most assailable point. I was not dis-<br />
posed to raise a question on Confedera-<br />
tion. A vote of want of confidence was<br />
outside of that question.</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER.—Why did you with-<br />
draw the latter part of the amendment?</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER.—I withdrew it for the <br />
reason I stated at the time. I said I in-<br />
tended to make that part of my charge<br />
against them, and I did so.</p>


















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER said his hon. friend and<br />
the House had assisted the Government<br />
in defending the country. If the Govern-<br />
ment come in and do not satisfy us that <br />
they have defended the country, it will be<br />
our duty to vote against them. We are<br />
put down as traitors. He never was oppos-<br />
ed to the abstract principle of a union of<br />
the Colonies. He had taken the first sec-<br />
tion of the scheme, and said he would go<br />
for that, and that was the only section in<br />
the scheme that was carried unanimous-<br />
ly. One of the charges brought against<br />
the Government is, that dispatched were<br />
withheld. He would tell them that a<br />
system had been pursued of publishing<br />
those dispatches in the neighboring colo-<br />
nies, before the English mail arrived<br />
here. He thought the people of New<br />
