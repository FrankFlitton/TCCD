There were ?<br />
and <span class="unclear" title="Word is illegible">?</span>
men in the Temperance Hall to<br />
listen to Mr. Fisher's speech. Surround-<br />
ed as he was by a packed audience, for<br />
very few of Mr. Pickard's friends were<br />
present, he was very bold and very loyal<br />
if his own assertions are proof of either.<br />
I could not have believed that Mr. Fisher<br />
would have indulged in so much self-<br />
glorification, and personal abuse of others.<br />
John Pickard, he said, was a good fellow,<br />
and had always supports him until the<br />
last election, and he (Mr. Fisher) was<br />
sorry he had got into such bad company<br />
now. (Mr. Pickard is a young man, but<br />
rather too old to be caught by the hollow-<br />
hearted compliments of Charles Fisher.)<br />
He would still continue to be a good<br />
fellow, in Mr. Fisher's opinion, was he to<br />
spend his money for him, and adopt all<br />
his opinions. but Mr. Pickard is a man<br />
who thinks for himself, and is known,<br />
both by his opponents and supporters, to<br />
be an honorable man ; and Mr. Pickard<br />
knows, also, that these professional poli-<br />
ticians are dangerous men, seeking, gen-<br />
erally, to elevate themselves at the ex-<br />
pense of the public, and in too many<br />
instances, at the sacrifice of truth and<br />
honor. Mr. Fisher stated that he had<br />
been urged by requisitions from all parts<br />
of the country to come forward at this<br />
election<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>the people stating, in
their let-<br />
ters, that they had been deceived at the<br />
last election, and that they now wanted a<br />
chance to reverse what they had done;<br />
and they had now shown most nobly that<br />
they were in favor of British institutions <br />
and of a great British North American<br />
nationality. He repeatedly stated that<br />
this election was tested upon the question<br />
of Confederation. That, and that alone,<br />
was the issue. (If there were any anti-<br />
Confederates present, who had voted for<br />
him, they must have felt exceedingly an-<br />
noyed for having been thus shamefully<br />
deceived, and must have most heartily<br />
despised the man who could practice such<br />
deception, and it will no doubt be remem-<br />
bered by many, should he again appear<br />
before them.) He read from the Freeman<br />
what he called Anglin the Dictator's<br />
challenge to the noblemen at York, which<br />
they had accepted, and the result would<br />
speak for itself. He had beaten them by<br />
a majority of seven hundred (meaning the<br />
Catholics) many of the best of whom, he<br />
said, had voted for him. He accepted<br />
the challenge much as a coward would,<br />
who, sheltering himself behind some for-<br />
tification, would shoot his adversary, and<br />
then come forth to boast of his pluck and<br />
manliness. He repeatedly called Anglin<br />
a traitor, said over and over again that<br />
there was not a drop of British blood in<br />
his veins, and, as an offset, said that the<br />
blood which coursed through his veins had<br />
descended from the true old Loyalists.<br />
These sentiments, which were several<br />
times repeated, invariably called forth<br />
hearty cheers. He was very sever on<br />
the Government; said they got into<br />
power by practising lies and deception,<br />
but that the voice from York had sounded<br />
their speedy downfall. (it occurred to<br />
me that he knew full well that when the<br />
members of the present Government were<br />
elected, Mr. Tilley and his colleague<br />
were then in power, they appealed to the<br />
people<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>the dear people in whom Mr.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fisher
has such an abiding confidence</span><br />
and the electors throughout the Province<br />
returned the men who compose the pre-<br />
sent Government to represent them. He<br />
(Mr. Fisher) several times said that An-<br />
glin the traitor was the leading genius of<br />
the Government; that he held them in<br />
the hollow of his hand, and could rule<br />
them as he pleased. but he was most<br />
surprised that men like R. D Wilmot<br />
and W. H. Odell could be influenced to<br />
sign a document, so full of disloyalty to<br />
the Queen and British Government, as<br />
that Memorandum of Council signed by<br />
seven of the Council and sent to Mr.<br />
Cardwell. It had been written by Anglin,<br />
the traitor, over night, and signed by the<br />
rest after dinner. These declarations<br />
seemed to please the most part of the au-<br />
dience very much. It could hardly have<br />
occurred to them that Mr. Fisher could<br />
not possibly know who wrote it, or when<br />
it was signed. Had they thought of this,<br />
they would have agreed with me that he<br />
was a most unscrupulous man for making<br />
such a declaration.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">He talked a great deal of nonsense<br />
about Fleming's Report, and the Inter-<br />
Colonial Road, which was soon to traverse<br />
the whole length of the County of York<br />
and the Province. It occurred to me,<br />
while listening to him, that it would be<br />
rather unfortunate for some politicians<br />
should that Road be built, as it could not<br />
be so conveniently used for different<br />
local canvasses as it could now. The re-<br />
port is remarkable for accommodating<br />
a great number of politicians, who can<br />
place the Road just where it will secure<br />
the most votes. He strutted with great<br />
dignity upon the platform, and complete-<br />
ly snuffed the audience with his lip loyalty,<br />
all of which was loudly cheered. He<br />
would occasionally give the men of York<br />
credit for some loyalty, but reserved<br />
much the largest share for himself. His <br />
audience did not appear to discover<br />
the emptiness of such an exhibition.<br />
He was very personal in referring to the<br />
Representatives of York, and referred to<br />
some of them in a very insulting manner.<br />
He hinted something in reference to<br />
Judge Allen's going on the bench, which<br />
I could not understand; he said the busi-<br />
ness of York had been neglected by<br />
them, and about the time the House<br />
closed, Allen, Fraser and Hatheway were<br />
engaged in figuring how to sustain a<br />
miserable Government, while Billy Need-<br />
ham was drunk and very boastingly, and<br />
I think foolishly, said that he had more<br />
stake in the country than the three of<br />
them put together, he had not much<br />
money, and could not, therefore, spend<br />
much in elections. And as to their<br />
morality, look at George L. Hatheway<br />
and W. H. Needham. Lord help the<br />
country if they were the standard; men<br />
who had not the least regard for the<br />
scared and holy ties of matrimony, noto-<br />
riously unfaithful to every obligation of<br />
that kind; then he went into a great deal<br />
of twaddle about marriage ties, sacredness<br />
of home, regard for religion and virtue,<br />
and recommended his devoted friends to<br />
go home peaceably and return to their<br />
workshop and their counting-house, and<br />
that at the general election, WHICH<br />
WOULD COME SOON, he with three others,<br />
who he would not name would carry<br />
York with an increased majority.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It was quite apparent in a large part of<br />
his speech that he had endeavored to ex-<br />
cite their prejudices, which every true and<br />
good man should seek to allay. He could,<br />
in conclusion, with truth had said, I</p>
<hr />
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">have endeavored to deceive the people in<br />
reference to the matter of Confederation,<br />
both in my card and my speech on Nomi-<br />
nation Day. I treated that matter so in-<br />
geniously, that in the event of a defeat, I<br />
could have said that Confederation was<br />
not the question, but should I be elected,<br />
I can claim it a great victory for Confede-<br />
ration. I have been informed that the<br />
questions was put to Mr. Fisher by some<br />
anti-Confederate: "Is this to be a test<br />
of Confederation?" and he answered them<br />
IT IS NOT! With that declaration they<br />
voted for him. He could say, I have at-<br />
tempted to make the electors of York be-<br />
lieve that the men in power intended to<br />
remove the Seat of Government, and in<br />
other ways fo great injustice to York<br />
County. I know that I have not the least<br />
foundation for this in truth, but it answer-<br />
ed my purpose for the time being, and I<br />
did it. I know that there has been no<br />
effort made to remove the Seat of Govern-<br />
ment since 1858, when I was a member of<br />
the Government with Smith, Tiller, Wat-<br />
ters, Brown, Johnson and Steves, all of<br />
whom were favorable to the removal.<br />
Knowing this, I remained in the Govern-<br />
ment with them UNTIL THEY PUT ME OUT.<br />
I know also that there are three mem-<br />
bers of the present Government at the<br />
head of three important public depart-<br />
ments, with twenty-four hundred dollars a<br />
years each, that these gentlemen all reside<br />
in York County, having their business,<br />
their property, and their interest there,<br />
and I know full well that the Government<br />
would not under those circumstances, even<br />
if they wished, attempt a removal of the<br />
Seat of Government. YES, I know this<br />
well; but I was untruthful enough to state<br />
to the electors of York that there was<br />
great danger, and that it was necessary<br />
that I should be returned in order to pre-<br />
vent it. I know very well that nearly<br />
every official in the Provincial Offices in<br />
Fredericton are fill by the inhabitants<br />
of York County. I know that they are<br />
all paid from the public Treasury, and<br />
that persons in other parts of the Prov-<br />
ince are just as much entitled to them as<br />
the men of York. Yet I endeavored to<br />
make the people believe that the Govern-<br />
ment was disposed to do injustice to her.<br />
I know that the thirty thousand dollars<br />
appropriated for Militia purposes, was ex-<br />
pended in York, which was a great bene-<br />
fit to the people there. I know that others<br />
had to contribute this money, and that we<br />
got the benefit of its expenditure; yet I<br />
tried to make the people believe that the<br />
Government was hostile to her interests.<br />
I have charged the members of the Gov-<br />
ernment with being tools in the hands of<br />
T. W. Anglin, and that they were all a<br />
disloyal set together, when I knew that<br />
Anglin had no more influence than the<br />
other members, as is shown by the differ-<br />
ence of opinion on Western Extension;<br />
yet it answered my dishonest purpose to<br />
say that they were all dictated to by him.<br />
I said that Anglin wrote the famous Me-<br />
morandum of Council over night, and<br />
that it was signed by six of his colleagues<br />
after dinner, when I knew nothing about<br />
who wrote it. I have said repeatedly<br />
that the Memorandum was full of disloy-<br />
alty to the Queen and British Govern-<br />
ment; yet I did not attempt to point out<br />
the paragraphs that contained disloyal<br />
sentiments. I know that the whole do-<br />
cument is strictly in accordance with<br />
the principles of Responsible Govern-<br />
ment, and claims only the rights which<br />
are due to us under the Constitution.<br />
I know that I opposed Downing Street<br />
