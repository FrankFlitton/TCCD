<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FISHER,</span>
on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resuming,</span> said, he <br />
would refer to the principal points put <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the House yesterday, when
he <br />
said, that the very fact that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legisla-</span>
<br />
ture had no been convened till one <br />
month after the usual time, showed an <br />
utter disregard of the wants and wishes of <br />
the people, and was in itself sufficient to <br />
condemn the Government before the <br />
country. The absence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the
Attorney <br />
General at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington</span> was no
sufficient <br />
excuse. He had referred to the vacilla- <br />
tion of the Government, and their failure <br />
to ﬁll up the public ofﬁces. as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span>
the <br />
ends and spirit of the Constitution ; that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provided</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there should</span> be a certain num- <br />
ber of salaried and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible </span>officers
; <br />
yet, during the time the Government had <br />
held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office, there</span> was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hardly</span> one to be <br />
found in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place—one</span> officer was off to <br />
one place and another to another place. <br />
He had referred <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁlling</span> up the office of Solicitor
General. <br />
The Constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demanded</span> that
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Go-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vernor</span> should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> the advice of hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> to conduct the business
of the <br />
country ; while the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney</span>
General was<br />
off to England and to Washington the <br />
country had been without the advice of a <br />
Crown Ofﬁcer. When he (Mr. F.) was <br />
Attorney General he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">never had</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">left</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">home</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> two days but he found that
letters and <br />
documents had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">flowing</span> in
conti- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nuously</span> demanding <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> attention. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Things</span> <br />
must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">marvellously</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">since</span>
he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was </span>in power, if, with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advancing</span> pro - <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perity</span> of the country, with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advancing</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tide</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">civilization,</span> there was not siill the <br />
same ﬂow of business—the name <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">need</span>
of <br />
the constant advice of the officers of the <br />
Crown. The Government had kept the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span> of Solicitor General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dangling</span> before <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> because they could
not find <br />
one man who was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span> to take
it, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">run</span> the risk of an election. That
fact <br />
showed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> was
sinking, and <br />
since it had come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> power, it
had <br />
sunk lower and lower, till it was difficult <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine</span> it would sink any
lower. And <br />
the salary of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Solicitor</span>
General had <br />
not been saved to the country. He knew <br />
