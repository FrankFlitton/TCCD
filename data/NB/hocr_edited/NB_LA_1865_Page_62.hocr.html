to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discuss this</span> subject. Some

by Mr.</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Howe</span> for a Union of the North

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonies,</span>
I thought it would be a benefit <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us, </span>by raising these
Provinces into a <br />
nationall<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">y.</span> I was glad also when
I heard <br />
that this delegation had proceeded to <br />
Quebec to take into consideration this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">q</span>uestion ; but afterwards on
reflection I <br />
thought there would be found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span>
<br />
wrong in the details of the Scheme, for <br />
those thirty-three men had taken only <br />
seventeen days to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> a
subject of <br />
such vast importance, and those days <br />
were interspersed with feasting. This<br />
was a very short time compared with the<br />
time taken by the United States to frame<br />
their Constitution, they being four months
<br />
in actual session, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore</span> I
considered <br />
there would be some details in the Scheme <br />
that would not bear the light. I was <br />
more confirmed in this view when I read <br />
the resolutions which they had adopted <br />
carefully and considerately, for I found <br />
that New Brunswick would be swamped <br />
in the Legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly,</span> we
being <br />
only allowed the small number of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fifteen</span>
<br />
members, the whole number of members <br />
being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194.</span> But the advocates of
the <br />
Scheme say there is a check to this in- <br />
fluence in the Legislative Council ; but if <br />
you read the l4th Section of these reso- <br />
lutions you will find only the first <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selec-</span>
<br />
tion of Councillors are to be taken from <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>Legislative Councillors of
the Prov- <br />
inces, and any subsequently appointed <br />
may be selected from Canada to represent <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Lower Provinces. The 16th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Section</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says :</span> “ Each of the twenty-four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legisla-</span> <br />
tive Councillors representing Lower Cana- <br />
da in the Legislative Council of the Gen- <br />
eral <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly shall</span> be
appointed to repre- <br />
sent one the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twenty-four</span>
Electoral <br />
Divisions. * * * and shall reside or <br />
possess his qualification in the division he <br />
is appointed to represent." That clause <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span> Lower Canada only. The
Coun- <br />
cillors of every other section of the Union <br />
may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed—after</span> the death
of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councillors</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">residents</span> of <br />
Canada. That is a very serious defect in <br />
the Scheme, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> allows <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councillors</span> to <br />
be selected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">district,</span> and they <br />
may have no interest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in the</span>
Province they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represent.</span> In the United States
their <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Senators</span> are elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span>presen- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tatives,</span> and they are well fitted
to repre- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent</span> their own particular State.
It is <br />
said that the people are not educated on <br />
this subject. In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">County</span>
of King's, <br />
during the late election, every means was <br />
taken to provide information for the <br />
people, and it speaks well for that Coun- <br />
ty, that when I, a new man, who had never <br />
taken any interest in political life, came <br />
before them as a candidate for their suf- <br />
frages, they returned me, giving me nearly <br />
300 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">votes</span> over their favorite
candidate, <br />
who had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represented</span> them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> many years. <br />
This shows the opinion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the people</span>
in <br />
that County on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> To
go <br />
over all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments</span> against
this <br />
Scheme would take more time than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span>
<br />
have at our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposal</span> ; but there
is one item <br />
particularly objectionable, that is the 51st <br />
Section. According to that, any law which<br />
we may pass, if it happen to conflict with<br />
the interest of Canada, can be disallowed<br />
at any time within one year after it has<br />
passed our Legislature. We give up our<br />
dearest right, the right of taxation, over<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.HILL.—I</span>
rise for the purpose of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">replying</span> to some of the remarks
made by <br />
my hon. friend from the County of Albert, <br />
(Mr. McClellan). I do not intend to go <br />
over them all, for at least two-thirds to go<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> speech has been upon matters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entirely</span> <br />
foreign to the subject under consideration. <br />
He has dealt with matters connected with <br />
himself and the President of the Council ; <br />
it will not be expected that I will follow<br />
him upon those points. I will reply now <br />
to one allusion which he made. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span>
ad- <br />
vised the delegates to extend their trip to <br />
Africa. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> think that comparison
will <br />
scarcely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apply,</span> because even
under this <br />
Union these little courts will be held, <br />
having less influence than they now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span>
<br />
His proposed Confederation will be very <br />
much like the case of Austria, which is <br />
burdened down by a heavy debt which has <br />
not been caused by external war, but by <br />
internal dissention. The Empire is com- <br />
posed of Provinces, with different interests <br />
and different languages, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they do</span> not <br />
work harmoniously together. We find <br />Hungary and Italy breaking out into re- <br />
bellion ; we ﬁnd the country loaded down <br />
with debt, simply because they are con- <br />
federated together, with no interests in <br />
common, but alienated one from another. <br />
He (Mr. McClellan) said that the delega- <br />
tion had as much right to confer on a <br />
Union of the Colonies making a total <br />
change in our position as a people, as a <br />
delegation had to go to England to make <br />
arrangements on railway matters. If a <br />
delegation went to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> to
make ar- <br />
rangements on railway matters, it was to <br />
make arrangements for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction of</span>
<br />
a railway, already authorized by the Legis- <br />
lature, and had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> been the
subject of <br />
discussion. It was entirely different from <br />
the delegation going to Quebec to take <br />
into consideration the making of arrange- <br />
ments which were to change our whole <br />
political condition. I have doubts as to <br />
the constitutionality of the course taken <br />
by the late Government and delegates in <br />
this matter. The hon. gentleman says <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we </span>have not a written <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span> and <br />
it is liable to be changed—every Act of <br />
the Legislature being a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change.</span>
This is <br />
true, and it is true of the British Consti- <br />
tution ; but was any Constitution ever <br />
changed by the action of self-appointed <br />
delegates. My hon. friend says this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme</span> was defeated on account of
the <br />
unpopularity of the Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span>
<br />
has only lately been discovered.&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
