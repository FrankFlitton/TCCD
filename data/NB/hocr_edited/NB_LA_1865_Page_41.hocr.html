the Government, and the leading members<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
of the Anti-Confederate party in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference</span>

to the appropriation of money for the Mili-<br />
tia ? They said it would be a waste of mo-<br />
ney so far as defence was concerned, but<br />
they stood in an unfavorable position in<br />
the opinion of the British public, and to<br />
prove their loyalty they voted the peo-<br />
ple's money for this purpose. They are<br />
not satisfied with asserting that two<br />
thirds of the people are against Confed-<br />
eration, but it becomes necessary to ap-<br />
point another delegation to make known<br />
the fact, for they feel they are not in a<br />
right position before the British public.<br />
The hon. member for Victoria (Mr. Cos-<br />
tigan) said that the more the people dis-<br />
cussed this question the more unpopular<br />
it would become. My experience is<br />
right the reverse of this ; the question<br />
came upon them so suddenly, and so<br />
few months elapsed before they were re-<br />
quired to vote at the polls, that they had<br />
not time enough to form a correct opin-<br />
ion upon the subject, and the general<br />
tendency of the people, when they do<br />
not understand a question, is to vote<br />
against any change until they do under-<br />
stand it. If that question was submitted<br />
to the people to-morrow, and the people<br />
were required to deposit their votes in<br />
the ballot box, either for or against it,<br />
two thirds of the people in the Province<br />
of New Brunswick would vote in favor<br />
of it.<br />

NEEDHAM.—The hon ex-Surveyor<br />
General wants to know how this scheme<br />
would ruin us, politically. What would<br />
we have been had Confederation taken<br />
place under this scheme ? Would we<br />
have been a Province? certainly not.<br />
O, it is said we can have a local legisla-<br />
ture ; so we could, and its powers would<br />
be confined to making laws to prevent<br />
cows from running on the commons,<br />
providing that sheep shall wear bells,<br />
and to issue tavern licences. Hon. mem-<br />
bers may talk about their loyalty and dis-<br />
loyalty. I would like to ask some of the<br />
members of the late Government whether<br />
their idea was not this—that they would<br />
not have gone for Confederation if they<br />
had not believed that it was the first step<br />
towards the independence of New Bruns-<br />
wick. (Mr. McMillan—it is not true.)<br />
I have no hesitation in saying that thous-<br />
ands of men believed in Confederation,<br />
honestly and sincerely, but they do not<br />
seem willing to give us any credit for<br />
sincerity ; they think they have all the<br />
argument, all the honesty and all the<br />
loyalty. We have now a direct com-<br />
munication with the Home Government,<br />
as they appoint our Governor ; but if we<br />
go into Confederation our Governor<br />
would be appointed by the Governor<br />
General ; that would raise our dignity<br />
very much, to have a local Governor<br />

after a time they returned, yet nothing <br />
was known as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proceedings</span>. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> <br />
attempt at secrecy roused <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
public feel- <br />

a paper <br />
in Prince Edward <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Island</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">publishing</span> the <br />
whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span> I read it ﬁrst I <br />
was somewhat favourably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impressed</span>
by it, <br />
but as I read on and came to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Section <br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provided</span> that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governor</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointment</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov-</span> <br />
ernors of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> at <br />
once, then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the last</span> link <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> binds us to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">broken.</span> I went on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fur-</span> <br />
ther and found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <br />
to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represented</span> in the General Parlia-<br />
ment by only fifteen members and I then <br />
felt that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">swamped</span> by Upper <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> The fact was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada found</span> her- <br />
self overwhelmed with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debt and wanted</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> to <br />
get the support of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> to re- <br />

and sold for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eighty</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents a head</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />. Our <br />
