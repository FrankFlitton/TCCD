We are now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considering a</span> vote of

a mere dodge.) I say the question of <br />
abstract union is a mere dodge to catch <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">somebody—for</span> it means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span>thing, or <br />
nothing. It is a phrase manufactured to <br />
meet every person's view, and bring them <br />
in to work on a majority against the Gov- <br />
ernment. Do you suppose, Mr. Speaker, <br />
that the Province will ever be called upon <br />
to decide the question of union without <br />
going into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> details and
conditions ? <br />
Some are for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec</span> Scheme,
some <br />
for union in the abstract, and some oppos- <br />

KERR. After this very exciting<br />
discussion, which has taken us by sur- <br />
prise. I may say it is a wonder how <br />
the Government have so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> held
to-<br />
gether, when we know the difference of <br />
opinion they have maintained on almost <br />
all questions; it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surprising</span>
how they <br />
were enabled to come together and sit <br />
at the some Council board. I have been <br />
in the House fourteen yours. The Pre- <br />
sident of the Council came in the same <br />
day that I did. He has had the sweets <br />
of office, and l have been left out in the <br />
cold. I regret the warmth to which the <br />
debate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> given rise. It is not
desira-<br />
ble we should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> such scenes,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> more <br />
especially between those who have the <br />
destinies of this Province in their charge <br />
to a large extent. I did hope—after <br />
the Hon. Provincial Secretary had <br />
stated in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> he would not <br />
say hard things, as he was too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bred</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that—he</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would
not</span>
have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gone</span> <br />
to the extreme length to which he has. <br />
I think there
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> things he might <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">have omitted without marring the<br />
beauty of his speech. He has thrown<br />
a bomb shell among the members of the <br />
Government, causing them to reveal the <br />
secrets of the Council Chamber of last <br />
season, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> if these scenes
were fre- <br />
uent there must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> some
hard <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings.</span> I am not surprised that
there <br />was difference of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinion there.</span>
I be-<br />
lieve this Government was formed upon<br />
one single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">idea.</span> The most discordant<br />
elements were brought together, and <br />
the members of the Government scarce- <br />
ly agreed upon any question except anti- <br />Confederation. I regret the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissolution</span><br />
of the Assembly took place. I believe <br />
if the House had met last winter, and <br />
the subject of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> had been <br />
discussed. and the debates had gone <br />
abroad in the country, people would <br />
have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood</span> the arguments for
and <br />
against that great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quest</span>ion,
and at the <br />
next election we would have had the <br />
matter settled one way or the other. <br />
Confederation is the main question now, <br />
for every speaker has said more or less <br />
about it. Before the last election, I, <br />
like man others, was undecided <br />
whether the Scheme propoundcd in <br />
Quebec was one this country should <br />
adopt, but I thought that disturbance <br />
might take place, as it was expected <br />
that at the 0 me of the American war,<br />
disbanded soldiers who were without <br />
employment might create <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disturbance</span>
<br />
on our borders, and if we did all in our <br />
power to assist ourselves by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entering</span>
<br />
into confederation which was highly <br />
approved of in England, the whole <br />
power of the nation would be put forth <br />
for our assistance. I did not think this <br />
union was going to give us such great<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">p</span>rosperity as some predicted,
neither did <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I think</span> it would bring desolation
und <br />
ruin on this Province. No great change <br />
of this kind is ever made without a <br />
great deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissatisfaction</span>
being ex-  <br />
pressed by the minority. In Scotland <br />
there was no dissolution of the Legisla- <br />
ture when the union with England was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effected,</span> and since that union
has been <br />
consummated, that country has pros- <br />
pered as well as any other portion of <br />
the world, although the representation <br />
of that country in Parliament is very <br />
small. In Ireland union was not <br />
brought about by an appeal to the peo- <br />
ple. Union appears to o the order of <br />
the day; we have union in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercial</span>
<br />
matters, union in Australia and the <br />
Cape Coast Colonies. lt has been<br />
stated that union is strength. It cer- <br />
tainly would be strength for a poor <br />
country like this to be joined
to a large <br />
wealthy country. And it is my opinion <br />
that the confederation of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonies</span>
<br />
must ultimately take place. After the <br />
election no man was qualiﬁed to sit in <br />
council, or fit for any office throughout <br />
the country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unless</span> he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">known</span> as an <br />
anti-Confederate. In the North there <br />
was only one member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chosen</span> to
repre- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent</span> the whole of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Northern Coun- <br />
ties. where we have had three during <br />
the last ten or fifteen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span>
all men of <br />
ability. I do not mean to say the pre- <br />
sent member is not capable, for I be- <br />
lieve there are few <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better</span>
business men <br />
in the Province. He is a strong Con-<br />
servative, and is a man that will think <br />
and act for himself; but there
were <br />
other men in the North quite as com- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petent</span> to have taken a seat at the <br />
Council Board. We have been left with<br />
only one gentleman in tho Council, and <br />
that gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attending</span> to his
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">business</span> <br />
