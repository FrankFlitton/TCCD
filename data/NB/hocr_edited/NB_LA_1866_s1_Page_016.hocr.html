some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasons, are against us, and abu-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

prejudicing the <span class="unclear" title="“unclear," letter="" might="" be="" missing="" in="" ininds="" ”="">?</span> of the
people<br />
against us. The Press is stating that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
this Government has been guilty<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fraud,</span> and is carrying abuse and
slander<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to every hamlet.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> We challenge them<br />
to prove it ; and we challenge this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
House to put their finger upon an act<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
of fraud, or an act of mal-administra-<br />
tion, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> dare. Let us bring
in our <br />
accounts before this House. We shrink <br />
from no<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> responsibility, and we are
glad <br />
to acknowledge our accountability to <br />
this House. We are told by my hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend that the Surveyor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> has <br />
been here but a few <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">days.</span> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason<br />
is, that affection for an indisposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
daughter has called him to his home. <br />
It may be very well for my learned<br />
friend, who resides at Fredericton, to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
talk about the members of the Govern- ment staying here<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">. No man
would<br />
Move his family to Fredericton upon <br />
the uncertain tenure of an office in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
Government. My hon. friend had bet-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
ter wait and see whether my colleague<br />
has done his duty in that office, and not <br />
condemn him before you know what he <br />
has done. It is an attribute of a just<br />
Judge, that he does not condemn a man <br />
before he is heard. The hon. mover <br />
stands in that position, and he professes<br />
to be entirely unselfish, but I charge<br />
him with wishing to prejudge the Go-<br />
vernment. The commissioner of the<br />
Board of Works has occupied that posi-<br />
tion for many years, and is ready, at<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
any time, to resign the office up to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
people, and has done it ; and he is pre- <br />
pared to show that he has discharged <br />
his duty too. I think we have been <br />
treated unfairly. My hon. friend has <br />
said many offensive things to us, which<br />
I will not to him. When he talks about <br />
mean, low, and decency, I do not wish<br />
to set that gentleman up as a standard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of decency, propriety, and honesty<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">. <br />
His conduct and my conduct are before<br />
the people of the country, and let them<br />
judge, for it is not for us to sound our<br />
own trumpets. A great part of his <br />
speech is made up in setting forth that<br />
our Government had made a tremend-<br />
dous attack upon Her Majesty, the <br />
Queen. I cannot tell whether a tear <br />
dropped from his eye or not. Some-<br />
thing had been said by the Government, <br />
insulting to Her Majesty. He spoke of<br />
Her Majesty's Ministers as if they were <br />
superior to the men of this country. I<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
respect a man occupying a high posi-<br />
tion ; but we must not forget, in our <br />
admiration for a great name an high<br />
sounding titles, that the holders of those<br />
titles are but men. I have, by the<br />
kindness of the people, been in commu-<br />
nication with these men, and, while I <br />
paid them every respect, I never forgot <br />
that I was a man myself. A man is not<br />
a man who forgets himself, and will<br />
fall down and worship any man. In<br />
regard to this Minute of Council which,<br />
he says, is insulting to the Queen. <br />
When a man stands up in his place and<br />
charges the Government with delibe-<br />
rately insulting the Queen, we throw it<br />
back upon him, I can speak more<br />
freely about this, because I was no <br />
party to it. The Attorney General and <br />
myself were in England, where we first<br />
saw it, and we approved of every line<br />
in it, and told, at the office of the Colo-<br />
nial Secretary, that it met our entire<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">In regard to the charge made against<br />
us of not having published the despatch.<br />
We were commanded to communicate it<br />
to the Legislature at their next meeting.<br />
We did not wait for the next meeting of<br />
the Legislature before communicating it<br />
to the public. I was surprised to hear<br />
the hon. gentlemen charge this Govern-<br />
ment with not having given information.<br />
I should like to have him point out to me<br />
how many despatches had been given to<br />
the public when he was a member of the<br />
Government before the Legislature as-<br />
sembled. Despatch after despatch was<br />
was never communicated to the people at<br />
all. This despatch was written on the<br />
24th of June, and published in July. This<br />
despatch was the opinion of Her Majes-<br />
ty's Government upon the Union of the <br />
Colonies, and it was our duty to respect-<br />
fully consider any opinion or suggestion<br />
emanating from so high a source, but at<br />
the same time we must not forget that we<br />
have a country here whose interests are<br />
not identical with those of England. I<br />
told Mr. Cardwell that the people of this<br />
country felt they were better able to judge<br />
this question that the people of England ;<br />
we felt, with all the deference we had for<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their opinion, that we ourselves were<br />
more competent to judge in regard to this<br />
matter, for our people had grown up with<br />
the country, and we know best what would<br />
promote our welfare. There is not a<br />
member of the Cabinet of England that<br />
has ever been to this country, and it is<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no disrespect for the people here to
say<br />
they understand their own interests best.<br />
Mr. Cardwell said the people of England<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favored the Sch<span style="">è</span>me
; we replied we had<br />
only found two persons outside the Gov-<br />
ernment that had ever read the Scheme; <br />
and we attribute a great deal of the feel-<br />
ing of the people of England to the fact<br />
that they assume that after Confedera-<br />
tion is carried they will be relieved from<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some of their taxes ; but Mr. Cardwell<br />
was not prepared to admit that was the<br />
only reason for their opinion. Intelli-<br />
gent men out of the Government sup-<br />
posed that a Legislative Union, pure and<br />
simple, was contemplated, and they ex-<br />
pressed astonishment that men could agree<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to such a Scheme as the one propos-<br />
ed. Mr. Cardwell himself acknowledged<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
that there were many objections to the<br />
scheme ; but said it was the best scheme<br />
which could be got now. We said we<br />
did not think it right to accept a thing<br />
we did not want, because it is the best<br />
thing that could be got ; we wanted to<br />
be let alone. No man denied that it<br />
originated in the necessities of Canada.<br />
the people of this country have no<br />
right to be made subservient to<br />
the political necessities of Canada.<br />
If we could get a scheme of union upon<br />
such terms as are fair and equitable,<br />
such terms as would be promotive of the <br />
welfare and prosperity of this country,<br />
I would be in favor of it, but I will not<br />
consent to ignore the prosperity of my<br />
country for the sake of relieving the po-<br />
litical necessities of Canada. Mr. Card-<br />
well said the scheme emanated from us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
We said no. A delegation went to <br />
Canada, but we gave them no author- <br />
ty ; and the people hurled them from <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power and repudiated the act. They<br />
rejected the scheme, therefore, it could<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">not be said that it emanated from them.<br />My hon friend has a great opinion of the<br />Canadian politicians ; but I can recollect<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the time when I tried to defend and vin-</span><br />dicate the honor of Canadian statesmen<br />when they were assailed by him, and<br />were charged with being guilty of a vio-<br />lation of public faith. The Government<br />had no more right to go to Canada and<br />agree upon a scheme to change the Con-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />stitution than the Government of Great<br />Britain has to go to France and barter<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />away their Government. The people<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />decided that they had proved recreant <br />
to their trust, and hurled them from<br />power. The hon. gentleman talks about<br />silent grumbling was going on, and in-<br />creasing in power, and would hurl this<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />Government to the ground. When he<br />
says this House could not be dissolved<br />if the Government were ousted. I do<br />not say it will be, but I think the Gover-<br />
nor has a right to appeal to the people<br />under the Constitution. We are pre<br />pared to go before the people of this<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country and let them decide whether our</span><br />administration has not been in accord-<br />ance with their interests ; and if they<br />decide against us we will resume our<br />occupations. We will not circle this<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />country and hold meetings in every<br />school house. We are not professional<br />politicians, and if I may be allowed to<br />give my opinion my judgment is that the<br />less professional politicians we have in<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this country the better for its welfare</span>.<br />It is put forth in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> that not only<br /> the Cabinet are in favor of the scheme,<br />but the whole united body of England ;<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>and thus this eroneous information is<br />disseminated to the people of England.<br />
They suppose that the two Canadas are<br />
now about to be united for the first time,<br />
forgetting that they had formerly been <br />under one Legislature. We are charged<br />
with being a Government of traitors,<br />with no spirit of loyalty, that we are will-<br />ing to submit ourselves to a man who <br />is a notorious traitor ; these are the sen-<br />timents put forward in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> and I<br />ask whether these sentiments receive<br />your approbation.<br />
