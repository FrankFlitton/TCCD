a large amount of the articles <br />
we use down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> Canada to
Portland, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thence</span> by boat to St. John, and
then by <br />
rail and boat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again</span> almost up to
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> <br />
again. How much cheaper and better <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be to</span> bring the articles direct. <br />
Then it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been said that the
railroad <br />
would be of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">little good</span> for the
purpose <br />
of defence. This is the ﬁrst time I have <br />
heard such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a statement</span> put
forth, and I <br />
think that all experience<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> is opposed
to <br />
such an idea. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear</span> it used <br />
as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> this union that <br />
we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sh</span>ould be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dragged up</span> to Canada to <br />
ﬁght her battles. I think it a very nar- <br />
row and contracted view to take of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> Is it not our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty, as</span> British <br />
subjects, if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enemy‘s</span> foot is
planted <br />
at Niagara or in Nova Scotia, to march <br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assistance</span> of our
neighbors in <br />
their troubles. Again it has been said <br />
that an effort will made to force us <br />
into Confederation. This would be di- <br />
rect violation of that principle of self- <br />
government which has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span>
accorded <br />
to us. Why then put <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> abroad
that the <br />
British Government will try and coerce <br />
us into a union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> our
wishes? I<br />
feel that it is my duty to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raise</span>
my voice, <br />
feeble though it may be, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contradict</span>
<br />
any such statement, inasmuch as we <br />
have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despatch</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Colonial Sec- <br />
retary, in which it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emphatically</span>
stated <br />
that it cannot be. Then the hon. mem- <br />
ber of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> for St.
John <br />
(Mr. Anglin) insinuates that the Go- <br />
vernment have received some informa- <br />
tion that a delegation is necessary to <br />
counteract the action of schemers, con-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spirators,</span> and so forth. Why not <br />
then lay the information before the- <br />
House? I think such remarks are <br />
entirely uncalled for, and at any <br />
rate should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not come</span> from such a
source. <br />
It is said that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the leaders</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedera-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tion were animated by feelings of sel- <br />
fishness in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">action</span> ; but
are not the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opponents of the scheme</span> as liable
to the <br />
same charge? The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">President</span>
of the <br />
Council said that Mr. Tilley had chang- <br />
ed. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Is he </span>not as open to such
an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intima-</span> <br />
tion as any other man in this Province? <br />
Does he undertake to say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
all politi- <br />
cal honesty is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concentrated:</span> in
Dorches- <br />
ter Corner? I do not say Confederation <br />
will come in six months or in two years, <br />
but I believe it will come. If the prin- <br />
ciple of isolation and stagnation which <br />
is now upheld be a correct one, how is<br />
it that the United States has spent so<br />
much treasure and spilt so much blood<br />
to preserve their union? If it is a true<br />
principle then must we charge them with<br />
folly after eighty years' experience, and<br />
having grown to a people numbering<br />
some of 30,000,000 ; and with consummate<br />
ignorance in doing what they have to<br />
save a Union which we pronounce to be<br />
politically, commercially, and financially<br />
disastrous. The President of the Coun-<br />
cil goes on to say that we cannot find a<br />
parallel for the action taken by us. Sup-<br />
posing we had done as they did in Cana-<br />
da, then we might be charged whit<br />
striving to force the measure upon the<br />
people, but we never attempted anything<br />
of the kind.</span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SMITH.—I said that there<br />
was no parallel in history where men<br />
without any authority from the people<br />
attempted to render up the independence<br />
of the country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. MCMILLAN.—In the point of in-<br />
depence I cannot agree with him. But<br />
does he lay it down that we should not<br />
meet and mature plans for the benefit<br />
of the people? And if this be done can<br />
we be charged with forcing any measures<br />

opinion of a celebrated Anti in Canada<br />
on the railway. The Hon. Mr. Rierson<br />
says :—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Why, this Intercolonial Railway is to<br />

<hr /><div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_33" title="bbox 1288 177 1867 900">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> whole cost she will have to pay ten- <br />
twelfths. This will involve five to seven <br />
millions of dollars of an expense more<br />
than we had any occasion for incurring, <br />
for the other Provinces were all willing <br />
to have been responsible for the rest, <br />
and there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> good reason
why they<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
should. The countries to be benefited <br />
by the Intercolonial Railway are New <br />
Brunswick and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia,</span> but especi- <br />
ally the former. In that Province<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> there
<br />
is an extensive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wilderness</span> with
some <br />
valuable lumber limits if not much <br />
farming land through which this road <br />
will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> to pass and every acre of <br />land within twenty or thirty miles of the<br />
Road will be largely increased in value. <br />
New Brunswick would gain that advan- <br />
tage, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">while</span> as for Nova Scotia,
Halifax, <br />
its chief port, will be made an outlet by <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction</span> of the line and
will of <br />
course be largely benefited, so that they<br />
equitable. But in coming down with a <br />
scheme which involves us in twice as <br />
great an expenditure as was formerly&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
contemplated, they seem not to have <br />
been satisfied unless we handed over to <br />
the Federal Government our public <br />
works. These, hon. gentlemen, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span>
of <br />
immense value to Canada. By imposing<br />
tolls on our canals to an extent which <br />
they would easily bear and which would <br />
not prevent us carrying on the same <br />
immense trade as at present, we could <br />
readily raise half a million of dollars a <br />
year. The Welland Canal alone has<br />
produced a revenue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000</span> a year  <br />
Well, all such sources of income are to <br />
be thrown into the hands of the Federal <br />
Government, while New Brunswick is <br />
to give us a Railway which only pays <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three-eighths</span> of one per cent.
over its <br />working expenses. This small sum, re- <br />
member too, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> what is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paid now</span> — two <br />
or three years after the construction of  <br />
the line. But when the rolling stock <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> out of repair<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">s,</span> the rails want renew- <br />ing, and other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters</span> usual
after a <br />
railroad has been some time working <br />
have to be attended to. The expenses <br />
of this line to the Federal Government <br />
will constantly increase. The road will <br />
be a drag, and I say to hon. gentlemen <br />
we are opening an account without <br />
knowing when it will be closed. By en- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gaging</span> in the construction of the Inter- <br />
colonial Railway and the assumption of <br />
the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia<br />
lines, we are entering upon undefinite<br />
liabilities., the whole being non-paying<br />
property in which we shall find a heavy<br />
bill of expense.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Then, if not satisfied with this, we are<br />
giving a sort of Regium donum of $63-<br />
000 for ten years to the Province of New<br />
Brunswick."<br />
