could he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saved</span> annually. This is
not a <br />
new idea of mine. I adopted it the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span>
<br />
time I was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> House, and
attempted <br />
to show that £15,000 could be saved an- <br />
nually by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retrenchment.</span> I <br />
would give the Board of Works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">employ-</span>
<br />
ment. I could not ind any thing that of- <br />
ficer has to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2.000</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a
year, except</span> to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">set </span>up an annual report.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> I proposed then, <br />
as I propose now, that the Railway should <br />
be connected with the Board of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Works.</span>
<br />
The office of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Post</span> Master
General might <br />
also be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connected</span> with it, for
there is no- <br />
thing incompatible in the building of <br />
roads and bridges with conveying the <br />
rails <span class="unclear" title="uncertain if the letter is an r, obscured">?</span>. The work
would not be too much <br />
in a few hours each day ; he could perform<br />
the business of these three departments.<br />
I do not see any sound economy in the<br />
Speech ; merely abolishing the office of<br />
Post Master General as being an officer<br />
of the Crown does not denote it. I hope<br />
I may be disappointed, and that the Gov-<br />
ernment will adopt a strict system of eco-<br />
nomy, that t</span></span></span>hey will take action and fill<br />
up the gap between Moncton and Nova <br />
Scotia, and build Western Extension <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this will ultimately</span> bring about
the union <br />
of the Maritme Provinces ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if they</span>
take <br />
immediate action in the matter they will <br />
have my warm support. Another branch <br />
if the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">service</span> with which
we
might <br />
dispense, is the School <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspection.</span>
An <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspector </span>travelling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> the country <br />
is no improvement to education ; it is only <br />
a waste of the public money. I trust that <br />
will occupy the attention of the Govern- <br />
ment, and they will alter the School sys- <br />
tem so far as inspection is concerned. <br />
There is an increased expenditure to- <br />
wards the militia contemplated. I hope <br />
the Government will pause before they <br />
increase the expenditure in that direc- <br />
tion. They had better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wait</span> and
see
what <br />
will be the result of the termination of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war</span> in the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States ;</span> whether <br />
they intend to keep up a standing army<br />
or not. I believe that as soon as this war<br />
is over they will disband a large portion <br />
their army ; they can throw off war <br />
there as easy as they can throw of the <br />
habiliments of war. If that will be the <br />
policy of our neighbours why should we <br />
keep ourselves in constant dread for fear <br />
of an invasion from that country ? If they <br />
have no standing army in that country, <br />
and any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">took</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place,</span>
we would <br />
have timely notice, and could then pre- <br />
pare and drill the militia to defend our <br />
country, instead of wasting the time and <br />
labor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ascertaining</span> who are <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best marksmen ; we had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better</span> spend <br />
our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money on</span> the roads of the
country, <br />
and the increase of our population. by this <br />
means increasing our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means</span> of
defence. <br />
We must not allow the time of this coun- <br />
try to be wasted which is important to its <br />
growth, as it has been heretofore. I hoped <br />
the hon. mover of the address would have <br />
given some explanation in regard to Pub- <br />
lic Works, Retrenchment and Coloniza- <br />
tion, but not hearing any thing from him<br />
or from the Government in reference to<br />
this matter I have attempted to express<br />
my views of what should be the policy of<br />
the Government. In reference to that<br />
part of the Speech concerning the con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ference at Quebec,</span> I regret it
will
not <br />
be in the power of the Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to lay</span>
<br />
before the House full <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minutes</span> of
that se- <br />
cret conference, for it is of vast interest <br />
to the people of this Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
they <br />
should have full minutes, memoranda, <br />
and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">divisions of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that Con-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. OTTY.—I am surprised at the<br />
course the hon. gentleman (Mr. Gilbert)<br />
has taken. When the order of the House<br />
was to take up this address, it was to be<br />
taken up paragraph by paragraph. Four<br />
paragraphs have been passed, and then<br />
Mr. Gilbert gets up and opposes the whole<br />
speech in toto. I think the proper course<br />
would have been to have moved an<br />
amendment to any paragraph with which<br />
he could coincide. I may be wrong<br />
in my views, for I am a novice in these<br />
matters, and expect to learn a great deal.<br />
Mr. Gilber has been very discoursive,<br />
and has touched upon a great many sub-<br />
jects. I do not think every thing a Gov-<br />
ernment intend to do is foreshadowed in<br />
the speech ; if it was so, the speech would<br />
be long enough to-day, and to-morrow<br />
also. I cannot understand the position<br />
Mr. Gilbert intends to hold. If he comes<br />
here as the leader of the Opposition it<br />
will surprise me, for I understood he was<br />
elected as an anti-Confederate, and was<br />
in favor of the Government. All these<br />
things are calculated to impress me with<br />
astonishment. He has gone into West-<br />
ern Extension, and finds nothing to pre-<br />
vent the Government from legislating on<br />
the subject. Has he read the facility<br />
bills, giving power to companies to build<br />
Western Extension? Under one of those<br />
Acts money has been expended, the line<br />
has been surveyed, and stock taken up.<br />
Attempts are now being made to secure<br />
the balance of the money in England. If<br />
any Government allows a body of men to<br />
undertake a great work of that kind, and<br />
then pass new Acts upon the subjects,<br />
there would be an end of all confidence<br />
in the Government of the country. I<br />
consider this a very proper expression in<br />
the speech, " But any immediate steps<br />
in this direction appear to be precluded<br />
by existing legislation." The members<br />
of the Government are present, and can<br />
defend the wording of the speech better<br />
than I can ; but being the mover of the<br />
speech I felt called upon to reply.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. A. J. SMITH.—I though this<br />
Speech would have passed without oppo-<br />
sition. The Government do not intend<br />
to take up very many subjects, which<br />
will involve much time in their consid-<br />
eration. It is the desire of the members<br />
of the House to get home as soon as pos-<br />
sible at this season of the year. We<br />
wish to take up only those subjects which<br />
the necessities of the country require,<br />
and we expect to introduce such measures<br />
as will commend themselves to your<br />
judgment. In regard to them, every man<br />
has a right to act as his sense of duty<br />
prescribes, and the Government do not<br />
ask for any favor more than their acts<br />
deserve. I did regret to listen to the<br />
speech of my hon. colleague, we having<br />
</p>
<hr />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> in the late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fought</span> side by <br />
side, and I did not think his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst act
and</span><br />
vote would be in opposition to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov-</span>
<br />
ernment. He asks why we did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not sub-</span>
<br />
mit some great scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of coloniz</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ation</span> <br />
and retrenchment. Has he read that part <br />
of the Speech wherein it is stated that<br />
the " Estimates of the current year will <br />
also be submitted to you." <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span>
have<br />
been framed with as close a regard to<br />
economy as is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consistent</span> with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">due</span> p<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ro-</span>
<br />
vision for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">requirements</span> of
the public <br />
services. (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gilbert—“</span> I
had ref<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">erence</span> <br />
to the reduction of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">salaries.")</span>
The Speech <br />
is no place to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refer</span> to the
reduction of <br />
salaries ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and I</span> am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfied</span> the people of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> will give the
Government a <br />
fair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trial,</span> which is more than
Mr. Gilbert <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seems</span> willing to do, for he has unequivo- <br />
cally shown himself to be in distinct op-<br />
position. He has shown a disposition<br />
not to give fair play. He has brought<br />
forward schemes which his own good<br />
sense will tell him it is impossible to carry<br />
out, and he opposes the Government be-<br />
cause those schemes are not in the<br />
Speech. If we must politically differ—<br />
though I regret it, and am prepared for<br />
all objections— we may continue on terms<br />
of friendship if he desires it ; but I say<br />
to him, that I think his constituents will<br />
not be satisfied with the course which he<br />
has taken in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposing</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> for so short a <br />
time. Is my hon. colleague <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span>
to <br />
state—knowing the facts as he does— <br />
that there are no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laws</span> which will <br />
preclude immediate action for the com- <br />
pletion and extension of the European and <br />
North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> Railway. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Has</span> he ex- <br />
amined the laws? I think he is aware <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<br />The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> Mr. Livesey his made a<br />proposition for the construction of the<br />
connection between Nova Scotia and<br />
Moncton. That proposition was accept-<br />
ed by the late Government, and is now,<br />
on the Executive books of the country.<br />
(Mr. Gilbert—I was not aware of it) The<br />
facility bill of last year promises and<br />
pledges the public faith of the Govern-<br />
ment, that any company which will form<br />
bona fide for the purpose of building those<br />
lines of Railroad, shall be entitled to an<br />
Act of Incorporation, and it will be our<br />
duty to carry out any work our prede-<br />
cessors have done, therefore we find it<br />
utterly impossible to take any immediate<br />
action for the accomplishment of this<br />
work. I regard to other matters, our<br />
time has been limited. We were sworn<br />
in on the first day of April and had three<br />
elections to run,—that of the Provincial<br />
Secretary was held as late as the 20th<br />
April ; since then we have done all we<br />
could to press on the business, but we<br />
find it utterly impossible for us to con-<br />
sider everything requiring to be done in<br />
so short a space of time. In regard to<br />
some Branch Railroads, I look upon the<br />
legislation of the last year as utterly worth-<br />
less, brought in at that time simply for<br />
the purpose of aiding the Government<br />
through the Session. We find efforts<br />
have been made for the construction of <br />
Western Extension, but up to this time<br />
have not been successful. However, a<br />
company has been organized, and an Act<br />
of Incorporation prepared, and that com-<br />
pany have rights under the law, therefore<br><br />

we cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undertake</span> the
construction of <br />
that work as a Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure.</span>
<br />The pledged faith of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> <br />
been given to Mr. Livesey and M<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r.</span>
<br />
Parks. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Corporation</span> of St. John have<br /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agreed </span>to take stock to the
extent of <br />
$400 000. We are no justified in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ignor-</span> <br />
