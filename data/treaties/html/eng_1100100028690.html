<p class="alignCenter"><strong>ORDER IN COUNCIL SETTING UP
COMMISSION<br />
FOR TREATY No. 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>P.C. No. 944</strong></p>
<p>On a Memorandum, dated 20th July 1874, from the Honorable the
Minister of the Interior, stating that he has had before him a
Minute of the Council of the North West of the 14th March last,
recommending that Treaties should this year be concluded with the
Tribes of Indians inhabiting the Territory therein indicated, lying
West of the Boundary of Treaty No. 2, and between the International
Boundary Line and the Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>That he has also had before him several Despatches from the
Lieutenant Governor of later date urging the necessity of these
Treaties.</p>
<p>That looking to these representations and to the fact that the
Mounted Police Force is now moving into the Territory in question
with a view of taking up their winter quarters at Fort Pelly, and
considering the operations of the Boundary Commission which are
continually moving westward into the Indian Country, and also the
steps which are being taken in connection with the proposed
Telegraph Line from Fort Garry westward, all which proceedings are
calculated to further unsettle and excite the Indian mind, already
in a disturbed condition; he recommends that three Commissioners be
appointed by His Excellency the Governor General for the purpose of
making Treaties during the current year with such of the Indians
Bands as they may find it expedient to deal with, inhabiting the
portion of the North West Territories which may be approximately
described as lying between the Westerly Boundary of Treaty No. 2
and the 110th degree of West Longitude, and bounded on the South by
the International Boundary Line, and on the North by Lake Winnipeg,
and by the Saskatchewan River, including a strip of country ten
miles north of that River to the Forks and thence following the
South branch of the said River until it meets the 110th degree of
West Longitude.</p>
<p>The Minister further recommends that the Commissioners to be
appointed for this purpose be instructed to confer with the
Lieutenant Governor of the North West Territories on the subject of
the Treaties, and that, in the event of permanent annuities being
granted to the Tribes with whom Treaties may be made, such
annuities should not be fixed at a higher rate than those
sanctioned by the Treaties already concluded with the Indians of
the North West.</p>
<p>The Committee submit the above recommendation for Your
Excellency's approval.</p>
<p>(sgd.) L. S. HUNTINGDON.<br />

<p>On a Memorandum dated 29th October, 1874 from the Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie submitting for the consideration of Your Excellency in
Council Copies of a Treaty and supplementary Treaty with the Cree,

the latter on the 21st September last, by His Honor the Lieutenant
Governor of the North West Territories, the Hon. the Minister of
the Interior, and W. J. Christie, Esquire, of Brockville, Ont., the
Commissioners specially appointed for that purpose, under Orders in
Council dated 23rd July and 26th August respectively.</p>
<p>Mr. Mackenzie states that the Territory covered by the Treaties
may be approximately described as lying between the Western
boundary of Treaty No.2 and the 1101/2 degree of West Longitude,
and bounded on the South by the International Boundary, and on the
North by the Red Deer River, and its Lakes, Red Deer and Etoimami,
to the source of its Western Branch thence in a straight line to
the source of the Northern Branch of the Qu'Appelle, thence along
and including said stream to the Forks near Long Lake; thence along
and including the Valley of the West Branch of the Qu'Appelle to
the South Saskatchewan, thence along and including said River to
the mouth of Maple Creek, thence along said Creek, to a point
opposite the Cypress Hills, thence due South to the Boundary Line,
and that the Area of the Territory above described comprises about
50,000 Square Miles.</p>
<p>That the terms of the Treaties are nearly identical with those
of the Treaty concluded last year at the North West Angle of the
Lake of the Woods.</p>
<p>That the principal conditions of the Treaties may be briefly
stated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st A Money present to each Chief of $25; to each Headman not
exceeding four in each Band $15 and to every other Indian, man,
woman and Child in the Band $12.</li>
<li>2nd An Annual payment in perpetuity, of the same sums to the
Chiefs and Headmen (not exceeding four in each Band) and $5 to
every other man, woman and Child in the Band.</li>
<li>3rd Certain trifling presents of clothing every third year, to
the Chiefs and Headmen.</li>
<li>4th A supply of Ammunition and twine every year to the value of
$750.</li>
<li>5th Presents of Agricultural implements, Cattle, grain,

the numbers of the Bands, and on the same conditions as in the
previous Treaty.</li>
<li>7th Schools to be established on each Reserve as soon as the
Indians settle thereon.</li>
<li>8th Intoxicating liquors to be excluded from the Reserve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Mackenzie states that the Treaties appear to him to be
satisfactory and he therefore recommends that they be approved by
Your Excellency in Council.</p>
<p>He further submits that he is of opinion that the satisfactory
conclusion of the Treaties is mainly due to patience, firmness,
tact and ability displayed by the Commissioners in the conduct of
the negotiations.</p>
<p>The Committee concur in the foregoing Report and recommend and
advise that the Treaties be approved and accepted and be enrolled
in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Whereas the Indians inhabiting the said territory have, pursuant
to an appointment made by the said Commissioners, been convened at
a meeting at the Qu'Appelle Lakes, to deliberate upon certain
matters of interest to Her Most Gracious Majesty, of the one part,
and the said Indians of the other.</p>

<p>And whereas the said Commissioners have proceeded to negotiate a
treaty with the said Indians, and the same has been finally agreed
upon and concluded as follows, that is to say:-</p>
<p>The Cree and Saulteaux Tribes of Indians, and all other the

do hereby cede, release, surrender and yield up to the Government
of the Dominion of Canada, for Her Majesty the Queen, and Her
successors forever, all their rights, titles and privileges
whatsoever, to the lands included within the following limits, that
is to say:-</p>
<p>Commencing at a point on the United States frontier due south of
the northwestern point of the Moose Mountains; thence due north to
said point of said mountains: thence in a north-easterly course to
a point two miles due west of Fort Ellice; thence in a line
parallel with and two miles westward from the Assiniboine River to

two miles distant therefrom to its source; thence in a straight
line to a point on the western shore of Lake Winnipegosis, due west
from the most northern extremity of Waterhen Lake; thence east to
the centre of Lake Winnipegosis; thence northwardly, through the
middle of the said lake (including Birch Island), to the mouth of
Red Deer River; thence westwardly and southwestwardly along and
including the said Red Deer River and its lakes, Red Deer and
Etoimaini, to the source of its western branch; thence in a
straight line to the source of the northern branch of the
Qu'Appelle; thence along and including said stream to the forks
near Long Lake; thence along and including the valley of the west
branch of the Qu'Appelle to the South Saskatchewan; thence along

place of commencement. Also all their rights, titles and privileges
whatsoever to all other lands wheresoever situated within Her
Majesty's North-West Territories, or any of them. To have and to
hold the same to Her Majesty the Queen and Her successors for
ever.</p>
<p>And Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees, through the said
Commissioners, to assign reserves for said Indians, such reserves
to be selected by officers of Her Majesty's Government of the
Dominion of Canada appointed for that purpose, after conference
with each band of the Indians, and to be of sufficient area to
allow one square mile for each family of five, or in that
proportion for larger or smaller families; provided, however, that
it be understood that, if at the time of the selection of any
reserves, as aforesaid, there are any settlers within the bounds of
the lands reserved for any band, Her Majesty retains the right to
deal with such settlers as She shall deem just, so as not to
diminish the extent of land allotted to the Indians; and provided,
further, that the aforesaid reserves of land, or any part thereof,
or any interest or right therein, or appurtenant thereto, may be
sold, leased or otherwise disposed of by the said Government for
the use and benefit of the said Indians, with the consent of the
Indians entitled thereto first had and obtained, but in no wise
shall the said Indians, or any of them, be entitled to sell or
otherwise alienate any of the lands allotted to them as
reserves.</p>
<p>In view of the satisfaction with which the Queen views the ready
response which Her Majesty's Indian subjects have accorded to the
invitation of Her said Commissioners to meet them on this occasion,
and also in token of their general good conduct and behaviour, She
hereby, through Her Commissioners, makes the Indians of the bands
here represented a present, for each Chief of twenty-five dollars
in cash, a coat and a Queen's silver medal; for each Headman, not
exceeding four in each band, fifteen dollars in cash and a coat;
and for every other man, woman and child twelve dollars in cash;
and for those here assembled some powder, shot, blankets, calicoes,
strouds and other articles.</p>
<p>As soon as possible after the execution of this treaty Her
Majesty shall cause a census to be taken of all the Indians
inhabiting the tract hereinbefore described, and shall, next year,
and annually afterwards for ever, cause to be paid in cash at some
suitable season to be duly notified to the Indians, and at a place
or places to be appointed for that purpose, within the territory
ceded, each Chief twenty-five dollars; each Headman not exceeding
four to a band, fifteen dollars; and to every other Indian man,
woman and child, five dollars per head; such payment to be made to
the heads of families for those belonging thereto, unless for some
special reason it be found objectionable.</p>
<p>Her Majesty also agrees that each Chief and each Headman, not to
exceed four in each band, once in every three years during the term
of their offices shall receive a suitable suit of clothing, and
that yearly and every year She will cause to be distributed among
the different bands included in the limits of this treaty powder,
shot, ball and twine, in all to the value of seven hundred and
fifty dollars; and each Chief shall receive hereafter, in
recognition of the closing of the treaty, a suitable flag.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that the following articles shall be supplied to any band thereof
who are now actually cultivating the soil, or who shall hereafter
settle on their reserves and commence to break up the land, that is
to say: two hoes, one spade, one scythe and one axe for every
family so actually cultivating, and enough seed wheat, barley, oats
and potatoes to plant such land as they have broken up; also one
plough and two harrows for every ten families so cultivating as
aforesaid, and also to each Chief for the use of his band as
aforesaid, one yoke of oxen, one bull, four cows, a chest of
ordinary carpenter's tools, five hand saws, five augers, one
cross-cut saw, one pit-saw, the necessary files and one grindstone,
all the aforesaid articles to be given, once for all, for the
encouragement of the practice of agriculture among the Indians.</p>
<p>Further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain a school in the reserve
allotted to each band as soon as they settle on said reserve and
are prepared for a teacher.</p>
<p>Further, Her Majesty agrees that within the boundary of the
Indian reserves, until otherwise determined by the Government of
the Dominion of Canada, no intoxicating liquor shall be allowed to
be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force, or hereafter to
be enacted, to preserve Her Indian subjects, inhabiting the
reserves, or living elsewhere within the North-West Territories,
from the evil effects of intoxicating liquor, shall be strictly
enforced.</p>
<p>And further, Her Majesty agrees that Her said Indians shall have
right to pursue their avocations of hunting, trapping and fishing
throughout the tract surrendered, subject to such regulations as
may from time to time be made by the Government of the country,
acting under the authority of Her Majesty, and saving and excepting
such tracts as may be required or taken up from time to time for
settlement, mining or other purposes, under grant or other right
given by Her Majesty's said Government.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and Her said Indian
subjects that such sections of the reserves above indicated as may
at any time be required for public works or building of whatsoever
nature may be appropriated for that purpose by Her Majesty's
Government of the Dominion of Canada, due compensation being made
to the Indians for the value of any improvements thereon, and an
equivalent in land or money for the area of the reserve so
appropriated.</p>
<p>And the undersigned Chiefs and Headmen, on their own behalf and
on behalf of all other Indians inhabiting the tract within ceded,
do hereby solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this
treaty, and also to conduct and behave themselves as good and loyal
subjects of Her Majesty the Queen. They promise and engage that
they will, in all respects, obey and abide by the law, that they
will maintain peace and good order between each other, and between
themselves and other tribes of Indians and between themselves and
others of Her Majesty's subjects, whether Indians, Half-breeds, or
whites, now inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit any part of the said
ceded tract; and that they will not molest the person or property
of any inhabitant of such ceded tract, or the property of Her
Majesty the Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person passing
or travelling through the said tract, or any part thereof, and that
they will assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to justice
and punishment any Indian offending against the stipulations of
this treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the country so
ceded.</p>
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF Her Majesty's said Commissioners, and the
said Indian Chiefs and Headmen, have hereunto subscribed and set
their hands, at Qu'Appelle, this day and year herein first above
written.</p>
