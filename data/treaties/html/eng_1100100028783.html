<h4>ADHESION BY CREE INDIANS</h4>
</div>
<p>We the undersigned Chiefs and Headmen, on behalf of ourselves
and the other members of the Wood Cree Tribe of Indians, having had
explained to us the terms of the treaty made and concluded near
Carlton, on the 23rd day of August and on 28th day of said month
respectively, and near Fort Pitt on the 9th day of September, 1876,
between Her Majesty the Queen, by the Commissioners duly appointed
to negotiate the said treaty, and the Plain and Wood Cree and other
Tribes of Indians inhabiting the country within the limits defined
in said treaty, but not having been present at the councils at
which the articles of the said treaty were agreed upon, do now
hereby for ourselves and the Bands which we represent, in
consideration of the provisions of the said treaty being extended
to us and the Bands which we represent, transfer, surrender, and
relinquish to Her Majesty the Queen, Her heirs and successors, to
and for the use of the Government of the Dominion of Canada, all
our right, title and interest whatsoever which we and the said
Bands which we represent hold and enjoy, or have held and enjoyed,
of, in and to the territory included within the following limits:
All and singular that portion or tract of land being the north part
of the Land District of Prince Albert, as shown on the maps
published by the Honourable the Minister of the Interior, dated at
Ottawa on the 31st day of August, 1885; the same tract being north
of the northerly limit of Treaty No.6, North-West Territory,
containing 11,066 square miles, be the same more or less, and more
particularly described as follows: Commencing at a point being the
north-west corner of projected Township No. 70, Range 10, west of
the Third Initial Meridian; thence easterly along the northern
boundaries of projected Townships Nos. 70 to the north-east corner
of projected Township No. 70, Range 13, west of the Second Initial
Meridian; thence southerly following the east boundary of said 13th
Range of projected Townships to the northern limits of Treaty No.
6. into the projected Township No. 60; thence westerly following
the northerly limit of Treaty No. 6 to the south-eastern shore of
Green Lake, being at the north-easterly part of projected Township
No. 58, Range 10, west of the Third Initial Meridian; thence
following the westerly shore of Green Lake to the main inlet
thereof known as Beaver River; thence up the right bank of Beaver
River to its intersection with the west boundary of projected
Township No. 62, Range 10, west of the Third Initial Meridian;
thence northerly following the west boundary of projected townships
of Range 10, west of the Third Initial Meridian, to the point of
commencement.</p>
<p>Also, all our right, title and interest whatsoever to all other
lands wherever situated, whether within the limits of any other
treaty heretofore made, or hereafter to be made with Indians, and
whether the said lands are situated in the North-West Territories
of elsewhere in Her Majesty's Dominion, to have and to hold the
same unto and for the use of Her Majesty the Queen, Her heirs and
successors forever.</p>
<p>And we hereby agree to accept the several benefits, payments and
reserves promised to the Indians adhering to the said treaty at
Fort Pitt or Carlton; with the proviso as regards the amount to be
expended annually for ammunition and twine, and as respects the
amount to be expended for three years annually in provisions for
the use of such Indians as are settled on reserves and are engaged
in cultivating the soil, to assist them in such cultivation, that
the expenditure on both of these items shall bear the same
proportion to the number of Indians now treated with as the amounts
for those two items as mentioned in Treaty No. 6 bore to the number
of Indians then treated with. And we solemnly engage to abide by,
carry out and fulfil all the stipulations, obligations and
conditions therein contained on the part of the Chiefs and Indians
therein named to be observed and performed, and we agree in all
things to conform to the articles of the said treaty, as if we
ourselves and the Bands which we represent had been originally
contracting parties thereto and had been present at the council
held near Fort Pitt or near Carlton and had there attached our
signatures to the said treaty.</p>
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Her Majesty's special Commissioners and the
Chiefs and Councillors of the Bands hereby giving their adhesion to
the said treaty have hereunto subscribed and set their hands at
Montreal Lake this eleventh day of February, in the year of Our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine.</p>
