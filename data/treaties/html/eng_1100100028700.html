<h3>TREATY No. 5</h3>
<p>ARTICLES OF A TREATY made and concluded at Beren's River the
20th day of September, and at Norway House the 24th day of
September, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
seventy-five, between "Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen" of
Great Britain and Ireland, by Her Commissioners the Honourable

and the North-west Territories, and the Honourable James McKay, of
the one part, and the Saulteaux and Swampy Cree tribes of Indians,
inhabitants of the country within the limits hereinafter defined
and described, by their Chiefs, chosen and named as hereinafter

<p>WHEREAS, the Indians inhabiting the said country have, pursuant
to an appointment made by the said Commissioners, been convened at
meetings at Beren's River and Norway House to deliberate upon
certain matters of interest to Her Most Gracious Majesty, of the

Her Majesty's said Commissioners that it is the desire of Her
Majesty to open up for settlement, immigration and such other
purposes as to Her Majesty may seem meet, a tract of country
bounded and described as hereinafter mentioned, and to obtain the
consent thereto of Her Indian subjects inhabiting the said tract,
and to make a treaty and arrange with them, so that there may be
peace and good will between them and Her Majesty, and that they may
know and be assured of what allowance they are to count upon and
receive from Her Majesty's bounty and benevolence.</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS the Indians of said tract, duly convened in council
as aforesaid, and being requested by Her Majesty's said
Commissioners to name certain Chiefs and Headmen who should be
authorized on their behalf to conduct such negotiations and sign
any treaty to be founded thereon, and to become responsible to Her
Majesty for the faithful performance by their respective bands of
such obligations as shall be assumed by them the said Indians, have
thereupon named the following persons for that purpose, that is to
say:</p>

WHEREAS the said Commissioners then and there received and

<p>AND WHEREAS the said Commissioners have proceeded to negotiate a

Government of the Dominion of Canada, for Her Majesty the Queen and
Her successors for ever, all their rights, titles and privileges
whatsoever to the lands included within the following limits, that
is to say:</p>
<p>Commencing at the north corner or junction of Treaties Nos. 1
and 3; then easterly along the boundary of Treaty No. 3 to the
"Height of Land," at the northeast corner of the said treaty
limits, a point dividing the waters of the Albany and Winnipeg
Rivers; thence due north along the said "Height of Land " to a
point intersected by the 53° of north latitude; and thence
north-westerly to "Favourable Lake"; thence following the east
shore of said lake to its northern limit; thence north-westerly to
the north end of Lake Winnipegoosis; then westerly to the "Height
of Land" called "Robinson's Portage"; thence north-westerly to the
east end of "Cross Lake"; thence north-westerly crossing "Foxes
Lake"; thence north-westerly to the north end of "Split Lake";
thence south-westerly to "Pipestone Lake," on "Burntwood River ";
thence south-westerly to the western point of "John Scott's Lake";
thence south-westerly to the north shore of "Beaver Lake"; thence
south-westerly to the west end of "Cumberland Lake"; thence due
south to the "Saskatchewan River"; thence due south to the
north-west corner of the northern limits of Treaty No. 4, including
all territory within the said limits, and all islands on all lakes
within the said limits, as above described; and it being also
understood that in all cases where lakes form the treaty limits,
ten miles from the shore of the lake should be included in the
treaty.</p>
<p>And also all their rights, titles and privileges whatsoever to
all other lands wherever situated in the North-west Territories or
in any other Province or portion of Her Majesty's dominions
situated and being within the Dominion of Canada;</p>
<p>The tract comprised within the lines above described, embracing
an area of one hundred thousand square miles, be the same more or
less;</p>
<p>To have and to hold the same to Her Majesty the Queen, and Her
successors forever;</p>
<p>And Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees and undertakes to lay
aside reserves for farming lands, due respect being had to lands at
present cultivated by the said Indians, and other reserves for the
benefit of the said Indians, to be administered and dealt with for
them by Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada,
provided all such reserves shall not exceed in all one hundred and
sixty acres for each family of five, or in that proportion for
larger or smaller families-in manner following, that is to say: For
the Band of "Saulteaux, in the Beren's River" region, now settled
or who may within two years settle therein, a reserve commencing at
the outlet of Beren's River into Lake Winnipeg, and extending along
the shores of said lake, and up said river and into the interior
behind said lake and river, so as to comprehend one hundred and
sixty acres for each family of five, a reasonable addition being,
however, to be made by Her Majesty to the extent of the said
reserve for the inclusion in the tract so reserved of swamp, but
reserving the free navigation of the said lake and river, and free
access to the shores and waters thereof, for Her Majesty and all
Her subjects, and expecting thereout such land as may have been
granted to or stipulated to be held by the "Hudson Bay Company,"
and also such land as Her Majesty or Her successors, may in Her
good pleasure, see fit to grant to the Mission established at or
near Beren's River by the Methodist Church of Canada, for a church,
school-house, parsonage, burial ground and farm, or other mission
purposes; and to the Indians residing at Poplar River, falling into
Lake Winnipeg north of Beren's River, a reserve not exceeding one
hundred and sixty acres to each family of five, respecting, as much
as possible, their present improvements:</p>
<p>And inasmuch as a number of the Indians now residing in and
about Norway House of the band of whom David Rundle is Chief are
desirous of removing to a locality where they can cultivate the
soil, Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees to lay aside a reserve on
the west side of Lake Winnipeg, in the vicinity of Fisher River, so
as to give one hundred acres to each family of five, or in that
proportion for larger or smaller families, who shall remove to the
said locality within "three years," it being estimated that ninety
families or thereabout will remove within the said period, and that
a reserve will be laid aside sufficient for that or the actual
number; and it is further agreed that those of the band who remain
in the vicinity of "Norway House" shall retain for their own use
their present gardens, buildings and improvements, until the same
be departed with by the Queen's Government, with their consent
first had and obtained, for their individual benefit, if any value
can be realized therefore:</p>
<p>And with regard to the Band of Wood Indians, of whom
Ta-pas-ta-num, or Donald William Sinclair Ross, is Chief, a reserve
at Otter Island, on the west side of Cross Lake, of one hundred and
sixty acres for each family of five or in that proportion for
smaller families-reserving, however, to Her Majesty, Her successors
and Her subjects the free navigation of all lakes and rivers and
free access to the shores thereof; Provided, however, that Her
Majesty reserves the right to deal with any settlers within the
bounds of any lands reserved for any band as She shall deem fit,
and also that the aforesaid reserves of land or any interest
therein may be sold or otherwise disposed of by Her Majesty's
Government for the use and benefit of the said Indians entitled
thereto, with their consent first had and obtained.</p>
<p>And with a view to show the satisfaction of Her Majesty with the
behaviour and good conduct of Her Indians, She hereby, through Her
Commissioners, makes them a present of five dollars for each man,
woman and child belonging to the bands here represented, in
extinguishment of all claims heretofore preferred.</p>
<p>And further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain schools for
instruction in such reserves hereby made as to Her Government of
the Dominion of Canada may seem advisable, whenever the Indians of
the reserve shall desire it.</p>
<p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that within
the boundary of Indian reserves, until otherwise determined by Her
Government of the Dominion of Canada, no intoxicating liquor shall
be allowed to be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force, or
hereafter to be enacted, to preserve Her Indian subjects inhabiting
the reserves, or living elsewhere within Her North-west
Territories, from the evil influence of the use of intoxicating
liquors, shall be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians, that they, the
said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of
hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from
time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada,
and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be
required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other
purposes, by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by
any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said
Government.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and Her said Indians
that such sections of the reserves above indicated as may at any
time be required for public works or buildings, of what nature
soever, may be appropriated for that purpose by Her Majesty's
Government of the Dominion of Canada, due compensation being made
for the value of any improvements thereon.</p>
<p>And further, that Her Majesty's Commissioners shall, as soon as
possible after the execution of this treaty, cause to be taken an
accurate census of all the Indians inhabiting the tract above
described, distributing them in families, and shall in every year
ensuing the date hereof, at some period in each year to be duly
notified to the Indians, and at a place or places to be appointed
for that purpose within the territory ceded, pay to each Indian
person the sum of five dollars per head yearly.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that the sum of five hundred dollars per annum shall be yearly and
every year expended by Her Majesty in the purchase of ammunition,
and twine for nets, for the use of the said Indians, in manner
following, that is to say: in the reasonable discretion as regards
the distribution thereof among the Indians inhabiting the several
reserves or otherwise included therein of Her Majesty's Indian
Agent have the supervision of this treaty.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that the following articles shall be supplied to any band of the
said Indians who are now cultivating the soil, or who shall
hereafter commence to cultivate the land, that is to say: Two hoes
for every family actually cultivating; also one spade per family as
aforesaid; one plough for every ten families as aforesaid; five
harrows for every twenty families as aforesaid; one scythe for
every family as aforesaid, and also one axe; and also one cross-cut
saw, one hand-saw, one pit-saw, the necessary files, one
grindstone, and one auger for each band; and also for each Chief,
for the use of his band, one chest of ordinary carpenter's tools;
also for each band enough of wheat, barley, potatoes and oats to
plant the land actually broken up for cultivation by such band;
also for each band one yoke of oxen, one bull and four cows all the
aforesaid articles to be given once for all for the encouragement
of the practice of agriculture among the Indians.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that each Chief duly recognized as such shall receive an annual
salary of twenty-five dollars per annum, and each subordinate
officer, not exceeding three for each band, shall receive fifteen
dollars per annum; and each such Chief and subordinate officer as
aforesaid shall also receive, once every three years, a suitable
suit of clothing; and each Chief shall receive, in recognition of
the closing of the treaty, a suitable flag and medal.</p>
<p>And the undersigned Chiefs, on their own behalf and on behalf of
all other Indians inhabiting the tract within ceded, do hereby
solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this treaty, and
also to conduct and behave themselves as good and loyal subjects of
Her Majesty the Queen. They promise and engage that they will, in
all respects, obey and abide by the law, and they will maintain
peace and good order between each other, and also between
themselves and other Tribes of Indians, and between themselves and
others of Her Majesty's subjects, whether Indians or whites, now
inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit any part of the said ceded
tracts, and that they will not molest the person or property of any
inhabitant of such ceded tracts, or the property of Her Majesty the
Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person passing or
travelling through the said tracts, or any part thereof; and that
they will aid and assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to
justice and punishment any Indian offending against the
stipulations of this treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the
country so ceded.</p>
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Her Majesty's said Commissioners and the
said Indian Chiefs have hereunto subscribed and set their hands at
"Beren's River" this twentieth day of September, A.D. 1875, and at
Norway House on the twenty-fourth day of the month and year herein

"Cumberland Band" a reserve at "Cumberland Island," and as the land
fit for cultivation there is also limited and insufficient to meet
