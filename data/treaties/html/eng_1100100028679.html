<h2>Treaty 3 between Her Majesty the Queen and the Saulteaux Tribe
of the Ojibbeway Indians at the Northwest Angle on the Lake of the
Woods with Adhesions</h2>
<p>(REPRINTED 1966)<br />
(REPRINTED 1978)</p>
<p>LAYOUT IS NOT EXACTLY LIKE ORIGINAL</p>
<p>TRANSCRIBED FROM:<br />
ROGER DUHAMEL, F.R.S.C.<br />
QUEEN'S PRINTER AND CONTROLLER OF STATIONERY<br />
OTTAWA, 1966<br /></p>
<p>Cat. No. Ci 72-0366</p>
<hr class="width75 alignCenter" />
<p class="alignCenter"><strong>ORDER IN COUNCIL SETTING UP
COMMISSION FOR TREATY 3</strong></p>
<p>The Committee have had under consideration the memorandum dated
19th April, 1871, from the Hon. the Secretary of State for the
provinces submitting with reference to his report of the 17th of
the same month that the Indians mentioned in the last paragraph of
that report and with whom it will be necessary first to deal occupy
the country from the water shed of Lake Superior to the north west
angle of the Lake of the Woods and from the American border to the
height of land from which the streams flow towards Hudson's
Bay.</p>
<p>That they are composed of Saulteaux and Lac Seul Indians of the
Ojibbeway Nation, and number about twenty-five hundred men, women
and children, and, retaining what they desire in reserves at
certain localities where they fish for sturgeon, would, it is
thought be willing to surrender for a certain annual payment their
lands to the Crown. That the American Indians to the south of them
surrendered their lands to the Government of the United States for
an annual payment which has been stated to him (but not on
authority) to amount to ten dollars per head for each man, woman
and child of which six dollars is paid in goods and four in money.
That to treat with these Indians with advantage he recommends that
Mr. Simon J. Dawson of the Department of Public Works and Mr.
Robert Pither of the Hudson's Bay Company's service be associated
with Mr. Wemyss M. Simpson-and further that the presents which were
promised the Indians last year and a similar quantity for the
present year should be collected at Fort Francis not later than the
middle of June also that four additional suits of Chiefs' clothes
and flags should be added to those now in store at Fort Francis-and
further that a small house and store for provisions should be
constructed at Rainy River at the site and of the dimensions which
Mr. Simpson may deem best-that the assistance of the Department of
Public Works will be necessary should his report be adopted in
carrying into effect the recommendations therein made as to
provisions, clothes and construction of buildings.</p>
<p>He likewise submits that it will be necessary that the sum of
Six Thousand dollars in silver should be at Fort Francis subject to
the Order of the above named Commissioners on the fifteenth day of
June next-And further recommends that in the instructions to be
given to them they should be directed to make the best arrangements
in their power but authorized if need be to give as much as twelve

to deal with such settlers as She shall deem just so as not to
diminish the extent of land allotted to Indians; and provided also

instruction in such reserves hereby made as to Her Government of
Her Dominion of Canada may seem advisable whenever the Indians of
the reserve shall desire it.</p>
<p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians that within the
boundary of Indian reserves, until otherwise determined by Her
Government of the Dominion of Canada, no intoxicating liquor shall
be allowed to be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force or
hereafter to be enacted to preserve Her Indian subjects inhabiting
the reserves or living elsewhere within Her North-west Territories,
from the evil influences of the use of intoxicating liquors, shall
be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians that they, the
said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of
hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as
hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from
time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada,
and saving and excepting such tracts as may, from time to time, be
required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other
purposes by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by
any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said
Government.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and Her said Indians
that such sections of the reserves above indicated as may at any
time be required for Public Works or buildings of what nature
soever may be appropriated for that purpose by Her Majesty's
Government of the Dominion of Canada, due compensation being made
for the value of any improvements thereon.</p>
<p>And further, that Her Majesty's Commissioners shall, as soon as
possible after the execution of this treaty, cause to be taken an
accurate census of all the Indians inhabiting the tract above
described, distributing them in families, and shall in every year
ensuing the date hereof, at some period in each year to be duly
notified to the Indians, and at a place or places to be appointed
for that purpose within the territory ceded, pay to each Indian
person the sum of five dollars per head yearly.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians
that the sum of fifteen hundred dollars per annum shall be yearly

ammunition and twine for nets for the use of the said Indians.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians

practice of agriculture among the Indians.</p>
<p>It is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians

officer, not exceeding three for each band, shall receive fifteen
dollars per annum; and each such Chief and subordinate officer as

inhabitants of such ceded tract, or the property of Her Majesty the
Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person passing or
travelling through the said tract, or any part thereof; and that
they will aid and assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to
justice and punishment any Indian offending against the
stipulations of this treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the

<p>Whereas the Half-breeds above described, by virtue of their
Indian blood, claim a certain interest or title in the lands or
territories in the vicinity of Rainy Lake and the Rainy River, for
the commutation or surrender of which claims they ask compensation
from the Government.</p>
<p>And whereas, having fully and deliberately discussed and
considered the matter, the said Half-breeds have elected to join in
the treaty made between the Indians and Her Majesty, at the
North-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods, on the third day of
October, 1873, and have expressed a desire thereto, and to become
subject to the terms and conditions thereof in all respects saving
as hereinafter set forth.</p>
<p>It is now hereby agreed upon by and between the said parties
hereto (this agreement, however, to be subject in all respects to

to say: The Half-breeds, through Nicholas Chatelaine, their Chief
above named, as representing them herein, agree as follows, that is
to say:-</p>
<p>That they hereby fully and voluntarily surrender to Her Majesty

terms and conditions of the said treaty shall receive compensation
in the way of reserves of land, payments, annuities and presents,
in manner similar to that set forth in the several respects for the
Indians in the said treaty; it being understood, however, that any
sum expended annually by Her Majesty in the purchase of ammunition
and twine for nets for the use of the said Half-breeds shall not be
taken out of the fifteen hundred dollars set apart by the treaty
for the purchase annually of those articles for the Indians, but
shall be in addition thereto, and shall be a pro rata amount in the
proportion of the number of Half-breeds parties hereto to the
number of Indians embraced in the treaty; and it being further
understood that the said Half-breeds shall be entitled to all the
benefits of the said treaty as from the date thereof, as regards
payments and annuities, in the same manner as if they had been
present and had become parties to the same at the time of the
