               from Mr. Dawson, regarding the exploration

               not strictly in the employ of the Government

               preparing a report on the subject of his last 
               <lb/>
               exploration. Last year he had been asked to 
               <lb/>
               make a more thorough exploration of the

               of the Woods, and he had done so, and had 
               <lb/>
               been very successful in finding a road much 
               <lb/>
               superior in every way to that formerly pro<lb break="no"/>posed. On this subject he would make a full
