between four and ﬁve <br />
thousand inhabitants, it was admitted as a <br />
State ten years ago, with a population of <br />
more than 200,000 inhabitants. During the
<br />
late war, from this State alone, 15,000 soldiers <br />
went into the ﬁeld, and paying besides a war <br />
tax, which, in 1864, amounted to upwards of <br />
$38,000,000, and the value of land has risen <br />
frmo $1 an acre to nearly $6 on an average. <br />
All this prosperity has taken place on the <br />
very borders of the Hudson’s Bay Territory. <br />
North of the boundary line, from Canada to <br />
British Columbia, is a continuation of the <br />
glorious country which is the pride of Minne- <br />
sota, and under a stable form of government <br />
there is no reason why the same degree of <br />
prosperity, or even more, may not be devel- <br />
oped in the landed country of the Northwest. <br />
Mr. Dawson says the climate of Red River will <br />
compare generally with that of Kingston, Ont. <br />
In 1858 the ice moved in Red River on the <br />
3lst March, and ploughing was commenced on <br />
the 9th of April. Average depth of snow on <br />
prairies is 12 inches, and in the woods 16 <br />
inches. The buffalo are said to winter in the <br />
upper Athabasca as safely as at St. Paul’s, <br />
Minnesota, and the spring opens at nearly the <br />
same time, along the immense line of plains, <br />
from St. Paul to the Mackenzie river. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Dawson, on the latest authority, says
<br />
that the woody districts contain abundance of <br />
timber—red and white pine, of large and good <br />
quality, and such districts would compare <br />
favourably with some of the best lumber re- <br />
gions of the Ottawa. Of peat, for fuel, the <br />
supply is enough or more; and, as for coal, it <br />
is described as being inexhaustible in supply. <br />
Salt, gypsum, and bitumen are known to exist <br />
