               granted that the gentlemen opposed to them 
               <br />
               would be as ready to turn their backs on 
               <br />
               themselves, as they in their past career had 
               <br />
               shown themselves to be. He (Mr. Holton) had 
               <br />
               never learned that art. He had felt himself 
               <br />
               constrained, by reason of his own antecedents 
               <br />
               in connection with this subject, in common 
               <br />
               with every man who had held ofﬁce in this 
               <br />
               country during the last ten years, to stand 
               <br />
               by the proposition to acquire this territory. 
               <br />
               He had always contended that it was right 
               <br />
               to take steps to acquire it although he might 
               <br />
               take exception to the terms on which it had 
               <br />
               been acquired. If an amendment had been 
               <br />
               moved ﬁnding fault with any one of the con-<br />
               ditions on which the territory was acquired, 
               <br />
               he would have voted for it, but he could not, 
               <br />
               under any circumstances, vote against the 
               <br />
               acquisition of the territory itself. He must, 
               <br />
               like the member for Lambton, express his 
               <br />
               surprise that the mover and seconder of the 
               <br />
               resolutions had made no reference to the agen- 
               <br />
               cy of the Hon. George Brown in connection 
               <br />
               with this whole subject. He remembered very 
               <br />
               well when the initiatory step towards the 
               <br />
               acquisition of this territory was taken by 
               <br />
               that gentleman. If any public man in this 
               <br />
               country had the credit of initiating the agi- 
               <br />
               tation which had led to this result, it was 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown and he had been all along its 
               <br />
               principal promoter. On him would rest prin- 
               <br />
               cipally the responsibility it the measure 
               <br />
               eventuated unfortunately for this country, 
               <br />
               and to him on the contrary would belong 
               <br />
               the largest measure of credit that would 
               <br />
               appertain to any public man if it should 
               <br />
               turn out, as they all hoped it would, of 
               <br />
               the highest advantage to this country. He 
               <br />
               regretted that that gentleman was not now 
               <br />
               in the House to bear a part in the settle- 
               <br />
               ment of this question, but as he was out 
               <br />
               of the House he thought his important agen- 
               <br />
               cy in bringing about what was now to be ac- 
               <br />
               complished, should be recognized and avowed 
               <br />
               in this public manner. (Hear, hear) He re- 
               <br />
               gretted with his hon. friend from Lambton 
               <br />
               that some reference had not been made to 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman by the mover, and still 
               <br />
               more by the seconder of these resolutions, for 
               <br />
               they must all know what the relations of that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman had been to Mr. Brown at the 
               <br />
               outset and throughout the most of his public 
               <br />
               career. He had been the protege and follower 
               <br />
               of Mr. Brown, not only in this matter, but in 
               <br />
               nearly every other political movement in 
               <br />
               which he had been engaged. Under these cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances it would have come well from that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman to have uttered some few 
               <br />
               words of acknowledgment of the services of 
               <br />
               his great leader in connection with this sub-
