               but by almost every writer who had des- 
               <br />
               cribed it, the Dominion had, indeed, made 
               <br />
               a most advantageous bargain. But, as he 
               <br />
               had said, to make the bargain valuable, im- 
               <br />
               mediate steps must be taken to secure the 
               <br />
               opening up of that region. Another point 
               <br />
               of considerable importance had reference to 
               <br />
               the treatment of the Indians in this ter- 
               <br />

               the peace of that section, it was to be feared 
               <br />
               that with the advance of civilization there 
               <br />
               would be a repetition of those horrible scenes 
               <br />
               of rapine and butchery which had marked 
               <br />
               frontier life in the Western States. Now, this 
               <br />
               must by all means be avoided. Not only must 
               <br />
               the country be settled, but the settlers must be 
               <br />
               protected at the public expense in some way or 
               <br />
               other (cheers). To show that he had long held 
               <br />
               these views, the hon. gentleman quoted from 
               <br />
               some of his speeches in 1865, at the time of 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst Confederation campaign. The country 
               <br />
               he represented was one of the ﬁrst which car- 
               <br />
               ried a vote in favour of Confederation. He 
               <br />
               thought it an honour they had taken that 
               <br />
               stand; and he knew they would be gratified 
               <br />
               to learn that he had in no respect altered his 
               <br />
               opinions regarding that great change. Address- 
               <br />
               ing his constituents in February, 1865, he said:
