               Mr. Grant: I am sure we only express the 
               <br />
               unanimous feeling of this House, when I say 
               <br />
               that we have listened with very great interest 
               <br />
               to the present debate. The hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               who have entered so lively into this discus- 
               <br />
               sion, are veterans in such matters, and as a 
               <br />
               junior member I would claim the indulgence 
               <br />
               of this House, while taking part in the debate.

               After the able and well-timed articles on the 
               <br />
               subject of the “Northwest Territory,” which 
               <br />
               have eliminated from the various Dominion

               intention to occupy the valuable time of this 
               <br />
               House by any lengthened remarks. As the 
               <br />
               subject is by far the most important which 
               <br />
               has turned up for consideration for many 
               <br />
               years past, I feel it a duty to my constituents 
               <br />
               to offer a few observations. Step by step since

               <br />
               to trace the progress of Union on this British

               North American continent. The historic details 
               <br />
               of this Northwest Territory, so long in questio

               vexata from the charter of Charles II 
               <br />
               to the present time, including the various 
               <br />
               treaties of St. Germain, Ryswick, Utrecht, 
               <br />
               and treaty of Paris, the whole subject of

               transference and boundary has been so well 
               <br />
               and ably defined by our delegates, Sir George 
               <br />
               E. Cartier and Hon. Wm. McDougall. No point 
               <br />
               of interest appears to have escaped their close 
               <br />
               scrutiny and searching enquiry. As the result 
               <br />
               of their labours, we are in possession of the

               terms of Lord Granville, concerning this ter-

               question arises for discussion—Are we to

               <br />
               of sale, we naturally are led to enquire into
