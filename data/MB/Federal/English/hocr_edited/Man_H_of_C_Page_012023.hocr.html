               had been treated with all courtesy. His com- 
               <br />
               plaints of the Dominion Act might, for a 
               <br />
               time, have been querulous and declamatory, 
               <br />
               but he had been treated with courtesy and 
               <br />
               respect by both sides, and so far he had 
               <br />
               no thing to complain of. But he certainly did 
               <br />
               expect some hon. gentlemen on the Opposition 
               <br />
               benches to have arisen and said that Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia had been hardly used, that there was 
               <br />
               good ground for the excitement in that Prov- 
               <br />
               ince, and to have sympathised with him in 
               <br />
               his efforts on behalf of that Province, not to 
               <br />
               the extent, perhaps, of releasing Nova Scotians 
               <br />
               from this political arrangement. What took 
               <br />
               place during the second part of the session 
               <br />
               he did not know, for he was not in the House 
               <br />
               then, but during the time he was present, his 
               <br />
               cause received so little sympathy from the 
               <br />
               member for Lambton, or his party, that he 
               <br />
               (Mr. Howe) did not feel at all trammelled as 
               <br />
               to which side of the House he would sit on 
               <br />
               hereafter. The hon. gentleman then detailed 
               <br />
               his subsequent agitation for repeal. How he 
               <br />
               spent nine months in England, backed by 
               <br />
               petitions from 30,000 people. How the Act 
               <br />
               passed in spite of every remonstrance. How, 
               <br />
               on his return to Nova Scotia, so strong was 
               <br />
               the dislike to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />Confederation, that during the 
               <br />
               election the Unionists were almost completely 
               <br />
               swept out of political existence. How, along 
               <br />
               with others, he subsequently went to England 
               <br />
               to induce the Imperial authorities to recon- 
               <br />
               sider the question of Repeal. How, when the 
               <br />
               question came up in the House of Lords, 
               <br />
               only two out of 400 spoke in favour of it, 
               <br />
               while in the House of Commons only 87 could 
               <br />
               be found to favour, not the repeal of the Act, 
               <br />
               but the enquiry into its workings. How, under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, he returned to his home 
               <br />
               feeling convinced that repeal was hopeless; 
               <br />
               but not before warning the British Minister 
               <br />
               that one result would be the generation of 
               <br />
               an annexation feeling, as the member for 
               <br />
               Lambton had asserted that an annexation 
               <br />
               feeling had sprung up. It was not to be 
               <br />
               attributed to his changed position, but a 
               <br />
               feeling of soreness on account of the treat- 
               <br />
               ment received from the British Government. 
               <br />
               He had not succeeded in his mission. What 
               <br />
               then was he to do? To sit down and do 
               <br />
               nothing? The member for Lambton seemed to 
               <br />
               think that he (Mr. Howe) would escape from 
               <br />
               the public position he had assumed. But he 
               <br />
               had been elected. His constituents and coun- 
               <br />
               trymen looked to him for advice and action. 
               <br />
               What was he to do? To go screaming out for 
               <br />
               repeal? To advise the people to break the 
               <br />
               laws, and resist the power and authority of 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government? He would not un- 
               <br />
               dertake to say what he would have done had 
               <br />
               he the power, (hear, hear), but the power
