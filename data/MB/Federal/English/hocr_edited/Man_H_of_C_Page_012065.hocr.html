               Sir George E. <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cartier</span> desired to relieve the

               hon. member for Chateauguay of the too 
               <br />
               heavy current sympathy which threatened to 
               <br />
               drown the heart and affections of that hon. 
               <br />
               member. The Patent Bill had been carried 
               <br />
               through Committee by him (Sir George 
               <br />
               Cartier) simply because his hon. colleague 
               <br />
               happened to be absent when the Bill was sent 
               <br />
               in from the Senate. It was to be hoped this 
               <br />
               explanation would prevent the noble heart of 
               <br />
               the member for Chateauguay from throbbing 
               <br />
               needlessly. (Laughter.) The hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               amid roars of laughter, went into what he 
               <br />
               called physiology or bumpology to sustain his 
               <br />
               position, and expressed the hope that he had 
               <br />
               thereby relieved the member for Chateauguay 
               <br />
               in his dolorous sympathy.

               Mr. Mackenzie thought the member for

               Chateauguay unjust towards the Minister of 
               <br />
               Militia, as it was well known that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman was always ready for any description 
               <br />
               of business on the shortest notice. (Laughter). 
               <br />
               He was like a well-known English statesman, 
               <br />
               who pressed himself as ready to take com-

               <br />
               govern England. (Laughter). As for the 
               <br />
               measure before the House, it would, perhaps, 
               <br />
               have been better had it been conducted 
               <br />
               through by the Minister of Public Works, 
               <br />

               <br />
               believe that there was something else meant 
               <br />
               than a <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">mere</span> expression of sympathy. For 
               <br />
               himself, he was not conscious that there was 
               <br />
               any occasion for the expression of sympathy. 
               <br />
               His relations with his colleagues had been of

               <br />
               ready to share with his colleagues. As to the 
               <br />
               North-West acquisition, he thought he was 
               <br />

               were conducted by that hon. gentleman, as
