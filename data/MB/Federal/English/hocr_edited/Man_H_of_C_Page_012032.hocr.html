               ment by the addition to the Confederation of 
               <br />
               British Columbia and Vancouver’s Island. We 
               <br />
               had heard lately the great boast of our neigh- 
               <br />
               bours over the completion of their Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway, which was 3,400 miles from the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc to New York. When our Confederation 
               <br />
               was complete, British capitalists would prob- 
               <br />
               ably turn their attention to bringing to 
               <br />
               England the trades of the east by a railway 
               <br />
               through British territory, which from the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc to Quebec would be only 2,200 miles 
               <br />
               in length—a saving of 1,200 miles, as com- 
               <br />
               pared with the Paciﬁc Line just opened. With 
               <br />
               this great territory at our disposal, it would 
               <br />
               be a matter for us to consider whether we 
               <br />
               should not devote a portion of it to encourage 
               <br />
               capitalists to undertake that railway. He did 
               <br />
               not say what was the policy of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment on that matter. They had not yet 
               <br />
               adopted a policy with regard to it. But so 
               <br />
               soon as this address was passed, the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment would introduce a measure to establish 
               <br />
               a Provincial Government in that great 
               <br />
               country, as the English Government might 
               <br />
               issue the proclamation giving effect to our 
               <br />
               address before this Parliament met again. It 
               <br />
               was important that not a month or day should 
               <br />
               be lost, after the territory became ours, in 
               <br />
               organizing a Government and having the 
               <br />
               lands surveyed, and their character made 
               <br />
               known throughout this country and Europe. 
               <br />
               It was a consoling idea to himself and the 
               <br />
               member for Lambton, if not to the President 
               <br />
               of the Council, that very soon all that was 
               <br />
               contemplated by the British America Act 
               <br />
               would be accomplished. He did not think it 
               <br />
               likely that any more would be heard about 
               <br />
               annexation. If it were possible to conceive 
               <br />
               such a thing brought about, all the money we 
               <br />
               collected here for the beneﬁt and support of 
               <br />
               the Dominion Government, and to pay the 
               <br />
               subsidies to the different Provinces, would be 
               <br />
               sent to Washington to be jobbed away there; 
               <br />
               and he hoped we would hear no more about 
               <br />
               independence either, for independence was 
               <br />
               merely a project to serve as a cover to an- 
               <br />
               nexation. He had been called an enemy to the 
               <br />
               acquisition of the North West Territory. This 
               <br />
               was not the case. All he had opposed was its 
               <br />
               being annexed to Upper Canada. He believed 
               <br />
               he had now the support of all his hon. friends 
               <br />
               from Quebec, in going heartily for acquiring 
               <br />
               that territory. In conclusion, he stated that 
               <br />
               he had made a mistake, the other day, in 
               <br />
               announcing that there was some despatches 
               <br />
               which had not been brought down. He found 
               <br />
               that they had all been laid before the House. 
               <br />
               The gallant baronet resumed his seat amidst 
               <br />
               cheers, having spoken for an hour and a half.
