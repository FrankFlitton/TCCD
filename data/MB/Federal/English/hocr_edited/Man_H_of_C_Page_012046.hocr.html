               proached. 1st. The old route of the Hudson’s

               Bay Company, via Fort York, on the Hudson’s 
               <br />
               Bay, which, owing to the short period of open 
               <br />
               navigation, is limited to once a year travel. 
               <br />
               2nd. The route, via Lake Superior, open on 
               <br />
               the average about 7 months in summer and 
               <br />

               <br />
               States, via St. Paul, open the whole year. For 
               <br />
               practical purposes the ﬁrst may be considered 
               <br />
               as requiring no discussion. The other two, 
               <br />
               however, are worthy of the closest investiga- 
               <br />
               tion. Taking Toronto as a starting point, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the route to Fort Garry, Red River, 
               <br />
               via Lake Superior, is 1,069 miles, while be- 
               <br />
               tween the same points, via the United States 
               <br />
               and St. Paul, the distance is 1,572 miles. Here 
               <br />
               we have a direct route through our own coun- 
               <br />
               try to commence with, and by water com- 
               <br />
               munication of 839 miles. This route will afford 
               <br />
               the cheapest mode of transport known for 
               <br />
               fully three-fourths of the distance. To the 
               <br />
               great saving of time and cost in furnishing 
               <br />
               the Red River District with supplies, must 
               <br />
               be added the difference between the cheap 
               <br />
               markets of Canada, and the dear markets of 
               <br />
               the United States, and with prohibitory and 
               <br />
               protective tariffs. To Canadian merchants a 
               <br />
               good market will here be secured, not only 
               <br />
               to the settlers in British territory, but also a 
               <br />
               share of the trade will thus inevitably be 
               <br />
               secured in the United States settlements of 
               <br />
               Northern Minnesota, and thus we will be 
               <br />
               enabled to return the compliment by a re- 
               <br />
               action in an opposite direction to that prac-

               The expense of conveying a ton of goods 
               <br />

               <br />
               St. Paul, is from $90 to $100. By a moderate 
               <br />
               outlay, Mr. Dawson has estimated that this 
               <br />

               to me that the formal acquisition of this
