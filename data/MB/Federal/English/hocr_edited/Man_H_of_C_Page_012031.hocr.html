               ton had, in a large measure, lost the sea 
               <br />
               trade, and was not growing. The population 
               <br />
               of New England was hardly increasing at all. 
               <br />
               The population of the State of New York, out- 
               <br />

               States ever had maintained; but what we 
               <br />
               wanted hitherto had been the prairie element. 
               <br />
               Under the measure now submitted we would 
               <br />
               have that element. We would have, like the

               Sir George E. Cartier resumed his remarks 
               <br />
               on the North-West resolutions. He said for the 
               <br />
               last 15 or 20 years the principal increase of 
               <br />
               population of the United States had been in 
               <br />
               the Western States. Within a few months we 
               <br />
               would be in possession of a prairie territory 
               <br />
               equal to that of the United States, and as the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, were a population of pro-<br />
               ducing people, their natural increase would 
               <br />
               rapidly Ô¨Åll up our western territory. We might 
               <br />
               look very soon for the admission of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land. British Columbia was ready to come in, 
               <br />
               therefore, with the acquisition of the North 
               <br />
               West. We might say we had completed our 
               <br />
               territorial organization. Who could foretell the 
               <br />
               future before us? Was it too much to expect 
               <br />
               that in ten years we would have doubled our 
               <br />
               population from natural increase? and taking 
               <br />
               into account the immigration that would be 
               <br />
               attracted, we might in ten years be a popula- 
               <br />
               tion of ten millions. The increase of trade 
               <br />
               would be correspondingly vast. Then we 
               <br />
               would have an increase to the maritime ele-
