               dedly opposed to the loss by Newfoundland 
               <br />
               of the public lands. The British North Amer- 
               <br />
               ica Act provided that the public lands of 
               <br />
               each of the Provinces which were by that

               Act united should be retained by those prov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Act in that respect was unquestionable.
