               Mr. Simpson (Algoma) moved the adoption 
               <br />
               of the Address. On looking round him he saw

               so many in every way better qualiﬁed for the 
               <br />
               task he had undertaken that he felt keenly

               his own inability; but he trusted that the

               same kindness which had been extended to 
               <br />

               tended to him on this. With the opening

               paragraphs of the Speech few hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               would, he believed, differ. He would desire 
               <br />
               more particularly to allude to the acquisition 
               <br />
               of the Hudson’s Bay Territory. They could 
               <br />
               not go into a single railway station without 
               <br />
               ﬁnding crowds of emigrants, some of them 
               <br />
               the young men of the country, who were 
               <br />
               going to ﬁnd their home in the Western 
               <br />
               States which the Dominion had not to offer. 
               <br />
               Hence, it was a subject of profound congrat- 
               <br />
               ulation that these negotiations had been car- 
               <br />
               ried on and completed, and that there could 
               <br />
               be now opened up to emigration a Territory 
               <br />
               offering far greater advantages than any por- 
               <br />
               tion of the United States. It was high time 
               <br />
               this Hudson’s Bay difficulty should be sur— 
               <br />
               mounted; for if Canada did not take hold of 
               <br />
               that country at once, in the course of a few 
               <br />
               years she would be squatted out. Minnesota 
               <br />
               and Dacotah were rapidly ﬁlling up, bringing 
               <br />
               the tide of immigration to the very borders 
               <br />
               of that North West Territory. He had lived 
               <br />
               some time in that section, and believed that 
               <br />
               its opening up and access to it by way of 
               <br />
               Canada would be an immense boom to the 
               <br />
               farming population of this Continent—as well 
               <br />
               as Europe. He knew the hardships endured
