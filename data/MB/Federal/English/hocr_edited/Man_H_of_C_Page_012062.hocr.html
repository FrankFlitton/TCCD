               the exuberant anxiety which prevailed on 
               <br />
               the other side of the line to regulate the af- 
               <br />
               fairs of all other nations. It was said the 
               <br />
               British Parliament had discussed the conduct 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Parliament with reference to 
               <br />
               the Militia Bill. That was true, and he must 
               <br />
               say he felt indignant at the tone of remark 
               <br />
               which was then indulged in. But it should be 
               <br />
               remembered that the British Parliament had 
               <br />
               an interest in that question, for if we did not 
               <br />
               provide for the defence of the country it de- 
               <br />
               volved on them to do so. In conclusion he 
               <br />
               again argued that this Parliament had no time 
               <br />
               to waste on a matter foreign to it. They had 
               <br />
               just acquired the North-West, and had to con- 
               <br />
               sider how they were to govern it. They had 
               <br />
               got the elephant and must Ô¨Ånd out how to 
               <br />
               feed him. There were never 181 gentlemen 
               <br />
               assembled together as a representative body 
               <br />
               who had more responsible duties to discharge, 
               <br />
               and the duties which really belonged to them 
               <br />
               were quite sufficient to engross all their at- 
               <br />
               tention.

               Mr. Blake, referring to the argument of the 
               <br />
               President of the Council, that this Parliament 
               <br />
               had so much on its hands that it could not 
               <br />
               expend time in discussing a question of this 
               <br />
               kind, said if they looked to the period of the 
               <br />
               Session at which they had arrived, and that 
               <br />
               the Government had as yet brought to the 
               <br />
               stage of discussion hardly any of their more 
               <br />
               important measures, the argument was merely 
               <br />
               an evasion. They were said to be within a 
               <br />
               fortnight of their prorogation, and the elec- 
               <br />
               tion Bill had not as yet been so much as 
               <br />
               printed. As regards the North West negotia- 
               <br />
               tions, they had been brought before the House 
               <br />
               at so late a period that Parliament had not 
               <br />
               yet been asked to deal with the question, 
               <br />
               which the hon. gentleman had alluded to, of 
               <br />
               how the North West was to be governed. Cer- 
               <br />
               tainly the measures of the Government were 
               <br />
               not so forward as to admit the excuse that 
               <br />
               Parliament had not time to discuss this ques- 
               <br />
               <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion.</span> Then it was asked by the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice would England so interfere with us; 
               <br />
               and the answer had already been given that 
               <br />
               England did interfere with us, and that not by 
               <br />
               an address from its Parliament, but by a des- 
               <br />
               patch from a Secretary or Under-Secretary of 
               <br />
               State, which was held sufficient to reverse the 
               <br />
               vote of this full Parliament, and to convert a 
               <br />
               majority of 136 in one session into a minority 
               <br />
               of 60 the next session. The President of Coun-

               cil said the conduct of the British Parliament, 
               <br />
               in discussing the proceedings of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Parliament with reference to the Militia Bill, 
               <br />
               was excusable, because they had an interest
