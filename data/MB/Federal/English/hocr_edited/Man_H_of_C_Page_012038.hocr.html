               Hon. Mr. McDougall explained that accord-

               ing to Article 6, it would be observed that the

               Company might defer the exercise of this for 
               <br />
               ten years, but they did so subject to the con- 
               <br />
               dition that they must take their land from 
               <br />
               that remaining unsold at the time. What would 
               <br />
               be the result? Sooner than wait till the best of 
               <br />

               Hon. Mr. McDougall said that the Company 
               <br />
               proposed an arrangement by which they hoped

               Mr. Mackenzie merely desired to point out 
               <br />
               these things as blemishes which might have 
               <br />
               been avoided. With regard to the settlement of 
               <br />
               the country, that was a matter so exceedingly 
               <br />
               desirable that he felt disposed to aid the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in every way in order to accomplish 
               <br />
               it. (Cheers.) He considered that it would be 
               <br />
               impracticable to pour a large body of emi- 
               <br />
               grants into that country at once, taking into 
               <br />
               account the lands to be occupied yet in Can- 
               <br />
               ada. But it was always possible to send a vast 
               <br />
               tide of emigration to these great prairies. If we 
               <br />
               are to succeed in populating half the continent 
               <br />
               by emigration from the Old World, as is con- 
               <br />
               templated in this scheme, it must be done by 
               <br />
               opening, as speedily as possible, a road where- 
               <br />
               by emigrants can reach the North West by 
               <br />
               way of the head of Lake Superior. With our 
               <br />
               population and country, he believed it would 
               <br />
               be impossible to absorb more than a certain 
               <br />
               proportion every year, until we reached that 
               <br />
               country; but once having reached that point, 
               <br />
               he believed we would be able to fill up as fast 
               <br />
               as the territories were ﬁlled up by our Re- 
               <br />
               publican neighbours. The hon. gentleman pro- 
               <br />
               ceeded to allude to the numbers leaving Can- 
               <br />
               ada annually—the surplusage of their popula- 
               <br />
               tion and expressed the belief that they would 
               <br />
               as soon as a road were opened go to people 
               <br />
               this great North West. As to a railroad to that 
               <br />
               section, it was not, as the Commissioner 
               <br />
               thought, impracticable, for he (Mr. Mackenzie) 
               <br />
               believed a good line might be constructed 
               <br />
               along the Ottawa Valley and behind the divid- 
               <br />
               ing ridge to the Lake Superior section and 
               <br />
               thence to Fort Garry. (Hear, hear.) He looked 
               <br />
               upon the acquisition of this territory as one 
               <br />
               of the most important transactions affecting 
               <br />
