               requiring a formal vote of the House for every 
               <br />
               expenditure. The ﬁrst item in the Estimates 
               <br />
               for the current year, which was new, was 
               <br />
               $3,000 for the Administration of Justice. It 
               <br />
               was asked lest the Department might ﬁnd 
               <br />
               itself short before the 30th of June next. The 
               <br />
               next item, $20,000 additional for the mainte- 
               <br />
               nance of the Penitentiary at Kingston, was a 
               <br />
               new vote, occasioned by a variety of circum- 
               <br />
               stances already explained. The next two 
               <br />
               items, for the Rockwood Asylum and the New 
               <br />
               Brunswick Penitentiary, were included in the 
               <br />
               expenditure already laid before the House. 
               <br />
               Some of the items connected with the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of the St. John Penitentiary were 
               <br />
               chargeable against New Brunswick, and the 
               <br />
               amount expended for the maintenance of the 
               <br />
               local prisoners was properly chargeable 
               <br />
               against the Administration of Justice; but 
               <br />
               the Dominion required to advance money to 
               <br />
               meet these amounts, and the Government 
               <br />
               considered that even though these sums were 
               <br />
               to be charged to New Brunswick, that still 
               <br />
               a specific vote should be asked for their 
               <br />
               expenditure from the Dominion. The next 
               <br />
               item was $3,590. In the detailed estimates 
               <br />
               that amount had been omitted altogether, 
               <br />
               partly in consequence of the representations 
               <br />
               of the member for Lunenburg. Last year we 
               <br />
               reduced the expenditure, but we had not 
               <br />
               been able to dispense altogether with some 
               <br />
               of the officers. The next item, for Emigra- 
               <br />
               tion and Quarantine, was occasioned by ad- 
               <br />
               ditional eﬁorts made in Europe to induce 
               <br />
               emigration, a gentleman having been spe- 
               <br />
               cially sent there, and other steps having been 
               <br />
               taken. The four items under the next head, 
               <br />
               Public Works, have been included in the re- 
               <br />
               turns already before the House in the nine 
               <br />
               months’ expenditure. The $98,000 for the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway was already in hand. 
               <br />
               The items for the repair of the steamer Druid 
               <br />
               was as now, and also that following for 
               <br />
               Lighthouse and Coast service. Under the 
               <br />
               head Civil Government, there was $3,700 to 
               <br />
               provide for the salaries of certain Deputy- 
               <br />
               heads and the Secretary of the Treasury 
               <br />
               Board, part of whose salaries had hitherto 
               <br />
               been charged to separate services, and in 
               <br />
               lieu of such separate payments the House 
               <br />
               was aware that the salaries of Messrs. Tru- 
               <br />
               deau, Grifﬁn, Bouchette and Langton had been 
               <br />
               made up in separate ways, partly out of 
               <br />
               Customs, Excise and Stamps; partly out of 
               <br />
               inspection of railways and partly out of the 
               <br />
               Civil Service Board, in addition to their nor- 
               <br />
               mal salaries. The sum now mentioned was in 
               <br />
               full of all their services. The next item, Col- 
               <br />
               lection of Revenue from Public Works, was at 
               <br />
               the disposal of the Commissioner in 1868, but 
               <br />
               was paid in the course of the current year.
