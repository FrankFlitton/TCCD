               Mr. Mackenzie desired to take the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of obtaining an explanation from the 
               <br />
               Ministry regarding the recent accession to 
               <br />
               their ranks, in the person of the President of 
               <br />
               the Council. He had been unwilling to ask 
               <br />
               those explanations hitherto, because for some 
               <br />
               time that hon. gentleman was not in his place, 
               <br />
               and when he did take his seat was obviously 
               <br />
               not in the best possible trim for giving the 
               <br />
               required explanations. But before entering on 
               <br />
               the important subject before them, it was 
               <br />
               quite evident that the House ought to be fur- 
               <br />
               nished with a statement of the circumstances 
               <br />
               which had induced the hon. member for Hants 
               <br />
               to enter the Cabinet. It would be remembered 
               <br />
               that last year the President of the Council, 
               <br />
               then sitting on the Opposition side of the 
               <br />
               House, took very strong grounds against the 
               <br />
               acquisition of the North West Territory. 
               <br />
               Speaking, as he then said, not from a purely 
               <br />
               Nova Scotian point of view, but from a Can- 
               <br />
               adian aspect, the hon. gentleman advanced 
               <br />
               very strong reasons for taking that position— 
               <br />
               reasons which ought to exclude the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman from holding ofﬁce in any govern- 
               <br />
               ment proposing to deal with this subject, as 
               <br />
               the present administration proposed to do. 
               <br />
               And when so radical a change had taken 
               <br />
               place in the character of the government, or 
               <br />
               the position of the hon. gentleman joining 
               <br />
               them, it was due to the House that some ex- 
               <br />
               planations should be given. There was another 
               <br />
               point to which he also wished to direct at- 
               <br />
               tention, and that was that the Government 
               <br />
               had not yet given the House an opportunity 
               <br />
               of pronouncing on the new terms made with 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. Had they done so, he would 
               <br />
               before this have asked for the explanations. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman might recollect that on 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor of that House, he contended that 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia had been despoiled of half a mil- 
               <br />
               lion dollars by the Union Act. He stated, while 
               <br />
               it was a matter of concern that these revenues 
               <br />
               should be taken by Canada under an enforced 
               <br />
               Union, that was nothing compared with the 
               <br />
               other outrage that she had been robbed of her 
               <br />
               liberties. It was certainly due to the country 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman should state how it 
               <br />
               was that, having held and uttered such senti- 
               <br />
               ments, he subsequently became a member of 
               <br />
               the Government which was not only respon- 
               <br />
               sible for the initiation of that robbery, but for 
               <br />
