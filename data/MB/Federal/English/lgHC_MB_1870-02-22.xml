     22 février 1870 DÉBATES DES COMMUNES 131 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
   
            <p>
    [...] plimented the hon. member for Cumberland 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Dr. Tupper) who had with grave dignity 
     <lb/>
     read the hon. member for Sherbrooke out of his 
     <lb/>
     party. But the Hon. Minister of Militia, on 
     <lb/>
     whose breath the government could be turned 
     <lb/>
     out, had in his statesmanlike speech said that 
     <lb/>
     he had no objection to the views of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Sherbrooke on the subject of in<lb break="no"/>dependence, though he did not want to place 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman in a position favourable to any 
     <lb/>
     movement—Fenian movement he might say-<lb/>towards independence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Sir George-É. Cartier</persName> said he did not 
     <lb/>
     expect any Fenian movement on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member; as for the Fenians, his volunteers 
     <lb/>
     would take care of them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">Hon. Mr. Huntington</persName> said the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Militia had said the subject of independence 
     <lb/>
     should not be taken up by this Parliament, and 
     <lb/>
     apart from that he would be delighted to have 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Sherbrooke for his col<lb break="no"/>league. He would ask the Hon. Finance Minis<lb break="no"/>ter and the hon. member for Cumberland, if he 
     <lb/>
     was to be ruined and degraded because he had 
     <lb/>
     expressed an independent opinion. The 
     <lb/>
     member for Cumberland had attempted to 
     <lb/>
     make a gulf between the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Sherbrooke and his party. He (Mr. Hunting<lb break="no"/>ton) went on to charge the Government with 
     <lb/>
     slowness in proceeding with Confederation. He 
     <lb/>
     had not been an ardent confederationist, but he 
     <lb/>
     had accepted it and become anxious for its 
     <lb/>
     success, but the Government had not adopted 
     <lb/>
     measures for Confederation in Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     the North-West, which the exigencies of the 
     <lb/>
     public service demanded. He had been aware a 
     <lb/>
     year or two ago, that disaffection existed at 
     <lb/>
     Red River among the half-breeds, and that they 
     <lb/>
     were afraid Canada was about to absorb their 
     <lb/>
     lands. He had been told that deputations had 
     <lb/>
     been sent to Fort Garry, to demand from the 
     <lb/>
     Governor an explanation, in order to know if 
     <lb/>
     their Territory was to be ceded to Canada. He 
     <lb/>
     did not know how much truth there was in all 
     <lb/>
     this, but he considered that it surely must have 
     <lb/>
     come to the ear of the Government. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Cumberland had visited the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and had ascertained in four days what the 
     <lb/>
     government did not know before that time, 
     <lb/>
     that there was disaffection, and he almost sym<lb break="no"/>pathized with the insurgents on account of the 
     <lb/>
     fairness and justness of the Bill of Rights 
     <lb/>
     which they had formulated. Referring to the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Secretary of State, then President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, he spoke of his affection for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Red River, and his gallantry in repell<lb break="no"/>ing aspersions upon the fairer portion of the 
     <lb/>
     population of that country, (laughter) but con<lb break="no"/>sidered that his presence there was an induce<lb break="no"/><pb n="132" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1870-02-22_Page_0132.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">132</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS DEBATES</fw> <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 22, 1870<lb/></fw>ment for the people to hold out in their 
     <lb/>
     demands. He went on to deprecate any cries of 
     <lb/>
     disloyalty, and said he would not enter upon 
     <lb/>
     the subject. He had no intention of making a 
     <lb/>
     movement in the House on the subject of in<lb break="no"/>dependence, and had advised his friends that it 
     <lb/>
     would be improper and unwise to introduce a 
     <lb/>
     petition to Parliament upon that subject. He 
     <lb/>
     had expressed this opinion before, without 
     <lb/>
     compromising his honourable friends on his 
     <lb/>
     right or on his left. He had thought the grave 
     <lb/>
     question of colonial relations, was a fair one 
     <lb/>
     for discussion in this country, as it was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed on the other side of the Atlantic. He had 
     <lb/>
     studied and discussed this question in a politi<lb break="no"/>cal sense, and as an orator and essayist. It had 
     <lb/>
     been widely discussed in England, and had 
     <lb/>
     called out an authoritative declaration that 
     <lb/>
     colonies, and Canada, when they wanted to go 
     <lb/>
     might do it, and the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     would place no obstructions in the way. He 
     <lb/>
     maintained that a man ought not to be ostra<lb break="no"/>cised because he favored independence. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Finance Minister was the apostle of per<lb break="no"/>petual connection, of perpetual colonial inferi<lb break="no"/>ority, but the time would come when indepen<lb break="no"/>dence would be a practical movement. Some 
     <lb/>
     parties in England—among them the Tory 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Standard</hi>—have recently asserted that the colo<lb break="no"/>nies had too much freedom, and that the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Parliament ought to regulate the tariff and 
     <lb/>
     other matters, so as to bring them more in 
     <lb/>
     consonance with that of the Empire. Would not 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Finance Minister become a mission<lb break="no"/>ary for perpetual unity, and for the restricting, 
     <lb/>
     and the taking away of some of the privileges 
     <lb/>
     for which he had fought in the olden time? He 
     <lb/>
     earnestly desired the success of Confederation,

     should not be forgotten that the whole of this

     <persName ref="pers:HINC1">Hon. Sir Francis Hincks</persName> said there was one

     sentiment of the member for Shefford with 
     <lb/>
     which he cordially agreed, and that was that 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country were thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     loyal, and therefore he felt no danger would 
     <lb/>
     arise from the views of which the gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was the exponent. That gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     referred to the position of inferiority and disa<lb break="no"/>bility under which the Colonies laboured. He 
     <lb/>
     did not believe that we occupied an inferior 
     <lb/>
     position. His strong objeciton to independence 
     <lb/>
     was that it would deprive us of monarchial 
     <lb/>
     institutions. No one would imagine that we 
     <lb/>
     were going to set up a monarchy here, and the 
     <lb/>
     only form of Government we could establish 
     <lb/>
     under independence would be that of our 
     <lb/>
     neighbours in the South, and he was sure they 
     <lb/>
     would agree with him that monarchial institu<lb break="no"/>tions were far superior. We enjoy practically 
     <lb/>
     all the independence any people could desire, 
     <lb/>
     and combined with that, we had the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     these institutions, which he sincerely believed 
     <lb/>
     were the best which any people could possess. 
     <lb/>
     It was idle to try to persuade us that we were 
     <lb/>
     labouring under any disabilities. We were not, 
     <lb/>
     and he sincerely hoped he would never see the 
     <lb/>
     day when any other flag should wave over us 
     <lb/>
     than that of England.

     <lb/>
     into discussion, that it had been discussed a 
     <lb/>
     week in the newspapers (including Sunday, on

     different paragraphs of the Address; but he

     <lb/>
     the one relating to the North-West; he con<lb break="no"/>sidered that question to be the most important

     one at issue. He regretted that the Government 
     <lb/>
     had selected Mr. McDougall as Lieutenant

     Governor of the North-West. When Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Crown Lands he had been sent to the

     <lb/>
     the Indians, and all recollect what trouble and

     <lb/>
     his mission. With this still fresh in their 
     <lb/>

     another choice. The Indian tribes are linked

     what affects the interests of one affects them 
     <lb/>
     all. The name of Mr. McDougall was sufficient 
     <lb/>
     in itself to create an insurrection of the Indian 
     <lb/>
     tribes and the half-breeds inhabiting the 
     <lb/>
     North-West. He believed the Government were 
     <lb/>
     honest and sincere in trying to carry out the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation Government scheme; but they 
     <lb/>
     must regret to-day, as all the members of the 
     <lb/>
     House do, that so unfortunate an appointment 
     <lb/>
     should have been made. The member for 
     <lb/>
     Lanark accused the French Canadian settlers 
     <lb/>
     of having been the first to rise in insurrection, 
     <lb/>
     but the accusation was unfounded. The French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians had proved their loyalty on many 
     <lb/>
     occasions; it was once said by an eminent 
     <lb/>
     statesman, now deceased, that the last shot 
     <lb/>
     which would be fired in Canada in defence of 
     <lb/>
     British interests, would be fired by a French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, and he might add, that the last drop 
     <lb/>
     of blood which would be shed for the same 
     <lb/>
     cause, would be that of a French Canadian. 
     <lb/>
     The Government had made a great mistake in 
     <lb/>
     selecting the member for Lanark, but the evil 
     <lb/>
     could still be remedied. Let the Government 
     <lb/>
     appoint as Lieutenant Governor of the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     West an able, efficient and popular man, let 
     <lb/>
     him be selected irrespective of his nationality, 
     <lb/>
     and let his first duty be to conciliate the Cath<lb break="no"/>olic Clergy who enjoy such an immense power 
     <lb/>
     and influence over their co-religionists. He also 
     <lb/>
     wanted to draw the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that in the House there are members 
     <lb/>
     who are receiving large salaries, for services 
     <lb/>
     rendered as Commissioners; he could not 
     <lb/>
     object to those gentlemen, whom he highly 
     <lb/>
     esteemed, but he thought it was a very bad 
     <lb/>
     precedent.

     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">Mr. Scatcherd</persName> complained that the debate 
     <lb/>
     was not on public questions, but on personal 
     <lb/>
     differences. The reciprocity question, and the 
     <lb/>
     obtaining of a market for the products of the 
     <lb/>
     farmer certainly merited some consideration, 
     <lb/>
     but they had been past by. He had supposed 
     <lb/>
     that the acquisition of the North-West Territo<lb break="no"/>ry, and if acquired, the construction of a rail<lb break="no"/>way to open it up, might surely have engaged 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House, for if the railway 
     <lb/>
     was not built, Canada would be better without 
     <lb/>
     the Territory; the enlarging of the canals, and 
     <lb/>
     improvement of internal navigation, to 
     <lb/>
     increase trade and commerce, were subjects for 
     <lb/>
     discussion of more importance, than whether 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice had kept faith with two 
     <lb/>
     or three gentlemen whom he had admitted to 
     <lb/>
     the Cabinet, and who had themselves deserted 
     <lb/>
     their party to take office. Such matters were of 
     <lb/>
     no importance to any one but themselves. He 
     <lb/>
     held that the question of whether any member 
     <lb/>
     holding views in favor of independence was 
     <lb/>
     loyal, was like arguing whether any one in 
     <lb/>
     favor of Fenianism in Ireland was loyal, the

     difference being only that those in favor of 
     <lb/>
     independence were less dangerous, because 
     <lb/>
     they were not so strong, (hear, hear). If any 
     <lb/>
     one desired annexation, the road was not so 
     <lb/>
     long but that he could go and enjoy its bless<lb break="no"/>ings on American soil (cheers). What was the 
     <lb/>
     use of arguing whether the Finance Minister, 
     <lb/>
     who had been serving his Queen for 15 years, 
     <lb/>
     should be admitted to the Cabinet? It was not 
     <lb/>
     his past they had to look at but his future 
     <lb/>
     conduct. Charges equally strong had been 
     <lb/>
     made against the Ministers of Justice and 
     <lb/>
     Militia, and the member for Sherbrooke, by the 
     <lb/>
     Reform party, as had been made against him, 
     <lb/>
     (Opposition cries of "no, no"), but yet they did 
     <lb/>
     not disdain to enter into coalition with them. 
     <lb/>
     But it has been said the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     had usurped the name of Reformer. If he had 
     <lb/>
     declared himself the leader of the Reform 
     <lb/>
     party in Ontario he must differ from him. The 
     <lb/>
     real leader of the party there is George Brown, 
     <lb/>
     (MacFarlane emphatically, "no, no"). The hon<lb break="no"/>ourable member who said no, was mistaken. He 
     <lb/>
     thought the Finance Minister had done more 
     <lb/>
     for Reform than probably any other man in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and that he did not assume too 
     <lb/>
     much in writing the circular. He saw Banking 
     <lb/>
     measures referred to in the address. He held 
     <lb/>
     the scheme brought before Parliament last ses<lb break="no"/>sion by Mr. Rose was sound, and the best that 
     <lb/>
     had been proposed, and had it come to a vote 
     <lb/>
     he would have supported it. He thought the 
     <lb/>
     people of the North-West had been too severely 
     <lb/>
     condemned for their conduct to the member for 
     <lb/>
     Lanark, for this country had no right to 
     <lb/>
     acquire that territory without consulting the 
     <lb/>
     people. Having done so, he could not see how 
     <lb/>
     they could expect different conduct from them. 
     <lb/>
     An Attorney-General and a Surveyor-General 
     <lb/>
     were taken from Canada, surveys being run 
     <lb/>
     before the land was acquired, than which noth<lb break="no"/>ing could be more odious to the people. All the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces had been consulted before the union, 
     <lb/>
     and so ought Red River. He did not believe that 
     <lb/>
     the few thousand half-breeds should be called 
     <lb/>
     savages, and their interests not consulted. He 
     <lb/>
     intended to deal with the Government and 
     <lb/>
     their measures as they came forward, and not 
     <lb/>
     with them for their past acts.

     the Government was different now from what 
     <lb/>
     it had been last Session. He thought that it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible that the people of Ontario could not 
     <lb/>
     but see that the professions of the Government 
     <lb/>
     had not been carried out, and that the agree<lb break="no"/>ment entered into at the last elections had been 
     <lb/>
     broken. The cry they went to the country with 
     <lb/>
     was that party differences were to be sunk and 
     <lb/>
     that however objectionable the policy of the

     <persName ref="pers:YOUN2">Mr. Young</persName> said that there had been many 
     <lb/>
     deceptions practised, and when they found two 
     <lb/>
     of those who had supported it and had been 
     <lb/>
     within the Ministry, were now on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     the House in opposition, it seemed pretty clear 
     <lb/>
     proof that some deception had been practised. 
     <lb/>
     It seemed to him that the true point was 
     <lb/>
     whether the Government were to go to the 
     <lb/>
     country on the ground of a certain representa<lb break="no"/>tion of the Liberal party in the Cabinet, and 
     <lb/>
     then not to carry out the agreement. They 
     <lb/>
     might write over the portals of the Cabinet, as 
     <lb/>
     a caution to those Liberals who entered it, the 
     <lb/>
     warning, ,"Let those abandon hope who enter 
     <lb/>
     here." If it could be shown that any of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Government hampered Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McDougall's entrance to the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tory, or in any way raised obstacles, directly or 
     <lb/>
     indirectly, to the peaceable acquisition of the 
     <lb/>
     country, then that Minister had lost the right 
     <lb/>
     to a seat in the Cabinet. He did object strongly 
     <lb/>
     to the false faith which had been kept by the 
     <lb/>
     Government to the Liberals of Ontario. With 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Finance Minister, he was not 
     <lb/>
     acquainted with the gentleman before he left 
     <lb/>
     the country; but he was acquainted with his 
     <lb/>
     history, and he knew of his ability. But when 
     <lb/>
     his old friends saw the manner in which he 
     <lb/>
     entered the Cabinet, when not a single member 
     <lb/>
     of the Government had said that he was 
     <lb/>
     pleased with the entrance of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man into the Cabinet, they would not consider 
     <lb/>
     that his entry had been worthy of approval; 
     <lb/>
     and if he only obtained the approval of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ferguson, he did not think his influence would 
     <lb/>
     amount to much. He held in his hand the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the Minister of Justice on the vote of 
     <lb/>
     the House of want of confidence against the 
     <lb/>
     present Minister of Finance, in which he said 
     <lb/>
     that in his Government he had more Walpoles 
     <lb/>
     than Pitts, and it had debauched the moral 
     <lb/>
     sense of the country, besides having question<lb break="no"/>able transactions in the public property. He

     happy to hear those charges denied, but they 
     <lb/>
     had not been successfully cleared up; and yet it 
     <lb/>
     was to such a man that Sir John A. Macdonald 
     <lb/>
     had entrusted the most important part of the 
     <lb/>
     public service. He could not but apply to him in 
     <lb/>
     that office the quotation of Mr. Baldwin, that 
     <lb/>
     "Confidence was a plant of slow growth; when 
     <lb/>
     once it was broken, it was difficult to restore 
     <lb/>
     it." Then, with regard to the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, they had violated the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion in their grant to Nova Scotia; and the 
     <lb/>
     Ontario Legislature had passed resolutions 
     <lb/>
     asking that Imperial legislation might be taken 
     <lb/>
     which would prevent such acts in the future, 
     <lb/>
     and there was no doubt that the example 
     <lb/>
     would be attempted to be followed by the other 
     <lb/>
     Provinces at present in the Confederation. This 
     <lb/>
     would account in some measure for the dis<lb break="no"/>turbances at Red River. The conduct of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Cumberland, in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     grant to Nova Scotia, was answered, and he 
     <lb/>
     thought that if a different course had been 
     <lb/>
     pursued in regard to this matter, the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that had been experienced in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Prince Edward Island would have 
     <lb/>
     been overcome. He was astonished to find that 
     <lb/>
     the Government had taken credit for economi<lb break="no"/>cal management of the Dominion; and he was 
     <lb/>
     astonished even more to hear the hon. mover of 
     <lb/>
     the Address refer to it. He would like to know 
     <lb/>
     where the economy of the Government was to 
     <lb/>
     be found. Was it in the creation of new Cabinet 
     <lb/>
     officials, and in the way the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way was being managed? He was afraid that 
     <lb/>
     instead of economy the very opposite course 
     <lb/>
     had been pursued. The public debt of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, after payment of the expenses con<lb break="no"/>templated, would amount to $120,000,000, and 
     <lb/>
     would entail a heavy taxation of the country. If 
     <lb/>
     they put the same duties upon articles entering 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion as the Americans did, they 
     <lb/>
     would be in fact cutting off their noses because 
     <lb/>
     the Americans did theirs. (Laughter.) He 
     <lb/>
     would go for any national policy which would 
     <lb/>
     benefit Canada; but he did not approve of a 
     <lb/>
     tariff which would place them in the same 
     <lb/>
     position as America.

     <lb/>
     had it been made in Parliament he would have 
     <lb/>
     nailed it at once. He now took the earliest 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of stating, in his place in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, that the report to which he referred was 
     <lb/>
     false and a base calumny, (hear, hear). It had 
     <lb/>
     been stated that when Mr. Provencher was 
     <lb/>
     sent to meet the insurgents he held a conversa<lb break="no"/>tion with them at River Sale, and they then 
     <lb/>
     told him that they were encouraged by mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government at Ottawa, and his 
     <lb/>
     (Langevin's) name was used. Out of the whole 
     <lb/>
     population of the North-West he knew only 
     <lb/>
     three individuals, Governor McTavish, Vicar- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     General Thibault, and Colonel De Salaberry. 
     <lb/>
     Colonel De Salaberry and Revd. Mr. Thibault 
     <lb/>
     were in Canada at that time, so that the only 
     <lb/>
     one then in the territory that he knew was 
     <lb/>
     Governor McTavish, who was reported at that 
     <lb/>
     time to be on his death bed. The only communi<lb break="no"/>cation he had ever held with Mr. McTavish was 
     <lb/>
     at Ottawa, in presence of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Militia and the member for North Lanark. He 
     <lb/>
     had never communicated either directly or in<lb break="no"/>directly by himself or by any one else with any 
     <lb/>
     one in the North-West on any matter whatever. 
     <lb/>
     If he could have been guilty of violation of his 
     <lb/>
     oath of office, as this charge implied, he would 
     <lb/>
     never have been where he is, nor should he 
     <lb/>
     occupy the position he now holds. He felt 
     <lb/>
     strongly on this point because the charge was a 
     <lb/>
     serious and malicious one and had been made 
     <lb/>
     when he could not at the time reply to it. The 
     <lb/>
     member for North Lanark had refused to name 
     <lb/>
     whom he referred to in his accusations, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore he would say that his denial applied 
     <lb/>
     also to the statements of that hon. gentleman; 
     <lb/>
     and he would add that he was authorized by 
     <lb/>
     his colleague, Mr. Chapais, to make, in his

     authority, then he would oppose them, and, if 
     <lb/>
     necessary, vote to turn them out of office. 
     <lb/>
     When he had suggested last night that it would 
     <lb/>
     not be prudent to publish all documents just 
     <lb/>
     now, some of the Government supporters had 
     <lb/>
     reported that there was something in them 
     <lb/>
     which he desired to conceal. On the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     there was not one word which he was ashamed 
     <lb/>
     of as a public man, but he had felt it his duty to 
     <lb/>
     place in the hands of the Government all the 
     <lb/>
     information, confidential and otherwise, that 
     <lb/>
     had reached him; and such being the character 
     <lb/>
     of the correspondence in the hands of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, he did not think it would serve public 
     <lb/>
     interests to publish it all at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     With reference to the report concerning the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Public Works which had been 
     <lb/>
     referred to, he would say that when he first 
     <lb/>
     heard that report he denied it as utterly incred<lb break="no"/>ible. He then explained the origin of the story; 
     <lb/>
     how that Mr. Provencher had parleyed with 
     <lb/>
     the insurgents some two or three hours; they 
     <lb/>
     told him the course taken by Mr. Howe when 
     <lb/>
     he was in the Territory, had encouraged them 
     <lb/>
     to revolt; and not only that, but that another 
     <lb/>
     member of the Canadian Government had 
     <lb/>
     ordered them to persist in their demands till 
     <lb/>
     they secured them. Provencher denied this, 
     <lb/>
     and asked for the name. They answered they 
     <lb/>
     could not give the name, but if he would men<lb break="no"/>tion the names of the members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, they would tell him if it was one of them. 
     <lb/>
     Provencher mentioned the names of three 
     <lb/>
     French members of the Cabinet, and they said 
     <lb/>
     he was one of them. He (Mr. McDougall) 
     <lb/>
     denied at the time this statement, and subse<lb break="no"/>quently he thought the solution of the matter 
     <lb/>
     might be found in the fact that the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works had a brother, a high dignitary of 
     <lb/>
     the church, and that, perhaps, in correspond<lb break="no"/>ence with the clergy of the North-West his 
     <lb/>
     name might have been taken among the people 
     <lb/>
     to be that of the honourable Gentleman. He 
     <lb/>
     then went on to read the report of his remarks 
     <lb/>
     last night, as published, showing that all he 
     <lb/>
     had said was that the insurgents relied upon 
     <lb/>
     the Secretary of State for the Provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     some gentleman near him, for assistance. That 
     <lb/>
     statement was strictly correct. They did rely 
     <lb/>
     upon the assistance of these gentlemen, and in 
     <lb/>
     the speech of the Minister of Militia last night 
     <lb/>
     he had argued that there was great justifica<lb break="no"/>tion for those who had taken up arms, and 
     <lb/>
     while he censured the loyal Canadians and 
     <lb/>
     others who were ready to risk their lives in 
     <lb/>
     defence of his own Government, he had not a 
     <lb/>
     word to say in condemnation of those who had 
     <lb/>
     taken up arms to resist his representative; and 
     <lb/>
     when reports of the troubles manufactured by 
     <lb/>
     American sympathisers were published, all 
     <lb/>
     over the country, the Government, though in 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     made to misrepresent the position of affairs, 
     <lb/>
     but he would endeavour to put it in its true 
     <lb/>
     light. The French half-breeds were not the only 
     <lb/>
     residents of the country; there was a large 
     <lb/>
     population there who had no sympathy with 
     <lb/>
     Riel, with disloyalty or annexation. At the 
     <lb/>
     Riviere Sale, at the time of th conference with 
     <lb/>
     Riel, there were 90 men, all French half-breeds, 
     <lb/>
     ready armed, under Mr. Wm. Dease, to contend 
     <lb/>
     with their countrymen in support of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but on account of the position of the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company, whose officers were <hi rendition="simple:italic">hors de 
     <lb/>
     combat</hi>, or winking at Riel's movements, they 
     <lb/>
     disbanded. He was afraid they would find 
     <lb/>
     many persons of influence, if not in the House, 
     <lb/>
     at least in the country, sympathizing with 
     <lb/>
     objects against the interests and wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. The hon. gentleman had provoked 
     <lb/>
     the remark, but it seemed strange that if there 
     <lb/>
     was no sympathy for the insurgents, their 
     <lb/>
     messenger Colonel De Salaberry, fresh from 
     <lb/>
     the offices of these gentlemen, should be found 
     <lb/>
     repeating the slanders about the Manitoulin 
     <lb/>
     Island after his (Mr. McDougall's) back was 
     <lb/>
     turned. Fortunately, some of his party who had 
     <lb/>
     been left behind heard him instilling stories 
     <lb/>
     into the ears of the poor innocent half—breeds, 
     <lb/>
     and poisoning their minds against him. His 
     <lb/>
     words had been taken down, and could be pro<lb break="no"/>duced in evidence to prove the encouragement, 
     <lb/>
     as well as sympathy given them. They should 
     <lb/>
     have sent a missionary of more judgment and 
     <lb/>
     discretion, and one who was urged by other 
     <lb/>
     views and feelings than those of hostility to 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada and its Representa<lb break="no"/>tive in that distant land. He had reason to 
     <lb/>
     complain that he had not met with a hearty 
     <lb/>
     sympathy from some members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but that a desire had been shown to turn 
     <lb/>
     the movement into another direction, than that 
     <lb/>
     to which the people of Canada, French and 
     <lb/>
     English, would, he felt confident, insist it 
     <lb/>
     should take. (Cheers.)

     what it did. There were two subjects of great

     importance to which no reference was made: 
     <lb/>
     the improvement of our Inland Navigation, and 
     <lb/>
     the rearrangement of our fiscal policy, so as to 
     <lb/>
     procure a home market for our products by the

     growing determination for proper legislation is

     rapidly on the increase. The Dominion and

     the manufacturer from the busy hives of indus<lb break="no"/>try, employment must be found for them also, 
     <lb/>
     by a wise national policy. This cannot be done 
     <lb/>
     by breaking down all the barriers of protection 
     <lb/>
     for our own people, and throwing our markets 
     <lb/>
     open as a common, to be used by our neigh<lb break="no"/>bours when it may suit their convenience, who 
     <lb/>
     by hostile tariffs almost entirely preclude us 
     <lb/>
     from their markets. The improvement of our 
     <lb/>
     magnificent chain of inland communication, is 
     <lb/>
     deserving of the most serious consideration, 
     <lb/>
     and no time should be lost in enlarging the St. 
     <lb/>
     Lawrence and Welland Canals, so that Sea<lb break="no"/>going Ships of large dimensions, could dis<lb break="no"/>charge their cargoes in our Lake ports without 
     <lb/>
     previously breaking bulk. In reference to the 
     <lb/>
     question of independence which had been 
     <lb/>
     freely spoken of on the floor of this House by 
     <lb/>
     one or two honourable members, he had a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks to make. He regretted that any senti<lb break="no"/>ments such as he had heard should have been 
     <lb/>
     uttered on the floor of a Canadian Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     The propagation of such sentiments tended to 
     <lb/>
     make the people discontented. We possess in<lb break="no"/>dependence of the most ample form, our laws 
     <lb/>
     and institutions are framed by representatives 
     <lb/>
     of our own choice, we are now an integral 
     <lb/>
     portion of the greatest Empire upon earth, as 
     <lb/>
     much so as London, or Dublin, and as much 
     <lb/>
     entitled to the powerful protection of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire as either of them, (hear, hear). Those 
     <lb/>
     who think we would be made great by such a 
     <lb/>
     change would find out we would be made less. 
     <lb/>
     The independence advocated by the honour<lb break="no"/>able gentleman referred to would be the most 
     <lb/>
     abject slavery (hear, hear), to suppose that a 
     <lb/>
     country like ours with its extended frontier 
     <lb/>
     and populated by four millions of inhabitants, 
     <lb/>
     adjacent to the grasping Republic with forty 
     <lb/>
     millions strongly imbued with the "manifest 
     <lb/>
     destiny doctrine" is simply absurd. He believed 
     <lb/>
     that if he were guilty of advocating indepen<lb break="no"/>dence in the sense referred to, he might justly 
     <lb/>
     be accused of advocating what amounted to a 
     <lb/>
     transfer of allegiance, and which he could only 
     <lb/>
     characterize as disloyalty, and which if suc<lb break="no"/>cessful would terminate in annexation to the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and strip us of the highest glory 
     <lb/>
     of which it is possible for us to feel proud-<lb/> that of being allied to Great Britain. In an 
     <lb/>
     economical point of view it would be undesir<lb break="no"/>able. We would then be under the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     not only maintaining an army, but we should 
     <lb/>
     also have to maintain a navy of considerable 
     <lb/>
     strength to protect our commercial marine, 
     <lb/>
     whose sails now whiten every sea, (cheers). 
     <lb/>
     We should also be obliged to send ambassadors 
     <lb/>
     to the various foreign courts—at great expense. 
     <lb/>
     These services were being now performed by 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country on our behalf, and without 
     <lb/>
     any contribution from us. Under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances he concluded that there was no people

     that enjoyed a larger amount of independence, 
     <lb/>
     or civil and religious liberty than the people of 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion, or no country where life and 
     <lb/>
     property were more secure. With regard to his 
     <lb/>
     position, in relation to the Government, he said 
     <lb/>
     that he would not give them a factious opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, but would be governed by the description 
     <lb/>
     of measures which they might introduce, and if 
     <lb/>
     they failed, in his judgment, in this respect, he 
     <lb/>
     would endeavour to replace them by others 
     <lb/>
     who could more fully realize the importance of 
     <lb/>
     their position and the requirements of the 
     <lb/>
     country. In reference to the North West ques<lb break="no"/>tion, he thought the action of the hon. member

     for Hants was not such as he could approve, 
     <lb/>
     judging from the admissions made by the hon. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     in passing Mr, McDougall on the prairie so 
     <lb/>
     cavalierly, without in any way advising him as 
     <lb/>
     to the state of affairs at Red River, but acted as 
     <lb/>
     if he had wished him to grope in the dark, 
     <lb/>
     instead of informing him as to the true state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs there when he left. His conduct, also, in 
     <lb/>
     ordering to be taken down a flag which had 
     <lb/>
     been hoisted in anticipation of the spread of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian rule in this territory, he considered 
     <lb/>
     most reprehensible, especially when perpetrat<lb break="no"/>ed, not only by a Canadian Minister, but by 
     <lb/>
     one charged by our Government with impor<lb break="no"/>tant duties in that country. The hon. member

     found them in a state of chronic discontent, but 
     <lb/>
     he tells us—when asked why he did not

     <persName ref="pers:BOWN1">Mr. Bown</persName> said, that he had friends who were 
     <lb/>
     prisoners in the North West, and anything said 
     <lb/>
     by him might be of serious consequence to 
     <lb/>
     them. In reference to the conduct of the hon<lb break="no"/>ourable Secretary of State in the Territory, he 
     <lb/>
     said that from what he had been informed of 
     <lb/>
     the case, he had been until lately inclined to 
     <lb/>
     believe a good deal of what had been said in 
     <lb/>
    the House on the subject. Before coming down . 
     <lb/>to Parliament he had made up his mind to 
     <lb/>enquire as to the sources of these reports, and 
     <lb/>he found out that the hon. gentleman, in his 
     <lb/>journey, had been accompanied by a Mr. San<lb break="no"/>ford, and a Mr. Turner, gentlemen who had 
     <lb/>trade relations with the North-West. Their 
     <lb/>friends there were Mr. Bannatyne and others 
     <lb/>well known to hold anti-Canadian sentiments 
     <lb/>in the settlement, if not leaders of the rebels in 
     <lb/>Winnipeg. He took up his residence at a hotel, 
     <lb/>the parlor of which was occupied also by his 
     <lb/>travelling companions. As soon as his entry 
     <lb/>into the Territory was made known, a circle 
     <lb/>was made round him to prevent his meeting 
     <lb/>Canadians, or those interested in Canada, and 
     <lb/>to prevent them from holding private or confi<lb break="no"/>dential interviews with the Hon. Secretary of 
     <lb/>State. What he was reported to have said was 
     <lb/>given out as taunts against the friends of our 
     <lb/>country, and as proof that he was in favor of 
     <lb/>their cause, rather than that of Canada. As far 
     <lb/>as he (Mr. Bown) could ascertain, none of 
     <lb/>these reports could be traced to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, but were traceable to Mr. Bannatyne, or 
     <lb/>Mr. McKenny. The object of these gentlemen 
     <lb/>evidently was to sow the seeds of discord be<lb break="no"/>tween the Secretary for the Provinces and the 
     <lb/>friends of Canada in the Territory, and to 
     <lb/>excite feelings of distrust against him in 
     <lb/>Canada and amongst his colleagues, and thus 
     <lb/>strengthen their own cause, and he was sure 
     <lb/>that the reports circulated would be found to 
     <lb/>have originated with those opposed to the 
     <lb/>entry of the Canadian Governor. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>Bown) and his friends had done all they could 
     <lb/>to make the reception of the Governor agre<lb break="no"/>able, and he was sorry that the feeling there 
     <lb/>was against him. As to Governor McDougall's 
     <lb/>course of action he would say nothing under

     <lb/>
     that a change would have taken place in the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the Government on the accession and 
     <lb/>
     the appointment to office of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, but he had been disappointed. He con<lb break="no"/>demned the policy of the Government with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Intercolonial Railroad, which, he 
     <lb/>
     regretted to see, was supported by the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister. He thought that the Railway would 
     <lb/>
     be an engine in the hands of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     He was in favour of such liberal grants of land 
     <lb/>
     to railroads as were given by the United States. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Justice said that the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the Government was not changed in regard to 
     <lb/>
     Banking, yet Mr. Rose had been compelled to 
     <lb/>
     withdraw his Bill last session. He (Mr. Bod- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     well) was sorry to hear such a declaration. The 
     <lb/>
     disturbances at the North-West reflected, he 
     <lb/>
     thought, upon the Government, and he did 
     <lb/>
     think it strange that no further endeavours 
     <lb/>
     had been taken by the Government to promote 
     <lb/>
     the peaceable entry of the Governor into the 
     <lb/>
     Territory. He was surprised to hear that the 
     <lb/>
     Minister for the Provinces did not feel it his 
     <lb/>
     duty to take any more active measures than he 
     <lb/>
     had done. (Hear, hear.) He did not know 
     <lb/>
     whether the Minister of Finance expected to 
     <lb/>
     obtain the support of the Reform party to the 
     <lb/>
     policy of Protection shadowed forth. He per<lb break="no"/>sonally did not think it likely that those who 
     <lb/>
     had spent their lives advocating Free Trade, 
     <lb/>
     would now, at his bidding, support opposite 
     <lb/>
     principles.

     <lb/>
     entirely without justification. Sir F. Hincks

     entered the Cabinet as a Conservative. He had

     <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Mr. Mills</persName> spoke at some length of the issues 
     <lb/>
     of the last election. He said both the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice and the Minister of Finance admit<lb break="no"/>ted that an opposition was necessary while at 
     <lb/>
     the same time they were endeavouring to 
     <lb/>
     annihilate the opposition by a coalition of par<lb break="no"/>ties. The Minister of Finance went farther, and 
     <lb/>
     maintained that after a coalition, party distinc<lb break="no"/>tions in the coalition are an absurdity. He said 
     <lb/>
     this was not the position taken by the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister upon entering the Cabinet, for he 
     <lb/>
     informed the country that the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice had been graciously pleased to permit him 
     <lb/>
     (Sir F. Hincks) to bring another reformer with 
     <lb/>
     him into the ministry. It was clear then there 
     <lb/>
     was no fusion in the ministerial camp. If the 
     <lb/>
     position taken by ministers was correct, he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Mills) would ask how was it possible to 
     <lb/>
     differ about the construction of the Cabinet? 
     <lb/>
     How could they differ as to whether there 
     <lb/>
     should be two reformers or three, or two con<lb break="no"/>servatives or three, seeing these distinctions 
     <lb/>
     were terminated by the coalition of 1867? He 
     <lb/>
     said the ministry had all along been like an 
     <lb/>
     Eastern Court, into which the hungry from 
     <lb/>
     without were eager to be admitted, and the 
     <lb/>
     holders of insecure places within, were anxious 
     <lb/>
     to hasten into profitable retirement. He spoke 
     <lb/>
     of the organization of the machinery of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and maintained that ministers had con<lb break="no"/>founded a Privy Council with a Cabinet Coun<lb break="no"/>cil. He expressed a doubt as to the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     a Privy Council, but argued that as the law 
     <lb/>
     provided for its establishment, that leading 
     <lb/>
     members of the opposition ought to have been 
     <lb/>
     made Privy Councillors, so that they might be 
     <lb/>
     in the position of leaders of Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     opposition in England, having the right to give 
     <lb/>
     advice to the Governor General when the exi<lb break="no"/>gencies of the public service justified such a 
     <lb/>
     course. He next spoke of the innovation made 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution by the Nova Scotia Act of 
     <lb/>
     last session, and said the government had pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded as if the Union was a Legislative and 
     <lb/>
     not a Federal one. He condemned the policy 
     <lb/>
     from the beginning as to the acquisition of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West. He maintained the members of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick had been tricked into placing 
     <lb/>
     the location of the Intercolonial Railroad in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of ministers, to save the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs the humiliation of being opposed by a 
     <lb/>
     large majority of the New Brunswick mem<lb break="no"/>bers. He next referred to the position of Sir F. 
     <lb/>
     Hincks. He said Byron called Rome the "moth<lb break="no"/>er of dead Empires," and that the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance was the resuscitated leader of a 
     <lb/>
     defunct party; that he had been made the for<lb break="no"/>lorn hope of a government in danger of dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion, but instead of giving renewed hope, he

     had awakened sedition. He said the hand of 
     <lb/>
     time in scattering its snows upon him had not 
     <lb/>
     damped the ardor of this venerable relict of a 
     <lb/>
     well nigh forgotten race of dead warriors. He 
     <lb/>
     said the member for South Lanark although a 
     <lb/>
     conservative was most anxious to smoke the 
     <lb/>
     pipe of peace with the opposition. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mills) had twice referred to the saturnian age 
     <lb/>
     of '64. He said, last year the member for 
     <lb/>
     Lennox and the hon. member for South Lanark 
     <lb/>
     were like Castor and Pollux "who fought so 
     <lb/>
     well for Rome," but now when the conservative 
     <lb/>
     element was strengthened in the Cabinet, for 
     <lb/>
     there was still no fusion, the alliance of "the 
     <lb/>
     great twin brothers" was broken, and the 
     <lb/>
     defection in the conservative ranks increased. 
     <lb/>
     He denied that the Receiver General had any 
     <lb/>
     followers. He said the Receiver General (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Morris) was made by the Minister of Justice, 
     <lb/>
     for he was truly one of his people. He criticised 
     <lb/>
     the position of Dr. Tupper, and held that his 
     <lb/>
     present position was an admission that he had 
     <lb/>
     been unmindful of the interests of his Province 
     <lb/>
     when the Union was established, and conclud<lb break="no"/>ed by expressing the opinion that Canada

having stated "that the Reformers acted most 
     <lb/>
     extravagantly when in office." I certainly did 
     <lb/>
     not make use of this language; what I did say 
     <lb/>
     in speaking against a Coalition form of Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was "that when the Reform element 
     <lb/>
     was fully represented in the Cabinet by 
     <lb/>
     Brown, Howland and McDougall, the extrava<lb break="no"/>gance of the Government was as great, and 
     <lb/>
     even greater, than it has been since with only 
     <lb/>
     one Reformer in the Ministry", and mentioned 
     <lb/>
     by way of illustration that when the Reform 
     <lb/>
     element was fully represented, as before 
     <lb/>
     stated, the claims of the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     for increased postal subsidy were submitted to 
     <lb/>
     arbitration and the amount increased from 
     <lb/>
     $70,000 per annum to $167,000 per annum. It 
     <lb/>
     was also at this time that the claims of the 
     <lb/>
     contractors for the construction of the Public 
     <lb/>
     Buildings at Ottawa, were submitted to arbi<lb break="no"/>tration, by which means $90,000 were allowed 
     <lb/>
     to these gentlemen over and above the amount 
     <lb/>
     which they had already received—the cost of 
     <lb/>
     this one arbitration amounting to $30,000. And 
     <lb/>
     during the time public money was squandered 
     <lb/>
     in this way there was scarcely a person to raise 
     <lb/>
     his voice in the House against such an appro<lb break="no"/>priation, so demoralized had the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     become in consequence of the Coalition be<lb break="no"/>tween the leaders of the opposite parties. I do 
     <lb/>
     not pretend to say but that a Coalition had not 
     <lb/>
     become necessary in 1864, so equal were parties 
     <lb/>
     at that time that it was almost impossible to 
     <lb/>
     carry on the Government on party principles, 
     <lb/>
     and the different appeals made to the country 
     <lb/>
     left the two political parties in about the same 
     <lb/>
     relative position. But the items of expenditure 
     <lb/>
     to which I have referred show the dangers to 
     <lb/>
     be apprehended from a coalition form of Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment; a combination of parties which 
     <lb/>
     should never be resorted to except in cases of 
     <lb/>
     extreme necessity or when some great princi<lb break="no"/>ple of State policy has to be carried into effect, 
     <lb/>
     and which one party alone is unable to accom<lb break="no"/>plish. And I may state while on this subject 
     <lb/>
     that the Hon. George Brown, in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     acted in a straightforward and honourable 
     <lb/>
     manner in relation to the Reform party of 
     <lb/>
     which he was leader. It appears he called his 
     <lb/>
     reform friends together and consulted them as 
     <lb/>
     to whether he should enter the government 
     <lb/>
     with the Conservative party, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     carrying into effect the great <hi rendition="simple:italic">scheme</hi> of Con<lb break="no"/>federation; and, as I have been informed, the 
     <lb/>
     whole Reform members of the House at that 
     <lb/>
     time approved of his joining the Government. 
     <lb/>
     Now the conduct of Mr. Brown on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion contrasts favourably with that of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative Leader, the Conservative members of 
     <lb/>
     the House were never called together and con<lb break="no"/>sulted as to whether they would approve of 
     <lb/>
     such a combination of parties; but they were

     to them in the strongest terms as Yankee How-

     land and Washington McDougall. And not only 
     <lb/>
     were these gentlemen taken into the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     with the Conservative leaders; but also the 
     <lb/>
     patronage of all the counties in Ontario repre<lb break="no"/>sented by Reform Members who supported the

     services Were no longer required. Before clos<lb break="no"/>ing my remarks, I wish to say a few words in 
     <lb/>
     relation to the North-West Territory, which 
     <lb/>
     has of late occupied so much public attention. I 
     <lb/>
     think the first error made in relation to that 
     <lb/>
     country, was in recognizing the claims of the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson's Bay Company, and in altogether 
     <lb/>
     ignoring the rights of the actual inhabitants, 
     <lb/>
     who were to all appearance to be transferred to 
     <lb/>
     Canada with the land, like slaves on a planta<lb break="no"/>tion. And the second and greater error commit<lb break="no"/>ted by Mr. McDougall, was in announcing his 
     <lb/>
     intention of establishing a despotic govern<lb break="no"/>ment in that country, and giving as a reason 
     <lb/>
     for doing so, the scattered state of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion. Now the inhabitants of a country may not 
     <lb/>
     be numerous, and still entertain as strong feel<lb break="no"/>ings in favor of liberty as the inhabitants of a 
     <lb/>
     densely populated country. Canada contained 
     <lb/>
     but a scattered population when the people 
     <lb/>
     contended for responsible government, and 
     <lb/>
     secured it; and England was not densely 
     <lb/>
     crowded when the barons and people demand<lb break="no"/>ed the charter of their liberties from King 
     <lb/>
     John. I cannot endorse the war policy advocat<lb break="no"/>ed by some warlike gentlemen in relation to 
     <lb/>
     that remote region, who wish to see an army 
     <lb/>
     sent into that country to annihilate the half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds. Do these gentlemen reflect on the 
     <lb/>
     nature of an Indian war, and the results likely 
     <lb/>
     to arise out of it. Once throw a fire-brand into 
     <lb/>
     that country and kindle the flame of war, and 
     <lb/>
     who can tell where the conflagration will end. 
     <lb/>
     Set the Indians on the warpath and who will 
     <lb/>
     be able to control their movements, and just as 
     <lb/>
     sure as they cross the boundary and commit 
     <lb/>
     depredations on the soil of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     so sure will retaliation take place, and instead 
     <lb/>
     of a war with the half-breeds we may experi<lb break="no"/>ence the awful consequences of a continental 
     <lb/>
     war. Let us give those half-breeds, and others 
     <lb/>
     in that country, their constitutional rights; let 
     <lb/>
     us try the effects of conciliation, and let war in 
     <lb/>
     that distant country be the last resort, and only 
     <lb/>
     when all other reasonable means fail. I think 
     <lb/>
     Mr. McDougall made another mistake in send<lb break="no"/>ing Colonel Dennis to arm one portion of the 
     <lb/>
     population to fight against the other and cer<lb break="no"/>tainly the reason assigned for selecting such a

     I regret to see so many violent personal 
     <lb/>
     attacks made on the Honourable Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance during this debate. I was not an 
     <lb/>
     admirer of that gentleman's political course; 
     <lb/>
     but perhaps his past history will bear criticism 
     <lb/>
     as well as that of most of our Canadian politi<lb break="no"/>cians. For my own part I shall judge him rather 
     <lb/>
     by his present and future conduct than by his 
     <lb/>
     past acts, and I shall judge the Ministry by 
     <lb/>
     their measures. I am determined not to give an 
     <lb/>
     unpopular vote for the purpose of keeping 
     <lb/>
     them in power, neither will I give a factious 
     <lb/>
     vote for the purpose of defeating them.

     <persName ref="pers:CHAM1">Mr. Chamberlin</persName> hoped that the subject 
     <lb/>
     which they had heard once more referred to in 
     <lb/>
     this debate would not be again heard. He 
     <lb/>
     referred to the question of independence. The 
     <lb/>
     member for Shefford had mooted the subject 
     <lb/>
     last session, and had afterwards gone into the 
     <lb/>
     Eastern Townships and spoken to the people 
     <lb/>
     on this subject, but any sympathy he met with 
     <lb/>
     was derived almost exclusively from the few 
     <lb/>
     annexationists there. The shrewd farmers 
     <lb/>
     could not be convinced that independence was 
     <lb/>
     not the half-way step to annexation. Referring 
     <lb/>
     to the member for Sherbrooke, it would be 
     <lb/>
     remembered that in 1850 he issued an annexa<lb break="no"/>tion manifesto, and now to the profound regret 
     <lb/>
     of those who had admired and followed him, 
     <lb/>
     like himself (Mr. Chamberlin), he was again 
     <lb/>
     seeking a severance of connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country. He was then content sudden<lb break="no"/>ly to drop the annexation project and soon 
     <lb/>
     after to become the advocate of the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of these Provinces. We might hope him as 
     <lb/>
     suddenly to drop independence and accept per<lb break="no"/>chance the federation of the Empire instead. 
     <lb/>
     The member for Shefford had urged indepen<lb break="no"/>dence among the people, as a means of securing 
     <lb/>
     what he knew the people of the frontier 
     <lb/>
     desired to obtain immediately, not in a distant 
     <lb/>
     future—better trade relations. Therefore he

     either mocked them or expected to carry the 
     <lb/>
     work forward at once. Now he says he is not in 
     <lb/>
     a hurry about it. And the member for Sher<lb break="no"/>brooke relegated independence to some dimly 
     <lb/>
     distant future day, although, last summer he 
     <lb/>
     made it one of the grounds of his refusal of 
     <lb/>
     office. He congratulated the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     and the House on this change in their views, 
     <lb/>
     but was it statesmanlike to make appeals to 
     <lb/>
     this House and the country on merely specula<lb break="no"/>tive subjects, striving to make the public mind, 
     <lb/>
     already too much unsettled, still more so? That 
     <lb/>
     gentleman complained of being politically 
     <lb/>
     ostracised, but when a man advocates pulling 
     <lb/>
     down the old flag, the withdrawal of allegiance 
     <lb/>
     and severance from the empire and calls that 
     <lb/>
     loyalty, he might expect all political parties to 
     <lb/>
     shun him. He would not exaggerate the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of that gentleman, but it was an 
     <lb/>
     undoubted fact that his independence speech, 
     <lb/>
     which was printed and circulated all over the 
     <lb/>
     United States, had aided, among other things, 
     <lb/>
     in inducing Americans to withhold reciprocity.

     <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">Hon. Mr. Huntington</persName> said the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     Independence had been forced upon them. The 
     <lb/>
     course of the honourable member for Missis<lb break="no"/>quoi had been well known; when connected 
     <lb/>
     with the press of this country he had published 
     <lb/>
     ribald abuse of the Americans for years, cal<lb break="no"/>culated to excite their antipathies, and to rouse 
     <lb/>
     the most hostile feelings. It was very well to 
     <lb/>
     stand in a hostile attitude to the neighbouring 
     <lb/>
     republic, but as far as Reciprocity was con<lb break="no"/>cerned, he must not blow hot and cold.
