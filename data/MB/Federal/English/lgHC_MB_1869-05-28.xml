            <p>
               On motion of <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir John A. Macdonald</persName>.

               <persName ref="pers:CART2">Sir George E. Cartier</persName> rose to move the House 
               <lb/>
               into Committee on the resolutions respecting 
               <lb/>
               the acquisition of the North West Territory.

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. Mackenzie</persName> desired to take the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of obtaining an explanation from the 
               <lb/>
               Ministry regarding the recent accession to 
               <lb/>
               their ranks, in the person of the President of 
               <lb/>
               the Council. He had been unwilling to ask 
               <lb/>
               those explanations hitherto, because for some 
               <lb/>
               time that hon. gentleman was not in his place, 
               <lb/>
               and when he did take his seat was obviously 
               <lb/>
               not in the best possible trim for giving the 
               <lb/>
               required explanations. But before entering on 
               <lb/>
               the important subject before them, it was 
               <lb/>
               quite evident that the House ought to be fur<lb break="no"/>nished with a statement of the circumstances 
               <lb/>
               which had induced the hon. member for Hants 
               <lb/>
               to enter the Cabinet. It would be remembered 
               <lb/>
               that last year the President of the Council, 
               <lb/>
               then sitting on the Opposition side of the 
               <lb/>
               House, took very strong grounds against the 
               <lb/>
               acquisition of the North West Territory. 
               <lb/>
               Speaking, as he then said, not from a purely 
               <lb/>
               Nova Scotian point of view, but from a Can<lb break="no"/>adian aspect, the hon. gentleman advanced 
               <lb/>
               very strong reasons for taking that position<lb break="no"/>reasons which ought to exclude the hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman from holding office in any govern<lb break="no"/>ment proposing to deal with this subject, as 
               <lb/>
               the present administration proposed to do. 
               <lb/>
               And when so radical a change had taken 
               <lb/>
               place in the character of the government, or 
               <lb/>
               the position of the hon. gentleman joining 
               <lb/>
               them, it was due to the House that some ex<lb break="no"/>planations should be given. There was another 
               <lb/>
               point to which he also wished to direct at<lb break="no"/>tention, and that was that the Government 
               <lb/>
               had not yet given the House an opportunity 
               <lb/>
               of pronouncing on the new terms made with 
               <lb/>
               Nova Scotia. Had they done so, he would 
               <lb/>
               before this have asked for the explanations. 
               <lb/>
               The hon. gentleman might recollect that on 
               <lb/>
               the floor of that House, he contended that 
               <lb/>
               Nova Scotia had been despoiled of half a mil<lb break="no"/>lion dollars by the Union Act. He stated, while 
               <lb/>
               it was a matter of concern that these revenues 
               <lb/>
               should be taken by Canada under an enforced 
               <lb/>
               Union, that was nothing compared with the 
               <lb/>
               other outrage that she had been robbed of her 
               <lb/>
               liberties. It was certainly due to the country 
               <lb/>
               that the hon. gentleman should state how it 
               <lb/>
               was that, having held and uttered such senti<lb break="no"/>ments, he subsequently became a member of 
               <lb/>
               the Government which was not only respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the initiation of that robbery, but for 
               <lb/>
     
            
            <pb n="474" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0474.jpg"/>

               its maintenance. For his part, he (Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie) never could see the precise point 
               <lb/>
               where the robbery took place or where the 
               <lb/>
               liberties of that Province had been lost, but 
               <lb/>
               he had been touched while the member for 
               <lb/>
               Hants, with moist eyes and uplifted face, 
               <lb/>
               alluded so feelingly to the departed liberties of 
               <lb/>
               his country. Tears started unbidden to the 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentleman's eyes on that occasion, and 
               <lb/>
               finding him claim that his country would suf<lb break="no"/>fer the loss of all her liberties in consequence 
               <lb/>
               of this Union, he (Mr. Mackenzie) felt bound 
               <lb/>
               to vote for the appointment of a Committee to 
               <lb/>
               find out where we could relieve that Province 
               <lb/>
               from the oppression spoken of. And now that 
               <lb/>
               the member for Hants had become President 
               <lb/>
               of the Council, it was fair to conclude that in 
               <lb/>
               some mysterious way the liberties of that 
               <lb/>
               country had been restored. It was possible 
               <lb/>
               that the hon. gentleman had joined the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment as others had done before him in 
               <lb/>
               violation of all his political proclivities (Hear, 
               <lb/>
               hear.) Then it was only another step in that 
               <lb/>
               political dependence which seems to be a 
               <lb/>
               dogma of the Government of this country 
               <lb/>
               every day—a step which in the interests of 
               <lb/>
               public morality was very much to be regret<lb break="no"/>ted. When men holding the most diverse opin<lb break="no"/>ions, politically, find a safe refuge in a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment we are driven to believe that these 
               <lb/>
               gentlemen after all attach more value to ob<lb break="no"/>taining office than maintaining their patriotic 
               <lb/>
               impressions. (Hear, hear.) Was it to be sup<lb break="no"/>posed that the hon. gentlemen carried with 
               <lb/>
               them into the Cabinet all their conflicting 
               <lb/>
               views of public policy on almost every con<lb break="no"/>ceivable subject? Or were they all subordi<lb break="no"/>nated by the views of the Minister of Justice? 
               <lb/>
               He (Mr. Mackenzie) confessed his astonish<lb break="no"/>ment at the position taken by the President of 
               <lb/>
               the Council, and thought it was evident that 
               <lb/>
               the hon. gentleman's country-men generally 
               <lb/>
               looked on his accession to office as a purely 
               <lb/>
               personal matter. That accession had produced 
               <lb/>
               not conciliation and contentment, but merely 
               <lb/>
               changed the channel through which the stream 
               <lb/>
               of discontent poured. Annexation doctrines 
               <lb/>
               were now openly advocated in the very House 
               <lb/>
               of Assembly of Nova Scotia, and most scan<lb break="no"/>dalous speeches and resolutions, from a 
               <lb/>
               British point of view, were daily made in that 
               <lb/>
               body. These facts were significant of political 
               <lb/>
               degradation, and for that hon. gentleman's own 
               <lb/>
               sake, as well as for that of the Government 
               <lb/>
               and the country, it was exceedingly to be re<lb break="no"/>gretted that such events should transpire, as 
               <lb/>
               they could not possibly strengthen the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but would weaken it and destroy the 
               <lb/>
               bonds of political morality which binds to<lb break="no"/>gether in this country, men holding sentiments 
               <lb/>
               
       
            
            <pb n="475" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0475.jpg"/>
            
     
               in common. Holding these views, he felt bound 
               <lb/>
               to ask some explanation. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:HOWE2">Hon. Mr. Howe</persName> thanked the member for 
               <lb/>
               Lambton in not raising this debate till his 
               <lb/>
               (Mr. Howe's) strength had been somewhat 
               <lb/>
               restored. He thought it due to the House and 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentleman opposite, to state candidly and 
               <lb/>
               fairly the reason why he occupied his present 
               <lb/>
               position. He would say to them in all frank<lb break="no"/>ness that perhaps he might not have been on 
               <lb/>
               the Ministerial side at all, had the member for 
               <lb/>
               Lambton and the hon. gentlemen acting with 
               <lb/>
               him made the other side of the House at all 
               <lb/>
               habitable. (Laughter.) When he (Mr. Howe) 
               <lb/>
               attended the House and spent forty days on 
               <lb/>
               that side, had he as an old Reformer, and an 
               <lb/>
               old Liberal, found that sympathy and support 
               <lb/>
               he thought himself entitled to, perhaps he 
               <lb/>
               might have remained with them. (Laughter). 
               <lb/>
               The men on the Ministerial side had accepted 
               <lb/>
               the situation—were committed to it, were the 
               <lb/>
               executive instruments by which it was to be 
               <lb/>
               carried out, and on the other side of the House 
               <lb/>
               almost every member, including the member 
               <lb/>
               for Lambton himself, was equally committed 
               <lb/>
               to the act of Confederation. If he understood 
               <lb/>
               the member for Lambton then he (Mr. Howe) 
               <lb/>
               was to place himself in this position: he was to 
               <lb/>
               attend that House, obey the law, and submit 
               <lb/>
               to the Act of Confederation, which had been 
               <lb/>
               gained by the pressure of both parties in 
               <lb/>
               Canada—and to occupy an isolated position, in 
               <lb/>
               such a happy position, commanding no sym<lb break="no"/>pathy on the one side of the House nor the 
               <lb/>
               other, he was to spend the remainder of his 
               <lb/>
               days for the edification and amusement of 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentlemen on both sides (Hear and 
               <lb/>
               laughter). Had he devoted himself to an 
               <lb/>
               isolated existence of that kind he should 
               <lb/>
               certainly be a martyr to a very high sense 
               <lb/>
               of honour, but if he needed such justification 
               <lb/>
               he might almost make an excuse for oc<lb break="no"/>cupying his present position by saying that 
               <lb/>
               he was only following the custom of the 
               <lb/>
               country. (Laughter.) Were he to believe the 
               <lb/>
               half of what he heard, and he was free to 
               <lb/>
               say he did not, were he to believe the charge 
               <lb/>
               which he had heard flung by public men 
               <lb/>
               at each other across the floor of the House 
               <lb/>
               during the forty days he had first attend<lb break="no"/>ed it, he could consider that the tone of 
               <lb/>
               political morality was so high in Canada 
               <lb/>
               that he had violently transgressed it in cros<lb break="no"/>sing the floor of the House. (Laughter.) 
               <lb/>
               He came there a stranger and would do 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentlemen the justice to say that he 
               <lb/>

               had been treated with all courtesy. His com<lb break="no"/>plaints of the Dominion Act might, for a 
               <lb/>
               time, have been querulous and declamatory, 
               <lb/>
               but he had been treated with courtesy and 
               <lb/>
               respect by both sides, and so far he had 
               <lb/>
               no thing to complain of. But he certainly did 
               <lb/>
               expect some hon. gentlemen on the Opposition 
               <lb/>
               benches to have arisen and said that Nova 
               <lb/>
               Scotia had been hardly used, that there was 
               <lb/>
               good ground for the excitement in that Prov<lb break="no"/>ince, and to have sympathised with him in 
               <lb/>
               his efforts on behalf of that Province, not to 
               <lb/>
               the extent, perhaps, of releasing Nova Scotians 
               <lb/>
               from this political arrangement. What took 
               <lb/>
               place during the second part of the session 
               <lb/>
               he did not know, for he was not in the House 
               <lb/>
               then, but during the time he was present, his 
               <lb/>
               cause received so little sympathy from the 
               <lb/>
               member for Lambton, or his party, that he 
               <lb/>
               (Mr. Howe) did not feel at all trammelled as 
               <lb/>
               to which side of the House he would sit on 
               <lb/>
               hereafter. The hon. gentleman then detailed 
               <lb/>
               his subsequent agitation for repeal. How he 
               <lb/>
               spent nine months in England, backed by 
               <lb/>
               petitions from 30,000 people. How the Act 
               <lb/>
               passed in spite of every remonstrance. How, 
               <lb/>
               on his return to Nova Scotia, so strong was 
               <lb/>
               the dislike to Confederation, that during the 
               <lb/>
               election the Unionists were almost completely 
               <lb/>
               swept out of political existence. How, along 
               <lb/>
               with others, he subsequently went to England 
               <lb/>
               to induce the Imperial authorities to recon<lb break="no"/>sider the question of Repeal. How, when the 
               <lb/>
               question came up in the House of Lords, 
               <lb/>
               only two out of 400 spoke in favour of it, 
               <lb/>
               while in the House of Commons only 87 could 
               <lb/>
               be found to favour, not the repeal of the Act, 
               <lb/>
               but the enquiry into its workings. How, under 
               <lb/>
               these circumstances, he returned to his home 
               <lb/>
               feeling convinced that repeal was hopeless; 
               <lb/>
               but not before warning the British Minister 
               <lb/>
               that one result would be the generation of 
               <lb/>
               an annexation feeling, as the member for 
               <lb/>
               Lambton had asserted that an annexation 
               <lb/>
               feeling had sprung up. It was not to be 
               <lb/>
               attributed to his changed position, but a 
               <lb/>
               feeling of soreness on account of the treat<lb break="no"/>ment received from the British Government. 
               <lb/>
               He had not succeeded in his mission. What 
               <lb/>
               then was he to do? To sit down and do 
               <lb/>
               nothing? The member for Lambton seemed to 
               <lb/>
               think that he (Mr. Howe) would escape from 
               <lb/>
               the public position he had assumed. But he 
               <lb/>
               had been elected. His constituents and coun<lb break="no"/>trymen looked to him for advice and action. 
               <lb/>
               What was he to do? To go screaming out for 
               <lb/>
               repeal? To advise the people to break the 
               <lb/>
               laws, and resist the power and authority of 
               <lb/>
               the Imperial Government? He would not un<lb break="no"/>dertake to say what he would have done had 
               <lb/>
               he the power, (hear, hear), but the power 
               <lb/>
               
     
            <pb n="477" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0477.jpg"/>
            
        
               and force brought to bear against his posi<lb break="no"/>tion was too great to resist. Therefore he felt 
               <lb/>
               that there was nothing to do but to accept 
               <lb/>
               the situation or enter into a hopeless, dreary 
               <lb/>
               contest, which could have but one result. 
               <lb/>
               (Cheers.) Just at that time, when we tried 
               <lb/>
               everything else and failed, hon. gentlemen 
               <lb/>
               from this side of the House came down to us 
               <lb/>
               and said—"We cannot repeal this Act, and do 
               <lb/>
               not wish to do so, but we are willing to re<lb break="no"/>examine the financial part of the scheme, and 
               <lb/>
               if it is shown that by it injustice has been or 
               <lb/>
               is to be done to Nova Scotia, we will en<lb break="no"/>deavour to repair the injustice." His first 
               <lb/>
               policy was to test the sincerity of these pro<lb break="no"/>fessions. Negotiations went on, and bye and 
               <lb/>
               bye it was quite apparent to the Finance 
               <lb/>
               Minister of Canada and the Auditor General 
               <lb/>
               that a gross injustice had been done Nova 
               <lb/>
               Scotia; and when this acknowledgement was 
               <lb/>
               made there was a fair ground for negotiations 
               <lb/>
               for better terms. Shutting out for the present 
               <lb/>
               any reference to these better terms, as that 
               <lb/>
               branch of the subject would come up in a 
               <lb/>
               few days, he would merely say that the ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations were brought to a close and Mr. 
               <lb/>
               McLelan and himself were satisfied that jus<lb break="no"/>tice would be done Nova Scotia. The Ministry 
               <lb/>
               by that act established a larger claim to his 
               <lb/>
               respect and confidence. The Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice then did him the honour to renew an 
               <lb/>
               offer made months before to take a seat in 
               <lb/>
               the Cabinet. He felt they had established a 
               <lb/>
               claim on him, and said frankly, "if you think 
               <lb/>
               it will strengthen your hands in carrying this 
               <lb/>
               measure through Parliament to have my aid 
               <lb/>
               and assistance in the Cabinet, you can have 
               <lb/>
               it. As far as I am concerned, I would rather 
               <lb/>
               continue as I am." He made one reservation, 
               <lb/>
               however. He had no hope from the new Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment established in England, but many in 
               <lb/>
               Nova Scotia hoped to get repeal from them. 
               <lb/>
               The reservation he made was this: The mo<lb break="no"/>ment the Local Government got their answer 
               <lb/>
               from the Gladstone Government, if it was 
               <lb/>
               unfavourable, as he expected, he was to con<lb break="no"/>sider himself free to take office. The answer 
               <lb/>
               came, was unfavourable, and he had then no 
               <lb/>
               hesitation. As to his opposition to the pur<lb break="no"/>chase of the Hudson's Bay Territory, he had 
               <lb/>
               opposed that purchase with all sincerity, be<lb break="no"/>lieving that it should have been the work of 
               <lb/>
               the Imperial authorities, and not of the 
               <lb/>
               Dominion, but the policy of the majority of 
               <lb/>
               the House opposed to that was carried out. 
               <lb/>
               The delegates went to England, the purchase 
               <lb/>
               was made, and arrangements completed al<lb break="no"/>most before he entered the Cabinet. Now, 
               <lb/>
               what would the member for Lambton have 
               <lb/>
               him to do? Was he to regard that as a 
               <lb/>
               stumbling-block in the way of entering the 
               <lb/>

               Cabinet? That would be a most extraordinary 
               <lb/>
               doctrine, from the day he entered the Cabinet 
               <lb/>
               he held himself responsible for the acts and 
               <lb/>
               policy of the gentlemen with whom he was 
               <lb/>
               associated, but for anything before that period, 
               <lb/>
               for any of their sins of omission or commis<lb break="no"/>sion he did not hold himself responsible.

               out a policy from which none of us can go 
               <lb/>
               back with honour. No public man can get 
               <lb/>
               up and ask to have that purchase repealed. 
               <lb/>
               All he could say was that he entered the Ca<lb break="no"/>binet covered to a large extent by revolution<lb break="no"/>ary arrangements which he resisted, and if it 
               <lb/>
               were to be made a rule that none of us oppos<lb break="no"/>ing Confederation and its concomitants should 
               <lb/>
               ever enter the Cabinet, then Nova Scotia 
               <lb/>
               would have very slight representation there. 
               <lb/>
               (Hear, hear.) For his part, as long as he found

               the gentlemen with whom he was associated 
               <lb/>
               sincerely anxious to carry out a policy con<lb break="no"/>ducive to the welfare of the Dominion, he 
               <lb/>
               should act with them, and sustain them; and

               the moment he could not do so conscientiously, 
               <lb/>
               he would tender his resignation.

               <lb/>
               had been brought forward was well worthy 
               <lb/>
               of the earnest attention of the House. On a 
               <lb/>
               former occasion he had followed the hon. 
               <lb/>
               member for Hants in debate, and stated that 
               <lb/>
               he deeply deplored that that hon. gentleman 
               <lb/>
               occupied a position which prevented him giv<lb break="no"/>ing the country the benefit of his services in 
               <lb/>
               the administration. With equal sincerity, and 
               <lb/>
               an equal sense of public duty, he now felt it 
               <lb/>
               right to express his gratification that the hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman had at last been enabled to take 
               <lb/>
               a more prominent and responsible position in 
               <lb/>
               the conduct of public affairs. He had never

            <pb n="479" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0479.jpg"/>
            
      
               believed that repeal would be successful, but 
               <lb/>
               what he had felt was that the vital interests 
               <lb/>
               of the Dominion required that the difficulty as 
               <lb/>
               respects Nova Scotia should be removed, and 
               <lb/>
               the Union enabled to present an unbroken 
               <lb/>
               front to the world. He had no hesitation, how<lb break="no"/>ever, in saying that the difficulty in that 
               <lb/>
               Province was very much exaggerated from 
               <lb/>
               the outset. He had never looked upon the 
               <lb/>
               issue of the elections of 1867 as evincing the 
               <lb/>
               desire of the people for Repeal. He had 
               <lb/>
               believed and had stated in the House the 
               <lb/>
               circumstances which warranted him in coming 
               <lb/>
               to the conclusion that by a moderate and 
               <lb/>
               judicious course of action all the difficulty 
               <lb/>
               might be removed. He had, indeed, always 
               <lb/>
               pressed upon the administration the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of making such arrangements. He felt 
               <lb/>
               that the sooner the representatives of Nova 
               <lb/>
               Scotia were able to work out the constitution, 
               <lb/>
               the better for the interests of the whole Do<lb break="no"/>minion. Some time ago the Government had 
               <lb/>
               done him the honour of offering him a high 
               <lb/>
               and responsible position in the administra<lb break="no"/>tion, but having given that subject the fullest 
               <lb/>
               consideration, he felt it his duty to decline. 
               <lb/>
               And he had done so on the ground that he 
               <lb/>
               should consider how far the acceptance of 
               <lb/>
               office would leave him free to advance the 
               <lb/>
               interests of his country. He had considered 
               <lb/>
               that the acceptance of such a position would 
               <lb/>
               mar his usefulness in connection with meas<lb break="no"/>ures that might reconcile the people to the 
               <lb/>
               Union. He did not hesitate to advise the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment—to say to them that he believed it 
               <lb/>
               was a solemn duty which they owed to the 
               <lb/>
               whole people of the Dominion to exhaust 
               <lb/>
               every means consistent with the honour and 
               <lb/>
               rights of the country, to bring representatives 
               <lb/>
               of the people of Nova Scotia into harmony<lb break="no"/>not with the Government of the country so 
               <lb/>
               much as with the institutions of the Dominion. 
               <lb/>
               The House would remember that in the most 
               <lb/>
               impassioned appeal he had made on the 
               <lb/>
               question, he had implored the anti-Union 
               <lb/>
               representatives, instead of standing outside 
               <lb/>
               of the constitution, to come forward and assist 
               <lb/>
               in perfecting these institutions. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had done him the honour to delegate 
               <lb/>
               him in England, for the purpose of giving the 
               <lb/>
               British Government all the information he 
               <lb/>

               West resolutions. He announced in the first 
               <lb/>
               place, as the resolutions involved a money 
               <lb/>
               appropriation, that they were introduced with 
               <lb/>
               the consent of His Excellency the Governor 
               <lb/>
               General. It was needless for him to say that 
               <lb/>
               the subject of these resolutions was very im<lb break="no"/>portant. The acquisition of the North West had 
               <lb/>
               been under the consideration of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Parliament of the late Province 
               <lb/>
               of Canada for a number of years. It had 
               <lb/>
               also engaged the attention of the Parliament 
               <lb/>
               of the Dominion, and resolutions having that 
               <lb/>
               object in view had been adopted last session. 
               <lb/>
               It was difficult to know how to begin in under<lb break="no"/>taking to deal with so important a question. 
               <lb/>
               He proposed to make no preface, but to go

            <pb n="481" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0481.jpg"/>
            

               into the subject at once and to show that the 
               <lb/>
               contemplated arrangement should be cheer<lb break="no"/>fully acquiesced in by the House. The papers 
               <lb/>
               showing the proceedings of himself and his 
               <lb/>
               colleague in England had been laid before the 
               <lb/>
               House. In considering the acquisition of so 
               <lb/>
               important a territory we were naturally in<lb break="no"/>duced to consider the history of the successive 
               <lb/>
               acquisition of territory by our neighbours in 
               <lb/>
               the United States. The original 13 States com<lb break="no"/>prised a territory much more limited than that 
               <lb/>
               which the United States now possessed; but 
               <lb/>
               no sooner did they acquire their independence 
               <lb/>
               than they entered on a policy of losing no 
               <lb/>
               opportunity of acquiring new territory. First, 
               <lb/>
               they got Louisiana. Some Americans were 
               <lb/>
               opposed to this, thinking they had territory 
               <lb/>
               enough; but the other idea prevailed, and 
               <lb/>
               that territory was acquired, affording the ma<lb break="no"/>terial out of which five States have been 
               <lb/>
               erected. Not satisfied with this, American 
               <lb/>
               statesmen looked to the necessity of extending 
               <lb/>
               their territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific, 
               <lb/>
               and that idea was finally accomplished. It had 
               <lb/>
               taken them, however, nearly 50 years to 
               <lb/>
               complete this project; but if the measures 
               <lb/>
               now before the House was carried out, we 
               <lb/>
               would acquire almost by one act a greater 
               <lb/>
               extent of territory, and in some respects more 
               <lb/>
               important, than what the United States had 
               <lb/>
               acquired during the last 50 years; for British 
               <lb/>
               Columbia was standing ready to meet us 
               <lb/>
               as soon as we took possession of the North<lb break="no"/>west. It was a matter of glorification to us 
               <lb/>
               that in so short a time since we entered into 
               <lb/>
               Confederation, we had made such progress. 
               <lb/>
               Who, under such circumstances, could say that 
               <lb/>
               this Confederation had not been successful? 
               <lb/>
               In this measure we were completing the terri<lb break="no"/>torial element for which protective provision 
               <lb/>
               had been made in the Act of Confederation. 
               <lb/>
               He would not go into the whole history of the 
               <lb/>
               negotiations in England, as all the facts were 
               <lb/>
               known to the House. He might explain, how<lb break="no"/>ever, the reason why he and his colleague had 
               <lb/>
               been detained so long in conducting these 
               <lb/>
               negotiations. They had been entered upon 
               <lb/>
               with the late Government, and when the 
               <lb/>
               change of Government took place, they had 
               <lb/>
               to be commenced again from the beginning. He 
               <lb/>
               thought any one acquainted with the facts 
               <lb/>
               would admit that he and his colleague had not 
               <lb/>
               unnecessarily delayed the proceedings. The 
               <lb/>
               severe illness which nearly proved fatal to his 
               <lb/>
               colleague, aggrieved by intelligence of the fatal 
               <lb/>
               illness of the being dearest to him in life, was 
               <lb/>
               another cause of delay. What they had suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in achieving, however, he was sure 
               <lb/>
               would redound to the prosperity of this coun<lb break="no"/>try, and the country should be especially

               grateful to his colleague, who had done his 
               <lb/>
               work and done it well, under the most trying 
               <lb/>
               circumstances. The agreement entered into 
               <lb/>
               resolved itself into two principal points as 
               <lb/>
               regarded what Canada had to pay for the 
               <lb/>

               acquisition of the North-West Territory; the 
               <lb/>
               first being a money payment of £300,000, and 
               <lb/>
               the second a reserve to the Company of one- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               twentieth of the land in the Fertile Belt. The 
               <lb/>
               other points were matters of detail. The mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Chateauguay had declared that Canada 
               <lb/>

               had got the worst of the bargain. He chal<lb break="no"/>lenged the hon. gentleman to make good that 
               <lb/>
               assertion in the course of this debate, and to 
               <lb/>
               criticise freely the arrangement made in all its 
               <lb/>
               details. Some misconceptions had in the first 
               <lb/>
               instance arisen from certain hostile criticisms 
               <lb/>

               in the press; but these had very much dis<lb break="no"/>appeared in consequence of the explanation 
               <lb/>
               given by himself and his colleague since their 
               <lb/>
               return to Canada. He was prepared to contend 
               <lb/>
               that this agreement gave us the territory on 
               <lb/>
               more favourable terms than those on which 
               <lb/>

               we would have acquired it had the address of 
               <lb/>
               last session been carried out. Under that 
               <lb/>
               address we would have got the sovereignty of 
               <lb/>
               country without territory. Under this arrange<lb break="no"/>ment we get both, on making a moderate 
               <lb/>
               money payment. That payment of £300,000 
               <lb/>

               raised on Imperial Guarantee at 3½ <lb/>per cent 
               <lb/>
               interest, with a sinking fund to extinguish the 
               <lb/>
               debt in 45 years would not involve a charge of 
               <lb/>
               more than £13,000 or £14,000 a year, while 
               <lb/>
               on the other hand we would get customs dues 
               <lb/>

               of nearly that amount. Sir Curtis Lampson the 
               <lb/>
               Deputy Governor of the Company, had stated 
               <lb/>
               that they were willing to pay £10,000 a year 
               <lb/>
               in commutation of customs dues. For this 
               <lb/>
               trifling amount we secured this immense terri<lb break="no"/>tory. The question arose what should we do 
               <lb/>

               with it? Should we at once commence a rail<lb break="no"/>way through the territory, or should we be 
               <lb/>
               satisfied with Provincial work which would 
               <lb/>
               furnish the necessary summer communication? 
               <lb/>
               That question was not at present before the 
               <lb/>
               House and he merely referred to it for the 
               <lb/>

               purpose of saying that whether we decided 
               <lb/>
               on a railway or provisional communication, 
               <lb/>
               we had acquired means sufficient to accom<lb break="no"/>plish either object, as it was well known that 
               <lb/>
               the United States had built their Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way by grants of lands along the line. He 
               <lb/>

               proceeded to refer to the increase our credit 
               <lb/>
               had received in the money markets in the 
               <lb/>
               world. The Dominion of Canada was now as 
               <lb/>
               well known as the United States, and it was 
               <lb/>
               known that we intended to be great. He did 
               <lb/>
               not mean that we were to be independent. All 
               <lb/>

               our dependence now, consisted in England 
               <lb/>
               giving us a Governor General, and he was 
               <lb/>
               
           
            <pb n="483" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0483.jpg"/>
            
       
               willing that we should remain dependent to 
               <lb/>
               that extent. He was willing that we should 
               <lb/>
               remain under the protection of the British 
               <lb/>
               Navy. If we were independent we would re<lb break="no"/>quire to have a navy of our own, but so long 
               <lb/>
               as we enjoyed the protection of a navy for 
               <lb/>
               nothing at all, we would not ask that we 
               <lb/>
               should be free from our present dependence. 
               <lb/>
               As regarded then the money payment, he did 
               <lb/>
               not think any one would say the bargain was 
               <lb/>
               hard for Canada. He would come now to the 
               <lb/>
               reserve of lands.

               <persName ref="pers:CART2">Sir George E. Cartier</persName> was not surprised to 
               <lb/>
               hear the interruptions of the member for 
               <lb/>
               Chateauguay. He supposed the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man was to build up a great argument against 
               <lb/>
               that, and to refer to the Clergy Reserves of 
               <lb/>
               Upper Canada as having obstructed the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of the country. The arrangements made 
               <lb/>
               here were very different from those with 
               <lb/>
               regard to the Clergy Reserves. Suppose the 
               <lb/>
               fertile Belt contained forty millions of acres, 
               <lb/>
               the reserve to the Company of one twentieth 
               <lb/>
               would be two million acres, spread here and 
               <lb/>
               there, subject to municipal taxation, for roads 
               <lb/>
               and other improvements, and belonging to a 
               <lb/>
               Company whose interest it would be to settle 
               <lb/>
               the reserved lots as soon as possible, and to 
               <lb/>
               have the other lands also settled, in order that 
               <lb/>
               the reserved lots might have as much value 
               <lb/>
               as possible. It had been objected that the 
               <lb/>
               corporate rights of the Hudson's Bay Company 
               <lb/>
               should not be continued. He thought it was 
               <lb/>
               for the interest of the country that those 
               <lb/>
               rights should be continued. The number of 
               <lb/>
               Indians in the territory was very great. Sir 
               <lb/>
               George Simpson had estimated the number 
               <lb/>
               at half a million souls. Governor Mactavish 
               <lb/>
               thought this estimate was exaggerated, but 
               <lb/>
               believed the number would be from 180,000 
               <lb/>
               to 200,000. These Indians had been dependent 
               <lb/>
               on the Company for employment and if this 
               <lb/>
               were suddenly interfered with the results 
               <lb/>
               might be disastrous. The officers of the Com<lb break="no"/>pany had shown a creditable regard for the 
               <lb/>
               welfare of the Indians and had, as stated by 
               <lb/>
               the delegates, to see that a law was passed 
               <lb/>
               which would prevent the sale of liquor to the 
               <lb/>
               Indians. He had answered them that we 
               <lb/>
               already had a law which would have that 
               <lb/>
               effect. He went on to say that we had a great 
               <lb/>
               future before us. We had already a popula<lb break="no"/>tion nearly half as great as that of the States 
               <lb/>
               of New York, Pennsylvania and the New 
               <lb/>
               England States combined, and our population 
               <lb/>
               was increasing more rapidly than theirs. Bos<lb break="no"/><pb n="484" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0484.jpg"/><fw type="num">484</fw><fw type="running"> COMMONS DEBATES</fw><fw type="dateline"> May 28, 1869<lb/></fw>ton had, in a large measure, lost the sea 
               <lb/>
               trade, and was not growing. The population 
               <lb/>
               of New England was hardly increasing at all. 
               <lb/>
               The population of the State of New York, out<lb break="no"/>side the city, was not increasing. Pennsylva<lb break="no"/>nia was almost at a stand still. The Provinces 
               <lb/>
               at present embraced in the Confederation 
               <lb/>
               could maintain as large a population as the 
               <lb/>
               States ever had maintained; but what we 
               <lb/>
               wanted hitherto had been the prairie element. 
               <lb/>
               Under the measure now submitted we would 
               <lb/>
               have that element. We would have, like the

               United States a great West, and he did not 
               <lb/>
               doubt that after ten years the census would

               <lb/>
               on the North-West resolutions. He said for the 
               <lb/>
               last 15 or 20 years the principal increase of 
               <lb/>
               population of the United States had been in 
               <lb/>
               the Western States. Within a few months we 
               <lb/>
               would be in possession of a prairie territory 
               <lb/>
               equal to that of the United States, and as the 
               <lb/>
               people of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and 
               <lb/>
               New Brunswick, were a population of pro<lb break="no"/>ducing people, their natural increase would 
               <lb/>
               rapidly fill up our western territory. We might 
               <lb/>
               look very soon for the admission of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. British Columbia was ready to come in, 
               <lb/>
               therefore, with the acquisition of the North 
               <lb/>
               West. We might say we had completed our 
               <lb/>
               territorial organization. Who could foretell the 
               <lb/>
               future before us? Was it too much to expect 
               <lb/>
               that in ten years we would have doubled our 
               <lb/>
               population from natural increase? and taking 
               <lb/>
               into account the immigration that would be 
               <lb/>
               attracted, we might in ten years be a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of ten millions. The increase of trade 
               <lb/>
               would be correspondingly vast. Then we 
               <lb/>
               would have an increase to the maritime ele<lb break="no"/><pb n="485" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0485.jpg"/>ment by the addition to the Confederation of 
               <lb/>
               British Columbia and Vancouver's Island. We 
               <lb/>
               had heard lately the great boast of our neigh<lb break="no"/>bours over the completion of their Pacific 
               <lb/>
               Railway, which was 3,400 miles from the 
               <lb/>
               Pacific to New York. When our Confederation 
               <lb/>
               was complete, British capitalists would prob<lb break="no"/>ably turn their attention to bringing to 
               <lb/>
               England the trades of the east by a railway 
               <lb/>
               through British territory, which from the 
               <lb/>
               Pacific to Quebec would be only 2,200 miles 
               <lb/>
               in length—a saving of 1,200 miles, as com<lb break="no"/>pared with the Pacific Line just opened. With 
               <lb/>
               this great territory at our disposal, it would 
               <lb/>
               be a matter for us to consider whether we 
               <lb/>
               should not devote a portion of it to encourage 
               <lb/>
               capitalists to undertake that railway. He did 
               <lb/>
               not say what was the policy of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on that matter. They had not yet 
               <lb/>
               adopted a policy with regard to it. But so 
               <lb/>
               soon as this address was passed, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would introduce a measure to establish 
               <lb/>
               a Provincial Government in that great 
               <lb/>
               country, as the English Government might 
               <lb/>
               issue the proclamation giving effect to our 
               <lb/>
               address before this Parliament met again. It 
               <lb/>
               was important that not a month or day should 
               <lb/>
               be lost, after the territory became ours, in 
               <lb/>
               organizing a Government and having the 
               <lb/>
               lands surveyed, and their character made 
               <lb/>
               known throughout this country and Europe. 
               <lb/>
               It was a consoling idea to himself and the 
               <lb/>
               member for Lambton, if not to the President 
               <lb/>

               contemplated by the British America Act 
               <lb/>
               would be accomplished. He did not think it 
               <lb/>
               likely that any more would be heard about 
               <lb/>
               annexation. If it were possible to conceive 
               <lb/>
               such a thing brought about, all the money we 
               <lb/>
               collected here for the benefit and support of 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion Government, and to pay the 
               <lb/>
               subsidies to the different Provinces, would be 
               <lb/>
               sent to Washington to be jobbed away there; 
               <lb/>
               and he hoped we would hear no more about 
               <lb/>
               independence either, for independence was 
               <lb/>
               merely a project to serve as a cover to an<lb break="no"/>nexation. He had been called an enemy to the 
               <lb/>
               acquisition of the North West Territory. This 
               <lb/>
               was not the case. All he had opposed was its 
               <lb/>
               being annexed to Upper Canada. He believed 
               <lb/>
               he had now the support of all his hon. friends 
               <lb/>
               from Quebec, in going heartily for acquiring 
               <lb/>
               that territory. In conclusion, he stated that 
               <lb/>
               he had made a mistake, the other day, in 
               <lb/>
               announcing that there was some despatches 
               <lb/>
               which had not been brought down. He found 
               <lb/>
               that they had all been laid before the House. 
               <lb/>
               The gallant baronet resumed his seat amidst 
               <lb/>
               cheers, having spoken for an hour and a half.

               <persName ref="pers:MCDO7">Hon. Mr. McDougall</persName>, in seconding the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, said it was unnecessary now to go 
               <lb/>
               over the history of this question. The only 
               <lb/>
               point now to be considered was whether the 
               <lb/>
               terms and conditions which had been agreed 
               <lb/>
               upon in England were terms and conditions 
               <lb/>
               which this Parliament and the country ought 
               <lb/>
               to oppose. The member for Chateauguay had 
               <lb/>
               stated that the delegates from Canada had 
               <lb/>
               been outwitted in the bargain. It was for the 
               <lb/>
               House to consider whether that was the fact. 
               <lb/>
               He freely admitted that he had been strongly 
               <lb/>
               of the opinion, that the position maintained by 
               <lb/>
               the various governments of Canada was cor<lb break="no"/>rect, that the Hudson's Bay Co. has no such 
               <lb/>
               right or property in the country we desired to 
               <lb/>
               obtain, as would justify their demanding a 
               <lb/>
               money consideration for them. It could not be 
               <lb/>
               denied, however, that in Ruperts Land, they 
               <lb/>
               had rights which would have been recognized 
               <lb/>
               in the courts of England. All these rights of a 
               <lb/>
               proprietary character were extinguished by 
               <lb/>
               this agreement. They would still exist as a 
               <lb/>
               trading company, but would have no pro<lb break="no"/>prietary rights. He considered that if we had 
               <lb/>
               paid £300,000 to extinguish the proprietary and 
               <lb/>
               governing rights of the Company in Ruperts 
               <lb/>
               Land alone, it would have been well expended, 
               <lb/>
               inasmuch as it was of great importance to us 
               <lb/>
               that there should be nobody possessing a 
               <lb/>
               separate governing jurisdiction between us 
               <lb/>
               and the Arctic Ocean. It should be remember<lb break="no"/>ed too that we would have a valuable equiv<lb break="no"/>alent in the custom duties which would be 
               <lb/>
               received. He had seen it estimated, looking to 
               <lb/>
               the quality of goods imported for a series of 
               <lb/>
               years, that the Hudson's Bay Company would 
               <lb/>
               have to pay annually £30,000.

               Stafford Northcote and Sir Curtis Lampson 
               <lb/>

               <persName ref="pers:GALT1">Hon. Mr. Galt</persName>—Perhaps Earl Granville had 
               <lb/>
               something to do in convincing them.

               that Earl Granville's persuasive eloquence had 
               <lb/>
               something to do with it. As regards the 
               <lb/>
               reserve of one-twentieth of the land, he 
               <lb/>
               believed it would be a great advantage 
               <lb/>
               to us to have a great company like this with 
               <lb/>
               a direct interest in the development and 
               <lb/>
               improvement of the country. This would be a 
               <lb/>
               great advantage to us if for example we had 
               <lb/>
               to go into the money market to borrow money 
               <lb/>
               for improving the Territory. One-twentieth 
               <lb/>
               was after all a small proportion of the land as 
               <lb/>
               compared with one-seventh reserved for the 
               <lb/>
               Clergy of Upper Canada, and which had un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly been an obstacle to the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of the Country. It had been arranged 
               <lb/>
               also through the efforts of the delegates, that 
               <lb/>
               the reserved lands should be subject to tax<lb break="no"/>ation from the outset, which was a very im<lb break="no"/>portant difference from the Clergy Reserve 
               <lb/>
               arrangement. The Hudson's Bay Company 
               <lb/>
               would occupy a very different relation to<lb break="no"/>wards Canada from what they had hitherto 
               <lb/>
               done. Formerly their interest had been to keep 
               <lb/>
               settlers out of the Country, their interests were 
               <lb/>
               in all respects adverse to those of Canada. Now 
               <lb/>
               their interests would be the same as ours, and 
               <lb/>
               they would heartily co-operate with us. We 
               <lb/>
               would find this a great advantage in the man<lb break="no"/>agement of the Indians. In the United States 
               <lb/>
               the Government of the Indians was a source of 
               <lb/>
               great difficulty: it was said they cost the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on an average $50 a head; but with 
               <lb/>
               the co-operation of the Hudson's Bay Company 
               <lb/>
               under whose influence the Indians had grown 
               <lb/>
               up, and whose agencies were scattered all 
               <lb/>
               through the country, we would find ourselves 
               <lb/>
               advantageously situated in this respect. A 
               <lb/>
               short Indian war would probably cost us 
               <lb/>
               a great deal more than the whole sum would 
               <lb/>
               were we to pay for the territory. The next 
               <lb/>
               question, and the practical one we had to 
               <lb/>
               deal with, was what we were to do in the 
               <lb/>
               way of developing the territory. There had 
               <lb/>
               been laid on the desks of members today the 
               <lb/>
               last report by Mr. Dawson on this subject. 
               <lb/>
               He (Mr. McDougall) considered the first thing 
               <lb/>
               we had to do was to fill up the gaps in the 
               <lb/>
               fine chain of water communication between 
               <lb/>
               Lake Superior and Fort Garry. He had ob<lb break="no"/>served that some parties had been organ<lb break="no"/>izing companies, with the view of undertaking 
               <lb/>
               railway communication at once. He thought, 
               <lb/>
               however, on a close examination of the fea<lb break="no"/>tures of the country, it would be discovered 
               <lb/>
               that, if there was on this continent any por<lb break="no"/>tion of the country through which it would 
               <lb/>
               be exceedingly difficult to run a railway, it 
               <lb/>

               was this country lying between Lake Supe<lb break="no"/>rior and Fort Garry. It was a country of lakes, 
               <lb/>
               and it would occasionally be necessary to 
               <lb/>
               deviate 30 or 40 miles from a straight line to 
               <lb/>
               avoid these lakes. Until, therefore, the coun<lb break="no"/>try was better explored, and it was seen 
               <lb/>
               whether, as reported by the Indians, a level 
               <lb/>
               country was to be found farther to the north, 
               <lb/>
               the Government would be disposed to go on 
               <lb/>
               with the improvements already begun. It 
               <lb/>
               would be observed from Mr. Dawson's report 
               <lb/>
               that last year's exploration had resulted in 
               <lb/>
               the discovery of a route twenty miles shorter 
               <lb/>
               than the Dog Lake route formerly explored. 
               <lb/>
               The Government had assumed the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility of the appropriation of a sum of 
               <lb/>
               money for the relief of the distress of the 
               <lb/>
               Red River Settlement, and the amount thus 
               <lb/>
               appropriated having been expended in giving 
               <lb/>
               employment on a portion of the road from 
               <lb/>
               Fort Garry to Lake of the Woods,—35 miles, 
               <lb/>
               or one-third of the whole, had already been 
               <lb/>
               completed. If the House granted the necessary 
               <lb/>
               funds, he hoped that by another season there 
               <lb/>
               would be a line of wagon roads and water 
               <lb/>
               communication from the head of Lake Supe<lb break="no"/>rior to Fort Garry quite practicable for con<lb break="no"/>veying emigrants. It had been found that 
               <lb/>
               water communication was the best and 
               <lb/>
               cheapest for conveying emigrants, and also 
               <lb/>
               for a large proportion of the goods that would 
               <lb/>
               be taken west. In illustration of this proposi<lb break="no"/>tion, he quoted a statement by Mr. Hatch, 
               <lb/>
               showing that by the Erie Canal alone, as 
               <lb/>
               compared with railway communication, there 
               <lb/>
               had been effected a saving annually to the

               what was thought among the monied men 
               <lb/>
               of New York, of the capabilities of the terri<lb break="no"/>tory he had now acquired, that no sooner 
               <lb/>
               was it known there that this territory was 
               <lb/>
               about to pass from the Hudson's Bay Company 
               <lb/>
               into the hands of Canada, than steps were 
               <lb/>
               taken to push on immediately the railway 
               <lb/>
               from the head of Lake Superior to St. Paul. 
               <lb/>
               Some three or four millions of bonds for this 
               <lb/>
               purpose had been sold in the New York 
               <lb/>
               market, showing the confidence the public 
               <lb/>
               had in the value of railways in that section 
               <lb/>
               from the trade that would spring up in the 
               <lb/>
               settlement of the interior country. It was un<lb break="no"/>necessary to dwell on the importance of this 
               <lb/>
               acquisition to the people of Canada. We had 
               <lb/>
               passed that period. It was manifest, however, 
               <lb/>
               we had obtained a great inheritance. The 
               <lb/>
               facts regarding its value were well stated in 
               <lb/>
               Mr. Russell's recent work. Canada, with this 
               <lb/>
               country added to it, would be equal to the

               <lb/>
               organize and develop, and govern such a 
               <lb/>
               country would give scope and employment 
               <lb/>
               enough for all our skill and energies. The 
               <lb/>
               utmost anxiety had been shown by the Duke 
               <lb/>
               of Buckingham, the Earl of Granville, and 
               <lb/>
               other British Ministers to obtain for Canada 
               <lb/>

               <lb/>
               us, the control and management of the terri<lb break="no"/>tory, and it was evident that so soon as the 
               <lb/>
               transfer was made there would be in the 
               <lb/>
               mother country a strong desire on the part 
               <lb/>
               of those who wished to better their condition 
               <lb/>
               to emigrate to Canada, with the view of 
               <lb/>
               proceeding to the North-West, and there find<lb break="no"/>ing new homes under the shelter of British 
               <lb/>
               institutions. That desire already existed, and 
               <lb/>
               it would be very much increased when it 
               <lb/>
               became known that we had taken posssession 
               <lb/>
               of the country and organized a suitable Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment over it. He considered we were now 
               <lb/>
               on the eve of obtaining the great objects we 
               <lb/>
               had in contemplation. When the Coalition 
               <lb/>
               Government of 1864 was formed the Minister 
               <lb/>
               of Militia had informed the House that there 
               <lb/>
               was at that time a prospect of securing the 
               <lb/>
               admission of Newfoundland. We knew that 
               <lb/>
               British Columbia was only waiting the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of the question with regard to the 
               <lb/>
               Northwest territory, to ask admission also; so 
               <lb/>
               that we might look forward to having our 
               <lb/>
               Confederacy extend in a short time from 
               <lb/>
               ocean to ocean, as was contemplated in the 
               <lb/>
               Quebec resolutions. At the time of the Toronto 
               <lb/>
               Convention, he (Mr. McDougall) was subjected 
               <lb/>
               to a good deal of unpleasant comments from 
               <lb/>
               his former political friends, the member for 
               <lb/>
               Lambton and others, for having resolved to 
               <lb/>
               maintain his position in the Government until 
               <lb/>
               the work they had undertaken was com<lb break="no"/>pleted. He recollected the sneer with which 
               <lb/>
               the acquisition of the North West was re<lb break="no"/>ferred to, as if it would take many years to 
               <lb/>
               bring that about, and as if he made the com<lb break="no"/>pletion of the work merely an excuse for re<lb break="no"/>maining in office. He was proud to believe 
               <lb/>
               that they were now on the eve of the com<lb break="no"/>pletion of that work, and that it would be 
               <lb/>
               entirely completed before this Government, 
               <lb/>
               in its present form, was dissolved. Only when 
               <lb/>
               it was so completed would he feel that he had 
               <lb/>
               accomplished the work which he set about 
               <lb/>
               in 1864; and all the assaults made on him 
               <lb/>
               would fall harmless in presence of the fact 
               <lb/>
               that they had achieved a successful result 
               <lb/>
               in finishing the great work they had then 
               <lb/>

               <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. Mackenzie</persName> said that looking at the par<lb break="no"/>ticular point as to whether it was better to

               <lb/>
               step to close up the matter at once. He had 
               <lb/>
               never doubted that the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany had territorial rights in certain sections. 
               <lb/>
               But on the other hand he never had any 
               <lb/>
               doubt that they had no territorial rights in 
               <lb/>
               any portion of the territory likely to become 
               <lb/>
               valuable to this country. He dissented alto<lb break="no"/>gether from the view expressed by the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Public Works, who considered the 
               <lb/>
               payment of one million and a half net a large 
               <lb/>
               sum to get possession of all the North Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan Valley, Hudson's Bay and what<lb break="no"/>ever portion of Labrador the Company had. 
               <lb/>
               There was one matter which the delegates 
               <lb/>
               ought to have insisted on more strongly. From 
               <lb/>
               Sir Stafford Northcote's letter it was easily 
               <lb/>
               to be inferred that he thought the claim of 
               <lb/>
               the Company to the fertile Belt could not be 
               <lb/>
               maintained, and he could not conceive why, 
               <lb/>
               under the circumstances, the delegates should 
               <lb/>
               have assented to the Company's getting one- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               twentieth of this fertile tract to which they 
               <lb/>
               could maintain no title. He observed too, that 
               <lb/>
               the Canadian delegates in their note conveying 
               <lb/>
               the acceptance of the terms offered require 
               <lb/>
               that the proposal should be accepted pure 
               <lb/>
               and simple as submitted by Earl Granville, 
               <lb/>
               but the hon. gentleman subsequently accepted 
               <lb/>
               a modification of these terms, which was, in 
               <lb/>
               his (Mr. Mackenzie's) opinion, very objec<lb break="no"/>tionable. By Earl Granville's letter the North 
               <lb/>
               Saskatchewan was made the boundary of the 
               <lb/>
               fertile belt in which the Company might 
               <lb/>
               choose lands; but our delegates agreed to 
               <lb/>
               allow the Company to choose their one-twen<lb break="no"/>tieth on the north instead of the south branch 
               <lb/>
               of the Saskatchewan. The best portion of the 
               <lb/>
               land being on the north branch, it would be 
               <lb/>
               seen that the Company would in this instance 
               <lb/>
               make a most profitable exchange. Then, again, 
               <lb/>
               the delegates most unwisely agreed to the 
               <lb/>
               proposition that the townships to be formed 
               <lb/>
               on the north branch should not extend to a 
               <lb/>
               greater depth than five miles. In that case, 
               <lb/>
               the Company could obtain their twentieth 
               <lb/>
               within five miles of the river, while the 
               <lb/>
               settlers would have to go beyond the five 
               <lb/>
               miles, and allow the Company's land to be 
               <lb/>
               in front. The Company ought to have been 
               <lb/>
               bound to accept their one-twentieth in every 
               <lb/>
               section of the survey, no matter how far 
               <lb/>
               north it extended. Again, another condition 
               <lb/>
               agreed to was that no taxation should be 
               <lb/>
               imposed for a period of 10 years on the Com<lb break="no"/>pany's land. In this way it was agreed that 
               <lb/>
               the Company should not be bound to select 
               <lb/>
               their twentieth till the expiration of ten years, 
               <lb/>
               and during that period they would have the 
               <lb/>
               right to withhold the taxes from the munici<lb break="no"/>palities which might be formed.

               opening, as speedily as possible, a road where<lb break="no"/>by emigrants can reach the North West by

               population and country, he believed it would 
               <lb/>
               be impossible to absorb more than a certain 
               <lb/>
               proportion every year, until we reached that

               <lb/>
               he believed we would be able to fill up as fast 
               <lb/>
               as the territories were filled up by our Re<lb break="no"/>publican neighbours. The hon. gentleman pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to allude to the numbers leaving Can<lb break="no"/>ada annually—the surplusage of their popula<lb break="no"/>tion and expressed the belief that they would 
               <lb/>
               as soon as a road were opened go to people 
               <lb/>
               this great North West. As to a railroad to that 
               <lb/>
               section, it was not, as the Commissioner 
               <lb/>
               thought, impracticable, for he (Mr. Mackenzie) 
               <lb/>
               believed a good line might be constructed 
               <lb/>
               along the Ottawa Valley and behind the divid<lb break="no"/>ing ridge to the Lake Superior section and 
               <lb/>
               thence to Fort Garry. (Hear, hear.) He looked 
               <lb/>
               upon the acquisition of this territory as one 
               <lb/>
               of the most important transactions affecting 
               <lb/>

the Dominion at present, and trusted within 
               <lb/>
               a very few years to see thousands pour into 
               <lb/>
               this territory. With regard to the opening of 
               <lb/>
               the road, he alluded to the fact that the ver<lb break="no"/>million gold fields bordered on the river St. 
               <lb/>

               Francis and that the whole territory was rich 
               <lb/>
               in mineral wealth. It was none of his business 
               <lb/>
               he said to allude to the success of the mis<lb break="no"/>sion of their delegates to England. Indeed the 
               <lb/>
               Minister of Militia himself has said all that 
               <lb/>
               need be said on the question, (laughter), but 
               <lb/>

               he (Mr. Mackenzie) would state with pleasure 
               <lb/>
               that the documents in which these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men replied to the Company's pretensions were 
               <lb/>
               masterly productions. (Hear, hear.) One very 
               <lb/>
               noticeable omission had been made by the 
               <lb/>
               Minister of Militia in speaking on this theme. 
               <lb/>

               In his review of the history of this question 
               <lb/>
               for the past ten or twelve years, he (Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie) did expect to have heard some allusion 
               <lb/>
               to the services of the Hon. George Brown. He 
               <lb/>
               (Mr. Mackenzie) could not let the occasion 
               <lb/>
               pass without alluding to this old political 
               <lb/>

               friend, Mr. Brown, as one who had labored 
               <lb/>
               zealously and effectively to advance the open- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               up of this territory. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman went on to express his regret that 
               <lb/>
               the Government had not announced any 
               <lb/>
               scheme of Government for this North West, 
               <lb/>

               but left it to the last moment. (Cheers.) How<lb break="no"/>ever, even as it was he was disposed to sus<lb break="no"/>tain the arguments rather than protract the 
               <lb/>
               negotiations interminably.

               <persName ref="pers:GALT1">Hon. Mr. Galt</persName> desired to say a few words on 
               <lb/>
               the motion before the chair. When the extent 
               <lb/>
               of the territory was considered, its population 
               <lb/>
               and the vast influence it must exercise on our 
               <lb/>
               future, the bargain was in reality a good one. 
               <lb/>
               Ten times the habitable part of Canada only 
               <lb/>
               represented a portion of that land. The fertile 
               <lb/>
               belt and its resources were as great as its area 
               <lb/>
               was extensive. The whole question of its 
               <lb/>
               boundary was a very doubtful one, and it was 
               <lb/>
               very important that all questions of territorial 
               <lb/>
               rights should be set at rest: but he would add 
               <lb/>
               that the Imperial Government ought to have 
               <lb/>
               extinguished the Hudson's Bay Company 
               <lb/>
               claim, and borne so much of the preliminary 
               <lb/>
               expense attendant on its settlement and organ<lb break="no"/>ization. But they had not chosen to do so, and 
               <lb/>
               we were to close up this matter at once. This 
               <lb/>
               cession of territory opens up a new field of 
               <lb/>
               duty to us. We have to open up communica<lb break="no"/>tions with the territory, organize a govern<lb break="no"/>ment, establish law and order, and extinguish 
               <lb/>
               Indian titles. To provide for all this, unques<lb break="no"/>tionably we must prepare ourselves for ad<lb break="no"/>ditional taxation, or else the Ministry, as we 
               <lb/>
               hinted at, must come with a larger, broader

               measure for opening up communication with

               that country and developing it. This latter was 
               <lb/>
               unquestionably the best course to his mind; 
               <lb/>
               and to his mind such burdens were a fair 
               <lb/>
               charge on posterity, and should not be met 
               <lb/>
               by direct taxation. As to railway connection, 
               <lb/>
               he could not see why that by way of St. Paul 
               <lb/>
               should not be used in preference to construct<lb break="no"/>ing a very costly and roundabout line through

               our own country. He could not see any more

               objection to our people using such a route,

               that we have listened with very great interest

               intention to occupy the valuable time of this

               House by any lengthened remarks. As the

               subject is by far the most important which

               to trace the progress of Union on this British

               transference and boundary has been so well

               and ably defined by our delegates, Sir George

                   are as to the physical character of this 
               <lb/>
               country; its resources; climate; agricultural 
               <lb/>
               and commercial advantages. In spite of the

               disparaging accounts of Mr. Ellice and others, 
               <lb/>

               Hudson Bay Company, as to the territory

               and the support of human beings, we must 
               <lb/>
               acknowledge, however, from overwhelming 
               <lb/>
               authority, that the North West Territory is a 
               <lb/>

               grand estate, larger than most kingdoms, the 
               <lb/>
               very cream of which is larger than England 
               <lb/>
               and Wales together, and as nature in her 
               <lb/>
               march from east to west showered her 
               <lb/>
               treasures on the land of the United States, 
               <lb/>
               until she reached the Mississippi, so there she 
               <lb/>

               turned aside to favour British territory in a 
               <lb/>
               direction northward. As in the West, so in the 
               <lb/>
               North West, the country, in short terms, is a 
               <lb/>
               beautiful combination of rich prairies and 
               <lb/>
               woods of rolling hills and undulating valleys, 
               <lb/>
               of meadows, lakes and streams. The slow 
               <lb/>

               progress of this country as to settlement 
               <lb/>
               has led to most erroneous impressions in this 
               <lb/>
               respect. This is self-evident in tracing the 
               <lb/>
               process of colonization from its first inception 
               <lb/>
               under Lord Selkirk, in 1812, to the present 
               <lb/>
               time. Grand centres for fur trading occupied 
               <lb/>

               the entire attention, to the detriment of agri<lb break="no"/>culture and outside commerce. As time rolled 
               <lb/>
               on this primitive settlement increased in im<lb break="no"/>portance, and necessity rendered an outlet by 
               <lb/>
               land indispensable. American enterprise, ever 
               <lb/>
               on the alert, forwarded speedily a pioneer 
               <lb/>

               emigration northwards into Minnesota, to St. 
               <lb/>
               Paul, at the head of the Mississippi, from 
               <lb/>
               which point a road was formed to Fort Garry, 
               <lb/>
               over which the great portion of both the im<lb break="no"/>port and export trade is obliged to pass at 
               <lb/>
               even the present time. Not many years ago a 
               <lb/>

               trade was carried on with Montreal for the 
               <lb/>
               supply of the various articles of life, but even 
               <lb/>
               this soon subsided on the opening up of St. 
               <lb/>
               Paul; however, more recently, it is satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory to know, it is again being revived. The 
               <lb/>
               present population of the colony is about 
               <lb/>

               15,000 or 20,000, and its trade is increasing 
               <lb/>
               each year, amounting in 1867 to about 
               <lb/>
               $2,000,000. However, even this trade is tending 
               <lb/>
               at present more towards the United States

               than Canada. As certain evidence of this fact 
               <lb/>
               the importation of British manufactured 
               <lb/>

               <lb/>
               decreased in 1864 (with increased growth of 
               <lb/>
               the settlement) to £65,081, while the imports

               districts of British Columbia are not unlike

               Saskatchewan exceeds in this respect Brussels

               or Paris, while the prairies south of 55° have

               much milder winters than the more eastern

               garden vegetables, oats, rye, and barley can 
               <lb/>
               be profitably cultivated as far north as 54° 
               <lb/>
               in the Saskatchewan district, that wheat and 
               <lb/>
               various kinds of fruit are safe as far as 52° 
               <lb/>
               and maize to latitude 50°. There is but one

               opinion expressed by all explorers—British 
               <lb/>
               and American—as to the general productive<lb break="no"/>ness of the soil. The Red River Valley is by 
               <lb/>
               far the oldest part of the Winnipeg basin and 
               <lb/>
               its annual mean temperature is 34°—that

               Northern Illinois, Western Wisconsin, and

               In Red River barley is a favourable alternate 
               <lb/>
               of wheat, and gives excellent returns—the 
               <lb/>
               average weight of each bushel being from 48 
               <lb/>
               to 55 pounds. Oats and potatoes also thrive 
               <lb/>
               admirably, and Taylor gives his firm expres<lb break="no"/>sion to the idea, "that in none of the prairie 
               <lb/>
               districts of North America are the native 
               <lb/>
               grasses so abundant and nutritious as in these 
               <lb/>
               northern valleys." Doubtless there are occa<lb break="no"/>sional periodical inundations in that region of 
               <lb/>
               country where the Saskatchewan joins the 
               <lb/>
               lakes; however, this applies only to a limited 
               <lb/>
               extent of country, which, like the plains 
               <lb/>
               of Egypt on either side of the Nile will 
               <lb/>
               become centres of increased fertility. Accord<lb break="no"/>ing to Mr. Russell's report, the extent of 
               <lb/>
               cultivated land stretches over an area two 
               <lb/>
               and a half times as large as France, which 
               <lb/>
               supports 40,000,000 of people, and the cost to 
               <lb/>
               Canada at £300,000, which would amount to 
               <lb/>
               something less than half a cent per acre. The 
               <lb/>
               fertility of the Western States is proverbial 
               <lb/>
               ——and of these Minnesota is the youngest and 
               <lb/>
               farthest north, and has made the most rapid 
               <lb/>
               strides. So great has been the prosperity 
               <lb/>
               and growth of this State, that although it 
               <lb/>

years ago with
between four and five <lb/>
thousand inhabitants, it was admitted as a <lb/>
State ten years ago, with a population of <lb/>
more than 200,000 inhabitants. During the
<lb/>
late war, from this State alone, 15,000 soldiers <lb/>
went into the field, and paying besides a war <lb/>
tax, which, in 1864, amounted to upwards of <lb/>
$38,000,000, and the value of land has risen <lb/>
frmo $1 an acre to nearly $6 on an average. <lb/>
All this prosperity has taken place on the <lb/>
very borders of the Hudson's Bay Territory. <lb/>
North of the boundary line, from Canada to <lb/>
British Columbia, is a continuation of the <lb/>
glorious country which is the pride of Minne<lb break="no"/>sota, and under a stable form of government <lb/>
there is no reason why the same degree of <lb/>
prosperity, or even more, may not be devel<lb break="no"/>oped in the landed country of the Northwest. <lb/>
Mr. Dawson says the climate of Red River will <lb/>
compare generally with that of Kingston, Ont. <lb/>
In 1858 the ice moved in Red River on the <lb/>
3lst March, and ploughing was commenced on <lb/>
the 9th of April. Average depth of snow on <lb/>
prairies is 12 inches, and in the woods 16 <lb/>
inches. The buffalo are said to winter in the <lb/>
upper Athabasca as safely as at St. Paul's, <lb/>
Minnesota, and the spring opens at nearly the <lb/>
same time, along the immense line of plains, <lb/>
from St. Paul to the Mackenzie river. <lb/>

            <head> INDIANS <lb/>
            </head>

            <p> That the native tribes have diminished in
<lb/>
numbers during the past two centuries is <lb/>
without doubt, though there is some difficulty <lb/>
of agreement amongst travellers and others <lb/>
as to the exact causes. On this point no par<lb break="no"/>ticular benefit can arise from speculation, and, <lb/>
concording the fact, the question arises, how <lb/>
is it best to treat with Indians whenever their <lb/>
rights of property will interfere with the <lb/>
opening up of the country, whether merely <lb/>
for roads of approach or for actual settle<lb break="no"/>ment? It is true that the Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany have not hesitated to take whatever <lb/>
lands they required, unasked and unmolested, <lb/>
their interests not being inimical to those of <lb/>
the Indians. Under the Government of this <lb/>
Dominion, and with the system of free grants <lb/>
of lands, agricultural and mineral, a new state <lb/>
of things thus inaugurated will require, and <lb/>
doubtless receive, a wise and judicious course <lb/>
of action. That the Indians consider them<lb break="no"/>selves "Lords of the Soil," is evident from the <lb/>
reports of Mr. Dawson and others. This will <lb/>
also, no doubt, form one of the primary con<lb break="no"/>siderations of Government. So long as the <lb/>
operations are confined to providing access to <lb/>
Red River and the adjacent country, no great <lb/>
difficulty will likely arise in dealing with the <lb/>
Indians, who have already signified their wil<lb break="no"/>lingness to grant a right of way. However, <lb/>
with a view of protecting those who may be <lb/>
attracted to this rich and fertile region, in <lb/>
search of either mineral or agricultural
wealth, <lb/>
a large and comprehensive treaty will be <lb/>
found necessary. Of the accuracy of this state<lb break="no"/>ment, both Canada and the United States <lb/>
have precedents in previous treaties. <lb/>

               however, are worthy of the closest investiga<lb break="no"/>tion. Taking Toronto as a starting point, we 
               <lb/>
               find that the route to Fort Garry, Red River, 
               <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">via</hi> Lake Superior, is 1,069 miles, while be<lb break="no"/>tween the same points, <hi rendition="simple:italic">via</hi> the United States 
               <lb/>
               and St. Paul, the distance is 1,572 miles. Here 
               <lb/>
               we have a direct route through our own coun<lb break="no"/>try to commence with, and by water com<lb break="no"/>munication of 839 miles. This route will afford 
               <lb/>
               the cheapest mode of transport known for 
               <lb/>
               fully three-fourths of the distance. To the 
               <lb/>
               great saving of time and cost in furnishing 
               <lb/>
               the Red River District with supplies, must 
               <lb/>
               be added the difference between the cheap 
               <lb/>
               markets of Canada, and the dear markets of 
               <lb/>
               the United States, and with prohibitory and 
               <lb/>
               protective tariffs. To Canadian merchants a 
               <lb/>
               good market will here be secured, not only 
               <lb/>
               to the settlers in British territory, but also a 
               <lb/>
               share of the trade will thus inevitably be 
               <lb/>
               secured in the United States settlements of 
               <lb/>
               Northern Minnesota, and thus we will be 
               <lb/>
               enabled to return the compliment by a re<lb break="no"/>action in an opposite direction to that prac<lb break="no"/>tised on our trade in this northwest country

               for the emigrants than the one of older date

               alongside. With this territory under our con<lb break="no"/>trol, we will be enabled to offer greater in<lb break="no"/>ducements to the emigrant than at any pre<lb break="no"/>vious time in the history of the country. In

               taking possession of this vast estate, a broad 
               <lb/>
               and a liberal policy is requisite. The distance

               of the fertile belt of this rich country from 
               <lb/>
               Canada, proper renders it somewhat difficult

               of access and at whatever period we desire 
               <lb/>
               to open up and colonize the country, rapid 
               <lb/>
               means of communication must, as a necessary 
               <lb/>
               consequence, be obtained. If this vast territory

               <lb/>
               a communication with—and that without loss 
               <lb/>
               of time. Money invested so as to yield an

               adequate return, must have a solid project 
               <lb/>
               to back up the expenditures. Our American 
               <lb/>
               neighbours have just completed the Pacific 
               <lb/>
               Railroad, in itself the great marvel of the age 
               <lb/>
               —next to the Atlantic telegraph. The enter<lb break="no"/>prise is truly characteristic of the time. It 
               <lb/>
               was a question of <hi rendition="simple:italic">sublime audacity</hi> whoever 
               <lb/>
               thought it possible to lay down thousands of 
               <lb/>
               miles of track, climbing mountains 8,000 feet 
               <lb/>
               high, leaping gorges, and causing the Atlantic 
               <lb/>
               and Pacific shores to join in <hi rendition="simple:italic">an iron bond of 
               <lb/>
               Union</hi>. Whoever first conceived the idea ranks 
               <lb/>
               with a Watt, a Stevenson, and a Brunel. In 
               <lb/>
               1850 there only 9,000 miles of road in that 
               <lb/>
               country, and at present there are 60,000 miles. 
               <lb/>
               Men are not now content with the old way 
               <lb/>
               of accomplishing things. The Pacific Railroad 
               <lb/>
               is a specimen of the new and bolder system 
               <lb/>
               that now prevails. Man's intellectual power 
               <lb/>
               is gaining increased strength, so as to cor<lb break="no"/>respond with the magnitude of modern im<lb break="no"/>provements. When the Italian masters flour<lb break="no"/>ished, literature had its periods of dazzling 
               <lb/>
               brightness, such as the Elizabethian age. To<lb break="no"/>day is the period of grand conception and 
               <lb/>
               enterprises; and we Dominionists should feel 
               <lb/>
               proud of this age in which we live. The pro<lb break="no"/>tracted life of ancient times did not enable 
               <lb/>
               man to know even as much as is now accom<lb break="no"/>plished in a limited life time. To turn, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to our own soil, we here in Ottawa, 
               <lb/>
               are geographically and politically in the very 
               <lb/>
               heart of the world, equidistant from Europe 
               <lb/>
               on the one side, and Asia on the other; and 
               <lb/>
               the reasons why we should, and must, in the 
               <lb/>
               course of time, have a Pacific road of our 
               <lb/>
               own, are self-evident. It is all very well to 
               <lb/>
               theorise upon the point; but the fact is we 
               <lb/>
               cannot afford to have our right flank en<lb break="no"/>veloped by the extending lines of the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring country. If we can do like the

               Americans, in the construction of the Pacific 
               <lb/>
               railway, utilize our domain, the time is not

               trade results of the Far West will flow south 
               <lb/>
               of Lake Michigan to the Atlantic. A rail<lb break="no"/>way from Montreal, passing through the val<lb break="no"/>ley of the Ottawa—the route which nature 
               <lb/>
               has marked out, and north of Lake Huron, 
               <lb/>
               to Vancouver—would give us a Canadian At<lb break="no"/>lantic seaport, hundreds of miles nearer the

               Pacific, with easier grades and numerous 
               <lb/>
               other advantages over any route the Amer<lb break="no"/>icans can adopt. Some time may, doubtless, 
               <lb/>
               elapse prior to the construction of so stupen<lb break="no"/>dous a work, but I am satisfied that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this country will adopt a liberal 
               <lb/>
               and an enlightened policy in the acquisition 
               <lb/>
               of the North West Territory, so that it may

               not burden the people of the Dominion too 
               <lb/>
               heavily with taxation, and in order to ac<lb break="no"/>complish such, the railway and the territory

               <lb/>
               was undoubtedly one of the very greatest im<lb break="no"/>portance to the Dominion. It was a question 
               <lb/>
               not merely of accession of territory, but one 
               <lb/>
               which must for weal or woe affect the desti<lb break="no"/>nies of the Dominion for all time to come 
               <lb/>
               (hear, hear). During the last session he had ob<lb break="no"/>jected to the course pursued by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this matter, on somewhat similar 
               <lb/>
               grounds to those more recently alluded to by 
               <lb/>
               the hon. member for Sherbrooke,——that this 
               <lb/>
               territory should be purchased by the Imperial, 
               <lb/>
               and not the Dominion authorities,—if purchas<lb break="no"/>ed at all. And he had also objected, because 
               <lb/>
               the people of New Brunswick did not under<lb break="no"/>stand, at Confederation, that any such pur<lb break="no"/>chase was needed. Not merely in New 
               <lb/>
               Brunswick, but in Nova Scotia the people 
               <lb/>
               were led to believe by the public men 
               <lb/>
               of Canada that this territory belonged to 
               <lb/>
               Canada; and, speaking as a representa<lb break="no"/>tive from New Brunswick, he was well 
               <lb/>
               aware that the action of the Ministry in bring<lb break="no"/>ing down a measure authorizing them to pur<lb break="no"/>chase this territory, was altogether unexpected 
               <lb/>
               by the people of his Province. He had carefully 
               <lb/>
               looked over the records connected with this

               Hudson Bay Territory, and had long ago come 
               <lb/>
               to the conclusion that the company had rights

               to a portion of that territory—the northern

               <lb/>
               (hear, hear). Hon. gentlemen would see that in 
               <lb/>
               sanctioning the resolutions before the House 
               <lb/>
               they assumed a great deal of responsibility. 
               <lb/>
               But they had now virtually assumed that 
               <lb/>

               responsibility, and must see to it that they 
               <lb/>
               made their position a good one. He could easily 
               <lb/>
               see that in passing these resolutions we might, 
               <lb/>
               in some respects, be only doing that which 
               <lb/>
               would prove a benefit to the United States. 
               <lb/>

               Once we had acquired the Northwest, unless 
               <lb/>
               we took proper steps to open it up, and organ<lb break="no"/>ize it, we would, as he had said, benefit our 
               <lb/>
               neighbours across the line, and not ourselves. 
               <lb/>
               But he sincerely hoped another course of 
               <lb/>
               action would be taken. It certainly behooved 
               <lb/>

               us to be very careful, now that we were as<lb break="no"/>suming responsibilities of the greatest magni<lb break="no"/>tude. We had passed the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               Way Loan—had voted $50,000 annually to the 
               <lb/>
               Governor-General—and there was undoubted<lb break="no"/>ly some ground for apprehending that if we 
               <lb/>

               continued on as we had been doing for the 
               <lb/>
               past two years, we would inevitably find our<lb break="no"/>selves in the condition recently alluded to by 
               <lb/>
               the Minister of Militia, of having to resort to 
               <lb/>
               direct taxation in order to meet our engage<lb break="no"/>ments (hear, hear). That was an evil which 
               <lb/>

               threatened us in the future, and from which 
               <lb/>
               he saw but one way of escape, and that was 
               <lb/>
               by assisting, as far as practicable, in promo<lb break="no"/>ting public works for the benefit of the 
               <lb/>
               Dominion (hear, hear). If this Dominion is 
               <lb/>
               ever to be prosperous, beyond all question we 
               <lb/>

               must bring our energies to bear in organising 
               <lb/>
               a system of public improvements. With a well- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               planned system, such as this, we can hope to 
               <lb/>
               draw amongst us, and provide for, thousands 
               <lb/>
               of the over-crowded populations of Europe. 
               <lb/>
               But without it, we can do nothing. We have 
               <lb/>

               fertile lands almost boundless in extent, but 
               <lb/>
               unless we can promote their settlement, they 
               <lb/>
               are worse than useless to us. What he wanted 
               <lb/>
               to impress on the House was this. We are now 
               <lb/>
               about to acquire a vast domain in the North<lb break="no"/>west, and we must at once take measures to 
               <lb/>

               open it up. Let there be communication by a 
               <lb/>
               railway or some other means, but let the mat<lb break="no"/>ter be set about promptly. The interests of the 
               <lb/>
               people of New Brunswick were not so im<lb break="no"/>mediately bound up with the acquisition and 
               <lb/>
               development of this territory, as were those of 
               <lb/>

               the people in the west. But he felt that if this 
               <lb/>
               Dominion was ever to be anything, it must be 
               <lb/>
               by acting as a united people, who sought ear<lb break="no"/>nestly the development, not of a section mere<lb break="no"/>ly, but of the whole country (cheers). And in 
               <lb/>
               this particular instance they had a very heavy 
               <lb/>

               stake in following out the course he alluded 
               <lb/>
               to. If this North West Territory were only 
               <lb/>
      
            <pb n="503" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0503.jpg"/>
            
      
               half as rich as it was described to be, not 
               <lb/>
               merely by the Hon. the Minister of Militia 
               <lb/>
               and Minister of Public Works and others, 
               <lb/>
               but by almost every writer who had des<lb break="no"/>cribed it, the Dominion had, indeed, made 
               <lb/>
               a most advantageous bargain. But, as he 
               <lb/>
               had said, to make the bargain valuable, im<lb break="no"/>mediate steps must be taken to secure the 
               <lb/>
               opening up of that region. Another point 
               <lb/>
               of considerable importance had reference to 
               <lb/>
               the treatment of the Indians in this ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. If their title were not fairly extin<lb break="no"/>guished, and efficient steps taken to secure 
               <lb/>
               the peace of that section, it was to be feared 
               <lb/>
               that with the advance of civilization there 
               <lb/>
               would be a repetition of those horrible scenes 
               <lb/>
               of rapine and butchery which had marked 
               <lb/>
               frontier life in the Western States. Now, this 
               <lb/>
               must by all means be avoided. Not only must 
               <lb/>
               the country be settled, but the settlers must be 
               <lb/>
               protected at the public expense in some way or 
               <lb/>
               other (cheers). To show that he had long held 
               <lb/>
               these views, the hon. gentleman quoted from 
               <lb/>
               some of his speeches in 1865, at the time of 
               <lb/>
               the first Confederation campaign. The country 
               <lb/>
               he represented was one of the first which car<lb break="no"/>ried a vote in favour of Confederation. He 
               <lb/>
               thought it an honour they had taken that 
               <lb/>
               stand; and he knew they would be gratified 
               <lb/>
               to learn that he had in no respect altered his 
               <lb/>
               opinions regarding that great change. Address<lb break="no"/>ing his constituents in February, 1865, he said: 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>

               "The Hudson's Bay Territory, with 2,260,<lb break="no"/>000 square miles, will also at some not far 
               <lb/>
               distant day, be comprised in the Confederacy. 
               <lb/>
               Extensive settlements now existing on the

               <lb/>

               <lb/>
               these extensive territories may, and doubtless

               will, in process of time, find themselves 
               <lb/>
               forming links in this great chain, which is to 
               <lb/>
               bind the now existing colonies together, not 
               <lb/>
               only with the benefit of each individual part 
               <lb/>
               in view, but also the great benefit of all con<lb break="no"/>nectedly, as a grand object, and the formation 
               <lb/>
               of a closer connection with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try; the firm establishment of British domin<lb break="no"/>ion being worth large sacrifices to obtain.

               Few countries are richer in mineral resources

               than that which is contained within the

               bounds of the proposed Confederacy. We have 
               <lb/>
               minerals exhaustless in quantity, only requir<lb break="no"/>ing capital and labour to develope them. With 
               <lb/>
               the well known enterprise of the people of 
               <lb/>
               these colonies, we may fairly hope we are on 
               <lb/>
               the way to prosperity and wealth (hear,

               These were his opinions at that period, and 
               <lb/>
               from them he had not deviated. That con<lb break="no"/>stituency had stood by him and elected him

               for the last 20 years, and he had never during 
               <lb/>
               all that period deceived them. He had al<lb break="no"/>ways, and consistently, sought to advance not 
               <lb/>
               merely the interests of his constituents, but 
               <lb/>
               of the Empire at large. Further to show that 
               <lb/>

               in taking his present stand he was acting 
               <lb/>
               consistently, he would quote an extract from 
               <lb/>
               the proceedings of the Quebec Conference, 
               <lb/>
               which laid the foundation of the Act under 
               <lb/>
               which we are governed. One of the articles 
               <lb/>
               in the scheme stated: "The communication 
               <lb/>

               with the North West Territory, and the im<lb break="no"/>provements required for the development of 
               <lb/>
               the trade of the Great West with the seaboard, 
               <lb/>
               are regarded by this Conference as subjects 
               <lb/>
               of the highest importance to the Federated 
               <lb/>
               Provinces, and shall be prosecuted at the 
               <lb/>

               earliest possible period that the state of the 
               <lb/>
               finances will permit." Now, he was not going 
               <lb/>
               to shirk the responsibility of that declaration. 
               <lb/>
               As a member of the New Brunswick Legis<lb break="no"/>lature and Government, he had aided in car<lb break="no"/>rying out Confederation, and he would not 
               <lb/>

               now seek to undo what he had done, and what 
               <lb/>
               had received the hearty approval of his consti<lb break="no"/>tuents. There were, he knew, drawbacks to 
               <lb/>
               this Confederation scheme; but these had 
               <lb/>
               been owing not so much to that scheme itself 
               <lb/>
               as to a lack of proper administration on the 
               <lb/>

               part of the Government, and their adoption 
               <lb/>
               of a policy at once unsound and opposed to 
               <lb/>
               the wishes and interests of the Maritime 
               <lb/>
               Provinces. With the experience since gained 
               <lb/>
               by the Dominion Government, the errors of 
               <lb/>
               the past would, he hoped, not be repeated 
               <lb/>

               (cheers.) The hon. gentleman having again 
               <lb/>
               pressed on the Government the danger which 
               <lb/>
               would result from delay in opening up the 
               <lb/>
               North West Territory—and having urged that 
               <lb/>
               their magnificient purchase should not be ren<lb break="no"/>dered valueless by an inefficient, tardy means 
               <lb/>

               of communication—went on to allude to the 
               <lb/>
               speedy development of new territories in the 
               <lb/>
               Union by the use of British capital. With 
               <lb/>
               British gold the people of the States were 
               <lb/>
               every day opening up fresh channels of trade, 
               <lb/>
               building railroads and canals, and in every 
               <lb/>

               way developing their resources. Could we not 
               <lb/>
               do so? Our resources were great enough, and 
               <lb/>
               enterprises, as profitable as any in the States, 
               <lb/>
               could be found on this side (cheers). The hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman concluded by expressing his doubts 
               <lb/>
               as to the wisdom of allowing the Hudson 
               <lb/>

               Bay Company such a large reservation of 
               <lb/>
               land. It was, he thought, quite enough for 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion to open up this new country, 
               <lb/>
               and govern it, without to pay besides a large 
               <lb/>
               amount of money, and give a large reserva<lb break="no"/>tion. But, sooner than agree to this land 
               <lb/>

               reservation at all events, he thought that it 
               <lb/>
               might have been bettter to get rid of their 
               <lb/>
               
       
            <pb n="505" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0505.jpg"/>
            
          claims altogether by a money payment. The 
               <lb/>
               scheme had, however, been arranged, and, as 
               <lb/>
               he believed it would not be wise now to re<lb break="no"/>open it, he would support the resolutions 
               <lb/>
               (cheers).

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:MCDO1">Mr. A. P. McDonald</persName> approved of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions; but differed from the Minister of Public 
               <lb/>
               Works as to the best mode of opening up com<lb break="no"/>munication with the territory. The great dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty with regard to it was the want of 
               <lb/>
               access to it. We had to take a jump of 400 
               <lb/>
               miles before we reached the edge of it. The 
               <lb/>
               proposed mixed route he did not think was 
               <lb/>
               either feasible or practicable. Would an emi<lb break="no"/>grant be induced to go 1,200 miles by a mixed 
               <lb/>
               route to reach the Red River, when at Cleve<lb break="no"/>land or Detroit he could meet railway com<lb break="no"/>munication to take him into the Western 
               <lb/>
               States. He maintained that the only way by 
               <lb/>
               which we could make that Territory available, 
               <lb/>
               was by building a railway, giving grants of 
               <lb/>
               land to aid its construction. He ventured to 
               <lb/>
               say that with a mixed route, 10,000 emigrants 
               <lb/>
               would not be induced to go into that Country. 
               <lb/>
               Without a railroad, the North West Territory 
               <lb/>
               would be a mill-stone round the neck of this 
               <lb/>
               Dominion. The million and a half now asked 
               <lb/>
               for would not pay for the Territory. The 
               <lb/>
               200,000 Indians found there, would claim as 
               <lb/>
               much for their rights as the Hudson's Bay 
               <lb/>
               Company. He went on to contend that a rail<lb break="no"/>road would pay for its own construction, and 
               <lb/>
               was the only feasible means of filling up the 
               <lb/>
               country with an industrious population. The 
               <lb/>
               acquisition of the North West had been a 
               <lb/>
               leading plank in the platform of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment party. Now that they had got it, he 
               <lb/>
               hoped they would find the benefit of it, and 
               <lb/>

               <persName ref="pers:CHIP1">Mr. Chipman</persName> considered if they had 200,000 
               <lb/>
               Indians to manage when they went to survey 
               <lb/>
               the country and cut it up into blocks for set<lb break="no"/>tlement, they would have a good deal of 
               <lb/>
               trouble with them. He was afraid this whole 
               <lb/>
               scheme was to involve a great deal of in<lb break="no"/>creased expenditure and increased taxation. 
               <lb/>
               First they had to pay £300,000 to the Hudson's 
               <lb/>
               Bay Company, besides the land they reserved. 
               <lb/>
               Then they had railways and telegraphs to 
               <lb/>
               build, and a long frontier to defend and after 
               <lb/>
               all they had 800 miles to travel before they 
               <lb/>
               reached an acre of land that was worth a cent. 
               <lb/>
               However, if they were to make a fortune by 
               <lb/>
               this territory, he thought they could af<lb break="no"/>ford to let Nova Scotia go. (Laughter.)

               <persName ref="pers:LEVE1">Mr. Le Vesconte</persName> moved in amendment.

               "That in the opinion of this House it is in<lb break="no"/>expedient to acquire a territory likely to in<lb break="no"/>volve this Dominion in a heavy expense 
               <lb/>
               without any prospect of adequate remunera<lb break="no"/>tion." In supporting his amendment he re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the strong views expressed last ses<lb break="no"/>sion by the President of the Council against 
               <lb/>
               acquiring the North West. He entirely shared 
               <lb/>
               these views, and accordingly moved this

               made by the Minister of Militia. Honourable

               gentlemen opposite were so practiced in ter<lb break="no"/>giversation that they seemed to take it for

            <pb n="507" facs="final/images/Man_H_of_C_1869-05-28_Page_0507.jpg"/>
            
    
               granted that the gentlemen opposed to them 
               <lb/>
               would be as ready to turn their backs on 
               <lb/>
               themselves, as they in their past career had 
               <lb/>
               shown themselves to be. He (Mr. Holton) had 
               <lb/>
               never learned that art. He had felt himself 
               <lb/>
               constrained, by reason of his own antecedents 
               <lb/>
               in connection with this subject, in common 
               <lb/>
               with every man who had held office in this 
               <lb/>
               country during the last ten years, to stand 
               <lb/>
               by the proposition to acquire this territory. 
               <lb/>
               He had always contended that it was right 
               <lb/>
               to take steps to acquire it although he might 
               <lb/>
               take exception to the terms on which it had 
               <lb/>
               been acquired. If an amendment had been 
               <lb/>
               moved finding fault with any one of the con<lb break="no"/>ditions on which the territory was acquired, 
               <lb/>
               he would have voted for it, but he could not, 
               <lb/>
               under any circumstances, vote against the 
               <lb/>
               acquisition of the territory itself. He must, 
               <lb/>
               like the member for Lambton, express his 
               <lb/>
               surprise that the mover and seconder of the 
               <lb/>
               resolutions had made no reference to the agen<lb break="no"/>cy of the Hon. George Brown in connection 
               <lb/>
               with this whole subject. He remembered very 
               <lb/>
               well when the initiatory step towards the 
               <lb/>
               acquisition of this territory was taken by 
               <lb/>
               that gentleman. If any public man in this 
               <lb/>
               country had the credit of initiating the agi<lb break="no"/>tation which had led to this result, it was 
               <lb/>
               Mr. Brown and he had been all along its 
               <lb/>
               principal promoter. On him would rest prin<lb break="no"/>cipally the responsibility it the measure 
               <lb/>
               eventuated unfortunately for this country, 
               <lb/>
               and to him on the contrary would belong 
               <lb/>
               the largest measure of credit that would 
               <lb/>
               appertain to any public man if it should 
               <lb/>
               turn out, as they all hoped it would, of 
               <lb/>
               the highest advantage to this country. He 
               <lb/>
               regretted that that gentleman was not now 
               <lb/>
               in the House to bear a part in the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of this question, but as he was out 
               <lb/>
               of the House he thought his important agen<lb break="no"/>cy in bringing about what was now to be ac<lb break="no"/>complished, should be recognized and avowed 
               <lb/>
               in this public manner. (Hear, hear) He re<lb break="no"/>gretted with his hon. friend from Lambton 
               <lb/>
               that some reference had not been made to 
               <lb/>
               that hon. gentleman by the mover, and still 
               <lb/>
               more by the seconder of these resolutions, for 
               <lb/>
               they must all know what the relations of that 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentleman had been to Mr. Brown at the 
               <lb/>
               outset and throughout the most of his public 
               <lb/>
               career. He had been the protege and follower 
               <lb/>
               of Mr. Brown, not only in this matter, but in 
               <lb/>
               nearly every other political movement in 
               <lb/>
               which he had been engaged. Under these cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances it would have come well from that 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentleman to have uttered some few

               words of acknowledgment of the services of

               had intended to have referred to the position 
               <lb/>
               of the question tonight as justifying the 
               <lb/>
               course he and Mr. Blake took last session, in 
               <lb/>
               moving an amendment declaring that the ad<lb break="no"/>dress then submitted would not bring about 
               <lb/>
               an acquisition of the territory, but he would 
               <lb/>
               waive doing so on account of the lateness of 
               <lb/>
               the hour and the weariness of the House.

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:CART2">Sir George E. Cartier</persName> denied that he was li<lb break="no"/>able to the charge of tergiversation in any part 
               <lb/>
               of his political career. He accused the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Chateauguay of having, some time 
               <lb/>
               deserted Baldwin and Lafontaine, and de<lb break="no"/>clared that he (Sir George E. Cartier) stood by 
               <lb/>
               the principles of those great men during the 
               <lb/>
               fourteen years that he had been leading the 
               <lb/>
               Lower Canada majority. He denied also that 
               <lb/>
               his colleagues in public had been guilty of 
               <lb/>
               tergiversation. As regarded his not having

               mentioned the Hon. Mr. Brown, the member 
               <lb/>
               for Lambton had scarcely done him justice. 
               <lb/>
               When he alluded to the mission to England, in 
               <lb/>
               which Mr. Galt and the Hon. John Rose took 
               <lb/>
               part, it was to show how long the question had 
               <lb/>
               been pending. He had not intended to omit 
               <lb/>
               mention of the name of Mr. Brown or his use<lb break="no"/>fulness with regard to this question. It was 
               <lb/>
               well known to this Parliament and throughout 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion the important part, Mr. Brown 
               <lb/>
               took with reference to this question in the

               proceedings of the delegates to England in 
               <lb/>
               1865, and it was with great pleasure he found 
               <lb/>
               on his recent return from England that when 
               <lb/>
               there were some attempts to prejudice the 
               <lb/>
               public mind with reference to some arrange<lb break="no"/>ments, Mr. Brown had stood up for his prin<lb break="no"/>ciples and defended those arrangements. In 
               <lb/>
               the despatch of June, 1865, which Mr. Brown, 
               <lb/>
               with his delegates, signed and agreed to, it 
               <lb/>
               was stated that after the settlement of the 
               <lb/>
               question it would be necessary to pay a sum of 
               <lb/>
               money that the imperial guarantee should be 
               <lb/>
               obtained, and it was following up the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment in that despatch that they now came be<lb break="no"/>fore the House asking its sanction to these 
               <lb/>
               resolutions. If any one regretted the absence

               of Mr. Brown from this House he (Sir George 
               <lb/>
               Cartier) did, and if he had been here he would 
               <lb/>
               not, because he had mentioned his name in 
               <lb/>
               connection with a previous delegation, having 
               <lb/>
               accused him of wishing to appreciate his use<lb break="no"/>fulness in the settlement of this question.
