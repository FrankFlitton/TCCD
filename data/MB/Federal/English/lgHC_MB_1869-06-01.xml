            <!--<p>
               petitions which had come in had been carried 
               <lb/>
               round by bank clerks (hear, hear), and an ex<lb break="no"/>pression had been forced from the country. 
               <lb/>
               He deprecated entering into a controversy 
               <lb/>
               with the large and important interests of the 
               <lb/>
               country; but a government unable to deal with 
               <lb/>
               such a question was unworthy of its position. 
               <lb/>
               It had been represented that the Government 
               <lb/>
               should have been overawed by this manifesta<lb break="no"/>tion of public opinion; but the same opposition 
               <lb/>
               had been manifested in England to Sir Robert 
               <lb/>
               Peel's measure, the same opposition had to be 
               <lb/>
               overcome in France; and the same in India 
               <lb/>
               when Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Lang, introduced 
               <lb/>
               a measure similar in principle to that em<lb break="no"/>bodied in these resolutions. He wished it to be 
               <lb/>
               remembered that there were three distinct sys<lb break="no"/>tems now in operation within the Dominion, 
               <lb/>
               and the large public works going on in the 
               <lb/>
               East, and soon to be going on in the West, 
               <lb/>
               would create a larger field for banking opera<lb break="no"/>tions, that would render these three separate 
               <lb/>
               systems utterly unreliable and dangerous to 
               <lb/>
               the public interests. His hon. friend had 
               <lb/>
               spoken as if there was entirely a new sys<lb break="no"/>tem of banking proposed; but the only changes 
               <lb/>
               in the system were with respect to the power 
               <lb/>
               of the banks to issue notes. When they found 
               <lb/>
               themselves at the beginning of a new national 
               <lb/>
               existence they required a policy suited to the 
               <lb/>
               altered circumstances of the country. This 
               <lb/>
               measure had been spoken of as a proposal by 
               <lb/>
               the Government to take from the banks the 
               <lb/>
               powers they possessed, but was that the case? 
               <lb/>
               The bank charters are about to expire; the 
               <lb/>
               powers of the banks are about to lapse, and 
               <lb/>
               as they come to ask for a renewal of their 
               <lb/>
               charters the Government lay down the condi<lb break="no"/>tions upon which these charters may be ex<lb break="no"/>tended. This was a very different measure 
               <lb/>
               from that of Sir Robert Peel, which prohibi<lb break="no"/>ted the banks of issue from making any fur<lb break="no"/>ther issue of notes.
