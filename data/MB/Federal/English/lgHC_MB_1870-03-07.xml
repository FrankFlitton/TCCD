     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. Mackenzie</persName> said that before going on

     with the "questions" by members, he wished to 
     <lb/>
     bring a matter to the attention of the House. 
     <lb/>
     He said that on Friday last the report of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee appointed to look over the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     West papers, was brought down. He under<lb break="no"/>stood that the correspondents of some of the 
     <lb/>
     newspapers had got possession of some of the 
     <lb/>
     papers connected with that report. It would be 
     <lb/>
     well if these gentlemen should understand that 
     <lb/>
     these documents should not be published 
     <lb/>

     before they were laid before the House, and 
     <lb/>
     that no newspaper should get them before the 
     <lb/>
     House did. If the practice of allowing the press 
     <lb/>
     to have the use of these papers was to be 
     <lb/>
     continued, it was only fair that they should be 
     <lb/>
     given to all the newspapers at the same time.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald</persName> said, as he 
     <lb/>
     understood the matter, these and all other 
     <lb/>
     papers were brought down for the use of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the House and no person should 
     <lb/>
     get them before them. The prime object in 
     <lb/>
     getting down papers was for the use of the 
     <lb/>
     House. That the information should be given to 
     <lb/>
     the public, through the press, was a secondary 
     <lb/>
     consideration.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. Mackenzie</persName> said the members of the 
     <lb/>
     press were not to be blamed, because, as a rule, 
     <lb/>
     they had been allowed to get possession of 
     <lb/>
     these documents as soon as they were brought 
     <lb/>
     down; but, in this case, where eliminations 
     <lb/>
     were to be made, it was not expedient that they 
     <lb/>
     should have been taken away. However, the 
     <lb/>
     general rule authorized the press correspond<lb break="no"/>ents in their attempts to get the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     papers.

     <lb/>
     that they were not then public, and had not the 
     <lb/>
     members of the press a right to get them and 
     <lb/>
     print them? He had always understood that 
     <lb/>
     papers were published, and were public prop<lb break="no"/>erty as soon as they were brought down to the

     House.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald</persName> said that these 
     <lb/>
     papers were given to the press as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     practice, but still the principle should not be 
     <lb/>
     violated, that the House should have the com<lb break="no"/>plete control of papers laid on the table.
