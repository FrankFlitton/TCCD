               Hon. Mr. Galt—Perhaps Earl Granville had

               something to do in convincing them.

               Hon. Mr. McDougall thought it probable 
               <br />
               that Earl Granville’s persuasive eloquence had 
               <br />
               something to do with it. As regards the 
               <br />
               reserve of one-twentieth of the land, he 
               <br />
               believed it would be a great advantage 
               <br />
               to us to have a great company like this with 
               <br />
               a direct interest in the development and 
               <br />
               improvement of the country. This would be a 
               <br />
               great advantage to us if for example we had 
               <br />
               to go into the money market to borrow money 
               <br />
               for improving the Territory. One-twentieth 
               <br />
               was after all a small proportion of the land as 
               <br />
               compared with one-seventh reserved for the 
               <br />
               Clergy of Upper Canada, and which had un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly been an obstacle to the improve- 
               <br />
               ment of the Country. It had been arranged 
               <br />
               also through the efforts of the delegates, that 
               <br />
               the reserved lands should be subject to tax- 
               <br />
               ation from the outset, which was a very im- 
               <br />
               portant difference from the Clergy Reserve 
               <br />
               arrangement. The Hudson’s Bay Company 
               <br />
               would occupy a very different relation to- 
               <br />
               wards Canada from what they had hitherto 
               <br />
               done. Formerly their interest had been to keep 
               <br />
               settlers out of the Country, their interests were 
               <br />
               in all respects adverse to those of Canada. Now 
               <br />
               their interests would be the same as ours, and 
               <br />
               they would heartily co-operate with us. We 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd this a great advantage in the man- 
               <br />
               agement of the Indians. In the United States 
               <br />
               the Government of the Indians was a source of 
               <br />
               great difficulty: it was said they cost the Gov— 
               <br />
               ernment on an average $50 a head; but with 
               <br />
               the co-operation of the Hudson’s Bay Company 
               <br />
               under whose inﬂuence the Indians had grown 
               <br />
               up, and whose agencies were scattered all 
               <br />
               through the country, we would ﬁnd ourselves 
               <br />
               advantageously situated in this respect. A 
               <br />
               short Indian war would probably cost us 
               <br />
               a great deal more than the whole sum would 
               <br />
               were we to pay for the territory. The next 
               <br />
               question, and the practical one we had to 
               <br />
               deal with, was what we were to do in the 
               <br />
               way of developing the territory. There had 
               <br />
               been laid on the desks of members today the 
               <br />
               last report by Mr. Dawson on this subject. 
               <br />
               He (Mr. McDougall) considered the ﬁrst thing 
               <br />
               we had to do was to ﬁll up the gaps in the 
               <br />
               ﬁne chain of water communication between 
               <br />
               Lake Superior and Fort Garry. He had ob- 
               <br />
               served that some parties had been organ- 
               <br />
               izing companies, with the view of undertaking 
               <br />
               railway communication at once. He thought, 
               <br />
               however, on a close examination of the fea- 
               <br />
               tures of the country, it would be discovered 
               <br />
               that, if there was on this continent any por- 
               <br />
               tion of the country through which it would 
               <br />
               be exceedingly difficult to run a railway, it
