               by settlers in the bush, where a man’s life- 
               <br />
               time almost was spent before he could earn 
               <br />
               a competency; while, in this new territory, a 
               <br />
               poor man could go in and get a splendid start 
               <br />
               in a couple of years. As a grazing country, too, 
               <br />
               it had no superior. But the ﬁrst thing to be 
               <br />
               secured, on the acquisition of that territory, 
               <br />
               would be good and easy communication be- 
               <br />
               tween Canada and the North-West, through 
               <br />
               the British territory. For the last two years 
               <br />
               the Government had been engaged in open- 
               <br />
               ing a road between Thunder Bay, Lake Supe- 
               <br />
               rior, and Fort Garry. His opinion was that 
               <br />
               there was only one mode of communication 
               <br />
               by which they could hope to accomplish 
               <br />
               much in that section, and that was by rail- 
               <br />
               road. If the Dominion had not cash enough, 
               <br />
               then let them give lands to build such a rail- 
               <br />
               road. One of the earliest steps to be taken 
               <br />
               regarding the North-West was, the formation 
               <br />
               of a proper Government there. A land oiﬁce 
               <br />
               of some description ought also be speedily 
               <br />
               established. The aborigines, he would also 
               <br />
               remind them, had to be dealt with. A very 
               <br />
               material step to take would be the establish- 
               <br />
               ment of a department which would act hon- 
               <br />
               ourably and justly towards the Indians; and 
               <br />
               though the Hudson’s Bay Company was ex- 
               <br />
               cessively unpopular in Canada, he believed 
               <br />
               the Government could not do better than take 
               <br />
               a leaf out of the Company’s books, in the 
               <br />
               management of the Indians. The Company 
               <br />
               certainly never had any trouble with them; 
               <br />
               but had since they came into their country 
               <br />
               always maintained the most friendly rela- 
               <br />
               tions with the aborigines. In the North-West, 
               <br />
               he conceived, free grants of land would have 
               <br />
               to be made. The reservation of the treaty to 
               <br />
               be given to the Company had been objected 
               <br />
               to; but he thought it indispensable even if 
               <br />
               regard were had merely to that class of the 
               <br />
               Company’s <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcers</span> which conducted their 
               <br />
               trade in the country. Many of them had left 
               <br />
               their homes when young. It was certain the 
               <br />
               stockholders in London would never give 
               <br />
               them a sixpence on transferring the terri- 
               <br />
               tory, and these traders were men unﬁtted for 
               <br />
               the ordinary occupations of life. It would be 
               <br />
               hard to cast them abroad on the world with- 
               <br />
               out giving them a chance. In connection with 
               <br />
               the opening up of this territory, something 
               <br />
               had to be done to improve navigation on 
               <br />
               Lakes Huron and Superior. Additional steam-<br />
               boat communication and harbours of refuge 
               <br />
               would have to be provided. Coming to the 
               <br />
               paragraphs regarding the admission of New-
