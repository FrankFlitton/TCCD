               Sir George E. Cartier was not surprised to 
               <br />
               hear the interruptions of the member for 
               <br />
               Chateauguay. He supposed the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man was to build up a great argument against 
               <br />
               that, and to refer to the Clergy Reserves of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada as having obstructed the pro- 
               <br />
               gress of the country. The arrangements made 
               <br />
               here were very different from those with 
               <br />
               regard to the Clergy Reserves. Suppose the 
               <br />
               fertile Belt contained forty millions of acres, 
               <br />
               the reserve to the Company of one twentieth 
               <br />
               would be two million acres, spread here and 
               <br />
               there, subject to municipal taxation, for roads 
               <br />
               and other improvements, and belonging to a 
               <br />
               Company whose interest it would be to settle 
               <br />
               the reserved lots as soon as possible, and to 
               <br />
               have the other lands also settled, in order that 
               <br />
               the reserved lots might have as much value 
               <br />
               as possible. It had been objected that the 
               <br />
               corporate rights of the Hudson’s Bay Company 
               <br />
               should not be continued. He thought it was 
               <br />
               for the interest of the country that those 
               <br />
               rights should be continued. The number of 
               <br />
               Indians in the territory was very great. Sir 
               <br />
               George Simpson had estimated the number 
               <br />
               at half a million souls. Governor Mactavish 
               <br />
               thought this estimate was exaggerated, but 
               <br />
               believed the number would be from 180,000 
               <br />
               to 200,000. These Indians had been dependent 
               <br />
               on the Company for employment and if this 
               <br />
               were suddenly interfered with the results 
               <br />
               might be disastrous. The ofﬁcers of the Com- 
               <br />
               pany had shown a creditable regard for the 
               <br />
               welfare of the Indians and had, as stated by 
               <br />
               the delegates, to see that a law was passed 
               <br />
               which would prevent the sale of liquor to the 
               <br />
               Indians. He had answered them that we 
               <br />
               already had a law which would have that 
               <br />
               effect. He went on to say that we had a great 
               <br />
               future before us. We had already a popula- 
               <br />
               tion nearly half as great as that of the States 
               <br />
               of New York, Pennsylvania and the New 
               <br />
               England States combined, and our population 
               <br />
               was increasing more rapidly than theirs. Bos-
