               Mr. Street differed with the member for 
               <br />
               Lambton in his statement, that the trustees 
               <br />
               were not exercising all the vigilance they 
               <br />
               could in respect to the realization of this prop- 
               <br />
               erty. It was property very difﬁcult to realize, 
               <br />
               but both from personal knowledge and inter- 
               <br />
               views with the administrators from time to 
               <br />
               time, he felt convinced that they were making 
               <br />
               every effort in their power to bring to a real- 
               <br />

               <br />
               property under their control. He believed it 
               <br />
               would be found on enquiry that they were 
               <br />
               exerting themselves by every means in their 
               <br />
               power to convert that property with a regard 
               <br />
               to the interest of the creditors, and to the ad- 
               <br />
               vantage of the shareholders, and every other 
               <br />
               party having an interest in the winding up of 
               <br />
               this estate. His object in rising was simply to 
               <br />
               inform the mover of the resolution, that he 
               <br />
               had fallen into an error in thinking that the 
               <br />
               trustees did not exercise necessary vigilance 
               <br />
