<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">               the Dominion at present, and trusted within 
               <br />
               a very few years to see thousands pour into 
               <br />
               this territory. With regard to the opening of 
               <br />
               the road, he alluded to the fact that the ver- 
               <br />
               million gold ﬁelds bordered on the river St. 
               <br />

               Francis and that the whole territory was rich 
               <br />
               in mineral wealth. It was none of his business 
               <br />
               he said to allude to the success of the mis- 
               <br />
               sion of their delegates to England. Indeed the 
               <br />
               Minister of Militia himself has said all that 
               <br />
               need be said on the question, (laughter), but 
               <br />

               he (Mr. Mackenzie) would state with pleasure 
               <br />
               that the documents in which these hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men replied to the Company’s pretensions were 
               <br />
               masterly productions. (Hear, hear.) One very 
               <br />
               noticeable omission had been made by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Militia in speaking on this theme. 
               <br />

               In his review of the history of this question 
               <br />
               for the past ten or twelve years, he (Mr. Mac— 
               <br />
               kenzie) did expect to have heard some allusion 
               <br />
               to the services of the Hon. George Brown. He 
               <br />
               (Mr. Mackenzie) could not let the occasion 
               <br />
               pass without alluding to this old political 
               <br />

               friend, Mr. Brown, as one who had labored 
               <br />
               zealously and effectively to advance the open- 
               <br />
               up of this territory. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman went on to express his regret that 
               <br />
               the Government had not announced any 
               <br />
               scheme of Government for this North West, 
               <br />

               but left it to the last moment. (Cheers.) How- 
               <br />
               ever, even as it was he was disposed to sus- 
               <br />
               tain the arguments rather than protract the 
               <br />
               negotiations interminably.

               Hon. Mr. <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Galt</span> desired to say a few words on 
               <br />
               the motion before the chair. When the extent 
               <br />
               of the territory was considered, its population 
               <br />
               and the vast inﬂuence it must exercise on our 
               <br />
               future, the bargain was in reality a good one. 
               <br />
               Ten times the habitable part of Canada only 
               <br />
               represented a portion of that land. The fertile 
               <br />
               belt and its resources were as great as its area 
               <br />
               was extensive. The whole question of its 
               <br />
               boundary was a very doubtful one, and it was 
               <br />
               very important that all questions of territorial 
               <br />
               rights should be set at rest: but he would add 
               <br />
               that the Imperial Government ought to have 
               <br />
               extinguished the Hudson’s Bay Company 
               <br />
               claim, and borne so much of the preliminary 
               <br />
               expense attendant on its settlement and organ- 
               <br />
               ization. But they had not chosen to do so, and 
               <br />
               we were to close up this matter at once. This 
               <br />
               cession of territory opens up a new ﬁeld of 
               <br />
               duty to us. We have to open up communica- 
               <br />
               tions with the territory, organize a govern- 
               <br />
               ment, establish law and order, and extinguish 
               <br />
               Indian titles. To provide for all this, unques- 
               <br />
               tionably we must prepare ourselves for ad- 
               <br />
               ditional taxation, or else the Ministry, as we 
               <br />
               hinted at, must come with a larger, broader 
               <br />
               measure for opening up communication with 
               <br />
