               <br />
               at present, but it was understood that he was 
               <br />
               preparing a report on the subject of his last 
               <br />
               exploration. Last year he had been asked to 
               <br />
               make a more thorough exploration of the 
               <br />
               country between Lake Superior and the Lake 
               <br />
               of the Woods, and he had done so, and had 
               <br />
               been very successful in ﬁnding a road much 
               <br />
               superior in every way to that formerly pro- 
               <br />
               posed. On this subject he would make a full
