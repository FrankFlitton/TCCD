               for the last 20 years, and he had never during 
               <br />
               all that period deceived them. He had al- 
               <br />
               ways, and consistently, sought to advance not 
               <br />
               merely the interests of his constituents, but 
               <br />
               of the Empire at large. Further to show that 
               <br />

               in taking his present stand he was acting 
               <br />
               consistently, he would quote an extract from 
               <br />
               the proceedings of the Quebec Conference, 
               <br />
               which laid the foundation of the Act under 
               <br />
               which we are governed. One of the articles 
               <br />
               in the scheme stated: “The communication 
               <br />

               with the North West Territory, and the im- 
               <br />
               provements required for the development of 
               <br />
               the trade of the Great West with the seaboard, 
               <br />
               are regarded by this Conference as subjects 
               <br />
               of the highest importance to the Federated 
               <br />
               Provinces, and shall be prosecuted at the 
               <br />

               earliest possible period that the state of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances will permit.” Now, he was not going 
               <br />
               to shirk the responsibility of that declaration. 
               <br />
               As a member of the New Brunswick Legis- 
               <br />
               lature and Government, he had aided in car- 
               <br />
               rying out Confederation, and he would not 
               <br />

               now seek to undo what he had done, and what 
               <br />
               had received the hearty approval of his consti- 
               <br />
               tuents. There were, he knew, drawbacks to 
               <br />
               this Confederation scheme; but these had 
               <br />
               been owing not so much to that scheme itself 
               <br />
               as to a lack of proper administration on the 
               <br />

               part of the Government, and their adoption 
               <br />
               of a policy at once unsound and opposed to 
               <br />
               the wishes and interests of the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces. With the experience since gained 
               <br />
               by the Dominion Government, the errors of 
               <br />
               the past would, he hoped, not be repeated 
               <br />

               (cheers.) The hon. gentleman having again 
               <br />
               pressed on the Government the danger which 
               <br />
               would result from delay in opening up the 
               <br />
               North West Territory—and having urged that 
               <br />
               their magnificient purchase should not be ren- 
               <br />
               dered valueless by an <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">inefficient,</span> tardy means 
               <br />

               of communication—went on to allude to the 
               <br />
               speedy development of new territories in the 
               <br />
               Union by the use of British capital. With 
               <br />
               British gold the people of the States were 
               <br />
               every day opening up fresh channels of trade, 
               <br />
               building railroads and canals, and in every 
               <br />

               way developing their resources. Could we not 
               <br />
               do so? Our resources were great enough, and 
               <br />
               enterprises, as proﬁtable as any in the States, 
               <br />
               could be found on this side (cheers). The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman concluded by expressing his doubts 
               <br />
               as to the wisdom of allowing the Hudson 
               <br />

               Bay Company such a large reservation of 
               <br />
               land. It was, he thought, quite enough for 
               <br />
               the Dominion to open up this new country, 
               <br />
               and govern it, without to pay besides a large 
               <br />
               amount of money, and give a large reserva- 
               <br />
               tion. But, sooner than agree to this land 
               <br />

               reservation at all events, he thought that it 
               <br />
               might have been bettter to get rid of their 
               <br />
