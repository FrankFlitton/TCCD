               its maintenance. For his part, he (Mr. Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie) never could see the precise point 
               <br />
               where the robbery took place or where the 
               <br />
               liberties of that Province had been lost, but 
               <br />
               he had been touched while the member for 
               <br />
               Hants, with moist eyes and uplifted face, 
               <br />
               alluded so feelingly to the departed liberties of 
               <br />
               his country. Tears started unbidden to the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s eyes on that occasion, and 
               <br />
               ﬁnding him claim that his country would suf- 
               <br />
               fer the loss of all her liberties in consequence 
               <br />
               of this Union, he (Mr. Mackenzie) felt bound 
               <br />
               to vote for the appointment of a Committee to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd out where we could relieve that Province 
               <br />
               from the oppression spoken of. And now that 
               <br />
               the member for Hants had become President 
               <br />
               of the Council, it was fair to conclude that in 
               <br />
               some mysterious way the liberties of that 
               <br />
               country had been restored. It was possible 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman had joined the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment as others had done before him in 
               <br />
               violation of all his political proclivities (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Then it was only another step in that 
               <br />
               political dependence which seems to be a 
               <br />
               dogma of the Government of this country 
               <br />
               every day—a step which in the interests of 
               <br />
               public morality was very much to be regret- 
               <br />
               ted. When men holding the most diverse opin- 
               <br />
               ions, politically, ﬁnd a safe refuge in a Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment we are driven to believe that these 
               <br />
               gentlemen after all attach more value to ob- 
               <br />
               taining office than maintaining their patriotic 
               <br />
               impressions. (Hear, hear.) Was it to be sup- 
               <br />
               posed that the hon. gentlemen carried with 
               <br />
               them into the Cabinet all their conﬂicting 
               <br />
               views of public policy on almost every con- 
               <br />
               ceivable subject? Or were they all subordi- 
               <br />
               nated by the views of the Minister of Justice? 
               <br />
               He (Mr. Mackenzie) confessed his astonish- 
               <br />
               ment at the position taken by the President of 
               <br />
               the Council, and thought it was evident that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman’s country-men generally 
               <br />
               looked on his accession to ofﬁce as a purely 
               <br />
               personal matter. That accession had produced 
               <br />
               not conciliation and contentment, but merely 
               <br />
               changed the channel through which the stream 
               <br />
               of discontent poured. Annexation doctrines 
               <br />
               were now openly advocated in the very House 
               <br />
               of Assembly of Nova Scotia, and most scan- 
               <br />
               dalous speeches and resolutions, from a 
               <br />
               British point of view, were daily made in that 
               <br />
               body. These facts were signiﬁcant of political 
               <br />
               degradation, and for that hon. gentleman’s own 
               <br />
               sake, as well as for that of the Government 
               <br />
               and the country, it was exceedingly to be re- 
               <br />
               gretted that such events should transpire, as 
               <br />
               they could not possibly strengthen the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but would weaken it and destroy the 
               <br />
               bonds of political morality which binds to- 
               <br />
