               Hon. Mr. McDougall, in seconding the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions, said it was unnecessary now to go 
               <br />
               over the history of this question. The only 
               <br />
               point now to be considered was whether the 
               <br />
               terms and conditions which had been agreed 
               <br />
               upon in England were terms and conditions 
               <br />
               which this Parliament and the country ought 
               <br />
               to oppose. The member for Chateauguay had 
               <br />
               stated that the delegates from Canada had 
               <br />
               been outwitted in the bargain. It was for the 
               <br />
               House to consider whether that was the fact. 
               <br />
               He freely admitted that he had been strongly 
               <br />
               of the opinion, that the position maintained by 
               <br />
               the various governments of Canada was cor- 
               <br />
               rect, that the Hudson’s Bay Co. has no such 
               <br />
               right or property in the country we desired to 
               <br />
               obtain, as would justify their demanding a 
               <br />
               money consideration for them. It could not be 
               <br />
               denied, however, that in Ruperts Land, they 
               <br />
               had rights which would have been recognized 
               <br />
               in the courts of England. All these rights of a 
               <br />
               proprietary character were extinguished by 
               <br />
               this agreement. They would still exist as a 
               <br />
               trading company, but would have no pro- 
               <br />
               prietary rights. He considered that if we had 
               <br />
               paid £300,000 to extinguish the proprietary and 
               <br />
               governing rights of the Company in Ruperts 
               <br />
               Land alone, it would have been well expended, 
               <br />
               inasmuch as it was of great importance to us 
               <br />
               that there should be nobody possessing a 
               <br />
               separate governing jurisdiction between us 
               <br />
               and the Arctic Ocean. It should be remember- 
               <br />
               ed too that we would have a valuable equiv- 
               <br />
               alent in the custom duties which would be 
               <br />
               received. He had seen it estimated, looking to 
               <br />
               the quality of goods imported for a series of 
               <br />
               years, that the Hudson’s Bay Company would 
               <br />
               have to pay annually £30,000.
