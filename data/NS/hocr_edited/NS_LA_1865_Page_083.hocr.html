the hon. Prov. Secy. and the hon. leader of the <br />
Opposition now sent broadcast by the hon gentle- <br />
men over the Province, that Cape Breton enjoyed <br />
all moneys coming from its Crown Lands, which <br />
last assertion was not supported to the extent <br />
of one cent.&nbsp; He also asked the Prov. Sec. what <br />
the reasons of the Government were for not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">car-</span> <br />
rying out the provisions of the law, and whether <br />
the Govt. intended in the future, as in the past, to <br />
treat the law as a nullity. <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span> not think that any reply was

to deal a fatal blow at the Government, had had <br />
an unhappy effect.&nbsp; From the remarks that had <br />
fallen on the previous evening from a gentleman <br />

had no <br />
hesitation in saying, that he would rather resign <br />
the position he held, and retire into the cold <br />
shades of opposition, than yield to unfair dictation <br />
from any combination of gentlemen. As regards <br />
the complaint of the member from Inverness, he <br />
had only to turn to the Estimates to prove that <br />
no other part of the Province had received so <br />
much consideration as the Island of Cape Breton, <br />
and at no time had the members for that section <br />
less cause to complain than the present. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Ever since he had the honor of a seat in
that <br />
House, he had done his utmost to assist the mem- <br />
bers for Cape Breton, in their attempts to obtain <br />
for that Island that consideration which its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im-</span> <br />
portance deserved, and now after the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>
<br />
had shown a disposition, which no previous Govern- <br />
ment had ever done, to deal liberally. with its <br />
wants, he would ask whether this was time, or the <br />
occasion, for any gentlemen from Cape Breton, <br />
least of all, for any one pretending to be a sup- <br />
porter of the Government, to assume an attitude <br />
of deﬁance and dictation. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. Prov. Sec. here referred to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> <br />
provision made in the estimates for the various <br />
public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">services</span> in Cape Breton,
and to the pledge <br />
of the Government, that they would undertake <br />
the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wharf</span> at
Port Hood, and <br />
asked whether in view of all this, it was fair for <br />
any member from that county, to complain of not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">havi</span>ng received proper
consideration at the hands <br />
of the Government. As regards the facts of this <br />
case, he would say that the hon gentleman him- <br />
self, was one of those who assisted in breaking up <br />
the system by which these monies were to be paid <br />
into the Treasury, and which had the effect of <br />
throwing the whole thing into confusion. <br />
