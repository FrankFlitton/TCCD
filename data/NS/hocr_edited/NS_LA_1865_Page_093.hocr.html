the city liable, that they should have the agree- <br />
ment drawn up and the bond signed. He be- <br />
lieved that if the proper papers had been signed <br />
by the properly constituted authorities, there would <br />
have been no difﬁculty—but the members of the <br />
City Council felt that they were not bound by any <br />
loose expressions or pledges made by some persons <br />
at a public meeting in the Temperance Hall, and <br />
which never had been ratiﬁed by any resolution of <br />
the City Council. These are the views of many of <br />
the members of the City Council, whether correct<br />
or not he was not prepared to say. If the city of<br />
Halifax, took stock to the extent of £100,000, she <br />
would receive from the Province four per cent. If <br />
the Province took it—they would have to pay 2 <br />
per cent more. All these sums added together, <br />
would give a total annual liability of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$578,700,</span>
<br />
which the Province would have to pay after the <br />
whole of these works were completed—representing <br />
a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$9.645.000</span> ; but this
of course would <br />
not accrue at once, but would be spread over <br />
a number of years. This appeared a pretty <br />
large debt for a population of about 350,000 <br />
people, amounting to about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1.65</span>
per head. <br />

which had been derived from the construction of <br />
the two short lines of railroad to Windsor and <br />
Truro. He found upon looking over the returns <br />

over the road and 56,471 tons of freight—9,784 free <br />

It was well known that people who travelled <br />
abroad, had a great repugnance to sea voyages, <br />
and no doubt if these lines of railroad were com- <br />
pleted, travellers from Canada, New Brunswick, <br />
and the United States, would come to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Halifax,</span>

take passage to Europe, and thus increase the <br />
