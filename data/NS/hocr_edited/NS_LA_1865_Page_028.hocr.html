</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> was derived from the report of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Superinten-</span> <br />
dent of Education. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He did</span> not say<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> that 62 <br />
schools were in operation, but that 62 school <br />
sections had organized under the law. He had <br />
listened with some surprise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
the style of ar- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gument</span> used by the member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for Guysborough.</span> <br />
He had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">listened</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> rather extraordinary ap- <br />
peals in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house, and</span> had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seen great</span> liber- <br />
ties taken with hon. gentlemen, but he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ne-</span> <br />
ver heard of such a liberty as that which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> <br />
just been taken by the member for Guysbo- <br />
rough with the gentlemen who supported the <br />
Governmentt. He(Mr.C.)could not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span>
that the <br />
principle of assessment was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bad, for</span>
hehad af- <br />
ﬁrmed it over and over again, but he called <br />
upon hon. gentlemen to vote against the bill <br />
from the small, paltry consideration of losing <br />
a few votes among their constituents. <br />

<br />

only what was due to themselves, and from <br />
personal motives to defeat a measure designed <br />
to improve the common school system of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><br />
country.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He (the</span>

was a digniﬁed or honorable position to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupy</span>

—to call upon gentlemen on that side of the <br />
house to abandon a government that had had <br />
the courage to grapple <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> a
great question, <br />
which they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knew</span> was fraught with
great dan- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. STEWART</span>
CAMPBELL said that the hon. <br />
Provincial Secretary had expressed surprise at <br />
his moving a call of the house. His reason was <br />
plain; three or four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen who</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had ex-</span> <br />
pressed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> opposed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> bill had <br />
been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about</span> the house all day; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> where were <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now?</span> His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object was</span> to bring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every man</span> <br />
here to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">record</span> his vote,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> as it was his duty to <br />
do. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The hon.</span> Pro. Sec. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> taken exception to <br />
the appeal he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had made</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house.
He</span> <br />
thought that when the house remembered the <br />
appeal that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon. gentleman once</span>
made to the <br />
house and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country on the</span>
subject of re- <br />
trenchment—an appeal which it is true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">achiev-</span>
<br />

he did not envy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him, when</span> gained
by such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un-</span> <br />
worthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">woul</span>d

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> was then taken upon Mr. Chas.

was under the impression that his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency,</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wished</span> to identify himself with
the education <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> country. In a speech <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which he deliver-</span> <br />
ed at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a banquet</span> last summer to
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> <br />
