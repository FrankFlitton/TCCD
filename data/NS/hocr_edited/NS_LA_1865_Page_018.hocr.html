province would have at its disposal to carry<br />
on the local governments - the blame must<br />
rest in a large degree, upon the delegates<br />
from the province, for that subsidy was<br />
fixed to a large extent upon the requirements<br />
of what we believed to be the necessities of Nova<br />
Scotia, and arranged upon a basis that we felt<br />
was necessary in order to meet local exigencies<br />
in this Province. We felt it was to the advan-<br />
tage of this Province as well as of British North<br />
America that the subsidy should be placed at as <br />
low a fugure as possible, for the simple reason<br />
that 80 cents a head was a tax that would rest<br />
upon the people of British North America and<br />
upon Nova Scotia in common. To have in-<br />
creased that subsidy to 90 cents would have<br />
made a very insignificant difference to be re-<br />
ceived by the people of this Province, but when<br />
applied to the million of Canada it would have<br />
amounted to a large aggregate to be drawn<br />
annually for ever from the general revenue of<br />
the whole country in which we would have a <br />
common interest  Therefore it was of the high-<br />
est importance to the people of this small pro<br />
vince with a small population to fix the subsidy<br />
at the smallest amount in order to lessen the<br />
burthens which the people of British North<br />
America, and especially of the lower provinces,<br />
would be called upon to sustain. We felt that<br />
the same principle dictated to us as a matter of<br />
common prudence that we should fix the sub-<br />
sidy upon the census of 1861. We felt, too,<br />
that the population of Upper Canada might be <br />
expected to increase in a greater ratio then any<br />
other part of British North America, and the <br />
result would be that an enormous drain would<br />
thus be made upon the general revenue if the <br />
subsidy were not stationary  As the population<br />
increased it would be but 70 then 60, then 50<br />
cents, instead of fixing forever 80 cents upon<br />
the people. We believed after making a care-<br />
ful calculation, which it will not be necessary<br />
to go into at this time, that in fixing the amount<br />
at 80 cents, we sufficiently consulted the local<br />
interests of the country, and the different ser-<br />
vices for which it was necessary to provide.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">REPRESENTATION
BY POPULATION.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I must glance now at one or two points
that <br />
were arranged at that Conference for the go-<br />
vernment of British North America. The prin-<br />
ciple of representation by population was<br />
adopted, and there have been found people in<br />
this Province to question its soundness and<br />
judiciousness. It has been said that it is a<br />
false principle and that therefore it should<br />
have been repudiated and rejected - that it was<br />
not one which Conservatives ought to support.<br />
It will not be necessary to go into any elabo-<br />
rate defence of representation by population,<br />
as applied to British America. The principle<br />
was approved twenty-five years ago, by a <br />
statesman as distinguished as Lord Durham.<br />
It was stated by him, in a report which will <br />
make his name ever famous in the annals of <br />
British America, and I may say Great Britain,<br />
that it was the only true and safer principle<br />
which the Legislature and Governments<br />
could be constructed in British America. That<br />
eminent statesman predicted, 25 years ago,<br />
in reference to Canada, that if they undertook<br />
we ignore the principle of representation by po-<br />

the day would come when the country<br />
would be rent in twain. Who does not know<br />
the difficulties that arose from the false princi-<br />
ple that was applied at the time of the union<br />
of the Canadas, in order to give the ascendan-<br />
cy to Upper Canada, whose population at the<br />
time was less than that of Lower Canada? - <br />
Who does not know that the prediction of Earl <br />
Durham</span> has been verified? and the time has<br />
come when that country has been convulsed<br />
in order to rid themselves of a principle so un-<br />
sound as that a certain number of people in a<br />
certain locality shall have an amount of repre-<br />
sentation arranged not according to their num-<br />
bers, but exhibiting a disparity with some<br />
other section. But were we to put ourselves in<br />
the position of saying that the intelligence of<br />
our people was such - that the want of intellect<br />
and ability amongst us was so marked, that, in <br />
order to have sufficient influence in a legisla-<br />
tive assembly in British North America, we <br />
should demand that the principle of repre-<br />
sentation by population should be ignored? - <br />
When it is said that the principle should be<br />
discounted by Conservatives, I call the<br />
attention of the house to the fact that the Que-<br />
bec scheme has been submitted to the most<br />
severe ordeal that any scheme of constitutional<br />
government could be subjected to, and to a tri-<br />
bunal perhaps as competent to pass upon it as<br />
any in the world - I mean the Government and<br />
people in England, as the represented by a press<br />
which for standing, character, and intelligence<br />
is not equalled in any part of the civilized<br />
world. I ask any public man to show me, al-<br />
though the scheme has been rigidly examinined<br />
a single statement in the press of England, or<br />
of any other country, calling into question the<br />
soundness of the principle of representation by<br />
population, as applied to British North Ameri-<br />
ca. I have examined all the criticisms I could<br />
have access to, and I have yet to find a single<br />
press that has objected to the application of<br />
that principle. It has been said that, assum-<br />
ing the principle to be right, it would neverthe-<br />
less place these provinces in a position that <br />
would jeopardise the interests of the people in<br />
connection with this scheme of government. I<br />
would ask this house to consider that, in the <br />
first place, under the principle Nova Scotia<br />
would be entitled to 19 representatives in ll<br />
in a parliament of 19+ members. I would ask <br />
this house, when any man ventures to question<br />
whether the 19 members or the 47, would not<br />
have a fair share of influence in the united parl-<br />
iament, to look at the only criterion by which<br />
it is possible to come to any conclusion on the <br />
subject. Look acorss the Atlantic at the par-<br />
liament of England - at the House of Commons<br />
of 600 members - where the parties into which<br />
the country are divided, the Liberals and Con-<br />
servatives, are separated by lines less strong<br />
than those which divide Upper and Lower Ca-<br />
nada, and must divide them for a century to <br />
come. There you will see a dozen independ-<br />
ent men controlling parties and influencing the<br />
destinies of the country. Is not this evidence <br />
that in a British American parliament of 196<br />
members the representatives of the Maritime<br />
Provinces would render it impossible for their<br />
interests to be ignored or set aside. It may be<br />
said they would not be united - personal anta-<br />
gonism would arise to keep them divided. I <br />
grant it. But the moment that parliament<br />
would attempt to touch the interests of any<br />
part of these Maritime Provinces; would you<br />
