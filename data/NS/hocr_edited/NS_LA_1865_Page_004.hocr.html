<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LOCKE said, in reference to the
clause <br />
touching upon the Union of the Colonies, that <br />
it did not commit any one on the question. <br />
Every one was, of course, left perfectly free to <br />
deal with it as his judgment should dictate, <br />
when all the papers connected with it were <br />
before the House. He thought it necessary to <br />
say this in order that the country might under- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.
ARCHIBALD (who was only heard with <br />
the greatest difficulty) said that the proper <br />
time, of course, for discussing the question <br />
referred to, would be when all the papers <br />
were before the House. All the House was <br />
asked to do at present was to promise that <br />
every question should receive their deliberate <br />
consideration when it came in due form before <br />
them. In looking over the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speech, he</span>
found <br />
that the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promised,</span> was one con- <br />
nected with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Edugation.</span> He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span><br />
opportunity of calling attention to the fact <br />
that he had last session foretold some of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> would probably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arise from</span>
<br />

which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objectcd</span> <br />

the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive.</span> Council. He had also
said that, at <br />
all events, if the Government were not willing <br />
to go as far as he wished, they should place at <br />
the head of the Council of Public Instruction <br />
the Lieutenant Governor, as his presence <br />
would give to the country the guarantee that <br />
mere party considerations would not always <br />
prevail. He now begged the Government to <br />
consider carefully in any amendments to the <br />
bill they might introduce, the propriety of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avoiding</span> even the semblance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suspicion</span> that <br />
party inﬂuences prevailed in Educational mat- <br />
ters. He congratulated the country on the <br />
encouraging statements made in the speech,- <br />
that our revenue was very large, and all our <br />
branches of industry prosperous to an unpar- <br />
alleled extent. Every gentleman, whatever <br />
his political prejudices, would learn this fact <br />
with the deepest satisfaction.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Stewart Campbell said that he per- <br />
fectly concurred with those gentlemen who <br />
had spoken of this Answer to the Address as <br />
being entirely non-committal in its character. <br />
Notwithstanding he held very strong opinions <br />
on the subject of the Union of the Colonies, he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">felt</span> that he had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> whatever in giv— <br />
ing his concurrence to the Answer. He em— <br />
phatically stated that he wished it to be at <br />
once un erstood that he did not endorse the <br />
action of the Government in sending a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delega—</span>
<br />
tion to Quebec. The house had put upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span>
<br />
journals last session a resolution authorizing <br />
the Government to appoint delegates in refer- <br />
ence to a Union of the Maritime Provinces. <br />
Authority, however, had been granted from <br />
some quarter to those delegates to go beyond <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misson</span> entrusted to them by
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislas</span> <br />
ture. Therefore, although he concurred in the <br />
answer to the address, he wished to guard him— <br />
self from having it sup posed that he at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span>
en— <br />
dorsed the act of the Government in sending <br />
a delegation to Quebec. <br />
