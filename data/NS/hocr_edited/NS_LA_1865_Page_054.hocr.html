<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and power
he possessed to carry out his ob-</span><br />
ject in definance of the people. Holding
the senti-<br />
ments he did, there was great room to
fear, that<br />
our rights and liberties were endangered ;
and <br />
under such circumstances it was time
gentlemen<br />
sitting around these benches, should put
thel<br />
house in order. It should be recollected
that the<br />
leader of the government had great powers
in his <br />
hands—he could control the public patronage—<br />
he had command of the public funds. He
might<br />
be induced to use all influences to
promote a <br />
scheme of which he was so enthusiastic an
advo-<br />
cate.  It would be well for gentlemen to
consider<br />
these things before it was too late. He
did not in-<br />
tend to follow the hon. Provincial
Secretary after<br />
the lengthy reply of the hon. member for
Guys-<br />
bro, and because a  more suitable
opportunity<br />
would offer to answer him. But he must den-<br />
ounce the assertion made for a purpose,
that any<br />
large number of the people favored the
scheme of<br />
the Quebec Conference. Such an assertion
from<br />
any reliable source might do much harm. He<br />
did not, however, think any statements of the<br />
hon. member were entitled to much credit.  There<br />
were few public men in the country who stood in<br />
a more unenviable position as respects thier unre-<br />
liabilit than the hon. Provincial Secretary.<br />
</p>


















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">He thought he was done with the hon. member<br />
for Halifax, but he found it was not the
case; that<br />
hon. gentleman with his usual
appropriateness of<br />
illustration, had referred to the
demonstration<br />
given in honour of Shakespeare last
spring, which<br />
was as far from the present case, as the
hon.<br />
memeber himself was from the moon. It was
true<br />
the House did adjourn, but it was more in
com-<br />
pliment to the occasion, than to any
living indi-<br />
vidual.  What analogy was there between the<br />
two cases—between Shakespeare and the Dele-<br />
gates?  But he (Mr. M.) might be wrong—per-<br />
haps he was unable to appreciate the great
acute-<br />
ness of the hon. member. There might be
some<br />
point in the comparison. That the
delegates dealt<br />
largely in fiction will not be denied, and
if they<br />
put their claim to a demonstration on this
ground<br />
he could understand them. When the records<br />
were examinined it would be found that the
works<br />
of fiction of some of these gentlemen were
numer-<br />
ous indeed.  If this would entitle them to such<br />
an ovation as had been accorded to the great<br />
dramatist, he would prefer it would be postponed till <br />
they were 300 years dead.</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Miller concluded by saying that as the<br />
hon. Provincial Secretary had stated that the<br />
Volunteers were not to take any part in the<br />
demonstration of that evening his object was<br />
gained and it was unnecessary to move any reso-<br />
lution on the subject.</p>






<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. ATTY. GENERAL said if he had ever wit-<br />
nessed a tempest in a teapot, it was
during that <br />
afternoon.  He could, however, easily
understant<br />
how the gentlemen opposite would wich to
make<br />
a demonstration which might have some effec<br />
across the water. They had stated that
nine-<br />
tenths of the people were opposed to
Confederad<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">tion, and ought now to be satisfied. He doubted,<br />
however, the worth of the mere assertions they<br />
had made, and the value that would be put upon<br />
them in the mother country. It was obvious that<br />
if gentlemen had not some covert object in view,<br />
the whole subject would have been settled in five <br />
minutes.&nbsp; If anyone had, at the outset, asked the <br />
question, whether the volunteers were to take<br />
part in the intended demonstration, he would <br />
have got an answer immediately. It was useless<br />
for gentlemen to try and persuade the House that<br />
actually nine-tenths of the people were opposed<br />
to Confederation. Only 3000 persons came before <br />
the House, stating that they were opposed to<br />
Confederation. He knew that a large number of<br />
the petitioners were induced to sign the petitions,<br />
through false representations that were made to<br />
them. Here Mr. Henry went on to refer to the<br />
fact that when the delegates were in Canada, the <br />
volunteers, on several occasions, took part in the<br />
celebration.&nbsp; He thought that some parties in<br />
this country had attempted to mix the ques-<br />
tion of Union with party considerations ever since<br />
the celebrated speech at Truro. It was party in-<br />
fluences that originated the petitions that were got<br />
up on this question.&nbsp; What he desired, was that the<br />
people should have every opportunity of discus-<br />
sing the question in all its bearings.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The matter then dropped, and the House ad-<br />
journed over Good Friday until Saturday, at<br />
11 o'clock.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The House of Assembly met this morning at<br />
11 o'clock, and the Provincial Secretary imme-<br />
diately moved a resolution to adjourn until<br />
Monday next. He said:—I need not say that<br />
this House has been deeply shocked by the<br />
intelligence which has just been received of<br />
the death of President Lincoln.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both branch-<br />
es of the Legislature having been on Thursday<br />
last informed that His Excellency would come<br />
down at 3 o'clock for the purpose of assenting<br />
to several Bills which have passed, I felt it my<br />
duty, proposing as we do, to adjourn this <br />
House, to put myself in communication with<br />
His Excellency who entirely concurs in the<br />
appropriateness of this House marking its sym-<br />
pathy with the people of the United States,<br />
who have thus lost their Chief Magistrate, and<br />
their deep abhorrence of the crime by which<br />
he had been removed. The House is aware<br />
that when exactly four years ago this day the <br />
first intelligence reached this country of the<br />
commencement of hostilities in the American<br />
Republic, this House placed on record its sen-<br />
timents by the following resolution:—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Resolved unanimously that the House of Assembly<br />
of Nova Scotia have heard with deep regret of the <br />
outbreak of civil war in the United States, that this <br />
House, without expressing any opinion upon the <br />
points in controversy between the contending parties<br />
sincerely lament that tjose who speak their language, <br />
and share their civilization should be shedding each<br />
other's blood, and offer up their prayers to the Father <br />
of the Universe for the speedy restoration of peace."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">This resolution sufficiently marked the feel-<br />
ings with which this House viewed the begin-<br />
ing of hostilities which have so long and so <br />
terribly distracted the neighboring republic. <br />
