<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> "develope its proportions," and
eventually be-<br />
come a terrible dragon that would "gobble
up"<br />
the American Eagle, and still hunger for
more.—<br />
But, alas ! he only made the worm longer.
He<br />
only lengthened it out until it become a
tape<br />
worm. He run it through circumlocation
offices<br />
800 miles away until it became a worm of
that<br />
"red tape" species, which so nearly proved
the <br />
destruction of the Birtish army on the
outbreak<br />
of the Crimean War. Our main protection
lies in<br />
the power of Britain, but the evident
tendency of<br />
this Ottawa arrangement is separation from
Eng-<br />
land. Our minds naturally follow the
channels<br />
of authority up to the source, and when we
have<br />
reached that source, out ideas centre
about it, and<br />
it becomes the embodiement of our
nationality.—<br />
We have hitherto looked to England, and
have<br />
run up through the various channels to the
<br />
Crown, and there our affections have
centred ; <br />
but this Confederation comes in and
proposes a <br />
new order of things. It proposes that we
shall<br />
have local governments, and that the
source of our<br />
authority shall be at Ottawa. And when our<br />
thoughts and affections are turned toward
that,—<br />
provided the various and divers interests
of the<br />
several provinces, will enable us to live
in har-<br />
mony,—the effect will be that our
affections<br />
will cling round that government, and
shall be<br />
withdrawn from the Crown of England.
Suppose<br />
that five or six American states imagined that<br />
separately they were too small, and accordingly<br />
proposed to form a special Confederation under the<br />
General Government just as these gentlemen pro-<br />
pose with us to form a Government at Ottawa.</p>















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Does not every man see that before ten
years<br />
had expired, the feeling of the people
would be<br />
around that smaller Confederation, and in
an-<br />
tagonism to the larger. And so would it be
in the <br />
event of Confederation, with the other B.
A. Pro-<br />
vinces.—Therefore, I believe, instead of
diminish-<br />
ing it would only increase our danger, and
render<br />
us an easy prey to an invader. Suppose we
should<br />
become an independent nationality, we
would then,<br />
indeed, be helpless as the crawling worms,
and <br />
the American Eagle would soon make a "Diet
of<br />
Worms" that would have a different
interpreta-<br />
tation in American history from the "Diet
of<br />
Worms" in European history. Lord
Palmerston,<br />
referring to the subject, says :—</p>


















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Sir, it is true that the only danger
which a<br />
smaller colonial State runs from a more
powerful and<br />
larger neighbour arises from quarrels that
may exist<br />
between the mother country and the foreign
State?<br />
I say that is a total fallacy  Suppose
these pro-<br />
vinces separated from this country—suppose
them<br />
erected into a monarchy, a republic, or
any other<br />
form of Government. Are there not motives
that<br />
might lead a stronger neighbour to pick a
quarrel<br />
with that smaller State with a view to its
annexa-<br />
tion? (Hear, hear.) Is there nothing like
terri-<br />
torial ambition prevading the policy of
great mili-<br />
tary States? The example of the world
should teach<br />
us that as far as the danger of invasion
and an-<br />
nexation is concerned, that danger would
be in-<br />
creased to Canada by a separation from
Great<br />
Britain, and when she is deprived of the
protection<br />
that the military power and resources of
this coun-<br />
try may afford. (Cheers.)</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">large extent, upon the spirit of those ho
are called<br />
upon to defend the country. If you elevate
the<br />
country and its institutions, the people
will be<br />
prepared to defend it with greater spirit,
We<br />
have seen in history the effect of
rendering a<br />
people dissatisfied with the country in
which they<br />
lived. One of the great grievances of the
people<br />
of Ireland, is that they have not had
since the<br />
Union with England, control of their own
affairs—<br />
that they have not sufficient
representation in the <br />
British Parliament, to give them their due
influ-<br />
ence ; and see what an exodus there is of
her<br />
people. The last census of the United
States re-<br />
turns 1,611,304, of the citizens of the
Union as<br />
born in Ireland, where the whole
population is <br />
only five and three quarter millions,
while the<br />
the same returns give only 431,692 persons
born<br />
in England, where the population is twenty
mil-<br />
lions.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">If then you desire to have the hearty
co-opera-<br />
tion of our people in the defence of this country,<br />
you should not deprive them of the control which<br />
they now exercise, over the constitution and insti-<br />
tutions of their country. Neither must you make<br />
them feel that they are pressed down by taxes.<br />
If you impose upon them burthens beyond what<br />
they consider just—<span style="font-style: italic;">and over which
they can exer-<br />
cise no control</span>—then the spirit to defend their<br />
country vanishes. Lord Bacon, reminds us that <br />
the blessing given to Judah and Issachar are never<br />
found combined in the same individual, not in the<br />
same people. Judah was to have the spirit of the<br />
lion—to place his hand upon his enemy's neck.</p>





























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">But Issachar was to bow himself to pay
tribute<br />
—to become like "the Ass crouching between
two<br />
burdens." And no matter how spirited a<br />
people are ; whenever these burdens are
placed<br />
upon them they will change. Did the hon.
Pro.<br />
Sec., suppose when he made this Quebec
bargain,<br />
that the men around these benches are the
Repre-<br />
sentatives of the lineal descendants of
Issachar.<br />
That we are such consummate asses, as to
bow<br />
down and allow him to fix and saddle upon
us<br />
forever the ass's burthen. This people have<br />
shown that they have a spirit to defend
their <br />
country and its interests. Little Nova
Scotia has<br />
given several names to history, and we
have erec-<br />
ted a monument to the memory of some of
those<br />
who have thus shown themselves worthy of a
noble<br />
ancestry. Every time I pass that monument I<br />
feel my step grow firmer and prouder with
the<br />
thought, that the spirit which influenced
these<br />
men, still lives in the bosoms of the
people of Nova<br />
Scotia. That it animates the stalwart
militia men<br />
of this Province, "whose arms were moulded
in<br />
their mothers wombs, to drive the invader
from<br />
our soil ;" but take away from these the
control<br />
of their representative institutions, and
impose<br />
upon them such burthens as I believe you
are<br />
going to place upon them by this
Confederation,<br />
and you drive out that spirit, and they
will be-<br />
come as useless for defence, as a
battalion of dried<br />
mummies from the catacombs of Egypt.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Provincial Secretary tells us that
Confede-<br />
ration will give us influence and position. He<br />
asks where was Nova Soctia, when the Reciprocity<br />
Treaty was passed. Was not Nova Scotia present</p>
