overwhelmed with terror. So are<br />
these hon. gentlemen overcome by the work-<br />
ings of their own imaginations.<br />
We are told by these gentlemen danger is <br />
really imminent, that it will come upon us sud-<br />
denly; then, I ask, is it the course of wise men<br />
to undertake a change in our constitutional<br />
administration that will require years to per-<br />
fect. Why the instincts of the lowest order of<br />
animal life tell us better. The insect, when it<br />
is about to undergo a transformation is perfect-<br />
ed; and shall we enter upon the throes of this<br />
great constitutional transformation at an hour<br />
when we are told danger is coming upon us.<br />
Let us not put off the olf harness until the <br />
time has come when we can safely put on the<br />
new and have it adjusted. Th illustration<br />
given by the late Abraham Lincoln, that it is<br />
no time to swap horses when you are crossing <br />
a stream, ought to be sufficient for these gen-<br />
tlemen. The hon. member for Colchester has<br />
spoken of the great change which has occureed<br />
in the character and position of the American<br />
people. He has told you that a very few<br />
years ago that people was engaged in their<br />
workshops and factories of the country, but<br />
now they have been drawn from all these, and</span><br />
have formed an army that had placed that<br />
nation among the first military powers of the<br />
world. But he neglected to tell us these men<br />
from their industrial pursuits than were per-<br />
haps ever before found combined.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They felt
not only called to rescue their </span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">country, in whose greatness they felt a
just<br />
pride, from being rent in fragments, but to<br />
wipe from their national escutcheon the
foul<br />
stain of slavery. That great work they
seem <br />
to have accomplished. When at our last
meet-<br />
ing the tidings reached us that their
PResident<br />
had fallen by the hand of a foul assassin,
and <br />
when we sat in silence no man daring to
trust<br />
his voice in expressing the sympathies—the<br />
sorrow that swelled our hearts—further
than to<br />
give official form to our feelings, I
asked my-<br />
self what must be the effect of these
tidings<br />
upon the people over whom Abraham Lincoln<br />
presided, when they so affect us. Surely,
sir,<br />
that people have now drank the last drop in<br />
their cup of bitterness, and whatever other
ef-<br />
fects may flow from this act, I believe the<br />
American people will, with the blood of
Abra-<br />
ham Lincoln, seal a covenant with the Most<br />
High that the clank of the slave chain
shall no<br />
more be heard in their land. That he who
had<br />
this object deep in heart, and who, while
ably<br />
presiding over them, led them on gradually
step<br />
by step to proclaim freedom to the black
man,<br />
will in his death so fix and stamp the
national<br />
mind to that high purpose that when the
hour of<br />
peace comes, as in the good Providence of
God<br />
it seems nigh, there will, in the
arrangement of<br />
terms, be no temporizing, no yielding o
South-<br />
ern interests and wishes on this question.
Soon,<br />
therefore, will many in those armies be
found<br />
going back to their industrial avocations,
sad-<br />
dened no doubt by the great sacrifice they<br />
have witnessed, yet consoled by the
glorious<br />
thought that they have aided in giving to
the<br />
term liberty a meaning and a signification<br />
hitherto unknown upon their soil, that
hence-<br />
forth it embraces all classes, creeds and
colors.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. member will tell us that there
are <br />
others in that army who will not so
readily go<br />
to industrial employments; this is true
but all</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those will find sufficient employment in re-or-<br />
ganizing the Southern</span> portion of the empire<br />
and in restoring it from the wreck and debris<br />
of this terrible civil strife. Consider also the<br />
spirit of the Sourthern people. The men have<br />
shown in the hardships they have endured—<br />
in the sacrifices they have made—and in their<br />
daring acts that a feeling of hostility to the<br />
North lies deep in their hearts. Nor have the<br />
Southern women been less remarkable for<br />
patient endurance, high courageous spirit and<br />
deep-seated hatred ; and can we for a moment<br />
suppose that the children born of such parents,<br />
nourished and trained by these women, will<br />
not inherit their feelings and so render it im-<br />
perative on the Northern portion of the nation<br />
to keep for many years a strong hand upon the<br />
South. The Provincial Secretary has told us<br />
that he has looked upon slavery as the great<br />
guarantee of our safety. I don't so read Ame-<br />
rican history. So far as I can judge, the men<br />
who have been most bitter in their hositility to<br />
England, and most desirous of finding causes<br />
of war with that country have been Southern<br />
statesmen. The circumstances dependent upon<br />
slavery have been such as to lead them to a<br />
breach of the peace. The fact that England, <br />
with a magnanimity that did her infinite honor,<br />
gave twenty millions to redeem her slaves—a<br />
fact that stood a perpetual censure as it were<br />
upon the South, no doubt was a cause of irrita-<br />
tion upon their minds. Again, England kept<br />
up a large force upon the African coast to keep<br />
down that traffic which tended to give rise to <br />
this feeling of animosity. Again, north of them <br />
there was a frontier line over which when the<br />
slave passed into Canada he gained free-<br />
dom. This was, perhaps, the strongest<br />
inducement for the Southerners to make war<br />
upon these colonies for the purpose of wiping<br />
away this boundry line, and enabling them<br />
to follow wherever the slave might go, and re-<br />
turn him to his chains. These were great<br />
causes of animosity to England, and now, <br />
since, under the blessing of God, this slavery<br />
has been blotted out, I believe peace is much<br />
more likely to be preserved between England<br />
and America. Had the Southerners succeed-<br />
ed in obtaining their independence, the likeli-<br />
hood of hostilities with England would have <br />
been much greater. The Northern people<br />
thwarted and smarting under the mortification<br />
occasioned by their inability to conquer the<br />
South, would have been more likely to<br />
turn their army—for which they would not<br />
have employment—upon these Provinces,<br />
than they will be now when they have suc-<br />
ceeded in accomplishing the great object that<br />
they had on calling these armied into existence.<br />
The hon. delegate alluded to a number of cir-<br />
cumstances—the passport system, the propos-<br />
ed armament upon the lakes, and the aborga-<br />
tion of the Reciprocity Treaty—as so many <br />
evidences of the feeling of the Northern peo-<br />
ple towards us. When he was reading his<br />
summary I wondered why he omitted to refer<br />
to a fact which was known here some weeks<br />
ago—that the notice in reference to the arma-<br />
ment upon the lakes had been withdrawn, and<br />
arrangements made for a mere police force.<br />
Earl Russell, however, justifies the notice, he <br />
says:</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Coupled with this notice is a notice given with <br />
respect to the armament of the lakes. I think it must<br />
be admitted that recent occurences on the lakes—<br />
namely, the seizure of vessels by the agents of the<br />
Confederacy and other acts of hostility—completely</p>
