that would have to be made, we<br />
would be called upon to pay a very much lar-<br />
ger sum into the general revenue than we pay</span><br />
into out own treasury. There never appeared<br />
to me to be any question on this point. The<br />
very fact that Canada has to resort to a stamp<br />
act in order to raise funds, was sufficient proof<br />
to me that they had run to the full extent they<br />
could in the imposition of duties. If there be<br />
any one mode of raising taxes that is more ob-<br />
noxious to the people then another, it is a<br />
stamp duty—a stamp tax on every note, bill,<br />
receipt, or paper. We are told that there will<br />
not be a very large increase of duty, because<br />
Canada admits many articles duty free. I<br />
have been to some trouble in turning to the re-<br />
turns of articles imported by Canada, and I<br />
find the result of the examination to be that<br />
the whole amount of imports for 1863 amoun-<br />
ted to $45,964,000. Now we are told $23,000,000, or<br />
or one-half, are free goods, and that since<br />
Canada has so many free goods, the conse-<br />
quence is, that running the tariff over the<br />
whole, she has a lower scale than Nova Scotia,<br />
In order to arrive at the incorrectness of this<br />
assertion, you must look at the nature of her<br />
importations, and see what those free goods<br />
are made up of. I find articles under the<br />
Reciprocity treaty $12,330,000. Of course these<br />
are free goods there as here, and would con-<br />
tinue to be so under Confederation. Again,<br />
coin and bullion is put down, although in Nova <br />
Scotia it is never called an import; but when-<br />
ever a Bank gets in a qualty of money, in<br />
Canada, it is placed among the Imports; the <br />
amount given is $4,652,287. I find down for<br />
books $455, 941. Again, the vehicles and car-<br />
riages of travellers crossing the lines to see<br />
their friends are down at $104,585. Again<br />
gravel and clay are among their imports; clo-<br />
thing and army and other stores for mili-<br />
tary and naval purposes, nearly a million<br />
more. Therefore you see that they put down<br />
among their imports articles which were never<br />
dreamed of here. The amount of these arti-<br />
cles I have enumerated as free here, or which <br />
we do not call an import, is $22,516,223. </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">There being in all their free goods only
half</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">a million which would pay duty under our
ta-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">riff. Add this to the amount of goods
paying</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">duty under their own, and the whole imports</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">of dutiable goods will only amount to
$23,448,-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">270, being $9.35 per head of population,
from</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">which would be collected $2.40 by their
tariff,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">making it over 25 per cent; whilst our
imports,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">deducting free goods and articles
re-exported,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">amounted to $5,360,106—being $16.20 to each</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">inhabitant yielding $2. 53 per head in
duty,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">equivalent to 15 3-5 per cent tariff. It
has been</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">asserted on some occasion that under Confe-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">deration we will not necessarily be called
upon</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">to come under this high Canadian tariff.
Now</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I claim that under the arrangements of this</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">confederation the new expenses involved
will</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">necessitate an increase of tariff. We find
in</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">the report a number of new servies which
in-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">volve new expenses. First,there is the
inter-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">est on the Intercolonial railway $707,000
a year.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Then we have the expenses of the civil
govern-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ment $540,000; the legislative charges
$630,000.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">In 1863 Canda, with a less number of repre-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">sentatives than is proposed to be given in
the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">general government, the expenses were
$627,-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">373. At the the same rate the expenses for
the</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">large government would be $850,000; but the</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">delegates have put the amount down at
$630,-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">000. Then
it is proposed to give on million<br />
for militia, which would be about $500,000 ad-<br />
ditional. The public works and buildings put<br />
down at $400,000. Then there is an additional<br />
sum given to Canada for local purposes. She<br />
retains her local revenues, $1,297,043, and re-<br />
ceives</span> a subsidy of $2,006,121, being a total of<br />
$3,303,164; while the average sum she has had<br />
in four years was $2,021,979—which gives her<br />
an increase of $1,281,185. In the same way<br />
there is an increase in local expenses to P. E.<br />
Island of $61,712, and to Newfoundland $124,-<br />
000. Add to all these for interest on additional<br />
dedt allowed Nova Scotia and New Brunswick<br />
$215,000 and you have a total of new charges<br />
upon the confederated colonies of $4,458,897.<br />
From this may be deducted reduction in local<br />
services in Nova Scotia $297.000, and in New<br />
Brunswick $71,047—together $350,047—leaving<br />
the new expenditures $4,108,850. Now the Ca-<br />
nadian tariff of 25 per cent average on all duti-<br />
able goods applied to the Maritime Provinces<br />
will realized a part of this sum. Nova Scotia, <br />
it has been ascertained by calculation, will pay<br />
additional $468,525; New Brunswick estmated<br />
to pay $200,000; Newfoundland and P. E. Is-<br />
land $300,000—in all $968,525, which will still<br />
leave, after we are all placed under the Canadi-<br />
an tariff, $3,140,335 to be provided by a furtehr<br />
increase of taxation. Now suppose we only pay<br />
one-tenth of this, #3,140,335 it will make, added<br />
what we shall pay, under the present Canadian<br />
tariff, an addition to our present annual taxa-<br />
tion of $782,560, for the benfit of the Ottawa<br />
Government. Whilst those who have addres-<br />
sed the house more particularly on the local<br />
expenses, have shown that we shall have to<br />
raise by direct taxation a large sum to meet<br />
the wants of roads, bridges, education, and<br />
other services, I may here remark that Nova <br />
Scotia has now the largest sum of any of the<br />
Colonies for local purposes per head $1.96, but<br />
under the Quebec arrangement will have the <br />
least—$1.124.</p>
