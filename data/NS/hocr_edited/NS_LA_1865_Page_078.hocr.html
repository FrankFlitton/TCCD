and advocates some local matter, do I not</span><br />
feel that it is my duty to assist him if
his re-<br />
quest ought to be granted? This legislature<br />
does not hesitate a moment in answering his<br />
appeal. So it would be in the case of
confede-<br />
ration. Every man in the general parliament<br />
—whether from Canada or Nova Scotia—would<br />
feel an equal interets in the whole
confederacy.<br />
I cannot see what possible interest that
Cana-<br />
dians could have for crushing or injuring
us?<br />
Is it not obvious that it would be for
their<br />
interests much more that we should be a <br />
city of 100,000 instead of 30,000 people.
It<br />
is for the interest of Canada to build up
our<br />
great seaports on the Atlantic so that she
may<br />
have an outlet to the ocean when the St.
Law-<br />
rence is closed. Without these great
outlets<br />
of trade of St. John and Halifax, Canada<br />
would be placed in a position of great
difficulty<br />
in time of war with the great power on her<br />
frontier. My hon. friend from Cape Breton<br />
has alluded to my presence at
Charlottetown,<br />
when the delegrates were meeting there, but<br />
I do not imagine that fact had much
influence<br />
over confederation. He told you at the
outset<br />
that you were injuring the best interests
of the<br />
country, by going into confederation ; but
he<br />
went so far as to say at the close that
when-<br />
ever the people were prepared for union he
was<br />
ready to obey their wishes. Under these
cir-<br />
cumstances I do not think we can put him<br />
down as a most determined opponent of con-<br />
federation. I believe the time will come
when<br />
the people of this country will be ready
to ac-<br />
knowledge the necessity of confederation,
and<br />
adopt it. They will see the great benefits
that<br />
they must derive from breaking down these<br />
vezatious custom houses that now stand on<br />
your frontier, so many obstacles to the
growth<br />
of industry and wealth in these Provinces.<br />
Look at your different currencies. Go to
P. E,<br />
Island and you find your money actually has<br />
increased in value. Go, again, to New
Bruns-<br />
wick and you find it decreased. Thus by<br />
every means in our power we create hosti-<br />
lity between these several provinces. Does
any<br />
person pretend to assert for an instant
that this<br />
is a state of things that should be
allowed to<br />
prevail for a single moment more than we
can<br />
help it? That these provinces belonging to
the<br />
same crown, and influenced by the same spi-<br />
rit of loyalty to the British Empire
should per-<br />
petuate all the incongruities that now
exist? I<br />
awaited with fear and trembling the
results of<br />
the Quebec Conference ; but, when I
consider-<br />
ed them carefully, I have no hesitation in
say-<br />
ing that the best interests of Nova Scotia
were<br />
carefully guarded. I was afraid that our
most<br />
valuable resources—our mines and minerals—<br />
might be yielded up by Confederation, and I<br />
was proud to find that our delegates had
wise-<br />
ly reserved to this country this valuable
source<br />
of revenue. I am convinced that these
resour-<br />
ces alone under Confederation would give us<br />
all the means necessary to carry on our
local<br />
affairs. We have only to look at the
results<br />
that have been obtained during the past
four or<br />
five years to gain some idea of what we may<br />
expect in the future from the financial
argument,<br />
I shall not say much, for it is
superfluous to do<br />
so. It is a matter of little consequence
whether<br />
we pay a few cents more a head, provided we<br />
get in return corresponding advantages.
Or, is<br />
it to be supposed that our burthens will
not be<br />
increased more largely than they are now in</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the natural order of things, whether we
have<br />
Confederation or not? Suppose we have Con-<br />
federation, are we all to stand still? I
presume<br />
each of these colonies will continue to
prosper<br />
as they have for the past ten or fifteen
years—<br />
that the revenue of each will
correspondingly<br />
increase. And how will the large revenue at<br />
the disposal of the General Government be
ex-<br />
pended? I presume in accordance with the<br />
wants of the whole Confederacy—not with re-<br />
spect to the interests of any particular
colony.<br />
Whenever any great public works are
required<br />
in any part they will be gone on with.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCDONNELL: In the North-West terri-<br />
tory, for instance.</p>




























































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCFARLANE: I believe the time will<br />
come, although many of us will not live to
see<br />
it, when that vast region will be the
abode of<br />
millions of human beings. There you have a<br />
territory abounding in most valuable
resources.<br />
and which could afford means of subsistence<br />
to more people than can be found on this
Con-<br />
tinent. A good deal has been said about the<br />
Canadas combining for the purpose of
injuring<br />
the Maritime Provinces. Now any one ac-<br />
quainted with public affairs on this
Continent<br />
must know that there must long be
antagonism<br />
between the two sections into which Canada
is<br />
divided. That antagonism proceeds from
some-<br />
thing more than mere diversity of interests—it<br />
is one that is the strongest of all, that
of race.<br />
The population of Lower Canada is as loyal
as<br />
any in British America—being decidedly mo-<br />
narchiical in its tendency, and well
satisfied<br />
with the advantages it receives from its
con-<br />
nection with the British Empire. That
French<br />
population has to a large extent the same
in-<br />
terests as we have, and we may be sure they<br />
would combine with the Maritime Provinces
in<br />
preference to the Upper Canadians. I feel,<br />
however, that it is unnecessary for me to
go<br />
into the subject of Union at length, for,
as I<br />
said at the outset, it is not actually
before us.<br />
I don't believe the time has arrived for
its full<br />
discussion in this House. Let me say, how-<br />
ever, that the friends of Confederation
have<br />
never had a wish to force it upon the
people—<br />
strongly convinced as they are that it is
con-<br />
nected with the best interests of the
country.<br />
Entertaining these views, I feel that it
is my<br />
duty to use all the means in my power to
con-<br />
vince those who are within the scope of my
in-<br />
fluence. I believe in all sincerity that
the<br />
time will soon come when the people will be<br />
found fully alive to the beneficial
results that<br />
will accure from this scheme. Let its
friends<br />
be patient, and use all the legitimate
means at<br />
their command to make their views known to<br />
the people. Can any one believe that<br />
this Province should continue to remain<br />
in the isolated condition it has been for<br />
fifty years? That we are now going on<br />
properously no one can doubt. Nova Scotia<br />
is certainly one of the most flourishing<br />
colonies of the British Empire, but
Confedera-<br />
tion will not endanger that prosperity. I
be-<br />
lieve, indeed, that confederation is
necessary<br />
in order to preserve the enjoyment of that<br />
peace and prosperity we now have. I have no<br />
hesitation in saying that when the war is
over<br />
in the States, I do not apprehend much
danger<br />
to ourselves; I believe that the people
will not<br />
be anxious for hostilities with a power
like<br />
England, and that they will not be willing
to<br />
add to the great burthens they have already<br />
created. But, at the same time, I believe
they<br />
