of Mr. Bourinot.</span></p>










































































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. BOURINOT :— As no one appears de-<br />
sirous this afternoon of commencing the de-<br />
bate I shall endeavour as briefly as
possible to<br />
state the opinions I entertain on the
subject<br />
under consideration. No doubt the question<br />
has been pretty well exhausted. Many able<br />
speeches have already been made both in and<br />
out of the house, and the press has gone
into<br />
the subject very fully; but I think it is
the<br />
duty of every member in this Legislature to<br />
state his views. It is the opinions
expressed<br />
in this house that will influence the
people the<br />
most. In accordance with the resolution
mov-<br />
ed by the Provincial Secretary last
winter, a<br />
delegation was appointed for the purpose<br />
of conferring with others from New
Brunswick<br />
and P. E. Island with the onject of uniting<br />
the Maritime Provinces. You are all aware
of<br />
the history of the delegation at P. E.
Island,<br />
and therefore it is unnecessary I should
refer<br />
to it. I cannot refrain, however, from
alluding<br />
to the composition of the delegation
itself.—<br />
First of all, four out of the five were
members<br />
of the Bar—the fifth being the Provincial
Se-<br />
cretary who, daresay, is a good a lawyer as<br />
the others. This fact, however, at the very<br />
outset produced distrust and no little
dissatis-<br />
faction throughout the country. It was
quite<br />
right and proper that the Provincial
Secretary<br />
should be a member of that delegation—his<br />
position and great abilities will not be
denied<br />
by any man in this country. The leader of
the<br />
opposition was also one of the number, and
it<br />
was but right that he should be, but what I<br />
complain of is, that the mercantile and
other<br />
interests were not represented in this
delega-<br />
tion. It is true that the Provincial
Secretary<br />
has in speeched at Temperance Hall and
else-<br />
where told you that several mercantile
gentle-<br />
men connected with the Legislature were
ask-<br />
ed to be members of the delegation—Hon. J.<br />
H. Anderson, Mr. Tobin, and Mr. Locke, but<br />
that for reasons given they were unable to
go.<br />
When the services of these gentlemen could<br />
not be obtained the selection fell upon
the hon.<br />
Mr. McCully, and the remaining members of<br />
the delegation were the Attorney General,<br />
and hon. Mr. Dickey from Cumberland. Now<br />
I must say it would have given far greater
sa-<br />
tisfaction if the government had looked
around<br />
these benches and selected gentlemen who<br />
could well have formed a part of that
delega-<br />
tion and represented the mercantile
interests<br />
of this country. And ley me ask why was it<br />
that in making the selection they should
have<br />
ignored the Island of Cape Breton
altogether?<br />
Were there no men to be found<br />
there who were capable of taking part in<br />
that delegation? And I can point out many<br />
around these benches, and one hon.
gentleman<br />
from the other branch of the Legislature
who<br />
could as well represent the mercantile
interest<br />
as those named. Look at little P. E.
Island,<br />
no greater in extent, certainly not to be <br />
compared with Cape Breton in resources; it<br />
was represented by no less than <span style="font-style: italic;">seven</span> mem-<br />
bers in Canada. Look again at the fact that<br />
no less than three gentlemen were taken
from<br />
one country alone. That favored country of<br />
Cumberland sent the Provincial Secretary,<br />
Mr. Dickey, and Mr. McCully. Therefore it<br />
will be seen that in the selection of the
dele-<br />
gates the interests of the different
sections of<br />
the province were altogether disregarded;
and <br />
under the circumstances it is not strange
that</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> at the very initiation of this question
dissatis-<br />
faction arose. I can assure you the
feeling was<br />
very widely extended in the section I
repre-<br />
sent, for Cape Breton, as in many other
cases,<br />
was entirely blotted out. And I was nearly<br />
foregetting to mention another fact in
connec-<br />
tion with the delegation at Charlottetown.—<br />
My hon. friend from Cumberland (Mr. McFar-<br />
lane) happened also to be present at the
time<br />
the delegation assembled—no doubt it was <br />
thought to be an act of wise foresight to
have<br />
him at hand in case some accident should
hap-<br />
pen to the other delegates from Cumberland.<br />
You all know what took place at Charlotte-<br />
town. Gentlemen from Canada joined the <br />
delegates from the Maritime Provinces and<br />
mysterious conferences ensued. A great deal<br />
of what took place there has not yet come
to<br />
light, but it will be known hereafter. When<br />
hereafter those private correspondence
come to<br />
light—as occurs so often in history—we
shall<br />
learn some facts which will give the world
a <br />
better idea than they have now of the
motives<br />
and reasons that influenced the delegates
in <br />
coming to the conclusion they did. These
gen-<br />
tlemen then left Charlottetown and came to<br />
Halifax, and when they had done so, I
receiv-<br />
ed a telegram inviting me to a banquet to
be<br />
given the Canadian delegates. Just imagine<br />
a telegram inviting me to come to a dinner<br />
party given at a place 300 miles distant
from<br />
were I resided. What took place at that fa-<br />
mous dinner patry? Any number of speeches<br />
were made. Union was descanted on at length<br />
and the Canadian delegates as well as the <br />
Provincial Government, no doubt, thought
that<br />
the public mind was quite decided on the
sub-<br />
ject and satisfied with the expression of
opin-<br />
ion on that occasion. Then they went on to<br />
Canada under the impression that the people<br />
of these provinces were quite ready to
accept<br />
the results of their conferenced. We all
know<br />
what took place in Canada. The reception<br />
given to our delegates was very flattering—a<br />
perfect ovation—and I am proud to say that<br />
some of the gentlemen that represneted this<br />
province did credit to themselves and Nova<br />
Scotia. Having finished the business of the<br />
delegation they returned to Nova Scotia
where<br />
they soon learned the state of the public
mind.<br />
The meetings at Temperance Hall gave them<br />
indications of the state of public opinion,<br />
even in a city which was likely to be
benefit-<br />
ted, whatever might be the case with
respect<br />
to the rest of the province. In this city
which<br />
had so much at stake they had actually to
lis-<br />
ten to derisive cheers and hisses. Then a<br />
meeting was held at Windsor. In that town<br />
the Provincial Secretary endeavored to im-<br />
press on the minds of the people, that no
ap-<br />
peal on the constituencies was necessary.
He<br />
went into the hisory of the scheme at
length<br />
to show that it had been before the country<br />
for years, and that under such
circumstances it<br />
was unnecessary that the people should be<br />
consulted in reference to the subject. Now<br />
that the people should be told that they<br />
were to have nothing to do with de-<br />
ciding so important a question as changing<br />
the constitution of the country, but that
the<br />
house could deal with it irrepective of the<br />
wishes of those they represented, was some-<br />
thing most preposterous to propound in a<br />
country like this, enjoying the prilileges
of<br />
responsible government—where the people are<br />
the fountain of authority. The Prov. Sec'y<br />
