               discussion was at hand or that a solution of its

               difficulties was practicable. We hoped that a 
               <br />
               period would arrive when the leading minds 
               <br />
               of the different provinces might agree upon 
               <br />
               some feasible plan, but we hardly dared to ex-

               pect that it would be in our time. And yet 
               <br />
               now, strange to say, when the difﬁculties have 
               <br />
               been removed, when the leaders of the diﬁer-

               ent parties in all the different colonies have 
               <br />
               united upon common ground, and the time has

               it unpalatable to those who thought their posi-

               not this the feeling which prevails with us at 
               <br />
               present? Are not small local jealousies at the 
               <br />
               bottom of most of the objections? The colony 
               <br />
               which is most hostile now is the small Island 
               <br />

               <br />
               stoutly refused to accept the constitution then 
               <br />
               was little Rhode Island. But has Rhode Is-

               had she determinedly held out for isolation.

               <br />
               summary of them as they lie in my mind. 
               <br />
               They have been so often brought before the

               public, both in the press and on the platform,

               <br />
               already fully occupied. And yet at the risk of

               yet in these latter days the old adage has been 
               <br />
               called in question, and isolation is lauded 
               <br />
               as practically of more value. It some to me to 
               <br />
               require no argument to prove that whatever 
               <br />
               power or force there may be in isolated frag- 
               <br />
               ments is greatly extended when those frag- 
               <br />
               ments are consolidated into one. And that 
               <br />
               power when exerted in self-defence is far more 
               <br />
               effectual under the direction of one central au- 
               <br />
               thority, than when exerted by different and of- 
               <br />
               ten conﬂicting inﬂuences. And this brings me 
               <br />
               to the next point. Union is defence.

               umphantly through these Provinces, and the 
               <br />
               United States, what was the position of the 
               <br />
               neigboring Republic? It was one busy hive of 
               <br />
               industry; and the great object of its citizens 
               <br />
               was to labor to increase their wealth. Its 
               <br />
               military power was triﬂing. What is its posi- 
               <br />
               tion now? It has become one of the greatest 
               <br />
               military nations in the world, and that too 
               <br />
               upon our frontier. While we remain more 
               <br />
               isolated settlements, this great nation is in a 
               <br />
               position to successfully attack us. If we can 
               <br />
               do anything, then, to protect ourselves, surely 
               <br />
               we ought to lose no timein doing so. If Union 
               <br />
               is one of the best means towards warding off 
               <br />
               an adversary, as we maintain it is, then let us 
               <br />
               adopt it. Now, I am far from being an alarm- 
               <br />
               ist. I believe the American Government has 
               <br />
               had the most friendly feelings towards these 
               <br />
               Colonies. The late President, to whose untime- 
               <br />
               ly end we referred recently with such deep sym- 
               <br />
               pathy, was, I am convinced, sincerely desirous 
               <br />
               of preserving peace between England and 
               <br />
               America, and the Governments of the different 
               <br />
               Provinces have always had the most amicable 
               <br />
               relations with that of the United Sates during 
               <br />
               all the perplexities of the terrible civil war 
               <br />
               now existing. But I am not insensible to the 
               <br />
               fact that democratic governments are frequent- 
               <br />
               ly obliged to give up their own convictions 
               <br />
               and bow to the will of the people; and there- 
               <br />
               fore I look with deep interest to the sentiments 
               <br />
               expressed by the journals and leading minds 
               <br />
               among our neighbors, and I cannot disguise 
               <br />
               from myself that there has been far from a 
               <br />
               friendly feeling manifested towards England 
               <br />
               in quarters where it was least expected. I do 
               <br />
               not refer so much to the New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">York</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Herald</span>, and 
               <br />
               papers of that stamp, as to the expressed opi- 
               <br />
               nions of men of standing and intelligence. 
               <br />
               The other dayI lighted upon a letter of Pro— 
               <br />
               fessor Parson's, Professor of Law at the Har- 
               <br />
               vard University, published a month or two 
               <br />
               since, that surprised me not a little, and serves 
               <br />
               to show the views entertained by some men, 
               <br />
               at least, in high position, in New England. 
               <br />
               From it I cull the following extract. He says: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “I have not the slightest hesitation in expressing 
               <br />
               my Opinion that the conduct of England, relative to 
               <br />
               the Trent, was insolence carried to the last extreme; 
               <br />
               wasa. great insult to this country as well a great 
               <br />
               Wrong: and stained the name of England, in history, 
               <br />
               with disgrace. The thought is now in men’s minds, 
               <br />
               that when our turn comes, we will imitate her exam- 
               <br />
               ple. That we will, so far as the different circumstan- 
               <br />
               ces permit, use her own words and her own methods, 
               <br />
               and with an equal peremptoriness and a similar threat 
               <br />
               of immediate war and a refusal ofdclay or negotiation, 
               <br />
               force her into immediate choice between compliance 
               <br />
               or war. And if we would follow her example, we 
               <br />
               must do just this; neither more or less. Most earnest- 
               <br />ly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />do I deprecate any such thought, any such act.— 
               <br />
But in my opinion the only way in which it can be 
               <br />
               prevente is to press upon our people the truth. For 
               <br />
               the lover of peace to forget the conduct of England or 
               <br />
               to defend it, is equally impossible. But our nee le 
               <br />
               may see that her conduct was not only so wrong id
