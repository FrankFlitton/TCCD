<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> must have known that the house was
elected <br />
under our existing constitution, and could not <br />
change it without consulting those that elected <br />
them. Yet the Provincial Secretary was <br />
quite ready to strike down all ex- <br />
isting rights and privileges enjoyed by the <br />
people, in order that he might march on to Ot- <br />
tawa. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But far and wide the spirit of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peo-</span> <br />
ple asserted itself. Little by little a feeling <br />
arose which spread over the length and breadth <br />
of this province, and showed the government <br />
that they must pause in their rash career. In <br />
my own county, at ﬁrst, much indifference was <br />
felt on the question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span> but as
the discussion pro- <br />
ceeded, a strong feeling of dissatisfaction at <br />
the scheme exhibited itself among all classes <br />
of the peeple. Before passing away, however, <br />
from the meeting at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Windsor, let</span>
me say that <br />
the Prov. Secretary dwelt particularly on the <br />
report of Lord Durham, who ma be said to <br />
have been the ﬁrst to have broug t this ques- <br />
tion before these provinces. That report is <br />
valuable, in consequence of its own intrinsic <br />
merit and the ability of its author; but we <br />
must all be aware that the mass of the people <br />
have never known anything about its contents, <br />
and could not, therefore, be at all affected by it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, turning to the scheme itself, we ﬁnd
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that it provides for a federal union of
these <br />
provinces. I have no hesitation in saying that if <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t</span>he conference had devised a
legislative union, it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> have been preferable. Every
one knows <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> the local legislatures will
be under this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme—very insrgniﬁcant bodies.
Another <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">portion</span> of the scheme provides
that the Lieut. <br />
Governors shall be selected by the Governor- <br />
General at Ottawa. What class of men shall <br />
we, then, have for our local governors? These <br />
very men who formed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
convention. But <br />
how would they be looked upon? The posi- <br />
tion of Lieutenant-Governor would become a <br />
mockery in the estimation of the public. I can <br />
understand the principle that induced the Bri- <br />
tish government to elevate Mr. H<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incks</span>
to a <br />
colonial governorship and should like to see <br />
it extended to Mr. Howe who has far higher <br />
claims than the former to such a position; but <br />
any one must see that the people would never <br />
approve of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public man</span> being
made gover- <br />
nor in his own colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It has never
yet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> <br />
fully explained <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why we have</span> been
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given local</span><br />
legislatures in this scheme. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might
be satis-</span> <br />
factory <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to the</span> Lower Canadians,
but it would <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">never </span>do for these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other provinces.</span>  The muni- <br />
cipal system that is in full operation in Canada <br />
West, or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very system</span> of
county sessions <br />
that exists here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now, </span>might
have done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><br />
work assigned to the local legislatures. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower Canadians</span> would not agree
to legislative <br />
union, an arrangement might have been made <br />
so as to give them the control of those matters<br />
in which they felt especial interest without in-<br />
terfering with the rest of the provinces. I am<br />
glad, however, that some gentlemen who form-<br />
ed part of the Conference had some respect for<br />
that section of Canada which has been so<br />
trampled upon by the Western Canadians for<br />
years past. It is known to many that Upper<br />
Canada has long been endeavoring to deprive<br />
Lower Canada of many of those institutions<br />
and rights which they value—the very princi-<br />
ple upon which the union was formed it has<br />
been attempted to destroy. Just in that way <br />
would the Upper Canadians in case of a Con-<br />
federation, endeavour to override the interests</span></span></p>

As re-<br />
spects the question of taxation, it has been so<br />
ably handled by the hon. member of North<br />
Colchester that I shall not attempt to touch it,<br />
except to say it requires no lengthy calcula-<br />
tions to see that if this union were consum-<br />
mated our taxes would be largely in-<br />
creased, if for no other object that the<br />
defences of Canada, more especially the<br />
fortifications that have to be erected, and<br />
the gunboats that must be put on the lakes.<br />
The Canadians are now expected to defend the<br />
lakes by means of those iron clad monitors,<br />
and the expense of only a very few would be<br />
at least three or four millions of dollars. We<br />
have also heard that Hon. Mr. Geo. Brown,<br />
when he went back to his constituents at To-<br />
ronto, from the Convention, told them in ex-<br />
plicit terms that when this Confederation took<br />
place their canals would be enlarged, and that<br />
the North-West territory would be opened up.<br />
Millions of dollars would be expended for that<br />
purpose alone, and under these circumstances<br />
is there any man so blind as not to see the<br />
great burthens that will be necessary impos-<br />
ed upon us by Confederation. As respects the<br />
proportion of representation that Nova Scotia<br />
will ahve, let me say at once that no other<br />
principle would have been acceptable as a ba-<br />
sis except population ; but when you look at the<br />
small number Nova Scotia will have in pro-<br />
portion to the Canadas, cannot you see she will <br />
be treated just as Cape Breton has been for <br />
years past. I admit in all sincerity that a<br />
greater desire new exists in this Legislature<br />
to do jsutice to Cape Breton, than was the<br />
case some time ago. Whoever is familiar with<br />
the history of legislation in this province is<br />
aware that no member from Cape Bre-<br />
ton could for years raise his voice on<br />
behalf of that island without being met<br />
with sneers, if indeed he was heard at all.<br />
At first I was inclined to rather favour the<br />
scheme of Union for this reason ; I felt it was<br />
better to be an appendage to Canada that to<br />
Nova Scotia, as we might then obtain<br />
more justice than we have received in the past<br />
from Nova Scotia. However, as I said before, I <br />
can see evidence of a disposition to pay more<br />
consideration to the section whose interests I<br />
have especially at heart. Gentlemen must<br />
know this, that the moment the Union takes<br />
place out grants for roads and brdiges must be<br />
diminished, (for the revenue at the disposal<br />
of the local government will be altogether in-<br />
sufficient for local wants,) or else you must re-<br />
sort to that most unpalatable that the commercial<br />
interests of this province would be benefitted<br />
by Union has been scattered to the wind by<br />
gentlemen who have preceded me. Look at<br />
our trade returns, and you see that we send<br />
Canada nothing of those great products such<br />
as fish and coal, for which there is a free mar-<br />
ket at present in that country. What<br />
do we get from them except a few barrels<br />
of flour? If it is necessary to have a uni-<br />
form tariff and currency, there is nothing<br />
to prevent it being done without Confederation<br />
—that has been conclusively shown time and<br />
again since this question was discussed. Now<br />
let me say a few words in respect to the recep-<br />
tion of the scheme in England. We are all<br />
familiar with Mr. Cardwell's despatch—how<br />
heartily he approved of it. The Provincial<br />
Secretary told us that the English Government<br />
