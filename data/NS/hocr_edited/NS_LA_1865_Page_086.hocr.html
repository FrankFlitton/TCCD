<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> within the limits of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Province. On some <br />
occasions he had even gone ahead of the Ad- <br />
ministration for the time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being.</span>
In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1857</span> a re— <br />
solution was moved in the house for the con- <br />
struction of the Pictou Railway. On that oc- <br />
casion he had warmly advocated that scheme, <br />
being then as now in opposition. The Govern- <br />
ment of the day, acting under the belief of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> they considered most
judicious under ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isting</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances,</span> refused <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> accept the re- <br />
solution; and, after the calm consideration <br />
which a few years had enabled him to give to <br />
the subject, he had no hesitation in acknowled- <br />
ging that he thought they discharged their duty <br />
to the country on that occasion.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> When last yea<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r</span> an attempt to repeal the In— <br />
tercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway act</span> was made
by the go- <br />
vernment he had not hesitated to express in <br />
the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emphatic</span> terms his
views in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">communication</span> between the
Provinces, and his <br />
preference of that great scheme to even the <br />
Pictou railway which was at the last session <br />
under discussion. He would refer to his lan- <br />
guage on that occasion to show how warm <br />
he had expressed himself on the subject. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ It appears,” he had then said,
“according <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the opinions</span> of the present
government of <br />
this province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that </span>the terms
agreed to were too <br />
burdensome for Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia. </span>
The
Canadian <br />
ministry have also taken the ground that the <br />
burthen imposed upon them is too great. With <br />
these opinions prevailing at the Nova Scotia <br />
end and at the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end, it</span>
is obvious that <br />
even if the act remained in force,the prospect <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of an intercolonial</span> line is
adjourned to an in— <br />
deﬁnite period in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future. </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Therefore</span> I feel <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that we</span> can approach the subject
of a Pictou <br />
railway in a very different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spirit</span>
from what <br />
we could have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done if </span>there
were any hopes <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the legislature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in reference to</span> the interco- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lonial </span>scheme. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> have no hesitation in saying <br />
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> dealing with this
important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> I<br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doing</span> justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to myself if </span>I did <br />
unequivocally state what policy I would pur- <br />
sue if the intercolonial project were feasible. <br />
I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the branch</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> to Pictou</span> is of sectional in— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terest compared</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with the</span> former scheme. It <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> priceless boon to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova Scotia, jut-</span> <br />
ting out as she does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">500</span> miles
on the path to <br />
Europe, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> could have
consummated an un- <br />
dertaking which must. have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">her</span> the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wharf</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> traﬂic of two continents <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concentrate."</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

again, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span>I must fully confess <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> conclu- <br />

I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> given up so desirable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a project</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Inter- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway scheme. </span> I have always looked
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at it as</span> the precursor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of that </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union</span>
which has <br />
so long been the hope of every intelligent man <br />
who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wishes to see the</span> arena of
politics in this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province enlarged</span> and ennobled.. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fear
very</span> <br />
much that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">actions of the government</span>

rail- <br />
way as a public man, and from Provincial con- <br />
siderations, but he was a representative of a <br />
county <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through which</span> that road
must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass.—</span><br />
Again, he was interested in a valuable mineral <br />

terprize, provided the route selected should be <br />
the one indicated in the proposals of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span><br />

it would be seen that not only his interests as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> <br />
public man and as a representative of the <br />
county, but also his personal and private inte- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rests were</span> at stake in this

if he did not give his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assent</span> to
the present reso- <br />

too, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he could</span> appeal to the

testimony, that during this and last session he <br />
had not exhibited any spirit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">towards</span>

to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impu-</span> <br />

a desire to discharge what he believed to be <br />
his duty to the people of this country. <br />

mined that the ﬁnancial year should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end on</span>
<br />
the 30th September instead of on the 3lst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Decr.,</span> <br />
