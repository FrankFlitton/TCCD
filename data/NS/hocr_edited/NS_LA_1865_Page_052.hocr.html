<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">bringing his name there, but also the
existence <br />
of those opinions. His Grace the Archbishop<br />
had also been referred to—as every one was
<br />
aware, that eminent gentleman, respected bu<br />
all creeds and classes, had made his
opinions<br />
known. These opinions had had their course<br />
through the country, and thier effect would<br />
appear in due time. The Presbyterian
clergy-<br />
men had also been alluded to, but how long<br />
was it that the Provincial Secretary had
placed<br />
such confidence in the ministry of that
deno-<br />
mination. A very strange revulsion of
feeling<br />
had taken place in that hon. gentleman. A<br />
few years ago he could not find anything,
too <br />
coarse in the vocabulary of Billingsgate
against<br />
Presbyterian clergymen, but he had changed<br />
his tone all at once.</p>



























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. member for Halifax (Mr. Shannon)<br />
had attempted to justify this demonstration<br />
by reference to what took place last year
in<br />
connection with the illustrious name of
Shake-<br />
spere. No analogy could be drawn between<br />
the two demonstrations. That of last year<br />
was a national demonstration; not merely in<br />
Halifax and Nova Scotia, but in all
portions of<br />
the British empire—wherever literature and
<br />
civilization are prized. It was an honour
to <br />
our common humanity—not an honour to any<br />
particular nationality, but one to the
name of<br />
man. Therefore it was that men of every
cli-<br />
mate and every nation vied with each other
in <br />
paying tribute to a name that will live as
long<br />
as this world will last. Another individual<br />
had been mentioned as approving of the <br />
scheme of Confederation—General Williams.<br />
No man of Nova Scotia was prouder of the <br />
fame of that distinguished Nova Soctian
than<br />
he himself, and it was a proud day when he
<br />
sat in the Speaker's chair and put the
resolu-<br />
tion by which the House paid him honour. He<br />
admired that illustrious gentleman's
talents,<br />
but upon this question the people of Nova
Sco-<br />
tia and their representatives were as
competent<br />
to form a sound and safe opinion as even
the <br />
hero of Kars.</p>






















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. Provincial Secretary defended the
<br />
demonstration on the ground that it was
only<br />
right that we should return the courtesies
paid <br />
to the delegates. There was no doubt that
the <br />
various bodies in Canada did treat these
gen-<br />
tlemen in the handsomest style. Although<br />
this province paid very handsomely for the<br />
visit they made, yet he rather believed
that<br />
they travelled free—that all their
expenses,<br />
even their washing bills were paind in Ca-<br />
nada. No one could have the slightest
objection<br />
to the hon. Provincial Secretary or the
Attor-<br />
ney General cracking as many bottles of <br />
Champagne as they pleased as private indivi-<br />
duals with these Canadian gentlemen, but it<br />
was not just or right that the governemnt
of <br />
this country should endorse the action of
the<br />
city of Halifax in respect to this
demonstra-<br />
tion. Without dwelling further on the sub-<br />
ject he would read the following
resolution as<br />
expressing the views of himself, and as be
be-<br />
lieved, of a majority in the House:<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Whereas a public demonstration is pro-<br />
posed to take place this evening in the city of<br />
Halifax for the purpose of giving a public re-<br />
ception to certain gentlemen who formed a <br />
portion of the late convention at Quebec.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">And whereas by the programme of the de-<br />
monstration, it appears that a portion of the <br />
Volunteers force are to take part in such de-<br />
monstration. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 349 458 1491 4195">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Resolved, as the sense&nbsp; of the house of this <br />
demonstration, that it is not, and must not be,<br />
taken to evince the feeling of the majority of this<br />
house or of the people of this province as being<br />
favourable to the Union of British Colonies as<br />
settled by the Quebec conference, and further<br />
that in the event of the local forces taking part<br />
in such demonstration, such action would be<br />
highly derogatory to their true position and<br />
distasteful and displeasing to the house, and <br />
that the house entertaining these views can-<br />
not proceed to the order of the day without in<br />
the first place, in the present emergency, ex-<br />
pressing the foregoing sentiments.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. KILLAM said as the government had <br />
conceded the position, he did not see it was ne-<br />
cessary to keep up the matter further. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. BOURINOT said that the Provincial<br />
Secretary, in the course of his second Confede-<br />
ration speech had stated that the petitions now<br />
on the table of the house did not show that the <br />
public opinion of Nova Scotia was opposed to<br />
this scheme of union devised at the Quebec<br />
Conference. Now he had the honour of repre-<br />
senting one of the largest constituencies in the <br />
province; he had individually expressed no<br />
opinion against Confederation, but at the same<br />
time he could not help seeing that the public<br />
sentiment of the country was opposed to the <br />
scheme. As respects the resolution before the <br />
house, it would not have been presented at all<br />
if it had not been stated in the programme that<br />
the volunteers would form part of the con-<br />
templated procession. The Provincial Secre-<br />
tary had, however, stated that the volunteers<br />
were not to be present, and therefore the whole<br />
thing was at an end. He looked upon this de-<br />
monstartion in a different light to any member<br />
who had spoken upon the subject. Gentlemen<br />
would re-call the demonstrations that took<br />
place during the summer months. He was<br />
glad that our people had given the Canadian <br />
visitors a reception that did honour to Nova <br />
Scotia. On this occasion, however, there was<br />
an expression of opinion given in favor of<br />
union. As far as the sentiment of Halifax<br />
audiences went, it was in support of union;<br />
but that feeling was not responded to by the <br />
country. The delegation representing Nova <br />
Scotia, thinking they were representing public<br />
opinion in this province, went to Canada and<br />
agreed to the scheme which was not before<br />
the people. Every one knew what a feeling of<br />
hostility existed in all the rural districts<br />
against this proposed Confederation, Now he<br />
looked upon this demonstration as one<br />
which the citizens of Halifax were at<br />
perfect liberty to make apart from any boday of<br />
men such as the Volunteers, but why was this<br />
affair got up. It was intended to exhibit sym-<br />
pathy for those despondent men who were<br />
coming among a population who recieved them<br />
so heartily last year. Every thing that could<br />
soothe their disappointment at the failure of<br />
their grand scheme would be doubtless done<br />
that night. He trusted it would have a bene-<br />
ficial effect upon them, but despite all this, let<br />
it be remembered, that Confederation was not<br />
and would not be adopted.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MILLER said that he rose chiefly to make a <br />
a few remarks in respect to the hon. member for<br />
Halifax, (Mr. Shannon), who had the bad taste<br />
to refer, in connection with the Union agitation, <br />
to some of the disgraceful scenes witnessed in <br />
Temperance Hall. He did so, because that gen-<br />
