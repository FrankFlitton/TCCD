think it <br />
was right to reduce the salaries oft those who <br />
were already too poorly paid in order to in- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crease</span> other. He would rather be

go further and increase<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> vote for this service. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LOCKE</span>

home in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vessel</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">captain</span> had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alluded</span> to the dan- <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notice</span> of the government, from
whom he had <br />
no doubt that it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span>
due considera— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion,</span> He would like to know if he
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever</span> <br />
done so. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. PRO. SEC. would make enquiry, and if

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lay</span> it upon the table. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COLIN</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CAMPBELL</span> said that the matter <br />
under discussion related to a money claim, <br />
and should, under the rules of the house, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> <br />
to the government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without</span> any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remarks.</span> He <br />
had had several claims of a similar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nature</span>
and <br />
had always adopted that course; but it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seemed</span>
<br />
that some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> were in the
habit of rais- <br />
ing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion</span> upon matters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> had no <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> to be before the house, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">order </span>that their <br />
remarks might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> to the country.
He did not <br />
think that was right. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. PRO. SEC. by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">command,</span> laid on the <br />
table a return asked for by the member for <br />

in motion. Also, a return from the Chairman <br />
of the Board of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Works</span> shewing
the number of <br />

license <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law.</span> At present the law
restricts the <br />

</span>OF THE UNION <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">QUESTION.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BOURINOT</span>
said, as there was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing be—</span> <br />
fore the House, he was desirous of asking the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> a question in
reference to the <br />
Union of the Colonies. That question was agi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tating</span> the country to perhaps a
greater extent <br />
than any other question for years, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
peo- <br />
ple were naturally anxious to hear the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> on the subject. He was
therefore <br />
desirous of learning from the Provincial <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Secretary, as</span> the leader of the
government, <br />
when it was proposed to discuss this all im- <br />
portant topic. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. PRO. SEC. replied that the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was <br />
now in possession of all the correspondence re- <br />
lative to the subject, and the policy of the <br />
government relative to it would he submitted <br />
at an early day. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BOURINOT</span>
said this was not the answer <br />
he expected, He had hoped that the govern- <br />
ment would have been prepared to name the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day</span> when they would be ready to
lay this <br />
question fully before the House. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span>
the <br />
prorogation was close at hand, was not the <br />
proper time for the discussion of a question <br />
which required so much deliberation on the <br />
part of every one in the Legislature. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> THE <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FRANCHISE
ACT.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. ROSS <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he </span>would like to know from <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincial</span> Secretary what
action the Go- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vernmenti ntended to</span> take with
the counties <br />
that did not comply with the terms of the <br />
Franchise Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He </span>observed that
the Custos <br />
from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria county</span> merely
mentioned that <br />
nothing was done in that county <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to
enforce the</span> <br />
terms of the Act, which fact he mentioned the <br />
other day. He thought the Custos <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should
have</span> <br />
assigned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some reason why the proper
steps</span> <br />
were not taken, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plainly expressed in
the</span> <br />
law. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Custos</span> also mentioned
that assess- <br />
ment rolls would be forwarded. Such rolls <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">operate</span> only from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">counties</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that acted</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under revisors and revising</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> districts. The <br />
sessions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in,</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case would</span> meet this month, <br />
and if they can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> legally, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> it was neces- <br />
sary that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some positive</span>
instruction should be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent to</span> a Custos who failed to
act up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span> the law <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and </span>gave no reason for so
palpable a neglect of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty.</span><br />
