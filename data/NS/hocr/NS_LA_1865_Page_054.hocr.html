               <br />

               these things before it was too late. He did not in-

               any reliable source might do much harm. He

               hon. gentlcman with his usual appropriateness of

               given in honour of Shakespeare last spring, which 
               <br />
               was as far from the present case, as the hon.

               member himself was from the moon. It was true 
               <br />
               the House did adjourn, but it was more in com- 
               <br />
               pliment to the occasion, than to any living indi-

               two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cases—between</span> Shakespeare and the Dele- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and these have been handed down to the present

               ness of the hon. member. There might become

               minutes. It‘anyone had, at the outset, asked the

               question, whether the volunteers were to take 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               actually nine-tenths of tho <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peepic</span> were opposed 
               <br />
               to Confederation. Only 3000 persons came before 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> stating that they were opposed to 
               <br />
               Confederation. He knew that a large number of 
               <br />
               the petitioners were induced to sign the petitions, 
               <br />
               through false representations that were made to 
               <br />
               them. Here Mr. Henry went on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> refer to the 
               <br />
               fact that when the delegates were in Canada, the 
               <br />
               volunteers, on several occasions, took part. in the 
               <br />
               celebration. He thought that some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parties?</span> in 
               <br />
               this country had attempted to mix up the ques-

               <br />
               the celebrated speech at Truro. It was party in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuences that originated the petitions that were got 
               <br />
               up on this question. What he desired, was that the 
               <br />
               people should have every opportunity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> discus-
