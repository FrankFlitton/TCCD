               accom lished by the recent action in connection

               they brought forward a measure which would 
               <br />
               largely diminish the public expenditure, and had 
               <br />
               succeeded in passing it notwithstanding the op- 
               <br />
               position from the other side. The alterations 
               <br />
               effected by the civil list bill were far more ex- 
               <br />
               tensive than any scheme of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retrenchment</span> which
