               <br />
               I may say that the only thing which I regret is 
               <br />
               the name by which the United Provinces are to 
               <br />

               <br />
               - the name British America. I feel convinced 
               <br />
               that under Confederation we are to have such 
               <br />
               advantages that even gentlemen opposed to it

               <br />
               I see no ground for the assertion that we are 
               <br />
               to lose our liberties,—-our laws will be as well 
               <br />
               administered as ever,—the local legislatures 
               <br />
               will have sufﬁcient funds to meet the local 
               <br />
               exigencies, and we will enjoy every privilege 
               <br />
               which we had before. I am convinced that in 
               <br />
               this respect our people will hardly know the 
               <br />
               difference.

               One of my constituents said to me the other 
               <br />
               day, “ What about this Confederation ?” I said 
               <br />
               to him, "You live in the country: you will get 
               <br />
               up in the morning and attend to your work; 
               <br />
               the same money will be expended on the roads 
               <br />
               and bridges, your children will be educated, 
               <br />
               and you will never know the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> except 
               <br />
               when you bring your wares to market you will 
               <br />
               get a double price for them.” Mr. Bourinot 
               <br />
               told us the other day what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> would 
               <br />
               do for Cape Breton—that the people of that is-

               land will have markets they never had before, 
               <br />
               and justice will be done to Cape Breton. I 
               <br />
               believe the statement, and further, next to the 
               <br />
               county of Halifax, I believe that the county 
               <br />
               of Pictou will receive the largest. beneﬁt 
               <br />
               What is the case in that county? I have been

               the instrument, to some small extent already

               Mr. COFFIN said :-I did not intend to make 
               <br />
               any remarks upon this subject, but there are two 
               <br />
               or three matters upon which I wish to make a 
               <br />
               few observations; The hon. gentleman who just 
               <br />
               spoke referred to New Brunswick as havin had 
               <br />
               two elections before the consummation 0 this 
               <br />
               measure ; the only thing we are complaining ot 
               <br />
               is that our government are passing upon it with- 
               <br />
               out giving the people an opportunity of consider- 
               <br />
               ing it at the polls ; for I contend that previous 
               <br />
               to the last election no mention of the question 
               <br />
               was made to the electors. When the delegates 
               <br />
               returned from Quebec the leading men of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick ﬁnding that they could not command 
               <br />
               a majority in the Legislature, dissolved the 
               <br />
               House and appealed to the people, when a large 
               <br />
               majority was returned against them. Subse- 
               <br />
               quently a majority was returned in their favour, 
               <br />
               but the eople of that Province have no reason 
               <br />
               to comp ain. In Nova Scotia the case was quite 
               <br />
               diﬂ'crent,—the delegates, although the majority 
               <br />
               was against them, had not the manliness to go to 
               <br />
               the country. We only ask that the measure may 
               <br />
               be postponed till the proper time arrives for an 
               <br />
               election. If the measure were not then sustain— 
               <br />
               ed it might at some future period be ratiﬁed by 
               <br />
               the people and could then be carried by their 
               <br />
               consent. As it is, you are depriving the people 
               <br />
               of their constitution without allowing them to 
               <br />
               Speak fer themselves ;-you are saying to them, 
               <br />
               ‘ you are not ﬁt to judge, we Will take away 
               <br />

               It has been stated here that Mr. Watkins told 
               <br />
               the House of Commons that the question had 
               <br />
               been before thc people, and had been preached at 
               <br />

               arbitrary act on the part of the Imperial Parlia— 
               <br />

               <br />
               throws new light on the proceeding. I know
