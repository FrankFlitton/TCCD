               this moment. My. hon. friend has deliver- 
               <br />
               ed to us a most impassioned harangue. Not 
               <br />
               content with giving us his views in the most 
               <br />
               emphatic manner—not content with an 
               <br />
               nouncing that no good will come in this 
               <br />
               world to those of Confederate faith—he goes 
               <br />
               on further, and in his closing sentences 
               <br />
               shuts us out from any hopes of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">happiness:</span> 
               <br />
               in the world to come. (Lau hter.) Is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span>

               any wonder that I should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelza</span> littlecm-

               barrassed in rising to speak after being thus

               formally excluded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> everlasting bliss.
