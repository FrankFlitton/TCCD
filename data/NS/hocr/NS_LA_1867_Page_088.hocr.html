               given the hon. member any authority to go across 
               <br />

               ible with the system of government which we 
               <br />
               enjoy. Selected by some irresponsible persons, 
               <br />
               in deﬁance of the principles of the British con- 
               <br />
               stitntion, the hen. member undertook to present 
               <br />
               himself before the British Government and Par- 
               <br />
               liament as one ot the “people’s delegates.”— 
               <br />
               Having spent a great deal of time and money, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman now volunteered an expla- 
               <br />
               nation of the way in which he had discharged 
               <br />
               his trust to the members of the Legislature, as 
               <br />
               a portion of the people whom he undertook to re- 
               <br />
               present. The House was aware that the hon. 
               <br />
               member spent some seven months in England 
               <br />
               pretending to be a people’s delega'e. In com- 
               <br />
               mon with two other gentlemen, he undertook 
               <br />
               to teach the people of England how to deal 
               <br />
               with an important question, and had given the 
               <br />
               people of this country an enormous amount of 
               <br />
               trouble, and had expended a great deal of mo- 
               <br />
               ney, in sending perambulators through the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince for the purpose of getting up petitions.— 
               <br />
               Now, after all he had done, the hon. member 
               <br />
               had condescended to give the House and coun- 
               <br />
               try some explanations. These explanations re- 
               <br />
               minded one of the story of the person who had 
               <br />
               been called upon to pay for a newspaper which 
               <br />
               had been sent to him ; he‘put in avariety of pleas ; 
               <br />
               he said he never subscribed to it, that he never 
               <br />
               took it, that it was never sent to him, and if it was 
               <br />
               sent tohim, he never took it out of the post ofﬁce, 
               <br />
               and that he had paid for it already. It now ap- 
               <br />
               peared that, notwithstanding all the time and 
               <br />
               money spent, the petitions were of a character 
               <br />
               that precluded their being presented to the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish Parliament. From want of information on 
               <br />
               his own art, he had misled the people. Had not 
               <br />
               he (Dr. .) as one of the people, then, a right to 
               <br />
               complain of the hon. member? The hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber had acknowledged that the petitions had been 
               <br />
               treated with contempt—that no member of the 
               <br />
               British Parliament could be induced to present 
               <br />
               them. Having resented himself in England 
               <br />
               without any aut ority, having volunteered his 
               <br />
               services to the people of this country, he now con— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fessed</span> that the moment the battle was commen- 
               <br />

               The hon. member for East Halifax had also 
               <br />

               <br />
               regarded this Union as S'rengthening the connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the Crown. From the very inception 
               <br />
               of this Union, from the ﬁrst despatch written on 
               <br />
               the subject, the same opinion was entertained by 
               <br />
               the statesmen of England. In fact, the argu- 
               <br />
               ment which recommended itself particularly to 
               <br />
               the British Parliament, was that it increased and 
               <br />
               strengthened the tie that now binds these Colo- 
               <br />
               nies to the Empire. Such was the idea that ex- 
               <br />
               hibited itself on every page of the despatches of 
               <br />
               Mr. Cardwell, and an abler statesman was never 
               <br />

               mencement of this question down to the time he 
               <br />
               attempted to prevent one of his political friends 
               <br />
               taking up a position, which he considered in-

               jurious to British subjects on this side of the At- 
               <br />
               lantic, he had not hesitated to express his deep 
               <br />
               conviction that the interests of the Empire re- 
               <br />
               quired that these Colonies should be bound and
