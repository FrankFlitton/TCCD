               you if a public man, after an exhibition 
               <br />
               like that, is in a position to ask that the slight- 
               <br />
               est weight should be given to any declaration 
               <br />
               that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> make? He may throw hisbase 
               <br />
               insinuations into the face of this deliberative 
               <br />
               Assembly—he may degrade himself by at- 
               <br />
               tempting to degrade this Home, but it will 
               <br />
               avail nothing with every man who knows that 
               <br />
               the gentleman who brought here a great ques- 
               <br />
               tion of public policy, and pledged his public 
               <br />
               character to its support, nowunblushingly de- 
               <br />
               clares thatit was a farce, a delusion, and a de- 
               <br />
               ception, which he had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passing</span> upon this 
               <br />
               deliberative Assembly. If I stood in such a 
               <br />
               position,I would forgive the hon. member if be 
               <br />
               attributed base and dishonorable mo ives as 
               <br />
               the reason why I had been inﬂuenced to adopt 
               <br />
               a course so untenable and so at variance with 
               <br />
               the nublic policy to which I stood pledged as a 
               <br />
               public man.

               I am going now to deal with another gentle-

               man, outside of these walls, who brought that
