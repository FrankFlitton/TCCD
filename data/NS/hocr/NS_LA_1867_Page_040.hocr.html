               The main point upon which the amendment

               <br />
               precedents. Mr. Archibald showed that when 
               <br />
               the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament</span> found it necessary to 
               <br />
               change the arrangements connected with the 
               <br />
               succession to the Crown and to bring in a new 
               <br />
               dynasty—when those noble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{men</span> who guarded 
               <br />
               the rights of the country, and were determined 
               <br />
               to get rid of the Stuart family, had induced 
               <br />
               Parliament to adopt their views; there was no 
               <br />
               appeal to the people, although the leading men 
               <br />
               in the movement knew that their action might 
               <br />
               be made a ground of impeachment There was 
               <br />
               a Union consummated in the history of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng.</span> 
               <br />
               land to which I may refer, although it is not; 
               <br />
               exactly a precedent. I refer to the union of 
               <br />
               Scotland with England. It was hardly to be 
               <br />
               expected in that case that the lesser nation would 
               <br />
               have concurred. We all know the spirit of 
               <br />
               Scotchmen—how the ancestors of the men of 
               <br />
               that day had, with their backs .to the unconque- 
               <br />
               table highlands and their faces to the foe, repel- 
               <br />
               led the English invader on every occasion—and 
               <br />
               the same spirit led them to oppose the union 
               <br />
               with England. They feared, as our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opponents</span> 
               <br />
               profess to do, that the smaller state would he 
               <br />
               swamped by the greater—but what was the re- 
               <br />
               sult? From that day Scotland went on in the 
               <br />
               path of improvement, and Scotchmen could 
               <br />
               take their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">price</span> with Englishmen in any part of 
               <br />
               the world. One gentleman some time ago 
               <br />
               styled the Scotch a race of paupers, but if they 
               <br />
               were. they found their way down to rich <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Enu-</span> 
               <br />
               land, and wherever there was an outlet for in- 
               <br />
               tellect or industry Scotchmen were to be found 
               <br />
               availing themselves of the noble education 
               <br />
               which they had received and of the opp rtuni- 
               <br />
               ties of advancement which appeared. From the

               <br />
               ed to enterprise Scotchmen predominated there; 
               <br />
               and at the present day Scotland is one of the 
               <br />
               most prosperous parts of Great Britain. This 
               <br />
               is, to some extent, a parallel case with ours ex- 
               <br />
               cepting that we will have far greater inﬂuence 
               <br />
               in the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament</span> and a higher position 
               <br />
               in every respect ; and I feel that the result will 
               <br />
               be in our case still more satisfactory. If we look 
               <br />
               at what an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nppaal</span> to the people really is, we 
               <br />
               will see that it is not in all cases satisfactory.

               could tell which exhibited the real feeling of the

               the real enemy was gathering on the frontier. 
               <br />

               lish feeling and the strong desire to maintain 
               <br />

               <br />
               majority was returned in favour of Union. I

               and one of the delegates gave us aﬂnancial view 
               <br />
               of the matter. _ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> 
               <br />
               The hon. member for East Halifax told us 
               <br />
               that it was impossible to remain as l'we are, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               he expressed his preference to ses Nova. Scotia 
               <br />
               as a county of England, like Kent or Surrey. I 
               <br />
               would agree to a large extent with that if it were 
               <br />
               possible, but we know well what the reslt would

               side would be willing to enter into such aunion.

               It would utterly pro trate all our energies to ',be

               But the hon. gentleman went further, and said;

               that if we could not become an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">integral</span> part of

               <br />
               their minds to such an alternative. I think. 
               <br />
