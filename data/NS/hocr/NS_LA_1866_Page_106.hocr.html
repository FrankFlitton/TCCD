               them, I must be aware of their views, and un— 
               <br />
               less a very great change has taken place since 
               <br />
               I left them I know that they are not prepared 
               <br />
               to adopt the proposition of union at present. 
               <br />
               At this time last year a. scheme of Confederation 
               <br />
               was before the people, and they had an op- 
               <br />
               portunity of examing and judging it. They 
               <br />
               did examine it, and a. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of them became 
               <br />
               opposed to it—not because a great deal ot’ 
               <br />
               pains and talent had not been taken with the 
               <br />
               measure; because now that we are about to 
               <br />
               form a new delegation, I do not think that we 
               <br />
               can send gentlemen of more talent and more 
               <br />
               knowledge of the business they have to per- 
               <br />
               form than those who went before. If I vote 
               <br />
               for this resolution, when I return to my eon- 
               <br />
               stituents and tell them that I voted for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union</span> 
               <br />
               they will naturally ask what kind. of a. union 
               <br />
               we are to get, and I shall be unable to tell 
               <br />
               them ;—last year I could give them the de‘ails, 
               <br />
               this year I can only say that the matter is to 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arranged</span> three thousand miles away, and 
               <br />
               if they ask me whe'hen .he representatives ot‘ 
               <br />
               the people will have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> opportunity of pas— 
               <br />
               sing on it afterwards can, only tell them no 
               <br />
               such opportunity will bo afforded, and that 
               <br />
               they will be bound by the arrangements which 
               <br />
               are made in England. Iregret that my con—

               <br />
               opinions I value, and whose friendship I de-

               <br />

               <br />
               terests oi the country. I must say Ieannotun— 
               <br />

               <br />
               not fall in with the idea. of union are disloyal, 
               <br />
               —the people whom I represent are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> loyal as 
               <br />
               any upon the face of the globe, and if any man 
               <br />
               had the hardihood to charge disloyalty upon 
               <br />
               themit would not be necessary to hurl back 
               <br />
               the imputa'ion—it would rebound With greater

               I believe to be desirable when we are pre-
