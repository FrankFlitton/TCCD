               Mr. COFFIN. — I regret that I am obli-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7ed</span> to address the House at this late hour of

               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anorher</span> day’s debate. and as the death-knell 
               <br />
               of my country is sou ding, I do not wish to 
               <br />
               give a silent vote. he subject before the 
               <br />
               House is one of tuo great magnitude to be 
               <br />
               passed over lightly ; it is a question of greater 
               <br />
               magnitude than any that has hitherto been be- 
               <br />
               fore the Legislature. It is one calculated to 
               <br />
               sweep away our constitution,the dearest rights 
               <br />
               of Nova-Scotians as free men ; it is one, sir, 
               <br />
               calculated to raise the ire of every one of N ova 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scoda’s</span> sons ; it is one that cannot be passed 
               <br />
               without ignoring the rights of the electors of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. Sir, I regret exceedingly that a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution</span> was passed in this House in 1864, 
               <br />
               authorizing a delegation to consult as to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.yropriety</span> of a union of the Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.‘or</span> out of that has grown the delegation to 
               <br />
               Quebec, and there with closed doors a consul- 
               <br />
               ration was held which ended in bartering away 
               <br />
               this ﬁne Province, the people, and the consti- 
               <br />
               tu ion, to Canadian rule. There we have been 
               <br />
               sold, there we have been valued, there the 
               <br />
               rights dear to us of governing ourselves, and 
               <br />
               of being in ourselves a free, independent and 
               <br />
               contented people, were given up ; and when it 
               <br />
               :s,known through the length and breadth of 
               <br />
               the land that this resolution has been passed, 
               <br />
               then it is that the indignation of the people 
               <br />
               will be aroused to an extent perhaps that will 
               <br />
               be calculated to weaken the strong feel- 
               <br />
               ings <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span> attachment to their rulers that had 
               <br />
               hitherto existed. If this question had been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agproached</span> in a way that was fair and honor- 
               <br />
               a e by ﬁrst submitting the whole question to 
               <br />
               the country at the polls, and if it were then 
               <br />
               passed by the Legislature there would not 
               <br />
               he ve been the cause of complaint which at pre- 
               <br />
               sent exists. This is indeed a. most dangerous 
               <br />
               step which is about to be taken; we have a 
               <br />
               thinking and intelligent people in Nova Sco- 
               <br />
               tia—a people that will not be likely to tolerate 
               <br />
               having their constitution bartered away with- 
               <br />
               out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> consent, and without having those 
               <br />
               privxleges which responsible government was 
               <br />
               intended to secure to them. I do not believe 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Imperial</span> Parliament will ratify this 
               <br />
               sche ne, if they are made properly acquainted 
               <br />
               - <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the whole transaction and with the facts 
               <br />
               which bear upon the case. Loyalty to the 
               <br />
               Crown has been spoken of. Sir, we pretend 
               <br />
               to foster that feeling, whilst at the same time 
               <br />
               a few men who now govern the country—who 
               <br />
               are expected to govern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people according to 
               <br />
               their well understood Wishes, and who ob- 
               <br />
               tained place and power at the polls in 1863 un- 
               <br />
               der the cry of retrenchment, but who have so 
               <br />
               managed the public affairs as to gain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> them-

               tation. Sir, I would ask can language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be,</span> em-

               other six months we have very indifferent com-

               <br />
               are we to reach there? Would it be over the 
               <br />
               ice. or on snow shoes over land? Sir, had the 
               <br />
               public men of Canada been true to their inte- 
               <br />
               rests, and the Colonial Secretaries of England 
               <br />
               been true to their engagements, we should 
               <br />
               long before this have had the railway built.— 
               <br />
               Can Canadians or Nova Scotians expect to 
               <br />
               build that railway on terms made easier as to 
               <br />
               ﬁnances than by the oﬁ'ers made by the Brit— 
               <br />
               ish Government in 18f2,to which the Canadians 
               <br />
               refused to accede? If they had acceded, the 
               <br />
               road might now have been built. The reason 
               <br />
               for Canada not accepting the offers then made 
               <br />
               may have been that they expected at some 
               <br />
               future day to use that work as a lever by 
               <br />
               which to force the Maritime Provinces into a 
               <br />
               union; and, sir may we not well believe that 
               <br />
               they have accomplished the end in view? They 
               <br />
               must be famous for their powers of persuasion 
               <br />
               or they never could have buttered the delega- 
               <br />
               tion from this Province so smoothly as to et 
               <br />
               them to sign that document at Quebec. I e- 
               <br />
               lieve it was at the last great dinner at Mon- 
               <br />
               treal that the iniquitous scheme was comple- 
               <br />
               ted—a scheme so unjust to the people of this 
               <br />
               Province—a scheme by which the country and 
               <br />
               the Constitution they loved so well have been 
               <br />
               most grossly bartered away—and a scheme 
               <br />
               that the government of this Province will not, 
               <br />
               na , sir, dare not, submit to the people at the 
               <br />
               po ls. But it may be said by the friends of 
               <br />
               this measure that the scheme is to be altered, 
               <br />
               they having met the propositions of the hon 
               <br />
               gentleman from Richmond, but does not every 
               <br />
               one know that this is a farce, adelusion? Does 
               <br />
               not every one know that that proposition was 
               <br />
               known to the government long before it was 
               <br />
               announced on the ﬂoors of this house? The 
               <br />
               resolution is that the British Government shall 
               <br />
               arbitrate between con ending parties, when
