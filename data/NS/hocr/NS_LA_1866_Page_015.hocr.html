               ﬁnal decision to the Colonial oﬁic'e. We know 
               <br />
               'that the Canadian element is predominant 
               <br />
               there, and these Maritime Provinces, however 
               <br />
               largely represented, would have little inﬂu- 
               <br />
               ence. The scheme that would come back would 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> be substantially that of Quebec. I could have 
               <br />
               understood the hon. member had he proposed 
               <br />
               —and the proposal may be in harmony with 
               <br />
               my own views—a Convention of all the Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, called with the sanction of the Crown, 
               <br />
               in British North America. Such a ConventiOn 
               <br />
               would consider the whole question, and come 
               <br />
               to an agreement, which could then be submitted 
               <br />
               to the people. If he had proposed some such 
               <br />
               scheme as that, I could have understood the 
               <br />
               hon. member; but to take the whole question 
               <br />
               from this House is what can never be agreed 
               <br />
               to by the people. I do not misinterpret the 
               <br />
               feeling of this country when I say that there is 
               <br />
               a universal feeling against any union with 
               <br />
               Canada. I do not say that this feeling is wise, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~there</span> may be a good deal of prejudice mixed 
               <br />
               up with it; but to follow the course proposed 
               <br />
               would be to destroy all hopes of unity. I am 
               <br />
               surprised at the motion of the hon. member, 
               <br />
               but I apprehend the result. The Government 
               <br />
               are only too glad to see _a way of getting out 
               <br />
               of their present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties:</span> However, I know 
               <br />
               if there is a lack of patriotlsm and intelligence 
               <br />
               in this House, it is not the case elsewhere. 
               <br />
               Feeling that, I do not hesltate to say this: A 
               <br />
               Union of these Provinces, consummated in this 
               <br />
               way, contrary to the Wishes of the people, will 
               <br />
               not be worth the paper upon which it is re-

               shown a disposition to abandon that pet

               time he and his friends appeared determined 
               <br />
               to fasten upon the people,—a scheme, in my

               opinion, as obnoxious and distasteful to the

               <br />
               a strong advocate of union, but urges that the

               a factious opposition. The union of these
