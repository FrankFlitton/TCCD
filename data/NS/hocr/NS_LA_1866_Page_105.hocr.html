               the country on such an occasion as this, and I

               fear that the undue pressure brought to hear to

               to support. I al <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1in</span> believed in Responsible 
               <br />
               Government and the principle upon which that 
               <br />
               sort of Government rests—that the people shall

               to-night, it would be seen that they would not

               that we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gain</span> some substantial ad- 
               <br />

               <br />
               who tulVO‘atc the scheme a great deal of more 
               <br />

               <br />
               some of our privileges, I think it behooves us to 
               <br />
               examine well before passing the resolution. I 
               <br />
               have yet expressed no opinion on the principle 
               <br />

               <br />
               the country that I will assent to no scheme until 
               <br />
               the people have passed upon it. By the division

               reproach which the one applied to the other.— 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the interests of the people. As long as these 
               <br />
               were opposed to each other the wrongs and inju— 
               <br />
               ries done to our people were well exposed; but

               now both support each other, without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to 
               <br />
               the interests of Nova Scotia. We are told that 
               <br />
               we are on the eve cfa great crisis, and it is true 
               <br />
               that some Fenians are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organizing</span> in the States,

               <br />
               nancial affairs on a sound and proper basis.— 
               <br />
               Thcy desire peace, and both France and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng-</span> 
               <br />
               land will look with jealous eye on any extension 
               <br />
               of their power on this continent. France is in— 
               <br />
               terested in Mexico, and Great Britain in the 
               <br />
               North American Provinces, and both would 
               <br />
               unite to prevent further increase of territory to 
               <br />
               the States. This is the best guarantee for peace. 
               <br />
               In the event of war it is acknowledged by those 
               <br />
               sent out ofﬁcially to report on our defences that 
               <br />
               Canada, with its long line of land and water 
               <br />
               boundary is our weak spot, and that it cannot be 
               <br />
               defended as well as Nova Scoti a, which is almost 
               <br />
               surrounded by water. Here we have men who 
               <br />
               will defend us, and are willing to do so ; but 
               <br />
               force us into a union with Canada, and you will 
               <br />

               <br />
               the extent of which it is painful to contemplate. 
               <br />
               Therefore, in the question of defence we gain 
               <br />
               weakness instead of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength.</span> It is said that,

               with the present rate of consumption, coal will be 
               <br />
               soon scarce in Great Britain, and then Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and Cape Breton Would be the last places 
               <br />
               that would be abandoned. Mr. Archibald says 
               <br />
               that this house will remain. But take away
