               We are told that we should not go into this 
               <br />
               Union—that Nova Scotia is now happy and

               prosperous, and does not require union to 
               <br />
               make her more so. Let me ask how are we

               going to provide for the continuance of that 
               <br />

               <br />
               can show ns where, without union, we will be 
               <br />

               sition for that period or less time? We only 
               <br />
               jeopardize it whilst we remain isolated as at 
               <br />
               present. Look at the geographical position of 
               <br />
               N ova Scotia, at her great resources, and ask it 
               <br />
               she should not wish to be even more prosper- 
               <br />
               ous than she actually is, or without union can 
               <br />
               ever expect to be. What is it that placed

               partly an agricultural country, but she has 
               <br />
               also most valuable mineral resources only is 
               <br />

               <br />
               our manufacturing system develop itself, but 
               <br />
               if we had a market of four millions of consu-
