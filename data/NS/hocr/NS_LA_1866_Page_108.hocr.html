               The first move in regard to a union of any

               Legislature. The Provincial Secretary then

               Lieutenant Governor to communicate with 
               <br />
               New Brunswick and P. E. Island, in reference

               to the appointment of delegates to meet at some

               agree upon a basis for a union of the maritime

               <br />
               without opposition. I think it was the duty of 
               <br />

               by the delegates at that time as to a maritime
