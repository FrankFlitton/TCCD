               Mr. KAULBACK said :-I feel some diﬂidence 
               <br />
               in addressing the House upon a question of such 
               <br />
               importance; but I consider it adnty devolving 
               <br />
               on me to express my views upon it, and in 
               <br />
               doing so I shall have occasion to referto the 
               <br />
               arguments of some gentlemen who have preceded 
               <br />
               me. I conceive that this subject, having been 
               <br />
               long before the country, is no new uestion; 
               <br />
               it has been before the people for more t an half 
               <br />
               a century, and has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitated</span> by our leading 
               <br />
               men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fur</span> a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scan</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> Every man con- 
               <br />
               sidering the question should surely have solved 
               <br />
               it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> matured his mind by this time. In 1814 
               <br />
               Judge Sewell, of Quebec, urged the necessity of 
               <br />
               a scheme of British North America on the 
               <br />
               Duke of Kent. A Union of the Colonies 
               <br />
               was urged by the Earl of Durham in 1839 when 
               <br />
               a scheme analogous to that now before us was 
               <br />
               mentioned. In 1849 a British American League 
               <br />
               was formed in Toronto who seemed to have had 
               <br />
               the matter fully before them. In 1854 we had 
               <br />
               Mr. Johnston moving in the matter, supported 
               <br />
               by Mr. Howe and Mr. Young. From 1854 to 
               <br />
               1860 we have correspondence on the subject. In 
               <br />
               1857 Mr. Johnston <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> delegated to go to Eng- 
               <br />
               and in connection with Intercolonial matters. 
               <br />
               In 1858 there was a delegation from Canada of 
               <br />
               the some kind. In 1860 Dr. Tupper delivered 
               <br />
               lectured un a. Union of the Colonies; in 1861 
               <br />
               Mr. Howe moved a resolution which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> ado ted 
               <br />
               by the House. In 1862 Mr. Annaud, Mr. owe 
               <br />
               and Mr. Mch‘ly went to Canada on the subject. 
               <br />
               In 1863 Mr. McGee lectured in Halifax, and in 
               <br />
               1864 I was present at a banquet in this city 
               <br />
               when Mr. llowe gave an eloquent address on 
               <br />
               the question. It cannot therefore be said, that 
               <br />
               the time has not. arrived when the question 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be solved. The hon. member for Shel- 
               <br />
