               <br />
               on that side I would like to say a few words 
               <br />
               on this question. I have been so much pleased 
               <br />
               during yesterday and to-day in listening to 
               <br />
               the statements made by gentlemen connected 
               <br />
               with the delegations, that I could have re- 
               <br />
               mained here fer hours listening to their 
               <br />
               speeches, and have been satisﬁed if I heard 
               <br />
               nothing more. But I happen to be one of 
               <br />
               those to whom the epithet “dumb dogs” 
               <br />
               was applied last year. The debate on that 
               <br />
               occasion had continued to so late an hour of 
               <br />
               the evening, that I did not think it advisable 
               <br />
               to say anything, but I found shortly after- 
               <br />
               wards that the Morning Chronicle referred to 
               <br />
               me_as one of those who had been expected to 
               <br />
               deliver my sentiments but had not done so. 
               <br />
               And Mr. Howe also, in his addresses in the 
               <br />
               country, referred to what he called the inde- 
               <br />
               cent haste with which the resolutions were 
               <br />
               carried, stating that some of those who had 
               <br />
               been expected to speak had not uttered a word. 
               <br />
               I thought that my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sentiments</span> on this subject 
               <br />
               had been too well known to require that I 
               <br />
               should say a word, and I do not feel that I can 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">add</span> anything of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”value</span> to what has already 
               <br />
               been uttered; but I am willing to say a few 
               <br />
               words to show that I am still as strongly in fa- 
               <br />
               vor of this great measure as ever. This is not 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time that I have spoken in favour of 
               <br />
               Union. As long ago as 1361 my vote was 
               <br />
               pledged to its support. Mr. Howe, the then 
               <br />
               Premier, in that year came down with a. reso- 
               <br />
               lution which received the sanction of the 
               <br />
               house. On a subsequent occasion, 1863, when 
               <br />
               we were debating the question of the Interco- 
               <br />
               onial Railway, though my views diﬁ‘ered 
               <br />
               somewhat from the then Government as to the 
               <br />
               . mode in which the guarantee should be raised, 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               thinking that our Province had been asked to 
               <br />
               Day too much, still I was in favor of the rail- 
               <br />
               road, and when Mr. Howe detailed in such 
               <br />
               eloquent terms the prospects rising before us, 
               <br />
               and when the hon. member for Yarmouth was 
               <br />
               80 carried away as to be willing to vote for the 
               <br />
               Pictou railway. I then made a few remarks re- 
               <br />
               ferring to the Intercolonial line as uniting all 
               <br />
               the Provinces, and expressing the hope that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> 
               <br />
               Would give birth io that new nationality of 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> opposite have shows them- 
               <br />
               seves to be so afraid. I then referred to my 
               <br />
               experience in the old country where colonists 
               <br />
               were treated with indiﬁ’erence, and I said

               of all, it is said thstlhe gentlemen who were

               <br />
               frantic appeals were made to members not to

               support the resolution for the delegation, be- 
               <br />
               cause the action of the House would bind the

               solution being carried, after Mr. Howe had used 
               <br />
               the same language throughout the country. I 
               <br />
               supposed that it would be fully understood that 
               <br />
               the action of the House was ﬁnal: and I was 
               <br />
               much surprised to hear gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making</span> use 
               <br />
               of such an argument on this occasion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Teen</span> 
               <br />
               the hon. member spoke of the tyrannical mode 
               <br />
               in which the measure had been carried out. and 
               <br />
               said he could ﬁnd no precedent for it until he 
               <br />
               went back to the history of ancient Rome, and 
               <br />
               compared the act of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> to which

               has been said that on the third reading. when 
               <br />
               some discussion had arisen, a number of 
               <br />
               Peers went away; but we all know what the
