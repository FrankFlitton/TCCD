               durin the debate of last year on the Union ques-

               and country certain authorities which, Iclaimed, 
               <br />
               proved conclusively the right of the Legislature 
               <br />
               to deliberate and ﬁnally decide upon this or 
               <br />
               any other measure which in their judg— 
               <br />
               ment affected the right or interests of the 
               <br />
               people. On that occasion I challenged the hon.

               member and those holding similar views, to bring 
               <br />
