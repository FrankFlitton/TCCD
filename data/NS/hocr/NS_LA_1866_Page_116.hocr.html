               much of the time of t 6 House in deﬁning 
               <br />
               his position, but it could be deﬁned in half 
               <br />
               a dozen words : his position was that of the 
               <br />
               fag of another man. It was notorious that 
               <br />
               Mr. Armand had no idea or will of his own 
               <br />
               but had drawn all his ins iration during 
               <br />
               the twenty odd ears he had een in public 
               <br />
               life from a wel known source. He was 
               <br />
               simply a puppet in the hands of 
               <br />
               another. When the House met that 
               <br />
               gentleman’s object was to become the 
               <br />
               leader of the Anti-Confederate party; 
               <br />
               and it was generally supposed that 
               <br />
               when in England he had represented 
               <br />
               himself in that character to Mr. Cadwell, 
               <br />
               who must have conceived a very poor 
               <br />
               opinion of that party from that circumstance. 
               <br />
               He, Mr. M., had not of course attended the 
               <br />
               caucus of the Liberal part at the opening 
               <br />
               of the Session, nor had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> attended any 
               <br />
               caucus, but he was reliably informed that at 
               <br />
               that meeting the member for East Halifax 
               <br />
               had been left in a minority of one, himself 
               <br />
               voting, on the proposition to supplant Mr… 
               <br />
               Archibald by Mr. Armand as leader—a mi- 
               <br />
               nority, it would be admitted, neither re- 
               <br />
               spectable in oint of numbers nor other- 
               <br />
               wise. From t at day the hon. member had 
               <br />
               commenced a most tortuous course in rela- 
               <br />
               tion to Confederation, which clearly proved 
               <br />
               that personal position was his sole aim. 
               <br />
               He had told him, Mr.'Miller, that he was 
               <br />
               willing to give the whole thing up and that 
               <br />
               he intended to visit Fredericton and com- 
               <br />
               municate with Mr. Smith of New Brunswick 
               <br />
               on a scheme of Union to be submitted to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature}</span> That fact was notorious to 
               <br />
               many in the city, and it dare not be denied. 
               <br />
               For a whole week his departure for that 
               <br />
               Province was expected,——he did not go for 
               <br />
               reasons unnecessary to mention,but from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               he, Mr. Miller, believed, that the charges of 
               <br />
               disloyalty and sympathy with Fenianism, which 
               <br />
               had been made by an injudicious portion of the 
               <br />
               Confederate press, of that province against certain 
               <br />
               members of the Roman Catholic body who op— 
               <br />
               posed Union, would be brought against gentle-

               men representing the Eastern counties. .These 
               <br />
               he suspected to be the tactics about to be resort- 
               <br />
               ed to, and, rccollecting the past, he justly feared 
               <br />
               them. Mr. Armand had at that time ex ressed

               anything to do with the change in the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Inema</span>

               ber’s views and actions he would not pretend to 
               <br />
               say. He would admit that the tortuous cause 
               <br />
               pursued by the hon. member had some inﬂu- 
               <br />
               ence on his (Mr. Miller’s) action, but his mind 
               <br />
               was chiefly inﬂuenced by higher considerations. 
               <br />
               About the same time the last hope of the re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was on our hands, Fenianism had assumed an 
               <br />
               alarming attitude, and the necessity for action 
               <br />
               became imminent. It was under this necessi- 
               <br />
               ty that he reluctantly yielded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> opinion in re— 
               <br />
               ference to an appeal to the people—the only point

               on which his opponents could charge him with 
               <br />
               inconsistency, and which was justiﬁed by the 
               <br />
               exigencies of the moment. After the Lunen- 
               <br />
               burg election, in conversation, he had told Mr. 
               <br />
               Armand that he could not persevere in op 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effecting</span> some compromise by which the ob-

               be got rid of. Mr. Armand agreed with him, 
               <br />
               and the result or that conversation was the ar- 
               <br />
               ticle of the 24th January, which appeared in the 
               <br />
               Morning Chronicle, suggesting a new Convention 
               <br />

               <br />
               munlcuted with Mr. Smith, and represented that 
               <br />
               gentleman as desirous of a common platform 
               <br />
               for compromise, as that article proposed. The 
               <br />
               views therein stated were publicly to be taken 
               <br />
               as the honest expressions of the hon. member, 
               <br />

               <br />
               avowcd that he was not sincere, and merely 
               <br />
               desired to get the dele tes into a snare by 
               <br />
               inducing them to aban <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nf</span> the Quebec scheme.

               He thus played with the friends of union on 
               <br />
               fair terms and the opponents of all union. Ho 
               <br />

               <br />
               question, replied that such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> course would not 
               <br />
               best subserve their own interests. ‘But by

               <br />
               he and his friends would have the best chances
