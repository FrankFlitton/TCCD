               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">putatively</span> valucless. No one, however, would

               bo better pleased than himself if the question

               of the ﬁsheries could be used successfully to 
               <br />
               bring back the Americans to reciprocity. He

               thought the Government had done their duty in 
               <br />
               remonstrating as they did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the adoption 
               <br />
               of the lice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"se</span> system. The history of the

               inﬂuence the action of Canada and the other

               Provinces, which had large territorial rights in 
               <br />

               Mr. Tonm said that it was the abuse <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬂthe</span>

               For many years the mackerel fishery of this

               <br />
               plentiful, was a case in point; the ﬁshermen of
