               similar to each other’s, under which the militia 
               <br />
               of each might be called out at any time, without 
               <br />
               a political Union. We are told of one heart, and 
               <br />
               one soul, and one mind, in respect to the defence 
               <br />
               of the Provinces. New I hold that the British 
               <br />
               Government, as long as this Province remains a 
               <br />

               <br />
               sum of money to be given by each Province every 
               <br />

               <br />
               the consent of our own Legislature, notwithstand- 
               <br />
               ing the strong language which the hon. Provincial 
               <br />
               Secretary made use of in respect to this matter on 
               <br />
               a previous evening. I would hand over this ques- 
               <br />
               tion of defence to the Imperial Government who 
               <br />
               possess the material of war, combined with the 
               <br />
               skill and science required in naval and military 
               <br />

               <br />
               the militia, but how are they expended? Do they 
               <br />
               do a large amount of good? Would not any 
               <br />
               money you would give be expended much more 
               <br />
               satisfactorily by ofﬁcers under the control of the

               The hon. Provincial Secretary defended his 
               <br />
               action in reference to the Union question on the 
               <br />
               ground of the opinions held in this House, and 
               <br />
               elaborated from time to time by Mr. Howe, Mr. 
               <br />
               Young and Mr. Johnston, and also by a lecture 
               <br />
               delivered at Temperance Hall by Mr. McGee, 
               <br />
               which was most enthusiastically received, and on 
               <br />
               the conclusion of which a vote of thanks was 
               <br />
               moved by two of the gentlemenIhave just named, 
               <br />
               to the lecturer. I would remind the Provincial 
               <br />
               Secretary that no action was ever taken practically 
               <br />
               upon this question. We have been told that a 
               <br />
               resolution was passed in the session of 1861. I 
               <br />
               was one of the delegates in 1862, and although 
               <br />
               the question of Union was supposed to be before 
               <br />
               us, the subjects that were really considered were 
               <br />
               Free Trade and the Inter-colonial Railway. I 
               <br />
               may state frankly that there was no formal dis- 
               <br />
               cussion at that convention on the question of 
               <br />
               Union. It was looked 11an as a matter in the 
               <br />
               distance, to be consummated after an Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway and Free Trade had been 
               <br />
               enjoyed for years by the separate Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Then, I say, the hon. gentleman had 
               <br />
               no right to assume from anything that occurred 
               <br />
               there, that the people of this country, were in 
               <br />
               favour of Union, particularly such an one, as has 
               <br />
               been propOunded for our acceptance. The city of 
               <br />
               Halifax is not the Province of Nova Scotia, and 
               <br />
               the expression of opinion that we hear there—- 
               <br />
               which will be heard to-morrow night—is not that 
               <br />
               of the people. It can only be gathered by the 
               <br />
               votes of the several counties, and whenever the 
               <br />
               opportunity is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> for the people to speak out 
               <br />
               on the question, they will do so, in amanner that

               <br />
               he is—as well as the people of England. The

               Colonies have been a heavy burden upon them,
