               question has been before the public for some 
               <br />

               We are here as a part and parcel of the 
               <br />
               British Empire—lying between the Atlantic

               <br />
               question, we must not look at it in its pounds, 
               <br />

               have preceded me and spoken on the subject,

               and therefore it will not be necessary for me to 
               <br />
               deal with that part of the question It is true

               larger than the present United States, and is

               think I can do better than to read an extract

               from a work, speaking of the territory that 
               <br />
