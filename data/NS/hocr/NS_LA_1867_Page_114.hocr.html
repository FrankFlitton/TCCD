               in a positition to iurnish the opinion of one whose

               <br />
               be cheaper to burn coal; but experience shows 
               <br />
               that the contract with Mr. Hyde was dictated by

               <br />
               should receive £250 instead of £600 per annum, 
               <br />
               but he himself has found no ditﬁculty in taking 
               <br />
               £600 a year while he has been in ofﬁce. The

               hon member's consistency, however. shows itself 
               <br />
               in everything. A _few years ago he proclaimed

               that “ rum zend railways were the ruin of the 
               <br />
               country.” I am not prepared to say whether he 
               <br />
               has changed his views as to rum, but we know 
               <br />
               that he has not hesitated to accept the post of 
               <br />
               Chief Commissioner of Railways. As to his ca— 
               <br />
               pacit for that position, we will ascertain whether

               <br />
