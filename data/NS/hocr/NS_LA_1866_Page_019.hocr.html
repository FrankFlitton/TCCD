               <br />
               she agreed with our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> for its construc-

               sary to say, and I will not say, because I do 
               <br />
               not desire to create <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irritation</span> between the go- 
               <br />
               vernments of these colonies. That railway, 
               <br />
               thus bringing us into connection with Canada, 
               <br />
               however valuable it may be in time of war, as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affording</span> a passage for troops, I never regard- 
               <br />
               ed as of much importance in relation to trade, 
               <br />
               because while communication is open with 
               <br />
               Portland, there will belittle or no traﬂic across 
               <br />
               the I itercolonial line. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Though</span> we may attach 
               <br />
               cons .derable importance l0 that line, yet I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maintain</span> it is not necessary to our existence. 
               <br />
               We live by the sea, and have free access to 
               <br />
               other countries,-but it inwlves the existence 
               <br />
               of Canada. She would have no access to the 
               <br />
               United States in time of war, and that railway 
               <br />
               would afford the only means of communication 
               <br />
               which she would have with the mother 
               <br />
               country. I therefore hold as I held in 1862 that 
               <br />
               however valuable the intercolonial railway 
               <br />
               may be to New Brunswick and Nova. Scotia, 
               <br />
               it involves the existence of Canada. I sa that 
               <br />
               no political union is necessary, unless ana- 
               <br />
               dian statesmen, using it as a lever, say you 
               <br />
               shall have no railway unless you unite with 
               <br />
               us. Holding these opinions, I ask why is this 
               <br />
               union pressed? Two years ago our country 
               <br />
               was undisturbed and our people were quiet; 
               <br />
               now this Province is a scene of agitation from 
               <br />
               Cape Sable to Cape North. These diﬂiculties 
               <br />
               did not arise with us, our people were content- 
               <br />
               ed and happy until Canada, embarrassed in her 
               <br />
               own condition pressed the proposals for union 
               <br />
               upon us, and I can pointto speeches of Canadian 
               <br />
               statesmen which show that this was the cause 
               <br />
               of the agitation. There is another branch of 
               <br />
               the subject to which I will now refer,—-—the 
               <br />
               question of defence. It is said that if all the 
               <br />
               questions of trade, of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postage,</span> of the currency, 
               <br />
               and of the railway, could be arranged, the 
               <br />
               great question of defence yet remains. There 
               <br />
               would have been some force in the arguments 
               <br />

               of operations? If these Colonies were to be

               attacked at all,they wereto be simultaneously 
               <br />

               Union as a means of Defence. Does it require
