               Sir, the hostilit I have all along evinced to the 
               <br />
               Quebec scheme o Confederation has frequently been 
               <br />
               attributed to a desire to defeat the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government,</span> and 
               <br />
               thus promote my own political prospects. I trust 
               <br />
               that the course I have this day taken will be a surli- 
               <br />
               cient answer to this charge. If such were my desire 
               <br />
               my end would be most certainly attained, in the pre- 
               <br />
               sent wide-spread <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hostilitg</span> to that scheme, by main- 
               <br />
               taining the position I ave occupied for the last 
               <br />
               eighteen months, without committm myself to any 
               <br />
               proposal for the solution of our diﬂiculties. But as 
               <br />
               an avowed Unionist, such a course would be inde- 
               <br />
               fensible, and I am not willing to pursue any course 
               <br />
               I cannot defend. Nor do I seek any temporary tri- 
               <br />
               umph over my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> opponents at the expense of 
               <br />
               the highest interests of my country. If the govern- 
               <br />
               ment are animated by sentiments of moderation, 
               <br />
               justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">andisonnd</span> policy, they shall have my humble 
               <br />
               aid in the great work in which they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engaged.</span> I 
               <br />
               hope we may ﬁnd a common ground of co—operation 
               <br />
               in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts</span> to improve our present condi ion of iso-

               <br />
               position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> ature intended her to occupy. But, sir, do 
               <br />
               not let me be supposed to under:-ste the present posi- 
               <br />
               tion of this Province. Far from it. Even as she is, 
               <br />
               I am proud of my country, and grateful for the happy 
               <br />
               homes she adords her sons. Yet proud, sir, as I am 
               <br />
               of the little sea—girt province I call my native land: 
               <br />
               proud as I am of her free institutions—her moral 
               <br />
               status—her material wealth; proud as I am of the 
               <br />
               name of Nova Scotian—a name which the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">genius</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               valeur of my countrymen have inscribed high on the

               <br />
               permitted to be of these things, I have never ceased 
               <br />
               to entertain the hope, expressed in this legislature 
               <br />
               in 1864, that the day was not far distant, when you,

               Hon. PROVINCIAL SECRETARY replied :—

               I have listened with much gratiﬁcation to the 
               <br />

               ful as the Quebec scheme of Union has been

               <br />
               opponents of that scheme should be directed to 
               <br />
               the great question of what solution may be 
               <br />
               found for the diﬁiculties of the position in which 
               <br />
               we are placed. Having taken a part in matur—

               ing that great measure—having, on former

               scheme that was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gropounded</span> for the consider-

               ation of British orth America, I cannot be

               supposed to enter into the feelings of the hon.

               member for Richmond in his denunciation of 
               <br />
               that scheme. I believed then, and I believe 
               <br />
               now, that the plan of Intercolonial Union that 
               <br />
               . was propounded by the Conference at Quebec 
               <br />
               and which has obtained so marked a degree of 
               <br />
               favour and approval from Her Majesty’s Go-

               North America the most ample guarantee for 
               <br />
               the rights and rivile es of all sections. But I 
               <br />
               am not insensi le to t e fact that many obJec- 
               <br />
               tions have been raised against that scheme, and 
               <br />
               that many gentlemen who have taken a most

               <br />

               <br />
               of the promoters of the Quebec scheme. The 
               <br />
               House is well aware that this question has ‘ 
               <br />
               from the ﬁrst been submitted to the people as 
               <br />
               one in which the government divided the 
               <br />
               responsibility with gentlemen Who were 
               <br />
               politically opposed to them. Occupying this 
               <br />
               position the government would have been not 
               <br />
               only wantingin courtesy to the gentlemen who 
               <br />
               had supported them, but would have failed in 
               <br />
               their duty in respect-to a great public question, 
               <br />
               if they had ever treated it in a party aspect.— 
               <br />
               In dealing with this question the government 
               <br />
               have always consulted the wishes and inclina- 
               <br />
               tions, and carried with them, the (:o-operation 
               <br />
               of the gentlemen who are politically opposed 
               <br />
               to them. Under these circumstances it would 
               <br />
               be impossible for me to state the views of the 
               <br />
               government, except on consultation with those 
               <br />

               <br />
               scheme of Union. But as far as I may 
               <br />
               state without consultation, I believe that 
               <br />
               all the gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who.</span> have been 
               <br />

               <br />
               have had no other desire than to meet 
               <br />
               the wishes and consult the best interests of 
               <br />
               their eountrymen.- They have always looked 
               <br />
               upon this question as too solemn in its charac-

               openly that the question asked by the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman has taken this side of the House by,sur- 
               <br />
               prise. When he comes to us and propounds <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> 
               <br />
               delegation to the Colonial oﬂice—invites the 
               <br />
               interposition of the Colonial Government to 
               <br />
               settle a question involving the rights and liber— 
               <br />
               ties of this people—asks the Home Government 
               <br />
               to arrange the question without reference to the 
               <br />
               people, I look at this hon. member with sur- 
               <br />
               prise, and recall the sentiments that he uttered 
               <br />
               on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">former</span> occasions. I feel strongly on this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject.</span> It is an attempt to barter away,to 
               <br />
               sell the rights and liberties of the people. I do 
               <br />
               not know the inﬂuences that are at work, but 
               <br />
               I can imagine them. I never expected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> live « 
               <br />
               to see the time when, on the ﬂoors of this Par- 
               <br />
               liament, a gentleman could arise and ask that 
               <br />
               our condition should be decided—where? not 
               <br />
               in your own Parliament, but by gentlemen 
               <br />
               sent across the water with carte blanche to set— 
               <br />
               tle the whole matter. The hon. member says 
               <br />
               he is in favor of the abstract . principle of 
               <br />
               Union. I may or may not be in favor of it, but 
               <br />
