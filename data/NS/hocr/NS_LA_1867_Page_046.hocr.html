               no new nationality. We are well enough as 
               <br />
               we are, and although I think it would have been 
               <br />
               wise to have legislatively united the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces in one Government under the Crown, 
               <br />
               I cannot concur with those who wish to make 
               <br />
               these Provinces independent of the Mother 
               <br />
               Country.

               We all know how the American Colonies were 
               <br />
               lost to England, which probably never would — 
               <br />
               have happened had the sage advice of such 
               <br />
               men as Adam Smith been taken, .and a voice 
               <br />
               given to the old Colonies in the imposition of 
               <br />
               taxes and the making of laws. These States 
               <br />
               would now have been a part of the British Em- 
               <br />
               pire, and that Empire would now be invincible 
               <br />
               against the entire universe. What power would 
               <br />
               dare to assail the Empire if these, the now two 
               <br />
               greatest nations in the world, were one. Our 
               <br />
               true policy I contend, and our duty as British 
               <br />
               subjects are.not to dissever the Empire, but to 
               <br />
               share the fortunes of England, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cling</span> to, and, 
               <br />
               if need be, to defend her. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> entirely from 
               <br />
               those who advocate the dismemberment of the 
               <br />
               Empire, and I believe this Cofederatiou 
               <br />
               scheme to be the beginning of the decline and 
               <br />
               fall of that great country of which we are all so 
               <br />
               fond. How long will the West Indies be re- 
               <br />
               tained when we are gone? And will not the cry 
               <br />
               then come up for new nationalities and indepen- 
               <br />
               dence from the Australian Colonies and the 
               <br />
               Cape. New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Zealand</span> and the smaller Colonies 
               <br />
               will catch the infection, snd- when all is gone 
               <br />
               this new powerful and noble Empire will be re-

               duced to two small islands. Against this fatal 
               <br />
               policy, the inevitable result as I believe of this 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme, I sincerely and solemnly
