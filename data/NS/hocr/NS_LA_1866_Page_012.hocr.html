               <br />
               in three consecutive speeches from the Throne. 
               <br />

               Sir, do I require to point to the evidences of

               Imperial solicitude for our safety and welfare

               imperfect estimate of the immense treasure

               Great Britain has spent for the protection of 
               <br />

               have only a very faint idea of the amount of 
               <br />
               treasure Great Britain has lavished upon us. 
               <br />
               How much does the army, supported here for 
               <br />

               <br />
               and leave their last dollar with our people. 
               <br />
               Should these things be forgotten or winked

               <br />
               the question I intend to ask. A few days ago 
               <br />
               this House went through all the solemn forms 
               <br />

               <br />
               the protection of our Fisheries. What was the

               result of the deliberations of the joint com— 
               <br />
               mittee of both Houses on that occasion ?— 
               <br />
               What means did they suggest for that great 
               <br />
               service? Their report has been placedon our 
               <br />
               table, and what does it advise? An humble 
               <br />
               petition to the Queen’s Government, praying 
               <br />
               for assistance. In our necessities we rush to 
               <br />
               the Colonial Oﬁîce for aid and protection, and 
               <br />
               yet there are those among us who deny any 
               <br />
               reciprocal duty on our part—any obligation 
               <br />
               even to listen respectfully to the wishes of Bri-

               can have no adequate protection if England 
               <br />

               Mr. Speaker, there is another subject to

               which I must refer, because its bearing on the 
               <br />

               mensions—I mean the Fenian Brotherhood. 
               <br />
               A part of the avowed policy of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organiza—</span>

               tion is the severance of the connection

               between these Colonies and Great Britain. 
               <br />
               The termination of the civil war in the Uni-

               rations against the British Empire, which it

               the vulnerable paint through which this object

               perhaps this House will be astonished to learn 
               <br />
               that in the published platform of the Fenian 
               <br />

               <br />

               on this continent by the proposed union of these

               Provmces under one government. This. fact has 
               <br />
               only some to my knowledge within a few weeks. 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repeat,</span> sir, it is laid dowu in the platform of the 
               <br />
               Fenian body as the aramount duty of every Fenian 
               <br />
               either in the Unite States or the British Provinces, 
               <br />
