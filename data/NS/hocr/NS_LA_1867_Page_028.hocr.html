               I may be here pardoned for referring to the 
               <br />
               fact that the history of Canada has shown that 
               <br />
               her people have not always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paid</span> due respect 
               <br />
               to the British ﬂag. No such charge, however, 
               <br />
               could be made against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span> peonle,and it would 
               <br />
               seem, from the despatches which have been 
               <br />
               made public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> the discussion of this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, that the statesmen of England <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">felt</span> a secu-

               not tampered with by the Canadians. It 
               <br />
               seems that on the. 27th of January, 1860, 
               <br />
               the Duke of Newcastle sent a. despatch 
               <br />
