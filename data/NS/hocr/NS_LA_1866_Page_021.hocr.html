               Dr. TUPPER—I shall turn to them for the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfaction</span> as he seems to

               have a very short memory, and show him the 
               <br />
               resolution, and the action of the government in 
               <br />
               relation to it. He, as a member of the Cabinet, 
               <br />
               actually initiated the policy of a. Union of 
               <br />
               British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America.—he</span> called not only the 
               <br />
               attention of the House to the subject, but 
               <br />
               asked the several governments of British 
               <br />
               North America to hold such 3 Convention as 
               <br />
               would ascertain the best mode of dealing with 
               <br />
               the question. What are we to think of a gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who, havinnr comeforward as a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> and aﬁirmed such a. 
               <br />
               principle as that, and obtained the support of 
               <br />
               the House to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principle,</span> now attempts to 
               <br />
               insult the intelligence 0 the people of this 
               <br />
               country by telling them, years afterwards, 
               <br />
               “ that he has yet to hear the ﬁrst argument in 
               <br />
               favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span> Union of British North America.”— 
               <br />
               He has professed respect for the British Go- 
               <br />
               vernment—but he has trampled down the 
               <br />
               authority of the government under his feet. I 
               <br />
               ask him to read the despatches which have 
               <br />
               emanated from the Imperial Government, and, 
               <br />
               if they are entitled to such respect, do they 
               <br />
               not contain arguments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> in favour of a 
               <br />
               Union of British North America?

               I have shown you in the outset thatthe hon. 
               <br />
               member has treated the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> as devoid 
               <br />
               of ordinary intelligence when he has under—

               the attention of this House on a former occasion 
               <br />
               was invited dishonestly by him. Are we or are 
               <br />
               we not to suppose that the views and sentiments 
               <br />
               which ne placed before the Legislature then 
               <br />
               were entirely at variance with those he 
               <br />
               actually held? If the hon. member had told us

               that like a weather-cock be shifted with every

               changing breeze—that he changed his views 
               <br />
               from hour to hour, then I could feel that
