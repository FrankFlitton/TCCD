               to one View of the question which is perhaps of 
               <br />
               some importance, in the opinion of some, and 
               <br />

               this question by its present opponents in former

               times. It is quite true men may legitimately 
               <br />
               change their opinion on public questions, but in 
               <br />
               doing so they invite inquiry as to the motives 
               <br />
               by which they are actuated and the reasons for 
               <br />
               the change—and although I do not think it of

               very much consequence, nor Will the peOple of

               <br />
               it perhaps worth our while to inquire whether it 
               <br />
               be true as the hon. member tor Halifax has
