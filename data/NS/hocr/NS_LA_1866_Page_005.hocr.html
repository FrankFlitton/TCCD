               Mr. S. CAMPBELL went on to say that the

               <br />
               of the Government, had republished the state- 
               <br />

               man in question make the speech, but there 
               <br />
               was a number of other prominent public men 
               <br />
               of Canada present who apparently endorsed 
               <br />
               the statement. The old adage said, In vino

               <br />

               ﬂuences spoke the truth. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               it might be considered a legitimate argument 
               <br />
               against union with Canada if we were told that 
               <br />
               its public men were persons of such a charac-

               ter that no reliance could be placed on their

               gument of the Provincial Secretary in res ect 
               <br />

               that they were unanimous. He would now

               question to the people of that Province, and 
               <br />

               He (Mr. H.) could certainly say that he was
