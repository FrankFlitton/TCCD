               to the doctrine of representation by population, 
               <br />
               and therefore should not complain on that point, 
               <br />
               but he had always considered population as an

               important element ; the agriculture, the ﬁsheries,

               was previously objected, would, he said, destroy

               <br />
               were distinct and separate, having manufacturing 
               <br />

               <br />
               be swamped by the votes ﬂowing in on them from

               <br />
               their representatives and the citizens theirs. Mr 
               <br />
               Annaud concluded by moving in amendment to 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst clause of the bill that the representation 
               <br />
               for Halifax county be four, two for the city and 
               <br />

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Team</span> considered the bill so fair in all its

               ly made to it, and Said that this was the opinion 
               <br />
               ot some gentlemen in opposition whom he had 
               <br />
               consulted. As to the amendment just moved. 
               <br />
               if the principle of representation by population 
               <br />
               was to be recognised, the representation of the 
               <br />
               entire Province should be remodelled. Supposing 
               <br />
               such a rule to prevail in England, how many 
               <br />
               members would London send with a population 
               <br />
               of nearly three millions. The bill, be said, pro— 
               <br />
               posed that every county should have two mem- 
               <br />
               bers in the local Parliament in addition to the one 
               <br />
               in the House of Commons : Pictou was excepted 
               <br />
               on account of its size and population ; and Hali- 
               <br />
               fax was to have three local and twu general re- 
               <br />
               presentatives. However much he might desire an 
               <br />
               additional member for Halifax. he did not thlnk 
               <br />
               it would be fair to ask an alteration of the entire 
               <br />
               principle of the bill. The opposition on the pre- 
               <br />
               vious day had been so feeble that he had been led 
               <br />
               to expect that in committee the bill would pass 
               <br />
               without a division. He believed that the govern—

               mental and legislative expenses oi the Province 
               <br />
