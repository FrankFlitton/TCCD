               I am told that I tried to destroy the public 
               <br />
               credit. That is not true; but in speaking of 
               <br />
               British America under Canadian rule, I had a 
               <br />
               right to draw the inference that these “ corrup- 
               <br />

               <br />
               with the mother country. If the credit of Cana- 
               <br />
               da has risen lately, as was hosted so loudly, it 
               <br />
               was by means of manipulations which we fully 
               <br />
               understand; but I hold in my hand a copy of the 
               <br />
               Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’News,</span> the organ of the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               Railway Company, and l ﬁnd it states that the 
               <br />
               debentures of Nova Scotia are at present from 97 
               <br />
               to 99 while those of Canada are from 95 to 97. 
               <br />
               With that damming fact stated by their own nu- 
               <br />
               thorities, how dare any one make the assertion 
               <br />
               that the credit of Canada is superior to' that of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia? If the Intercoloulal Railway had 
               <br />
               been ﬁfty times as'valuable as it is, my action 
               <br />
               would have been the same, and I would not even 
               <br />
               for that consideratrcn have given up the liberties 
               <br />
               of my country. We knew that the railway scheme 
               <br />
               was an essential part of the union arrangement, 
               <br />
               and we hoped, by combining the opposition on 
               <br />
               these two measures, to defeat the bill. We are 
               <br />
               told that we may not have the terminus of the 
               <br />
               railway if we send nineteen members of the Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia party to Ottawa. If Halifax be the natural 
               <br />
               terminus, and the interests of trade require that 
               <br />
               the road should extend here, it would be imma- 
               <br />
               terial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> Nova Scotia formed part of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> or not. But we ﬁnd Mr. Adderly, 
               <br />
               the Assistant Secretary for the Colonies, stating 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cost,</span> of the road would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">four</span> millions 
               <br />
               sterling, and we find that only three millions have 
               <br />
               been provided. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> see also that this three mil-

               <br />
               were recreant to theirduty‘in not making it a part 
               <br />
               of the agreement that the construction of the rail. 
               <br />
               way should commence simultaneously at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Riviere</span> 
               <br />
               du Lou and Truro. In that case the interests 
               <br />
               of Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gcotia</span> would have been safe, which the 
               <br />
               are not now. It is true the Union Act declares 
               <br />
               it to be the duty of Canada to carry the road to 
               <br />
               completion; but we see the Canadians were not 
               <br />
               bound by their minute of council in 1862, and if 
               <br />

               <br />

               that that gentleman would oppose the guarantee

               the last man to rise here and make a. passionate

               the electors had given their solemn assent to the
