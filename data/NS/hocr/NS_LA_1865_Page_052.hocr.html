               The hon. member for Halifax(Mr. Shannon)

               had attempted to justify this demonstration

               the two demonstrations. That of last year 
               <br />
               was a national demonstration; not merely in 
               <br />
               Halifax and Nova Scotia, but in all portions of 
               <br />
               the British empire—wherever literature and 
               <br />
               civilization are prized. It was an honour to 
               <br />
               our common <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">humanity-mot</span> an honour to any

               particular nationality, but one to the name of

               mate and every nation vied with each other in 
               <br />

               as this world will last. Another individua

               The hon. Provincial Secretary defended the

               Opinion against Confederation, but at the same 
               <br />
               time he could not help seeing that the public

               sentiment of the county was opposed to the 
               <br />
               scheme. As respects the resolution before the

               the volunteers would form part of the con- 
               <br />
               templated procession. The Provincial Secre-

               <br />
               were not to be present, and therefore the whole

               thing was at an end. He looked upon this de-

               place during the summer months. He was 
               <br />
               glad that our people had given the Canadian 
               <br />

               but that feeling was not responded to by the 
               <br />

               Scotia, thinking they were representing public 
               <br />
               opinion in this province, went to Canada and 
               <br />
               agreed to the scheme which was now before
