               the delegates were clothed with power to pre-

               tlemen who crossed the sea as delegates knew 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> The Prov. Secretary calls upon us to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show</span> him an example in the history of the 
               <br />
               world where a statesman was idiotic enough ' to 
               <br />
               dissolve the house when he had a majority at 
               <br />
               his back. We do not ask a dissolution. Let 
               <br />
               the duration of the house run down, and the 
               <br />
               question come before the people in its natural 
               <br />
               course. But was not Mr. Tilley, who had 
               <br />
               such amajority, “idiotic” enough to dissolve 
               <br />
               the house in New Brunswick? We all know that 
               <br />
               he did, and the consequence was that he and 
               <br />
               his Government were defeated at the polls. His 
               <br />
               was the manly course, for which he fairly earn- 
               <br />
               ed the respect of the people of that Province. 
               <br />
               This may not be a very inviting precedent, but 
               <br />
               that is the answer I give to the honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tleman. If there can be any doubt about the 
               <br />
               force of this precedent, I will give another: It 
               <br />
               was asked in the Canadian Parliament whether 
               <br />
               Confederation should not be placed before the 
               <br />

               <br />

               about the feelings of the people, then, decidedly, 
               <br />
               the question should be referred to them.
