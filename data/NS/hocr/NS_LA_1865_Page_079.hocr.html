               It will be in the recollection of the House, that 
               <br />
               at the last session, a resolution was passed, au- 
               <br />
               thorizing a conference to be held between Dele- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gates</span> from this Province, and New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               and Prince Edward Island, on the subject of a 
               <br />
               Union of the Maritime Provinces. In accordance 
               <br />
               with that resolution, the Delegates proceeded to 
               <br />
               Charlottetown, and after deliberating for a day—— 
               <br />
               in an incredibly short space of time, they came to 
               <br />
               the conclusion, that a Union of the Lower Pre- 
               <br />
               vinces was impracticable, and they admitted into 
               <br />
               the conference a number of gentlemen from Cana- 
               <br />

               <br />
               views upon the question of the larger Union of all 
               <br />
               the Provinces. The result was that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates</span> 
               <br />
               returned to Halifax, and immediately proceeded to

               should like to ask these gentlemen upon what

               principle they received these Canadian Delegates

               and yet by some means or other, they appear to

               have lost sight of that altogether, and to have

               more especially as regards Nova Scotia. I hold

               that in adopting the principle of representation 
               <br />
               by population, they have ignored other important 
               <br />
               interests of this Province, which are entitled to 
               <br />
               consideration. There are other matters to be 
               <br />
               considered besides mere blood and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bones.»</span> There 
               <br />
               is the mining interest which contributes solar gely 
               <br />
               to our provincial prosperity, thereis the shipping 
               <br />
               interest, which as has been stated in this debate, 
               <br />
               is equal’to one eighteenth of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> that possessed by 
               <br />
               the British Empire, and represents a capital of 
               <br />
               eight millions of dollars. Is that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notan'</span> interest 
               <br />
               worth protecting and worthy of representation ? 
               <br />
               Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has‘nothing</span> to compare with that. It is 
               <br />
               true that she has "a large inland trade by means 
               <br />
               of her canals, but we cannot participate in the 
               <br />
               advantages to be derived from them. Then again 
               <br />
               there is a most important branch of industry, the

               ﬁsheries, and in connection with that thereis one
