               here must, as in all countries under It's on-

               There is no party, however strong. that can af-

               <br />
               terests of any section were neglected. It is 
               <br />
               true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> no government can sa'isfy the

               their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friends;</span> but I am now referring to the 
               <br />
               local interests that are to be represented. If

               no one can say that local interests are lare-

               tion as its importance demands, but although 
               <br />
               unprepared and not expec ing to speak to day 
               <br />
               I could not allow the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution</span> to pass with a 
               <br />
               silent vote. Present and aiding in the Char- 
               <br />
               lottetown and Quebec Conventions, I came to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that it was for the interest of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia as well as her duty to the great 
               <br />
               Empire to w ich she belongs, that she should 
               <br />
               adopt this Union. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> endeavoured to 
               <br />
               give these crude observations in a dis- 
               <br />
               passionate and calm manner. I have gi- 
               <br />
               ven some of the reasons that inﬂuence my 
               <br />
               judgment in favour of the resolution before 
               <br />
               the house and now say most emphatically that 
               <br />
               if there are any rsons who prefer annexation 
               <br />
               to the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tetes,</span> let them, in Heaven’s 
               <br />
               name, follow the example of the hon. member 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Yer-mouth, but do not let them at pt 
               <br />
               b false representations to thwart the e orts 
               <br />
               0 those who would bring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about</span> a Union of the
