               two important questions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> have proved 
               <br />
               most advantageous to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people, and yet Mr. 
               <br />
               Howe, the patriot, was found throwing obsta- 
               <br />
               cles in their way. Again, the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               became a railway commissioner, and I need 
               <br />
               not remind the House that.,in 1856. he was con-

               party, who-re subordinate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂicvr</span> he was. If 
               <br />
               that Government, which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represented</span> as rest-

               <br />
               broken up, it was not his fault. Things went 
               <br />
               on this way until 1857, when the Con lay shanty 
               <br />
               riots occurred. We all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remember</span> the religious 
               <br />
               animoslties that were excited. Who was the

               origin? This same gentleman. He destroyed 
               <br />
               his own political friends by forcing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures</span> 
               <br />
