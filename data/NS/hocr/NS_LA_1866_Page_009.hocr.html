               For the past two years, Mr. Speaker, the 
               <br />

               <br />

               records of this House. I can go even further 
               <br />
               and appeal to the gentlemen with whom I 
               <br />
               have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperated</span> for the last eighteen months

               in opposition to the scheme of the Quebec

               Conference, many of whom are opposed to all 
               <br />
               union, and who will hear me ready witness 
               <br />
               that my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(to-operation</span> in the anti-union move- 
               <br />
               ment in this Provmce, has only extended to 
               <br />
               the details of that scheme. The subject of an 
               <br />
               union of British America, since I have been 
               <br />
               capable of forming a judgment on the question, 
               <br />
               has found favor with me. Apart from the 
               <br />
               material advantages of such an union, there is 
               <br />
               something in the assurance of national 
               <br />
               strength and greatness to be derived from it, 
               <br />
               which is in sympathy with the best feelings and 
               <br />
               aspirations of every British American whose 
               <br />
               future is wrapped up with the future of this 
               <br />
               country. For years past I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entertained</span> a 
               <br />
               strong opinion on the subject,—an opinion that 
               <br />
               the period was fast approaching when these 
               <br />
               North American colonies must cast off their 
               <br />
               present political habiliments, and assume 
               <br />
               others more consistent with their advanced 
               <br />
               position, their surroundings, and their altered 
               <br />
               relations to the Empire. I was in favor of their
