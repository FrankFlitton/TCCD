               <br />
               the end I profess to have in view. Well, sir. I am

               here to-day to deﬁne my position, and to answer the 
               <br />
               other objections urged against me. I am also here to 
               <br />
               make an important enquiry of the Government. As 
               <br />
               tc my position, I am in favor of an Union—a Federal 
               <br />
               Union of these Provinces. I b alieve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span> a Union 
               <br />
               best suited to the exigencies of our situation. It a

               <br />
               ado ting the Federal principle in forming an union 
               <br />
               of ritish America. among the admirable speeches 
               <br />

               ject, that of the present Chief Justice, in which that 
               <br />
               able lawyer and shrewd politician contended that a 
               <br />
               Federal Union was best suited to our circumstances, 
               <br />
               appeared to me the most statesmanlikc and sound. 
               <br />
               Accepting, then, as I do, the principle of a Federal 
               <br />
               Union, 1 desire to ask the Government if there is no 
               <br />
               common round on which the supporters of the 
               <br />
               Quebec sc ems—abandoning that scheme—can meet 
               <br />
               the friends of an Union on more advantageous terms, 
               <br />
               and arrange the details of a measure that will be just 
               <br />
               and satisfactory to the people? I think there is a 
               <br />
               common ground,—a ground on which I am willing 
               <br />

               If the Government will publicly abandon the 
               <br />
               Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme,</span> and introduce a resolution in favor 
               <br />
               of a Federal Union of British America—leaving the de 
               <br />
               tails of the measure to the arbitrament of the Imperial 
               <br />

               <br />
               This would be comm ncing rightly. By getting the 
               <br />
               endorsement of the Le islature, in the outset, of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               settlement of the details of a scheme, the friends of 
               <br />
               the measure would occupy a very diﬂ‘erent position 
               <br />
               from that occupied by the delegates to the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference, who went to Canada, in 1864:, without any 
               <br />
               authority from Parliament. No small amount of op- 
               <br />
               position was at that time excited against confedera-

               and many others, who looked upon the action of the

               <br />

               <br />
               I ask is there a tribunal in the world to which Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia might more confidently appeal for justice than 
               <br />
               to that august and impartial body? Its integrity—- 
               <br />
               its wisdom—its intelligence are beyond dispute. I 
               <br />
               say that if there be a tribunal, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where</span> might will not 
               <br />
               prevail <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> right, it is the one I indicate. If we 
               <br />
               can get justice any where we will get it from that 
               <br />
               tribunal, and I ask does any Nova Scotian desire 
               <br />
               more than justice? This subject has en aged the at- 
               <br />
               tention of the public men of Great Brita n. It is well 
               <br />
               known in that country that the difﬁculties in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> of union are principally with the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces, and if we throw ourselves ccnﬂdingly on 
               <br />
               the justice of the British Government, I believe we 
               <br />
               will receive even a artiai arbitration of our rights. I 
               <br />
               know of no means y which we can more effectually 
               <br />

               <br />

               w ile I have been in this Assembl . it has been for 
               <br />
               independence of action, and fear essness in the ex- 
               <br />
               pression of my thoughts. I have never acknowledged 
               <br />
               allegiance to any leader or party in this House. I 
               <br />
               have never attended a party caucus in my life. 
               <br />
               Among the gentlemen I address, no one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within</span> the 
               <br />
               past two ears has come more f uently into keen 
               <br />
               collision ere and elsewhere with the occupants of 
               <br />
               the Treasury Benches than myself. I am certainly 
               <br />
               indebted to these gentlemen for no favours, and 1 can 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point</span> to more than one act of personal and oliticai 
               <br />
               njustice received at their hands. _But._s1r, would 
               <br />
               be unworthy of my position in this Legislature, if I 
               <br />
               could allow considerations of this nature on one side 
               <br />
               or the other to controul my action in the resence of 
               <br />
               a question of the highest magnitude. I wi lnot deny 
               <br />
               that I have some ambition as a public man, but my 
               <br />
               highest ambition will be gratiﬁed, if I can contribute 
               <br />
