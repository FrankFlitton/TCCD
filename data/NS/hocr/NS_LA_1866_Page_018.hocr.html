               all the capital that was available, and citizens 
               <br />
               could now scarcely obtain the money they re- 
               <br />
               quired on mortgages at 6 per cent., which are 
               <br />
               liable to taxation. Lenders of money of course

               <br />
               result was, that persons engaged in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span>

               actually brought to a stand still in conse-

               quence of the want of money. Parties who 
               <br />
               had money out in mortgages were calling it in

               circumstances, to supply them with the money 
               <br />
               they required. He therefore felt that it was 
               <br />
               necessary that the question should be dealt 
               <br />
               with immediately by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house.</span> He was not 
               <br />
               prepared to say that the time had come when 
               <br />
               the people of this country would be willing to 
               <br />
               see the Usury Laws repealed. Some persons, 
               <br />
               however, contended that the legal rate of into- 
               <br />
               rest might be properly ﬁxed at 7 per cent.— 
               <br />
               Certainly it was not right that the industrious 
               <br />
               men of this country should be exposed to the 
               <br />
               great inconveniences they were now subject 
               <br />
               to from the causes to which he had made refe- 
               <br />
               rence. It was therefore necessary for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> house to consider whether it would be wise to 
               <br />
               raise the legal rate of interest, or subject the 
               <br />
               securities in question to taxation, so as to place 
               <br />
               every one in the same position. He would,

               however. take another opportunity of bringing 
               <br />

               Donnell, addressed the House, that the time 
               <br />
               had come when I shoulddeﬁne my position on 
               <br />
               the question of a Union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Colonies, and I 
               <br />
               shall now invite the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> of the House to 
               <br />
               that position. I have alwavs been in favor of 
               <br />
               a union of the Maritime Provinces, and my 
               <br />
               views upon that subject entirely accord with 
               <br />
               Views expressed by members on both'sldes. I 
               <br />
               need not now recur to the Convention held at 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, or to what took place 
               <br />
               elsewhere when the Convention was dissolved. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">These</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> matters of history, and I will mere- 
               <br />
               ly allude to the objections which I entertain to 
               <br />
               any union of the Colonies. I have always 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought</span> that the people of Canada were dis— 
               <br />
               similar to us in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">origin</span> and pursuits, and that 
               <br />
               the fact of this Province being separated ﬁ'om 
               <br />
               communication with the world, excepting 
               <br />
               through hostile territory, rendered it politically 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lm_p988lbie</span> that a union in the present state of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> could take place. I have also enter— 
               <br />
               tamed, and have here expressed the opinion. 
               <br />
               that all the beneﬁts of which we have board 
               <br />
               can be obtained without union. Let me brieﬂ 
               <br />
               refer to three of these,-in the ﬁrst place, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{</span> 
               <br />
               maintain that all matters of material advan- 
               <br />
               tage relating to trade can be obtained without 
               <br />
               a. political union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> is there to hinder us 
               <br />
               to-day from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arranging</span> a treaty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of’</span> free trade 
               <br />
               in the manufactures of the diﬁ‘erent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pro.</span> 
               <br />
               vinces? I may be told that Canada will not 
               <br />
               entertain the proposition now; _— <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perhaps</span>
