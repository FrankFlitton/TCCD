               ~-—-I would ﬁrst refer to the taunt made by the 
               <br />
               Financial Secretary. He said we had brought 
               <br />
               a case here without a precedent to support us, 
               <br />
               although we had a whole year to obtain such 
               <br />
               precedents if they existed. I tell him that I 
               <br />
               have had an abundance of authorities for the 
               <br />
               position I have taken—authority which I have 
               <br />
               not sought in the musty pages of Blackstone, 
               <br />
               to which the hon gentleman last year referred 
               <br />
               to sustain his position. I have been reading a 
               <br />
               nobler page than Blackstone ever wrote—a 
               <br />
               page which bears the impress and imprint of 
               <br />
               God himself: I mean “ the human face divine.” 
               <br />
               I have read the authority which sustains us

               <br />

               <br />
               my authority. Fifty thousand of these men 
               <br />
               are devoting their time and means to learn de-

               <br />
               their country, their homes and their altars. 
               <br />
               They have during the year paid into the Trea-

               sury through the customs, excise and other de-

               <br />

               saying that they should be allowed to decide 
               <br />
               the question. It is not only to the copies of

               <br />

               <br />
               are training children; they have sons who will

               that my authority for maintaining the rights

               us. Why, then, this being the case, was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> 
               <br />
               the Union accomplished? The language of 
               <br />
               the resolution is, “ by mutual consultation," 
               <br />
               implying that there should be mutual conces- 
               <br />
               sion: and perhaps the main reason whya ba- 
               <br />
               sis of union was not then arranged was that 
               <br />
               the Canadians were unwilling to make such 
               <br />
               concessions as Mr. Howe, in a due regard for 
               <br />
               the interests of Nova Scotia, believed should 
               <br />
               be made before we went into any Union—— 
               <br />
               And let me ask here what concessions 
               <br />
               they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made.</span> in the scheme .under 
               <br />
               60nsideration? It_is impossible for the de- 
               <br />
               legates to lay their ﬁnger on a single fea- 
               <br />
               ture in this'scheme and say, there is some- 
               <br />
               thing that has been conceded to us by Canada 
               <br />
