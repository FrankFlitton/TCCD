               I come now to the ﬁnancial terms of this scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span> 
               <br />
               of Union. The delegates have adapted at Quebec 
               <br />
               a scale, and arranged the debt oi‘ the Provinces 
               <br />
               pretty much as they did representation,upcn a 
               <br />
               plan of population irrespective of the income: 
               <br />
               which the Provinces pcssessed. It seems to me 
               <br />
               at the very outset. the hon. delegates laid down 
               <br />
               the wrong principle, instead of arranging the 
               <br />
               debt according to population; they should have 
               <br />
               looked at the incomes—at the revenues, and 
               <br />
               funds, what each had in the treasury. ' If any

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">partnership.</span> Taking it upon this ground, little

               Now, in the year in which this arrangement was
