               had been publicly branded as villianous 
               <br />
               falsehoods. The discrepancy was of little 
               <br />
               consequence, whatever it was. Mr. An-

               <br />
               if it were not that he, Mr. M., had been so 
               <br />
               careful of the expenditure of a few shillings, 
               <br />
               the petition for Invemess would have been 
               <br />
               sent by him. Did not this shew that the 
               <br />
               subject was talked over before the franking 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grivilege</span> was possessed by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members?</span> But 
               <br />
               LIT. Armand knowing what he did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> 
               <br />
               be the last to charge penuriousness on him. 
               <br />
               No member was less open to such a charge. 
               <br />
               In reference to it, he, Mr. M., would state a 
               <br />
               few undeniable facts ; three years ago when 
               <br />
               he had gone to run his election, it had been 
               <br />
               stated that he had received a large sum of 
               <br />
               money from the Liberal party to secure the 
               <br />
               County of Richmond. He had to meet this 
               <br />
               slander everywhere during his-canvass, but 
               <br />
               the truth was that every sixpence of his ex— 
               <br />
               penditure on that occasion had been borne 
               <br />
               by himself, and that contest was fairly 
               <br />
               gained without the slightest understanding 
               <br />

               <br />
               say that his opposition to the Quebec scheme 
               <br />
               had cost more than any ﬁve of the richest 
               <br />
               merchants of Halifax who had the credit of 
               <br />
               contributing so largely in support of the 
               <br />
               anti-union cause. He, Mr. M., had gone 
               <br />
               into the country during the busy seasons 
               <br />
               for weeks to canvass and hold public meet-

               although there was a fund from which his 
               <br />
               expenses might be paid but which he al- 
               <br />
               waysdeclined to touch. This contrasted 
               <br />
               strongly with the conduct of a member who 
               <br />
               would not go on a ti ing visit to one of the
