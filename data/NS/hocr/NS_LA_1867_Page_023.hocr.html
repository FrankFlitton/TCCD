               the neighbourin Republic. That is not the ﬁrst

               has been nothing more than annexation to the

               <br />
               I would ask the people of this country, all who 
               <br />
               have seen that document, whether it does not 
               <br />
               contain sentiments most obnoxious to those 
               <br />
               who desire to live under British laws and in- 
               <br />
               stitutions, and direct encouragement to those in 
               <br />

               ing the annexation of these colonies. I have 
               <br />
               said that this hon. member is desirous of an- 
               <br />
               nexing this country to the United States, and 
               <br />
               this is an assertion which nothing but the 
               <br />
               strongest proof 'could justify. Let me then re- 
               <br />
               call to the recollection of the House some of 
               <br />
               the productions of that hon. member’s pen—the 
               <br />
               position which he has assumed from the very 
               <br />
               cominen‘eement of the discussion on this ques- 
               <br />

               <br />
               by that hon. member? From t e beginning of 
               <br />
               this discussion—from the “Botheration” arti- 
               <br />
               cles down to the‘ present hour—the strongest 
               <br />
               declarations of the un-British and disloyalsen- 
               <br />
               timents of the hon. member are to be found. In 
               <br />
               the paper which the hon. member claims as pre-

               <br />
               a Britis colony, the lion. member undertakes 
               <br />
               to compare the scheme of Union with the sis- 
               <br />
               ter colonies, and the scheme of annexation to 
               <br />
               the United States devised by Mr. Banks. Take 
               <br />
               that document and compare the description of 
               <br />
               the Confederation scheme—a description which 
               <br />
               could only emanate from a man imbued with 
               <br />
               hostility to the country which he pretends to 
               <br />
               love—with the description of a plan of Union 
               <br />
               which he proposes with the United States. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hr.</span>

               Banks’ scheme is portrayed in the most ﬂatter-
