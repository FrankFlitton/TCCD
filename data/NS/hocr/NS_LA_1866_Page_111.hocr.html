               <br />
               that should be answered by the promoters of 
               <br />
               this scheme are these: Did not the delegation 
               <br />
               at Quebec sit in secret? Did they not con- 
               <br />
               clude that Quebec scheme with closed doors? 
               <br />
               Was it not understood by all the parties then 
               <br />
               that the terms of the scheme were not to be 
               <br />
               disclosed until all the delegates should return? 
               <br />
               Did not the Canadian delegates proceed post 
               <br />
               hasteto England,_there to implore the Secre- 
               <br />
               tary for the Colonies to aid their propositions? 
               <br />
               And was it not urged at the Colonial Secre- 
               <br />
               tary’s oﬂîce nearly as soon as in Temperance 
               <br />
               Hall? Sir, I do not wonder that the Cana- 
               <br />
               dians should with such haste endeavour to 
               <br />
               excite the sympathies of the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment in favour of this scheme when they had 
               <br />
               made a bargain so much to their own advan- 
               <br />
               tage. I believe that could the disadvantages 
               <br />
               that this involves to Nova Scotia have been 
               <br />
               shewn to the British government they could 
               <br />
               not have been so blind to our interests as to 
               <br />
               favour such a scheme; but all this will be re- 
               <br />
               presented to the British government. It is 
               <br />
               not impossible nor unlikely that this may yet 
               <br />
               be a quesnon of greater moment in the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of England than may now be imagined, 
               <br />
               and when it is known that this Quebec scheme 
               <br />
               is so distasteful to the people of this province; 
               <br />
               when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">injustice</span> of the case comes to be 
               <br />
               known, and the discontent and strife that will 
               <br />
               be engendered thereby, I feel some hope that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> government will pause before they 
               <br />
               pass an act to make this resolution become the 
               <br />
               law of the land. I presume that the British 
               <br />
               government will have a detailed account of 
               <br />
               the whole scheme; a pounds shillings and 
               <br />
               pence version of the whole affair; a matter of 
               <br />
               fact proposition for them to solve; and when 
               <br />
               they do know, as I believe they do not know, 
               <br />
               that N ova Scotia must lose at least <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000</span> a 
               <br />
               year by the arrangement, which they will 
               <br />
               have to make up by direct taxation—and that 
               <br />
               that will be a mode of raising money—that 
               <br />
               will be likely to create a very bad feeling and 
               <br />
               perhaps almost a revolution in the country, 
               <br />
               they will pause before they pass the act. But, 
               <br />
               sir, in making use of this language, I am quite 
               <br />
               aware that I shall be styled by the promoters 
               <br />
               of this infamous scheme an annexationist; but 
               <br />
               this ] deny, and I claim to possess as loyal 
               <br />
               feelings to my beloved Queen as any man in 
               <br />
               this assembly. and it is with feelings loyal to 
               <br />
               the crown of Great Britain that I warn you 
               <br />
               new of the dan or there is of creating afeeling 
               <br />
               of hostili'y to t e Government of Britain by 
               <br />
               the passage of this act. The feelings of the 
               <br />
               peo le of England have been quoted here by 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Boo.</span> Attorney General, and the applause he 
               <br />
               received at the Manchester dinner when intro- 
               <br />
               duced as one of the union delegates. But, sir, 
               <br />
               did the honorable Attorney General ask 
               <br />
               them their views of our relation to Eng- 
               <br />
               land under the union? If he had they i'would 
               <br />
               have told him that united we would no 
               <br />
               longer be an expense to England for protec- 
               <br />
               tion. And this is the general impression of 
               <br />
               the people of England. I was in England last 
               <br />
               winter, and in Manchester, and was in conver- 
               <br />
               sation with entlemen there of high standing, 
               <br />
               some of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%!anchester</span> school, and found that 
               <br />

               this was the general idea that these Provinces 
               <br />
               uni'ed would no longer be a hui-then to the 
               <br />
               people of England for protection, and I found 
               <br />
               this to be the idea of a very large proportion 
               <br />
               of the peOple there with whom I came in con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               government enter‘ain that idea. Now, sir,

               Mr. HATFIELD said:-—I feel that the duty 
               <br />
               devolves upon me of expressing my views on 
               <br />
               this resolution. I may state that until this 
               <br />
               evening no one has been informed of the way 
               <br />
               in which I intend to vote; when meetings 
               <br />
               were held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> Yarmouth and Argyle I said I 
               <br />
               would not give a decided opinion un il the le— 
               <br />
               gislature met, and the pros and onus of the 
               <br />
               question laid before us. I have come here, I 
               <br />
               have heard speeches upon both sides, and have 
               <br />
               made up my mind to vote against the resolu- 
               <br />
               tion which the government have introduced. I 
               <br />
               feel that the duty which I owe to my constitu- 
               <br />
               ency, and that duty is not-a small one, requires 
               <br />
               that I should take this action. Since coming 
               <br />
               to this house I have supported the government 
               <br />
               almost to a vote, sometimes with a disregard 
               <br />
               of my personal position, but on this measure I 
               <br />
               will do what is right irrespctive of political 
               <br />
               feelings and with a determination to stand or 
               <br />
               fall by the course which I pursue. I have fre- 
               <br />
               quently felt diﬁident in addressing the house, 
               <br />
               ieeling that I was a young member and unac- 
               <br />
               customed to public speaking, in comparrison 
               <br />
               with some gentlemen who frequently address 
               <br />
               us, but to-night I stand ﬁrm in_the conviction 
               <br />
               that the course I am taking is one that be- 
               <br />
               comes my position. We ﬁnd that out of the 
               <br />
               ten or eleven lawyers who have seats in this 
               <br />
               house, nine are in favor of the scheme, and 
               <br />
               what is their object unless it be personal ag- 
               <br />
               grandisement? To-night we have seen a gen- 
               <br />
               tleman sitting here, and not revealing even to 
               <br />
               his own colleagues that he had “ paired oﬁ'” 
               <br />
               with another member and did not intend to 
               <br />
               vote on the division. That certainlylooks sus- 
               <br />
               picious, and has convinced me that all the cir-

               cumstances connected With the transaction 
               <br />
               have not been revealed. I have made these 
               <br />
               few remarks without preparation, and would 
               <br />
