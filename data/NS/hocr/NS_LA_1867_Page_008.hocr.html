               There has never been any measure of Union

               submitted to this house for its deliberation. In- 
               <br />
               stead of bringing back what they agreed on they 
               <br />
               have put their hands to an Act of Parliament. 
               <br />
               We are hereafter to be bound by a paper con- 
               <br />
               stitution which has never been submitted to us 
               <br />
               for our consideration. No more important 
               <br />
               question than this was ever before the people of 
               <br />
               this country. If this bill is passed we are de- 
               <br />
               prived of the power of hereafter legislating for 
               <br />
               ourselves. We shall certainly have avoice in 
               <br />
               the General Parliament, but that the people 
               <br />
               don’t want at all. Nothing can reconcile the 
               <br />
               people to the manner in which this measure is 
               <br />
               being forced upon them. They might have 
               <br />
               submitted to an Act of Union, if the British 
               <br />
               Parliament and people had declared that it was 
               <br />
               positively necessary for Imperial purposes, but 
               <br />
               that has not been the case. It appears by the 
               <br />
               papers that Her Maiesty’s Ministers have all 
               <br />

               tered by the delegates. It is not difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               understand the motives that have prompted the 
               <br />
               delegates to take the course they have. These 
               <br />
               politicians wish to put themselves out of the 
               <br />
               power of the people—to obtain place and emo- 
               <br />
               lument without the wishes of the people being 
               <br />
               at all consulted. The public men et New

               Brunswick dissolved the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> when they 
               <br />
               returned from Quebec, and the people returned 
               <br />
               a large majority opposed to Union with Canada. 
               <br />
               Another election subsequently took place. and 
               <br />
               the people, {or some reason or other, reversed 
               <br />
               the verdict they had given previously. So the 
               <br />
               the people of New Brunswick have been ap- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ple of Nova Scotla have not been consulted 
               <br />
               even once. The course pursued by these gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen is, as far as I know. unprecedented in

               <br />
