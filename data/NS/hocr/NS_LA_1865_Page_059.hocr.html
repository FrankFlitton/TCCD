               <br />
               and prosperity of the country there grew up an

               to the North, at length culminated in a demand 
               <br />
               for a separation. We are all familiar with the 
               <br />
               history of events from that time to this-that 
               <br />

               the furrows in a farmer’s ﬁeld. Looking at the in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence which this sentiment has exercised over 
               <br />
               men’s minds at all times, I must conclude that 
               <br />
               it has also operated largely in the provinces, 
               <br />
               and that men have been carried away by that

               and'prosperity of t is province, and telling 
               <br />
               us how much we had to be grateful for, why 
               <br />
               We could not withal cultivate the virtue of 
               <br />
               contentment. But they tell us that there are 
               <br />
               circumstances outside of our own borders that 
               <br />
               prevent the continuance of these things. In 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theﬁrstplace,</span> we have been told that there is 
               <br />

               <br />
               adrift. It is hardly necessary to spend much 
               <br />
               time on that part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subset,</span> because opi— 
               <br />
               nions lately propounded in t e British parlia- 
               <br />
               ment show that there is a determination on 
               <br />
               the part of Great Britain to preserve her colo- 
               <br />

               of Englan . We naturally expected this de- 
               <br />
               claration. We have seen that the expansion 
               <br />
               and malntenance of colonies has been the 
               <br />
               policy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> En land has pursued from time 
               <br />
               immemorial, an it is that which has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> 
               <br />
               her her proudest title ——“mistress and sover- 
               <br />
               eign of the sea.” In the many long years of 
               <br />
               struggle With other powers to obtain that title, 
               <br />
               it was not so much the staunchness of her 
               <br />
               ships, or the bravery of her crews, as from the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">training</span> to the seas which they had acquired

               Before passmg away from this part of the

               subJect, I may add it is still more unlikely 
               <br />
               that En land should have adopted this policy 
               <br />
               of aban omng her colonies at a time when her

               been called the “ workshop oi the world,” but

               <br />
               years ago: “I ﬁrmly believe it is our duty, to

               maintain our great and valuable Colonial em- 
               <br />

               <br />
               but a few days ago we saw the same expres-
