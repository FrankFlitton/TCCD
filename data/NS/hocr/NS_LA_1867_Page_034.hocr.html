               Banks has lately taken a great interest in our 
               <br />
               aﬁ‘airs; he has introduced into Congress a bill 
               <br />
               to provide for our admission into the United 
               <br />
               States. The advantages which this bill offers 
               <br />
               us are spoken of in very favorable terms by 
               <br />

               <br />
               question from his own point of view. Let us 
               <br />
               see what he thinks of Confederation. In
