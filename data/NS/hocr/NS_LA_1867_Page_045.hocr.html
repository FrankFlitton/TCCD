               <br />
               ﬁrst this evening (Mr. Shannon) alluded to

               the union of Scotland and England as a caso 
               <br />
               analogous toonrs;—but let me point out one 
               <br />
               or two distinctions. England and Scotland 
               <br />
               had been at war for centuries, and they 
               <br />
               formed parts of the same island. Scotland 
               <br />
               gave England a King, she was without colo- 
               <br />
               nies, and by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> to share the trade of the 
               <br />
               larger kingdom had every inducement to 
               <br />
               union with England. These were the argu- 
               <br />
               ments addressed to the Scottish mind, and we 
               <br />
               must all admit their force; but what has Ca- 
               <br />
               nada to offer us? Does she oﬁ‘er us addition— 
               <br />
               al trade with colonies from which we were 
               <br />
               previously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">excluded?</span> Have we ever been at ‘ 
               <br />
               war with her? Are we part of the same Is 
               <br />
               land? And instead of our giving her king 
               <br />
               will she not lord it over us? Is her geogra- 
               <br />
               phical position like ours? Nature evidently 
               <br />
               formed the Island, now England and Scot- 
               <br />
               land to be under one government, but with 
               <br />
               a narrow strip of land connecting the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces with Canada, in many places 
               <br />
               not more than twenty-six to thirty miles 
               <br />
               wide, is it net evident-that geography pro-' 
               <br />
               tests against the union of Provinces, whose 
               <br />
               railways and telegraphs in time of war could 
               <br />
               be severed in ﬁfty places, and all communica- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the year, which has no trade to oﬁ‘er us of 
               <br />
               which we cannot avail ourselves now. More 
               <br />
               than that, Scotland went into the union with 
               <br />
               the advantage in a pecuniary point of view. 
               <br />
               and we go into Confederation with the money
