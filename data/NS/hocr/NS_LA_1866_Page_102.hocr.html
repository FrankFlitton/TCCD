               there be for such a course? On the contrary,

               with a common revenue and common interest,

               of Upper Canada that the lower provinces 
               <br />
               should prosper equally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> themselves—that

               would be felt t0wards Canada by the lower

               animated with selﬁsh motives, and want to get

               vice of the enemy got up to frighten our people. 
               <br />
               .Any person who has travelled over that vast 
               <br />
               country and become acquainted with its great 
               <br />
               resources and growing trade, cannot fail to be 
               <br />
               convinced that this is entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">groundless—The</span> 
               <br />
               public debt of Canada, in proportion to her pop- 
               <br />
               ulation, is little in exceSs of our own, while her 
               <br />
               resources and ability to meet it are equaly good. 
               <br />
               But I am satisﬁed that altho’ Canadians are 
               <br />
               certainly anxious for Union with us, it is not 
               <br />
               on this selﬁsh ground. They know that, while 
               <br />
               their country is rapidly increasing in popula- 
               <br />

               <br />
               nection with the Maritime Provinces and an 
               <br />
               outlet to the sea at all seasons, they will be 
               <br />
               continually at the mercy of the people of the 
               <br />
               United States; who having cautiously put an 
               <br />
               end to the Reciprocity Treaty, threaten also to 
               <br />
               terminate the transport of Canadian bonded 
               <br />
               Goods over their territory and thus worry the 
               <br />
               people into adesire for Annexation. Should 
               <br />
               this be the case and the United States he thus

               the people of Nova Scotia are working to

               exhibit their indignation against any person 
               <br />
               who deals with this scheme? I believe that 
               <br />
               the people of this Province having considered 
               <br />
               this matter, have made up their minds that 
               <br />
               the event is inevitable, and that they are 
               <br />
               content to trust their rights and liberties to the 
               <br />
               gentlemen who are within these walls. They 
               <br />
               are satisﬁed that tied up with the people as we 
               <br />
               are all of us —that whatever we possess being 
               <br />
               bound up in the prosperity of the country— we 
               <br />
               are not likely to jeopardize the public interests. 
               <br />
               Under these circumstances I feel that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> 
               <br />
               safe in passing the resolution before us, and. 
               <br />
               that on its adoption largely depends the 
               <br />
               safety of the people of this countr . lt is for us 
               <br />
               to consider if the Confederation ot these Prov- 
               <br />
               inces will increase their strength and power, it 
               <br />
               is not our duty as well as interest, to yield to 
               <br />
               the advice of the British Government and pass 
               <br />
               this measure. 1 believe that such will be the 
               <br />
               results of Union, and I am therefore ready for 
               <br />
               one to support the resolution, believing that in 
               <br />
               doing so we are tending to perpetuate British 
               <br />
               rule, and British liberty through the length and 
               <br />

               this question to be decided without at least
