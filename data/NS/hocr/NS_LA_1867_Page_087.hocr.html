               about 40,000. A few years ago a petition was

               had abandoned the idea of presenting the peti-

               ti ons, more eSpecially because of the unprece-

               around the house evidently was to get rid o the

               <br />
               other explanation could be given of the intelli- 
               <br />
               gence from Canada that a nucleus of a standing 
               <br />

               <br />
               who should be paid by the Confederation? The 
               <br />
               meaning of this was that we were being educated 
               <br />
               up to independence and the Provinces were ra—

               pidly approaching that point.
