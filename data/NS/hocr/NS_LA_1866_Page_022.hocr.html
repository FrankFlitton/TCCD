               which is at this moment engaging the attention

               not only of the Legislature, but of the best 
               <br />
               minds not only in this Province, but in the 
               <br />
               whole Empire, and that is, the defence of the 
               <br />
               country. He felt, in view of the prominence 
               <br />
               this question has now assumed, that it was 
               <br />
               necessary that he should show to the House 
               <br />
               how he proposed to deal with it. He says we 
               <br />
               would he exposed to simultaneous attack, and 
               <br />
               therefore Union would be of no avail, inas- 
               <br />
               much as New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
               <br />
               Canada would have each to defend themselves. 
               <br />
               The Government of which he was a member, 
               <br />
               the delegates and representatives of that Go-

               British North America would be of no avail 
               <br />
               for the security of Nova Scotia. Is he not 
               <br />
               bound by the public record of his views, given

               corded declaration in another place. The

               <br />

               years by a gentleman in the other branch of

               the Legislature, and it is well known that a. 
               <br />
               change was suddenly made in the editorial 
               <br />
               management of that paper. It was wrested

               from the hands of the gentleman in question, 
               <br />
               and the sole responsibility of editorship was 
               <br />
               assumed by the hon. gentleman who has just 
               <br />
               sat down. The hon. member felt that the 
               <br />
               question of defence lay at the very threshold. 
               <br />
               On the platform,iu the press, and in the House 
               <br />
               he has proposed that the Legislatures of all 
               <br />
               British North America should pass laws by 
               <br />
               which they would supply the means to render 
               <br />
               defence practicable. He has proposed that 
               <br />
               laws should be passed under which the man 
               <br />
               on whom might rest the responsibility might 
               <br />
               draw the very last man from one Province for 
               <br />
               the defence of the other. Who is there that 
               <br />
               does not know that, having propounded that
