               1 will now refer shortly to some remarks up- 
               <br />
               on the disadvantages which we are told will 
               <br />
               result from the project. First—it is said that 
               <br />
               our union means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separation</span> from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England.</span> 
               <br />
               think I have already disposed of this, for I 
               <br />
               need only repeat that the whole public mind 
               <br />
               in the mother couutr is in favor of the plan, 
               <br />
               for the very reason t lat it will draw parent 
               <br />
               and children closer together, to be united by 
               <br />
               one common tic. The main objection, however, 
               <br />
               which has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> forward, is one of a 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial character. lt is said we have made a 
               <br />
               bad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bargain—4n</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> of the hon. mem-

               nada! Well, my answer is, the sale is not yet 
               <br />
               perfected, for it has still to be ratified. But is 
               <br />
               it so bad abargain‘? The objections are two- 
               <br />

               They say we have not a fair representation 
               <br />
               in the United Parliament. I ask, what has 
               <br />
               been conceded to us in the Legislative Coun- 
               <br />
               cil? We shall have in that body, which I am 
               <br />
               happy to see is to be purely of a monarchical 
               <br />
               character, and whose functions will be high 
               <br />
               and important, greater weight than we were 
               <br />
               really entitled to. But it is said that the real 
               <br />
               power of the Parliament will be in the House 
               <br />
               of Assembly, and that there we will not be ade— 
               <br />
               quately represented. We shall be represented 
               <br />
               upon the true principle, that is, according to 
               <br />
               our population, and I cannot see how such an 
               <br />
               arrangement can be objected to, or what could 
               <br />
               be considered more equitable. But the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North (lolchestor would introduce 
               <br />
               a curious idea in connection with this. He 
               <br />
               would increase the representation in propor- 
               <br />
               tion to the distance from the capital. 1 think 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from the county of Ca e Breton 
               <br />
               would gladly accede to this, as it won d <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely</span>

               increase the inﬂuence of his favourite island—~— 
               <br />
               This idea was illustrated by a reference to the 
               <br />
               distribution of the members of Parliament in 
               <br />
               England, but the hon. member should have 
               <br />
               gone further; he should have told us what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re—</span> 
               <br />
               presentation Scotland actually has, and what 
               <br />
               she would be entitled to on his principle. He 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd his argument utterly fail him.

               As regards the ﬁnancial aspect of the bar-

               gain, the matter has been so fully discussed 
               <br />
               that I do not intend to enter into it further

               <br />
               statements of ﬁgures are too often very delu-

               <br />
               and found correct the conclusions are worth— 
               <br />
               less. All that may he said is that though we 
               <br />
               shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be'required</span> to give up the larger part of

               provide for our local wants. As regards the 
               <br />
               question of increase of tariff we have had the 
               <br />
               same wide diﬁerence in computation. The

               Hudson, and then return to Halifax, and how 
               <br />
               great is the contrast! Now, if we have union

               <br />
               that the debates . oi the General Parliament

               <br />
               bition of personalities as we were treated with 
               <br />

               galleries when I ought to have been on the

               <br />
               out foun ation. I was present on the platform 
               <br />
               at the ﬁrst meeting in Temperance Hall, but 
               <br />
               from all the others I was absent owin <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               state of my health. I hardly know that it was 
               <br />
               even necessary to refer to these things, but I 
               <br />
               have done so because I felt it due to this house 
               <br />
               to give this public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contradiction</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state-“</span> 
               <br />
               ments made. I know that my constituents do

               not require it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span>

               As regards the other personalities which have 
               <br />
               fallen from the hon. gentleman, I can treat‘them
