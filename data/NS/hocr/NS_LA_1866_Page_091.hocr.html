               These were the sentiments that Mr. How. 
               <br />
               impressed upon the peOple of this country 
               <br />
               What then did they lead to? When the Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial Secretary moved the resolution, two 
               <br />
               years ago, for the Union of the Maritime Colo— 
               <br />
               nice, I stated in a very short speech. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> from 
               <br />
               my earliest recollection of the political history 
               <br />
               of this country I had been impressed with the 
               <br />
               conviction that the leading men on both sides 
               <br />

               North American Colonies, and that a desire 
               <br />
               for such Union largely pervaded the public 
               <br />
               mind of this country. Iregretted, on that oc- 
               <br />
               casion, that instead of a Union of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Maritime</span> 
               <br />
               Provinces, we could not aspire to a Union of 
               <br />
               all the Colonies in British North America. 
               <br />
               Sir, I did not stand alone in entertaining that 
               <br />
               opinion, and I venture to assert that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wag</span> 
               <br />
               the opinion of the large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of the people

               of this country, until. their fears and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁreﬂiudicea</span> 
               <br />
               were aroused by demagogues who a other

               ends to serve, and not a leading man but has

               which e published the other day, says we am
