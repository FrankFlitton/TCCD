               weal or woe by this measure accept it?" The 
               <br />
               answer he gives is that party feeling is so 
               <br />
               high that a. fair decision cannot be obtained at 
               <br />

               ing will not interfere when he has seen gentle-

               men from his own ends _of the House rallying

               into opposition, and leading gentlemen formerly

               <br />
               party and going to his support. This is the best 
               <br />
               proof that the question overrides party feeling, 
               <br />
               and that feeling will not interfere with its just 
               <br />
               consideration at the polls. Thequestion has as-

               <br />

               something in opposition to the scheme which 
               <br />
               they have submitted. But I tell him we pos-

               sessed a satisfactory system of government 
               <br />
               before this scheme was brought here. Let me 
               <br />
               now say a word or tw0 respecting the Organi- 
               <br />
               zation of the Empire. It has been time and 
               <br />
               again stated and acknowledged that the weak— 
               <br />
               est portion of the British Empire is B. N.Ame— 
               <br />
               rica, and we, placed alongside so powerful 
               <br />
               a neighbour see and feel the truth of the state- 
               <br />
               ment. When last night this subject was 
               <br />
               touched, my imagination pictured the hor- 
               <br />
               rors of a war between England and America 
               <br />
               with Nova Scotia for the battle ground as it 
               <br />
               would be. The picture presented I cannot ﬁnd 
               <br />
               language to describe, nor can the most vivid 
               <br />
               imagination truly paint the desolation which 
               <br />
               would come upon us should the demon of war 
               <br />
               drive his horrid ploughshares over this fair 
               <br />
               Province. The very graves of our fathers 
               <br />
               would be uprooted and their cherished dust 
               <br />
               scattered to the winds. Every man sees and 
               <br />
               feels, moreover, that the chances of war with 
               <br />
               us are greatly increased by our connection 
               <br />
               with the mother country. Yet still if treated 
               <br />
               as men, permitted to enjoy legitimate rights, 
               <br />
               the British feeling within us will lead us to 
               <br />
               maintain at all hazards, our allegiance and 
               <br />

               weakest of the Empire—what does Mr. Howe

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection</span> of this new nationality alone. As

               was said here last evening Nova Scotia must 
               <br />
               belong to some great naval power. We are 
               <br />
               so situated that a gunboat can shell al- 
               <br />
               most any part of our territory, and not only 
               <br />
               the treasures of coal and minerals we have 
               <br />
               within call for protection, but our commerce 
               <br />
               without; our ships on every sea demand it; 
               <br />
               and yet this scheme which is being forced 
               <br />
               upon us will leave us only to the protection 
               <br />
               of Canada. What ! leave us only un- 
               <br />
               der the protection of Canada? What ab-

               <br />
               bour and bring to its protection the whole navy 
               <br />
               of Canada, and there is hardly a ﬁfth rate 
               <br />
               naval power in the world but would consider
