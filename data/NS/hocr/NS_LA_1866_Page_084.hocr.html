               time ago, he wrote a letter denying that he had

               Now I have always entertained the opinion

               <br />

               <br />

               generally by the press, stating that he had not 
               <br />
               written an article for several months. I received 
               <br />
               a letter last night from a friend of mine in the

               <br />
               adopt Confederation. He is one of the most in- 
               <br />
               ﬁuential men in my own county, and has been an 
               <br />

               night from Cornwallis, and I asked him what was 
               <br />
               the feeling in Kings. " Mr. Howe has done two 
               <br />
               things,“ was the reply; “he has cemented the 
               <br />
               Conservatives to a man, and has divided the pro- 
               <br />
               gressive Liberals from those who are opposed to

               As respects the hon. member for East Halifax, 
               <br />
               he has been on both sides of this question. He 
               <br />
               puts me in mind of the boy who complained to 
               <br />
               his mother that Bill took all his portion of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               sides. I regret that he should have introduced 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> this debate the reference he made to the 
               <br />
               Queen. to the representative of Majesty, and to 
               <br />
               hon. Gto. Brown. It is not necessary to refer 
               <br />
               to the papers that support Confederation. It has 
               <br />
               been said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> clergymen have no tight to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal</span> 
               <br />
               with matters like this. Clergymen, I contend, 
               <br />
               exercise their legitimate functions when they in- 
               <br />
               struct their people in an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tmoortant</span> crisis. There- 
               <br />
               fore I believe that the religious press is only per- 
               <br />
               forming its duty in discussing thts question and 
               <br />
               advising the people on the subject. Temperate 
               <br />
               and argumentative articles have appeared in its

               columns, and no fault can be found with it for 
               <br />
               pursuing this course. As respects the secular 
               <br />
               press, the weight of authority is ln favor 0fCon— 
               <br />

               <br />
               poses the measure is the Chronicle, and we all

               know the inconsistent and extraordinary course 
               <br />
               it has pursued. Therefore, whether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you.</span> take
