               fore it has been from my ﬁrst inception of 
               <br />
               public life that I have earnestly and zealously 
               <br />
               advocated the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span> which the public men of

               the day have in view—a. Union of British North

               America. When I looked at. the state of feeling 
               <br />
               in this House last session, I was of Opinion 
               <br />
               that there were hardly half a dozen of men 
               <br />
               belonging to the party with which I was con- 
               <br />
               nected, that were ready to come up to the mark 
               <br />
               and vote for a Union of the Provinces. To my 
               <br />
               utter surprise, on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> meeting of this House, I 
               <br />
               found that an entire change had taken place 
               <br />
               in the opinions and feelings of gentlemen, and 
               <br />
               I of course could not otherwise than suppose 
               <br />
               that they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuenced‘</span> by the knowledge

               tuents during the recess of Parliament. I 
               <br />
               have in my conversations with members of 
               <br />
               this House stated over and over again that I 
               <br />
               was not in favour of a Union of these Pro—

               feel that with their consent a Union might be

               March. The House discussed the question as

               think of the difference between Halifax and 
               <br />

               discontented with the Union, separated as she

               hon. member does not amount to agreat deal

               minds of this province have advocated Union; 
               <br />
               but it was not until 1863 that Canada was will-

               the Province of Canada, and as an evidence of 
               <br />
               the feelings of the peo le I need only refer to 
               <br />
               the fact, that after the uebec scheme was ma-

               only one was returned in opposition. Here you

               sult of the elections in New Brunswick has 
               <br />
               been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different,</span> but now we ﬁnd that agreat 
               <br />
               change is rapidly taking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place.</span> in the senti- 
               <br />
               ments of the people of that Provmce. In N ew- 
               <br />
               foundland the question has assumed a most, 
               <br />
               satisfactory aspect; although occupying an iso- 
               <br />
               lated position, the le islature has shown a 
               <br />
               most favorable disposition to enter the union 
               <br />
               when N ova Scotia and the other provincesgive 
               <br />
               their assent to the measure. As respects 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, I am not able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> 
               <br />
               now to say anything deﬁnite, but no doubt 
               <br />
               she will also fall in in good time. It 
               <br />
               has been said by the Provincial Secretary 
               <br />
               that a Union was impracticable whilst New 
               <br />
               Brunswick occupied a position of uncompro- 
               <br />
               mising hostility t) the scheme, but the feeling 
               <br />
               of that Colony, as I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Just</span> stated, is under. 
               <br />
               going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i.</span> constant change, and it is therefore 
               <br />
