               <br />
               best interests of his country in order to sa- 
               <br />

               <br />
               choose, as between a union with Canada 
               <br />
               and a union with the American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Republic,</span> 
               <br />
               in favor of the latter. We have heard him 
               <br />
               characterizing the Parliament of Great Bri- 
               <br />

               <br />
               loquy upon the grandest institutions that 
               <br />
               are the pride and glory of the world. He 
               <br />
               has declared that a preference for a closer

               <br />
