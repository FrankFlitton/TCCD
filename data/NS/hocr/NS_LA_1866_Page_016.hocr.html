               Whatever my opinions on this great subject 
               <br />
               were a year ago, occurrences transpiring in

               <br />
               as to what this House owe to the country.—The 
               <br />
               repeal of the Reciprocity Treaty is no longer a 
               <br />
               matter of doubt, as it was when we last sat here. 
               <br />
               The cause of its repeal is ominous of a state 
               <br />
               of things and of a feeling which should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make</span>

               <br />
               to themselves, because there was none, that 
               <br />
               the United States determined this treaty; but,

               and to injure and embarrass us in the chan- 
               <br />
               nels of our trade. The position of these Pro— 
               <br />
               vinces could not but be regarded as humiliat-

               debate, must have some excuse for the crude- 
               <br />
               ness of my observations. This question is one 
               <br />
               of the deepest moment to the people of this 
               <br />

               not be worthy of a seat within these walls if I

               were not prepared on the instant to express

               <br />

               interest and pleasure to the hon member for 
               <br />
               Richmond, because I felt that he was sincere 
               <br />
               in his observations,—I will not attribute any 
               <br />
               unworthy motives for the course which he has 
               <br />
               taken, but notwithstanding that I give him 
               <br />
               credit for candor and sincerity, I am not pre- 
               <br />
               pared to acquiesce in the result at which he 
               <br />
               has arrived until the people express themselves

               in a different tone and manner from those in
