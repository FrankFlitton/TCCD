               I conceive then that this delegation has ex- 
               <br />
               ceeded its authority, and that the commission 
               <br />
               under which they probably acted was not an- 
               <br />
               thorised by this resolution. We had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegutesk</span> 
               <br />
               in connection with this subject on a previous 
               <br />
               occasion, and the resolution under, which they 
               <br />
               were appointed was similar in its terms to 
               <br />
               this, but was it supposed that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> 
               <br />
               sent to Charlottetown and Quebec were em- 
               <br />
               powered to do anything but prepare a. scheme 
               <br />
               to he submitted {or the ratiﬁcation of this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house?</span> Not by an y means, and therefore 
               <br />
               when those gentlemen went across the water 
               <br />
               and became parties to an imperial act, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.t</span> 
               <br />
               they were engaged in the lobby of the British 
               <br />
               Parliament promoting that act, they exceeded 
               <br />
               the authority conferred upon them by this 
               <br />
               house and by their commission. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> view- 
               <br />
               I think that the action of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> is such 
               <br />
               as the house and the people should not sustain. 
               <br />
               This is a. matter which should have been 
               <br />
               brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back</span> here and subjected to the consi- 
               <br />
               deration of the legislature. But they have 
               <br />
               consummated the not as far as it was in their 
               <br />
               power to do so, and under what circumstances 
               <br />
               have their proceedings transpired? It is well 
               <br />
               known that the people of this countryin every 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">section</span> petitioned by thousands praying that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> scheme should not receive any consum- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mation</span> at the hands of the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment until it had been submitted 
               <br />
               to them at the polls. but how have these peti- 
               <br />
               tions been treated? Have we heard that they 
               <br />
               have even been read or even presented, in or- 
               <br />
               der <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thut</span> the wishes of the country should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> n? Then this bill, framed by the dele- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gates,</span> under an authority which they assumed 
               <br />
               but hzui not, was introduced into the House of 
               <br />
               Lords, a. body composed, I think, of between 
               <br />
               300 and 400 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members,</span> and how was it there re- 
               <br />
               ceived when presented for consideration? Of 
               <br />
               the hundreds of members, there could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notfbc</span> 
               <br />
               found one to witness its formal presentation 
               <br />
               one round dozen, and that important bill, 
               <br />
               touching the rights, the property and persons 
               <br />
               of our people for all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> to come, was not 
               <br />
               even read. It was read by its title_only, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               the important details it embodied never
