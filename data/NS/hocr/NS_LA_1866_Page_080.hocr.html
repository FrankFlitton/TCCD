               hack to the period when the mother country gave 
               <br />
               us a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution</span> ; what was the language of the 
               <br />
               Imperial ministry then’.l It amounted to this, 
               <br />
               “ Only tell us what you want and you shall have 
               <br />
               it, you shall be governed according to the well

               shall be the one that we will maintain.” That

               elevated to the positions they now fill,—-I say it 
               <br />
               comes with a bad grace from them to strike down 
               <br />
               the constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> which they have derived 
               <br />
               such distinction. I trust that they will pause

               before doing so, and if they reﬂect for a moment

               <br />
               have not said a word as to my views respecting 
               <br />
               union in the abstract. I ﬁnd Nova Scotia a 
               <br />
               happy, prosperous, loyal country; I find her on 
               <br />
               the high road of progress and advancement, a 
               <br />
               country in which every man may pursucinduStry 
               <br />
               in any branch he may select, a country enjoying 
               <br />
               civil and religious liberty in the largest degree, 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd her a comparatively untaxcd country, en- 
               <br />
               joying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blessings</span> and advantages not to be found 
               <br />
               in any other country beneath the sun, and these 
               <br />
               are to be lost or to be perilled for what? Where 
               <br />
               is the necessity for the change 7 Until I can see 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seine</span> greater necessity than I now see, my ban

               ner shall he Nova Scotia for Nova Seotians, my 
               <br />
               device shall be that the privileges we now enjoy 
               <br />
               shall be maintained inviolate. At present “I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seek</span> no change, and least of all such a change as 
               <br />
               this would bring us.” Mr. Speaker, I hold in 
               <br />
               my hand a resolution which I intend to offer in 
               <br />
               vindication of my position. I trust it will meet 
               <br />
               with the concurrence of a large number of mem- 
               <br />

               the present condition of the Province—I mean

               ask in what position would every man who truly 
               <br />

               <br />

               and hand in hand, without any question agitating 
               <br />
               their minds in connection with political consid-

               <br />
               moment, should have but one object in view,—

               <br />
               things necessary, just, and wise, that there should 
               <br />
               be but one sentiment abroad—that ofloyalty to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> Crown, and that ofa determination 
               <br />
               to sustain the integrity of the British Empire. 
               <br />
               It is because an agitation such as this measure

               is inducing will produce consequences of an un—

               which they live, and dividing their power to resist

               an enemy, if an enemy should venture an attack; 
               <br />
               it is because, in addition to the other objections

               which I have stated that I am apprehensive of such

               results as these, that I ask this house to pause 
               <br />
               before they consummate a union which the peo- 
               <br />
               ple do not desire—one in fact against which 
               <br />
               they have petitioned, and that at a time when 
               <br />
               they should be found warm in their allegiance, 
               <br />
               as united as one man to protect the soil on

               which they live and upon which they hope to 
               <br />
               die. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposing</span> this perilous consummation, I

               am discharging my duty to my constituents, to

               myself, and to the country at large. I do trust,

               that wedded though some gentlemen in high

               <br />
               of consummation of this net. It may matter not

               to me individually what the decision of this 
               <br />
