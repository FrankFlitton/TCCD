               Is it not evident that when the embryo republic 
               <br />
               is fairly in operation, if the local Legislatures, 
               <br />
               pressed by their various constituencies, should 
               <br />
               for instance, propose that the Lieut. Governor, 
               <br />
               instead of being nominated by the Governor- 
               <br />
               General, should be elected by the people—and I 
               <br />
               can fancy that such a proposal might be made 
               <br />
               —--at its ﬁrst meeting here, the conﬂict that 
               <br />
               would in such a case ensue between the various 
               <br />
               legislative bodies would result in serious collis- 
               <br />
               ion—perhaps smash the whole confederacy into 
               <br />

               claring that the senators should be elected—and 
               <br />
               I may here say that such a change would be a 
               <br />
               misfortune to some persons who have stood for
