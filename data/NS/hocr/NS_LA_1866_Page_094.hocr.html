               summation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> of Union. But this 
               <br />
               also let me say the opponents <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Union may 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">succeed</span> in deriving a lit le temporary popularity 
               <br />
               by their course, but the people sooner or later, 
               <br />
               when they see the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hentfi</span> s that the scheme 
               <br />
               confers upon them will acknowledge their mistake 
               <br />
               and give their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬁdence</span> and cstten. where it is 
               <br />
               properly due. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite</span> content to wait the

               coming of that time when the very mm who may 
               <br />
               now reject Union will be the same who will 
               <br />
               accept it and recognize the claims of its friends 
               <br />
               and promoters to their consideration. (Cheers)

               Mr. MCLELAN said :——If I consulted my own
