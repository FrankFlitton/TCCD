               prominent members that this matter had been

               and I need scarcely ask members whether 
               <br />
               that information was true or false. Is there a 
               <br />
               member of this house or a man in the country 
               <br />

               las: election—at the time when the canvass 
               <br />
               was taking place—this question was presented 
               <br />
               to the people, or that on any hustîngs it was 
               <br />
               even mentioned. And if not. I care not 
               <br />
               whether it had been at any previous time. In 
               <br />
               the course of my professional training I have 
               <br />
               learned this principle: that the last will which

               his subsequent wishes. When, therefore, at 
               <br />

               before the people. and that they did not then

               express their views upon it. But let me be 
               <br />
               more particular. I have in my hand a copy of

               <br />
               pieces of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misinformation</span> that I must trouble

               referable to the interests of Nova Scotia, took

               a deep interest in the proceedings and action of

               would be still more apparent that the Parlia-

               to view it as a declaration of War—war on the

               its existence can last but for a few weeks and

               <br />
               approached a crisis of a momentous character 
               <br />
               in our history. This Province until a recent 
               <br />
               period was a loyal and happy Colony, having 
               <br />
               every reason to be loyal, every reason to be 
               <br />
               happy until this .unfortuuate and unhappy 
               <br />
               measure was brought in and cast among us. 
               <br />
               Shall I be told that loyalty exists now 
               <br />
               in the same richness among us as it once and 
               <br />
               recently did? Mr. Speaker, I strenuously 
               <br />
               opposed the measure last Session on the ground 
               <br />
               that the course about to be taken. would en- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">danger</span> the allegiance and undermine theloyal- 
               <br />
               îy of the people and since that time I have 
               <br />
               seen that that result is but too probable. We 
               <br />
               are told by members of the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment that it is desirable we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be separat- 
               <br />
               ed from the British Empire and further we are 
               <br />
               told that it is not alone for the interests of 
               <br />
               hi ova Scotia that the scheme has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro'ec»</span> 
               <br />

               ble that we should be connected with a large
