               a great public measure. We are able to stand

               here and claim that the friends of Union were

               ous, but that the ties that now hind them to the 
               <br />

               members who could be induced by gentlemen

               ground that the colonies were a burthen, and 
               <br />
               that the sooner they were got rid of the better. 
               <br />
               These are the views of Mr. Bright who com- 
               <br />
               plained that if this Union was accomplished the 
               <br />
               result would be to burthen the Empire with the 
               <br />
               defence of these provinces and what position did 
               <br />
               Mr. Ayrton take? He would not commit himself 
               <br />
               so far as to oppose Union, but what he com- 
               <br />
               plained of was that millions of British money 
               <br />
               were to be expended in connection with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> 
               <br />
               highway between this provmce and Canada.

               Thus we ﬁnd the British Government, and all 
               <br />
               statesmen who value the colonies as one of the

               port of colonial Union, whilst in opposition to 
               <br />
               to this great scheme we ﬁnd only the men who

               I must for a single instant call the attention 
               <br />
               of gentlemen opposite to the fact that they are 
               <br />
               bound by their own recorded votes in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1864</span> to 
               <br />
               vote against this resolution. I had the honour 
               <br />
               to move in the session of that year a resolution 
               <br />
               authorizing a conference to make a much more 
               <br />
               radical change than it is now intended to make 
               <br />
               in our constitution. It proposed a scheme of 
               <br />
               Union that would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">merged</span> our local insti

               would have been transferred to another place. 
               <br />
               When I moved that resolution to appoint dele-

               <br />

               <br />
               as it would change the constitution, there should

               gentlemen who now raise these objections when 
               <br />
               I declared that this House had the power to do 
               <br />
               what I have said’.l There was no one then to 
               <br />
               raise an objection to such a course. They bound 
               <br />
               themselves to the constitutional principle that 
               <br />
               this Parliament had the undoubted power, and

               <br />
               without an appeal to the people at the polls. 
               <br />
               But I can give them another illustration how 
               <br />
               lately it is that they have discovered this new 
               <br />
               constitutional doctrine—that it is not constitu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               believe to beasolemn duty to the country. 
               <br />
               Can it be possible that these gentlemen have 
               <br />
               forgotten that in1863,just before an appeal to

               changes, a change in the constitution _ which, I

               the electoral body who were about to go to the 
               <br />

               most violent and declamatory supporters of

               <br />
               tutional right to do so. Then he backed up 
               <br />
               his leader, Mr. Howe, who had put on record

               <br />
               question. It will bo remembered that some 
               <br />
               26,000 electors, rather taken aback at this 
               <br />
               attempt to change the election law, appealed

               <br />

               <br />
               No! I hold in my hand the declaration of 
               <br />
               the leader of the Government stating that it 
               <br />
               was the undoubted right of "Parliament to 
               <br />
               pass a law in deﬁance of the people. Yet the

               sympathy which the people will never give 
               <br />
               them credit for. Mr Howe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said:—“I</span> am not
