               In speaking upon the latter question, it was

               not improbable that he spoke to his own pre-

               <br />
               to do so, on the question of Confederation. He 
               <br />
               put the two questions of Railway Extension

               breadth of view in which they should he re- 
               <br />
               garded. It was greatly to be regretted that 
               <br />
               such opposition had been shown to the West- 
               <br />
               ern Extension, and it was surprising to see the 
               <br />
               rejoicing when Knight and Company failed in 
               <br />
               their engagements. As to the objections raised 
               <br />
               by the member for Yarmouth it was well 
               <br />
               known that the previous agreement was word- 
               <br />
               ed in precisely the same way. He would have 
               <br />
               preferred that all mention of Troop‘s Point had 
               <br />
               been omitted;but any man knowing the VVest- 
               <br />
               ern part of the country would have no hesita- 
               <br />
               tion in saying that the road could not stop there. 
               <br />
               Be well recollected the opposition given in 
               <br />
               1851 by the member for Yarmouth to railway 
               <br />
               construction, and the cry all through the coun- 
               <br />
               try was that the country would be ruined, and 
               <br />
               the tax-gatherer would be at every door, but 
               <br />
               it was found that notwithstanding theexten- 
               <br />
               sion to Pictou, our road and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bridge</span> service was 
               <br />
               doubly as well provided for as it was in 1851. 
               <br />
               The same difﬁculties as to the terminus had 
               <br />
               arisen in connection with the Pictou line, and 
               <br />
               the same local feeling would always exist, but 
               <br />
               members must rise superior to such inﬂuences. 
               <br />
               There could he no doubt that this line, instead 
               <br />
               of stopping either at Annapolis or Troop’s 
               <br />
               Point, must eventually reach the Bay of Fun- 
               <br />
               dy, and for that purpose must go to Digby Gut. 
               <br />

               <br />
               With such a line of communication, the dis-

               Hon. A'r'rY. GEN. said he was not surprised 
               <br />
               at the obstruct-ion to the bill. The Govern- 
               <br />
               ment were told, in introducing the resolution 
               <br />
               for the extension, that they were not sincere, 
               <br />
               and had taken the step merely to secure sup— 
               <br />
               port for the Pictou line, that had been repeated 
               <br />
               over and over again, and some members in- 
               <br />
               terested in the Western counties were rather 
               <br />
               pleased when the commercial depression in 
               <br />
               London enabled them to point to the scheme 
               <br />
               as a failure. He had never felt any duty a 
               <br />
               more pleasing one than when he took steps to 
               <br />
               carry out the terms of the act, and to give to 
               <br />
               the western people the road which they had 
               <br />
               been expecting. Mr. Killam’s desire seemed 
               <br />
               to be that the people should consider the mat- 
               <br />
               ter and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decide—if</span> he knew <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> of the 
               <br />
               people they were anxious to keep their honor- 
               <br />
               able ohligations, and you had only to shew 
               <br />
               them that they were in justice bound to do 
               <br />
               anything in order to induce them to demand 
               <br />
               that it should he done. It was not at that time 
               <br />
               to be considered whether the road should be 
               <br />
               built,—that had been decided long ago. The 
               <br />
               opposition had increased very much in their 
               <br />
               solicitude to secure the advantages of the road 
               <br />
               to Annapolis since the time when they voted 
               <br />
