               ment of delegates to see if a better scheme than 
               <br />
               the Quebec scheme could be devised. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">71</span> felt it my 
               <br />
               duty to oppose them, not because I was averse 
               <br />
               to the principle of union—tor it is not merely 
               <br />
               since I occupied a seat here that I felt the con- 
               <br />
               viction that we could not long occupy our pre- 
               <br />
               sent position—but because of these two reasons: 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, I did not know what kind of a bargain the 
               <br />
               delegates might make when they went thousands 
               <br />
               of miles away, and I thought it wrong that we 
               <br />
               should not have the opportunity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying</span> Whe— 
               <br />
               ther we approved of their arrangements or not; 
               <br />
               and second, because I knew that a great many 
               <br />
               of the people were opposed to union. From cau- 
               <br />
               ses that cannot very well be explained, the peo- 
               <br />
               ple are afraid of change. The ﬁrst reason for 
               <br />
               my opposition has now been done away; and, 
               <br />
               as far as I am able to judge, I am disposed to 
               <br />
               think that the bargain which the delegates have 
               <br />
               made is a great deal better than the Quebec 
               <br />
               scheme. though even that I was not afraid of. 
               <br />
               I had intended last year to go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further</span> than I did; 
               <br />
               I intended not only to have Opposed the resolution 
               <br />
               but to have supported the amendment, but be- 
               <br />
               fore the discussion was over I discovered some- 
               <br />
               thing I did not like—I discovered among some 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> a strong desire for annexation to the 
               <br />
               United States. I was brought up in loyal princi- 
               <br />
               ples, and taught to cherish British institutions, 
               <br />
               and while I wished to give our people time for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«consideration,</span> I could not and never will consent 
               <br />
               to make a change from the English ﬂag to a ﬂag 
               <br />
               which I never wish to wave over my head or the 
               <br />
               heads of my children. And now, although con- 
               <br />
               tinued opposition might be consistent, I consider 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> question has come to be in that statein which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further</span> opposition would not only be useless, but 
               <br />
               dangerous. We are all proud of the eloquence 
               <br />
               and abilities of Mr. Howe, and when he went to 
               <br />
               England Iwaited with great anxiety to see if 
               <br />
               he was going to give us something which we 
               <br />
               would consider better than the scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation; but when I found him propounding 
               <br />
               a scheme which was lang ago condemned by 
               <br />
               himself as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impracticable,</span> I began to think if he 
               <br />
               had nothing ettcr tepropound, there was no- 
               <br />
               thing better to be expected than the scheme 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had,</span> been before us. If the Quebec scheme 
               <br />
               would bring taxation to the value of one cent, 
               <br />
               Mr. Howc’s would bring taxation to hundreds 
               <br />
               of times that amount.

               Another matter which operated strongly on 
               <br />
               my mind was the fact that our American neigh-

               tion, we must only look elsewhere for friends 
               <br />
               and allies. It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clear</span> that free trade with 
               <br />
               the United States was the greatest boon we 
               <br />
               could now enjoy. The trade with Canada 
               <br />
               could never be large, and we could encourage 
               <br />
               it as well without union as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> it. But free 
               <br />
               trade with our republican neighbors would be 
               <br />
               our salvation, in a commercial sense. He hop-

               e'd the Government would pause before they 
               <br />
               passed an act so arbitrary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> so unjust to the 
               <br />
               people.

               Mr. C. J. CAMPBELL—I did notintend to say 
               <br />
               much on this question, but. the hon member for 
               <br />
               Inverness has made an observation which I 
               <br />
               must contradict. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> that the people of 
               <br />
               Cape Breton are proud of their connection with 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, and that the only man opposed 
               <br />
               to the union has passed away. I think I am 
               <br />
               as fully acquainted with the feelings of that 
               <br />
               people as he is. and I therefore feel <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Justiﬁed</span> in 
               <br />
               contradicting the impression which his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remarks</span> 
               <br />
               would leave. The case of Cape Breton is not 
               <br />
               at all parallel with the case now before us,—the 
               <br />
               union was eﬁ‘eeted without the consent of the- 
               <br />
               people, and indeed without their knowledge.
