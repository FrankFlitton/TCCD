               <br />
               Haste, not only in cramming this measure 
               <br />
               down the people’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thro~ts</span> without their consent

               haste in bringing this debate to aclose to-night,

               and thus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stiﬂing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> voice of free discussion. 
               <br />
               Nothing can be more arbitrary than the cou- 
               <br />
               duct of the government. They can fri=ter

               <br />
               denies us an hour. I ask, sir, where is the 
               <br />
               necessity for action? Why not remain as we 
               <br />
               are? \Vhat is the emergency? Is it, because, 
               <br />
               as the Provincial Secretary has admitted, the 
               <br />
               government and union party in this house are 
               <br />
               afraid to hear the voice of the people? I thank 
               <br />
               the Pro. Secy. for the admission—it is candid, 
               <br />
               aude xplains his position. The emergency, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker,is not the emergency of the people, 
               <br />
               it is the emergency of the rulers of the people. 
               <br />
               Why is it that they will not refer this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure,</span> 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mos'</span> momentous of all measures that ever 
               <br />
               came before this Legislature, to the people 
               <br />
               whom it most concerns“? simply because they 
               <br />
               dare not. Do you suppose, sir, can any man 
               <br />
               imagine, if the government had a ghost ofa 
               <br />
               chance ihey would hesitate to appeal to the 
               <br />
               liustings? The voice of the people and the 
               <br />
               voice of their representatives are stiﬂed, be- 
               <br />
               cause they know it is against them. Now, sir, 
               <br />
               this act may be perpetrated, the rights 
               <br />
               of the people of Nova Scotia may be 
               <br />
               trampled on, and ignored, but Iapprehend this 
               <br />
               will not be the end ot the contest. The voice of 
               <br />
               the people though silenced for the present will 
               <br />
               make itself heard. I mistake much if the free 
               <br />
               and intelligent people of Nova. Scotia will 
               <br />
               quietly submit to be crushed and overridden— 
               <br />
               l mistake much if the honest and enlightened 
               <br />
               farmers of Kings County will quietly submit 
               <br />
               to it. And when I speak of Kings County I 
               <br />
               mean not only South Kings, which I have the 
               <br />
               honor to represent, but North Kings which is, 
               <br />
               I have every reason to know, equally strong in 
               <br />
               its condemnation of this measure. I do not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hesita‘e</span> to declare it as my o inion in the pre-

               sence of the members for or.h Kings that 
               <br />
               three-fourths of the electors of that district are 
               <br />
               opposed to it, and are only waiting for an op-

               portunity to sweep It and its authors away to- 
               <br />

               Dr. Hamilton, says he has learned from a cor- 
               <br />
               respondent in Kings that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.-</span> Howe’s letters 
               <br />
               have had the effect of cementing the Conser-

               vatives in that county. I agree with him_that 
               <br />
               the minds of all parties, With few exceptions, 
               <br />
               concur in one point—in denouncing union with 
               <br />
               Canada. I havejust returned from a Visit 
               <br />
               home, and ﬁnd the anti-union feeling stronger 
               <br />
               than ever.

               came from a gentleman not far from me. As 
               <br />

               pass Confederation; another letter is from a

               <br />
               such sentiments ss his had a good deal to do
