               Well, Mr. Speaker, when we call to mind the 
               <br />
               addresses we have so often heard from one of 
               <br />
               these gentlemen on the ﬂoors of this House on 
               <br />
               the subiect of the Intercoloniai Railway—when 
               <br />
               we remember the fervid eloquence with which 
               <br />
               he described the value of such a road in open- 
               <br />
               up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> resources of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> country behind us 
               <br />
               and in constituting a means of defence—when 
               <br />
               we recollect the letters which in 1862 the same 
               <br />
               gentleman addressed to the Secretarv for the 
               <br />
               Colonies. pointing out. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> enormous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”saving</span> in 
               <br />
               time of war-which Would result from the con— 
               <br />
               struction of this great work—and then read the 
               <br />
               document to which the house has just listened, 
               <br />
               it is difﬁcult to believe that both are the produc- 
               <br />
               tions ofthe same hand. But bad as as all this 
               <br />
               is, it is almost worse. to come here as 
               <br />
               the hon. member does, and after using every 
               <br />
               eﬁort to prevent us getting any advance at 
               <br />
               all, charge on us as an offence that we have 
               <br />
               not secured something more. If we haVe got 
               <br />
               an advance, it has been in spite of all that 
               <br />
