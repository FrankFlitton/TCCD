               that the hon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> should make such an 
               <br />
               observation, after the issue of the Colonist on 
               <br />
               last Saturday, which shows him to be in that 
               <br />
               very position. The Prov. Sec. has been driven 
               <br />
               from the constituency in which his daily life 
               <br />
               and the motives which have actuated him 
               <br />
               are best understood. His own messengers 
               <br />
               have not yet came back to tell him whether a 
               <br />
               place for his foot can be found or not. He says 
               <br />
               that we are arrayed to obstruct the progress of 
               <br />
               the country. but will he put his ﬁnger upon one 
               <br />
               advantage that is to ﬂow from union. The 
               <br />
               only beneﬁt which they promise is the construc- 
               <br />
               tion of the Intercolonial railroad, and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Guysboro, and those who concur 
               <br />
               with him, are therefore in a position to enquire 
               <br />
               whether for that work we are not to pay more 
               <br />
               than it is worth,-—whether we are not to be tax- 
               <br />
               ed to an extent that would be sufﬁcient to build 
               <br />
               the whole road. Surely if these are the facts it 
               <br />
               would have been better to forego the railroad 
               <br />
               on such hard terms. Is the member for Guys- 
               <br />
               boro’ wrong when he says that the delegates 
               <br />
               failed to secure to us that one beneﬁt on which

               now the most desirous to go to Ottawa. I ﬁnd

               that there is an election card out for this city,

               know he could have beaten every Anti-Unionist 
               <br />
               who might have the hardihood to run against 
               <br />
               him. I have conversed with highly intelligent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man,</span> from East and West-with professional men, 
               <br />
               clergymen, and others of weight and inﬂuence 
               <br />
               —-and my conviction is that there is not a 
               <br />
               shadow of a doubt that all such persons are in 
               <br />
               favour of union. I say to the Union party: 
               <br />
               Wait, have patience for a days, for there will be 
               <br />
               candidates in the ﬁeld worthy of your support, 
               <br />
               —men who will reﬂect credit upon the consti- 
               <br />
               tuency of this metropolitan county. The game 
               <br />
               is not up yet, but will be fought to the bitter 
               <br />
               end by men of tried value and of ability. I am 
               <br />
               convinced that there are in this city four Union- 
               <br />
               ists to one Anti-Unionist. An unfair advan- 
               <br />
               tage has been taken of the fact that the Provin- 
               <br />
               cial Secretary has retired, and it is said that he 
               <br />
               did so for want of support. Never would an elec—

               tion have been more easily. won, if he had run 
               <br />
               it. If‘ he felt it his duty to go back to his own 
               <br />
               county, that is his own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affair,</span> but I believe 
               <br />
               he could have won an easy victory 
               <br />
               in Halifax. Don’t let gentlemen believe 
               <br />
               that this struggle has even yet com- 
               <br />
               menced. I regret the more that the Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial Secretary retired, because at the mo. 
               <br />
               ment he did so a requisition was about being 
               <br />

               <br />
