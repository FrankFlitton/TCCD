               We have heard something about the petitions 
               <br />
               presented to this house against Confederation, 
               <br />
               we have yet heard nothing ot petitions in its

               <br />
               ignore the expressed sentiments of this people: 
               <br />
               we are told that these petitions are to be disre- 
               <br />
               garded, and that no notice is to be taken of the 
               <br />
               rights of the electors. We are reminded of the 
               <br />
               action ot the British Parliament in dealing with 
               <br />
               the Reform question, and we are told that that 
               <br />
               measure involved an important change in the 
               <br />
               constitution of the country and no one ever con- 
               <br />
               tended that Parliament was inc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impotent</span> to deal 
               <br />
               with it without reference to the people; but. 
               <br />
               will any one tell me that the questson was not 
               <br />
               before the people of Great Britain before the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last</span> General Election“! That is the answer 
               <br />
               which I give to those who assert that this legis-

               <br />
               the step. The subject of Reform was. as I have 
               <br />
               stated, before the people of England previously 
               <br />

               <br />
               statesmen that England ever saw, that question 
               <br />
               would have had more bearing on the results of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> election than it had ; gentlemen, therefore,

               be content with that, I will ask is there a maîo-

               rity of the people in favor of any union? I de- 
               <br />
               ny it, and I have some means of tortifying the 
               <br />
               assertion. In the course of the last two years 
               <br />
               Since the question has been agitated in the 
               <br />
               country, there have been no less than three 
               <br />
               appeals to the constituencies of this 
               <br />
               Province, and they are not by any means the 
               <br />
               most inconsiderable of our constituencies. There 
               <br />
               is the county of Annapolis which for many 
               <br />
               years elected to a seat within these walls a gen- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tleman</span> who, without reference t° politics, I 
               <br />

               <br />
               try, and the fact of their returning that gentle- 
               <br />
               man proves the electors of that county to be 
               <br />
               among the most intelligent constituencies of the 
               <br />
               Province. Since this question has been agita— 
               <br />
               ted that constituency has spoken, and how?

               timony that will conﬁrm me in the statement

               <br />
               the township of Yarmouth, and the gentle. 
               <br />
               men who represent that constituency need not 
               <br />
               be ashamed of it—for if there be a portion of 
               <br />
               the province in which active industry and en— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Her ships are on every sea. Look abroad at all

               quarters of the globe, and you see Yarmouth 
               <br />
               ships and Yarmouth men. When I am told, 
               <br />
               then, that the opinions of this constituency are 
               <br />
               to be disregarded, or that their views upon this 
               <br />
               measure Were not expressed. I feel that I must 
               <br />
               turn a deaf ear to such statements, because they 
               <br />
               are abundantly contradicted by the facts and 
               <br />
               circumstances. But some gentlemen argue that 
               <br />
               on this question, of all questions, the people 
               <br />
               should not be appealed to, because the people 
               <br />
               would decide on other issues and not on this. 
               <br />
               From whom does this statement come? Does

               that this, the most important question that ever

               agitated the public mind, is one upon which no 
               <br />

               <br />
               Sir, I think very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differently</span> of the people; I 
               <br />
               believe they would appreciate the magnitude of 
               <br />
               the proposition. and while they would be dis—- 
               <br />
               posed to condemn much of the public conduct 
               <br />
               of the administration, their intelligent discern- 
               <br />
               ment would lead them to sink all other consi- 
               <br />
               derations and all other questions of policy, in 
               <br />
               order that upon this they might pronounce the 
               <br />
               decisions of their minds and hearts. It will be 
               <br />
               perceit ed that I am for submitting this ques-

               which concerns their interests for all time to 
               <br />

               <br />
               argument of the other side, and supposing that 
               <br />
               the people are not as intelligent as I assert they 
               <br />
               are, there is another mode of testing their opi- 
               <br />
               nions. and that is by submitting to them the 
               <br />
               question of Confederation, pure and simple. 
               <br />
               We are told that this is not a British practice- 
               <br />
               that there is no precedent for this ; but I reply

               that we have on our statute book a precedent
