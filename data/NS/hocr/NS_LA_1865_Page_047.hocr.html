               wrong the government who have educated the

               sider, however, all the money is required for the 
               <br />
               roads and bridges. You will see by the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               1 have given that the sum required for the roads 
               <br />
               and bridges would nearly swallow up the sub-

               know you cannot without emperilling the pub-

               <br />
               as Mr. Galt has told you, in his speech, if the 
               <br />
               local revenues are not suﬁicient, you must re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever that this must be the case if this 
               <br />
               scheme is carried out. When I feel that the 
               <br />
               institutions of our country are to be swept 
               <br />
               away, and that the control of our resources 
               <br />
               is to be handed over to apeople with whom 
               <br />
               we have no sympathy, am I not right in 
               <br />
               askin this House to pause? What chance 
               <br />
               wouh there be, in such an event, of our

               <br />
               provements that are now being carried on? 
               <br />
               All our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surplus</span> revenue, as I have said, will go 
               <br />
               to Ottawa; and I ask gentlemen who look for-

               will there be of having their anticipations real—

               tile to the feelings of a vast <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of the 
               <br />
               people of this country. He had no o jections 
               <br />
               to the citizens of Halifax as citizens indulgin 
               <br />
               in any demonstration they pleased, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provuieg</span> 
               <br />
               it would not misrepresent the whole province, 
               <br />
               but he thought that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> on both sides 
               <br />
               would agree with h m‘ that this attempt to

               draw the Volunteer organization into the mat- 
               <br />

               <br />
               judicious in the extreme. It was well known 
               <br />
               that these gentlemen who were going across 
               <br />
               the water were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> with no feelings of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agite—</span>

               val of the con net of the people of the ari— 
               <br />
               time Provinces. For aught that was known 
               <br />
               they were going charged with the duty of forc-

               ing upon this people a union hostile to their 
               <br />
               feelings and their interests. . It was understood 
               <br />
               that in England and elsewhere Halifax would 
               <br />
               be considered to represent the ublic sentiment 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia, and when t e delegates go 
               <br />

               the procession that would take place that night.
