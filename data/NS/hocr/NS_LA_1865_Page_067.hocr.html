               <br />

               our mines; and it may be claimed that one of 
               <br />
               the advantages that will arise from this Union

               <br />
               giving us extended trade and commerce. We 
               <br />
               have heard a great deal of the powers of par-

               <br />
               one thing that is almost beyond the control of 
               <br />
               such enactments—that is, the divergence of 
               <br />
               trade from its natural channels. We have 
               <br />
               had in ﬁsh, coal, and those articles which 
               <br />
               are our chief products, free trade with the 
               <br />
               other colonies, and what has been the re— 
               <br />
               suit? Have our resources thereby been 
               <br />
               developed? Has our trade been enlarged?
