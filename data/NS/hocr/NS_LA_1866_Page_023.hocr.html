               ment months ago, for the means of protecting 
               <br />
               our territory, at this hour we are unable to 
               <br />
               put before the House and country the state- 
               <br />
               ment that the are .repared to assume that 
               <br />
               responsibility The mperialGovernment are 
               <br />
               evidently waiting to see whether we 
               <br />
               are prepared to adopt the advice which 
               <br />
               she was b <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mud</span> in our interests to offer.— 
               <br />
               They have emplored us time and again to com- 
               <br />
               bine and put ourselves in a position in which 
               <br />
               they can efﬁciently defend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">usyand</span> they are 
               <br />
               waiting to see whether we shall respect their 
               <br />
               advice before involving Britain in a war with a 
               <br />
               great power. The 'non. member for Richmond 
               <br />
               called <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> to the fact, that some 400,000 
               <br />
               desperate men, united by the deepest hatred of 
               <br />
               British institutions, and assisted by the sym- 
               <br />
               pathy of a powerful people, stand in a position 
               <br />
               to do everything that they can to foster and 
               <br />
               create a collision between the United States 
               <br />
               and Great Britain, if they do not attempt an 
               <br />
               invasion themselves. It is no secret that that 
               <br />
               organization have taken measures to iill the 
               <br />
               ﬁshing vessels with men who are determined to 
               <br />
               provoke collision between the two countries. 
               <br />
               In view of circumstances like these, is it not 
               <br />
               time-for every loyal suhiect to lay aside all 
               <br />
               party and [personal considerations and unite 
               <br />
