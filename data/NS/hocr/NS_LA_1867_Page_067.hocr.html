               <br />
               be in the recollection ot the house that I moved 
               <br />
               for a special committee to inquire into the 
               <br />

               <br />
               composed of the Attorney General. and a large 
               <br />
               number of leading men on both sides, and I had 
               <br />
               the honor, as chairman, of bringing in its re- 
               <br />
               port, which asserted, in the clearest and most 
               <br />
               emphatic manner, the rights of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span> to 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries, and recommended that every pos-

               sible means should be taken for the purpose ct 
               <br />
               protecting them from the encroachments of the 
               <br />
               American ﬁshermen. The American Govern— 
               <br />
               ment had, by their own act, and without refer- 
               <br />
               ence to their own ﬁshermen, deprived them of 
               <br />
               the rights which for ten years they had enjoyed 
               <br />
               in our waters. The Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofithis</span> Pro-

               vince, therefore, emphatically committed them-

               selves to the policy of excluding American ﬁsh-

               ermen at once from the waters belonging to this 
               <br />
               country. That report, submitted by myself, 
               <br />
               was adopted unanimously by the Legislature, 
               <br />
               and the Government immediately took action 
               <br />
               upon the subject, and addressed a despatch to 
               <br />

               <br />

               operation—a cooperation which appeared to be 
               <br />
               most essential in dealing with this question, in- 
               <br />
               asmuch as the ﬁshing grounds resorted to by 
               <br />
               the Americans do not exclusively belong to 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, but are also within the territorial 
               <br />

               Legislature. was for the purpose of devising 
               <br />
               with the other Provinces a system of protection 
               <br />
               by which American ﬁshermen might be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exclud-</span> 
               <br />
               ed from the ﬁshing grounds of British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> 
               <br />
               America. In order that no time might be lost 
               <br />
               in dealing with this question, the Government 
               <br />
               proposed that a member ot the Canadian Cabi- 
               <br />
               net should meet one‘ of ourselves at Fredericton 
               <br />
               during the last Session of the Legislature there, 
               <br />
               for the purpose of taking such measures as 
               <br />
               would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁectually</span> accomplish the object which 
               <br />
               we had in view. I mention these tests to the 
               <br />
               house to show how far we were from being in- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> to the ﬁshing interests of this country. 
               <br />
               A perusal of the papers which I am about to 
               <br />
               lay on the table will show that the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government. at an early stage of this question 
               <br />
               formed the opinion that if the American ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men were suddenly excluded from the privileges 
               <br />
               which they had enjoyed for so long a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time,</span> dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculties of a very serious character might arise 
               <br />
               between the United States and Great Britain, 
               <br />
               which would operate against the renewal of a 
               <br />
               treaty. This view was presented in a very 
               <br />
               strong manner, as will be seen by a Minute of 
               <br />

               The Imperial Government were led to believe, 
               <br />
               from whatever source they got the information, 
               <br />
               that the peremptory exclusion of American 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen from our waters would lead to such 
               <br />
               unpleasantness between the two countries as

               of reciprocal trade between British America 
               <br />
               and the United States. This policy, it will be 
               <br />
               seen, did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">originate</span> with the Canadians, but 
               <br />
               was pressed upon them by the Imperial autho- 
               <br />
               rities, as is clearly shown by the clause that I 
               <br />
               have read. The Canadian Government went 
               <br />
               on to show the great interest that British Ame- 
               <br />
               rica had in these ﬁsheries, and the great impor- 
               <br />
               tance of protecting them, and the inconvenience 
               <br />
               that would arise from any step that would seem 
               <br />
               an apparent concession to American ﬁshermen, 
               <br />
               or would raise a doubt as to the entire right of 
               <br />
               British America to exclude the citizens of any 
               <br />
               other country from resorting to their ﬁshing 
               <br />
               grounds. Yielding finally to the policy pressed 
               <br />
               upon them, they proposed as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compromise</span> that, 
               <br />
               for one year only, a system of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">licensing</span> Ame- 
               <br />
               rican ﬁshermen should be pursued. The Go- 
               <br />
               vernment of Canada drew up this Minute of 
               <br />
               Council, and sent it to the Imperial authorities, 
               <br />
               as embodying their views, and to show how far 
               <br />
               they were prepared to meet the wishes of the 
               <br />
               latter in relation to this question. The answer 
               <br />
               sent by the Government of Nova Scotia will 
               <br />
               show that so far from their at once yielding to 
               <br />
               the proposal thus made, they drew up a Minute 
               <br />
               of Council <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressing</span> in the strongest terms 
               <br />
               their great objection to any such policy being 
               <br />
               pursued. They pointed out, as will be seen, 
               <br />
               at considerable length, the serious objections 
               <br />

               the despatch of the Imperial Government on
