               New Brunswick, said the hon. gentleman, has 
               <br />
               been appealed to twice. Why is it that the

               people of Nova Scotia have not been allowed to 
               <br />
               express their opinions even once ? At Quebec 
               <br />
               it was agreed that the scheme of Union should 
               <br />
               be submitted to the several Parliaments. It 
               <br />
               was the last session ':f the Legislature of New

               <br />
               had nota majority to carry the measure. They 
               <br />
               appealed to the people, who decided against the 
               <br />
               Government, and therefore all action in relation 
               <br />
               to the measure in this house was prevented, for 
               <br />
               every man felt that whatever were his opinions 
               <br />
               on the subject no Union was practicable unless 
               <br />
               New Brunswick‘ came into it. Action was ac—

               former verdict and gave a large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of 
               <br />
               Union. When it became <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obvious</span> here that

               New Brunswick would concur we submitted the

               question to this House. I ask the hon mover

               the position of the government in this Legisla-

               They were called upon to take action upon the

               quently they made that appeal. Subsequently 
               <br />
               it was found that the tide of public sentiment 
               <br />
               had turned—the explanations which were made
