               examined them myself. They were submitted

               to the Imperial Government, and Mr. Cardwell 
               <br />

               <br />
               —with respect to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution</span> of the Legis-

               of England. as well as of North America, and

               approved by such eminent authorities on both 
               <br />
               continents, I think these resolutions must be en- 
               <br />
               titled to much respect; and therefore I cannot 
               <br />
               go to the length that some people do in respect 
               <br />
               to this scheme. Although delegates may be ap- 
               <br />
               pointed by the Provinces to discuss the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of Colonial Union in England, the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions must form the platform—the basis of that 
               <br />
               discussion. I would myself prefer a legislative 
               <br />
               Union of the Provinces, but I feel that it is im- 
               <br />
               practicable, in view of the fact that it is opposed 
               <br />
               by Lower Canada, with its large French popu- 
               <br />
               lation and peculiar laws and Institutions which 
               <br />
               they have retained since the time of \Volfe.— 
               <br />
               Their prejudices must be respected.and there 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> of inﬂuence in Lower Canada, that

               peculiar reasons for wishing to address the 
               <br />
               House in reply to the attacks made upon me. 
               <br />
               Some gentlemen have attempted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charge</span> me 
               <br />
               with inconsistency in connection with the 
               <br />
               question of a reference to the people at the

               <br />
               the fullacy of the statements that have been 
               <br />
               made in reference to I_ny course. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«_I</span> could 
               <br />
               justify my action, in this great crisrs of the

               aﬂ‘airs of British North America, in a way 
               <br />
               that would be a conclusive answer to the 
               <br />
               charge made against me. If the present crlsls 
               <br />
               was an ordinary one, I would be one of the 
               <br />
               last. men to consent that any great question 
               <br />
               should be decided without going to the people. 
               <br />
               hut Ifeel that to pursue such a course at the
