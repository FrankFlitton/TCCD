               Mr. Howe opens his second otter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">€;</span> saying 
               <br />
               “ my advice has not been taken”; we have taken 
               <br />
               the advice he gave us formerly as to a Union of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonies,</span> but how could his more recent 
               <br />
               advice be taken when it is well known that he 
               <br />
               is writing disloyal letters injurious to the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince. I say, sir, that we have seen enough of 
               <br />
               this gentleman to know that he has broken faith 
               <br />
               on every public question, and that everything he 
               <br />
               can say must be received with a large amount 
               <br />
               of doubt. When in days gone bye he advocated 
               <br />
               Union, did he ask for an appeal to the people? 
               <br />
               No, the Legislature was to decide the question, 
               <br />
               and yet he tells us it is unconstitutional to take 
               <br />
               such a course. That is the ition which this 
               <br />
               gentleman has aasumed. e declared some 
               <br />
               time ago that Halifax would not be safe without 
               <br />
               connection with Canada by rail; now he tells 
               <br />
               us that Canada is only a source of weakness. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">These</span> are inconsistencies which no man can 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reconcile.</span> Again he agreed that Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               should build <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three-and-arhalf</span> twelfths of the

               are now to get the Railway built for one-twelfth, 
               <br />
               and yet he comes out in opposition to the whole

               intended to buy the county. Their friends said

               <br />
               were largely in favour of it. They then resort- 
               <br />
               ed to every subterfuge to win the election. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               in favour of Mr. Hebb. The School Bill was 
               <br />
               the question that settled the election. I had 
               <br />
               not taken any part in the alfair, until I saw that 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Richmond had come down. 
               <br />
               I did not feel inclined to take any active part 
               <br />
               because we had no man up. There were two 
               <br />
               men actually on the same side. I preferred Mr. 
               <br />
               Zwicker, however, because he declared himself 
               <br />
               for Paoonsss; but on Nomination Day be de- 
               <br />
               clared against the School Bill and Confederation. 
               <br />
               He spoke, then, however, under excitement, and 
               <br />
               his card led us to believe he was not as likely to 
               <br />
               oppose all measures of improvement and progress 
               <br />
               as Mr. Hebb. He was, therefore, in some res— 
               <br />
               pects referable to the latter. We went into the 
               <br />
               towns ip of Chester where the question of Con- 
               <br />
               federation was raised and discussed. The day 
               <br />
               before Nomination Day we had a meeting in the 
               <br />
               town, which lasted till a very late hour. And 
               <br />
               what was the result at every polling place '! The 
               <br />
               friends of the Quebec scheme were two to one.
