               that the bill divided the Province into two halves

               ling the representation —on the contrary, it had

               been held that a material change in that respect 
               <br />
               was equivalent to the declaration that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> le

               <br />
               a Government which introduced a bill to change 
               <br />
