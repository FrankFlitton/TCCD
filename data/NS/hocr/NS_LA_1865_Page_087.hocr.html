               pose we were to enter on this year as we did 
               <br />
               the year which followed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854,</span> would we be far 
               <br />
               astray ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854</span> was a year of plethoric revenue; 
               <br />
               but it was followed by several successive 
               <br />
               years of declining trade and falling income. 
               <br />
               It would not be unreasonable to expect that 
               <br />
               the receipts from customs and excise in 1805 
               <br />
               would not much exceed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$800,000.</span> The revenue

               <br />
               ﬁgures of that year. Whether we collected 
               <br />
               more than that in the ensuing year or not, he 
               <br />
               was quite sure‘that we would not be justiﬁed

               in making our calculations on a larger scale 
               <br />
               for several years to come; and if that was 
               <br />
               true, we should be unable to meet the appro—

               there is the Pictou railway. This was estimated 
               <br />
               at ﬁrst to cost us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,600,000.</span> It was supposed 
               <br />
               to be forty miles, at £10,000. The government 
               <br />
               pass the bill before he, read is created. It is 
               <br />
               then measured; and orthwith ten miles or one- 
               <br />
               fourth of the whole is added to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">length</span> and 
               <br />
               cost. Then Mr. Fleming surveys the ground 
               <br />
               more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:weurately,</span> and ﬁnds it Will cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2}</span> mil-

               lion of dollars to build it, and somewhat more 
               <br />
               to build and equip it. He is told, however, 
               <br />
               that he must reduce his ﬁgures, and he does so, 
               <br />
               and now tells us we may have a road for two 
               <br />
               millions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vAnybody,</span> however, who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ltnewhow</span>

               immensely expenditures exceed estimates 
               <br />
               must be satisﬁed that if we get oft’l‘cr two an
