               <br />

               <br />
               lege it-had hitherto enjoyed, for Yarmouth had a 
               <br />
               population equal to two-thirds of the county, and 
               <br />
               the result would be that Yarmouth would return 
               <br />
               all the members. Nearly three-ﬁfths of the in- 
               <br />
               habitants of Argyle were Catholics, and they thus 
               <br />
               would be deprived of a voice in the representation.

               Resistance, however, appeared useless, and the 
               <br />
               opposition must submit; but he could tell the

               <br />
               perhaps when they least expected it. He believed 
               <br />
               the bill to be wrong in loto, and that the represen- 
               <br />
