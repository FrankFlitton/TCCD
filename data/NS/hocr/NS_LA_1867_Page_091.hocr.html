               p Mr. MILLER said that those who had ever 
               <br />
               visited Arichat would conf - ss that few towns in 
               <br />
               the Province stood in greater want of commis- 
               <br />
               sioners of streets. As arule, the streets were 
               <br />
               in a perfectly disgraceful condition, and conse- 
               <br />
               quently when he was recently in the town a 
               <br />
               number of the most inﬂuential <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resident-z</span> asked 
               <br />
               him to introduce just such a bill as was before 
               <br />
               the House. On looking over the petition just 
               <br />
               presented, he found that it was contemptibly 
               <br />
               signed as regards numbers. There were not 
               <br />
               more than half a dozen names to this petition to 
               <br />
               whom he felt disposed to pay any regard. At 
               <br />
               any rate, it was not such a petition as would 
               <br />
               induce him to hesitate in the discharge of a pub— 
               <br />
               lic duty. He was conﬁdent, in fact he knew 
               <br />
               that the bill was desired by the very great ma- 
               <br />
               jority of the residents of Arichat. It was a mat- 
               <br />
               ter of notoriety that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tome</span> cases the statute 
               <br />
               labour money had been collected and pocketed, 
               <br />
               without having been expended on the streets <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”at—</span> 
               <br />
               all In consequence of this fact, and the shame-— 
               <br />
               ful condition of the streets, he had been induced 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a?”</span> in the bill before the House. The 
               <br />
               in ner in which the petition came before the 
               <br />
               House was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> evidence to him of the 
               <br />
               quarter whence it emanated. He believed it 
               <br />
               was not usual for any member to present a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peti—</span> 
               <br />
               tion from another cannty than his own without 
               <br />
               having, in the ﬁrst place, shown it to one of the 
               <br />
               representatives of that county.
