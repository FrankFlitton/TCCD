               I was amused last evening to hear the re-

               I hoped never to hear of the proposition. I

               doubt that the United States would be anxious

               times the comparison is necessary, and I wish 
               <br />
               to make one: I know that if you put on a horse

               <br />
               eyes become dim and his ears droop,—and 
               <br />
               what can you expect from human beings if 
               <br />
               you force on them a measure which they dislike.

               can only say that I should not like to be one

               ing home, in order to make a division procured 
               <br />
               apair of scales;—the monkey was careful to 
               <br />
               cut one piece larger than the other, and when 
               <br />
               it did not weigh evenly he got permission to 
               <br />
               taste, and so went on cutting and tasting until 
               <br />
               the cheese had nearly disappeared, and when 
               <br />
               the cat remonstrated she was threatened with 
               <br />
               a hiding. 
               <br />

               That is pretty much the position of our af— 
               <br />
               fairs; we are the small Colonies, and if We 
               <br />
               complain, Canada will threaten to chastise us. 
               <br />
               It would seem that no one can speak upon 
               <br />
               this question without referring to Mr. Howe; 
               <br />
               but supposing that gentleman did at one time 
               <br />
               speak of union. It is too much the practice for 
               <br />
               men to stick to the principle they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avowi</span> 
               <br />
               ed, whether right or wrong; and the man Who 
               <br />
               acknowledges an error is entitled to credit.

               As is well known, I am not much ofa speaker, 
               <br />
               and will not therefore long detain the house. I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> understand how any set of gentlemen 
               <br />
               dare to impose such a measure upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> coun- 
               <br />
               try, against the wishes of the people. If the 
               <br />
               people are favorable to it. why be afraid to 
               <br />
               come out among them and abide the cause- 
               <br />
               quences? For my part, I will stand by the 
               <br />
               people, and if I fall, I will fall by them.
