               this question. And sometimes we put the

               query to ourselves, whether he should be re- 
               <br />

               that hon. gentleman, on a question of such

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> large importance as this, has ill discharged his 
               <br />
               duty to the'gentlemen with whom he has long 
               <br />
               been associated, when he ignored the functions 
               <br />
               of the party that introduced responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cov-</span> 
               <br />
               ernment into _this country, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ventured</span> to 
               <br />
               agree in Canada to adopt a scheme without 
               <br />
               reference to the people—contrary, as I believe, 
               <br />
               to the principles under which our government 
               <br />
               is formed. That hon. gentleman stated no 
               <br />
               opinion had been expressed against Union. 
               <br />
               But it must not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supposed</span> in this case that 
               <br />
               silence gives consent. f the uestion of im- 
               <br />
               mediate union with Canada had een submitted 
               <br />
               to the house last winter, I believe it would not 
               <br />
               have been entertained at all. The sentiment 
               <br />
               of this country has not come up to union with 
               <br />
               Canada. It is true we have had delegates from 
               <br />
               time to time, and eminent leadin men have 
               <br />
               proceeded to Canada and Englan authorized 
               <br />
               to discuss the question in connexion with other 
               <br />
               matters, but you never had any measure sub- 
               <br />
               mitted. You never had the question of federal 
               <br />
               union. Union in any form never was brought 
               <br />
               up in a practical shape. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But,</span> says the learned 
               <br />
               gentleman, the public opinion of England, 
               <br />
               previous to 1857, was opposed to a union of 
               <br />
               these colonies. So it was. There was a party 
               <br />
               in England at that time who thought if these 
               <br />
               colonies were united they would become pow- 
               <br />
               erful and antagonistic to the mother—country. 
               <br />
               I admit a different feeling has come over the 
               <br />
               British people in that respect. But let us look 
               <br />
               at the motive. England is governed large] by 
               <br />
               the mercantile interests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span> and the men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of;</span> the 
               <br />
               Manchester school looking at the enormous 
               <br />
               taxes imposed by Canada upon British manu— 
               <br />
               factures and that in 1862 a proposition to grant 
               <br />
               a consi erable sum of money towards the 
               <br />
               maintenance of the militia was thrown out, 
               <br />
               naturally look favorably upon a confederation 
               <br />
               or any scheme which, in their opinion, would 
               <br />
               not only have the effect of reducing the duties
