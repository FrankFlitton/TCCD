               eighteen for it.: and he believed that if they 
               <br />
               were not inﬂuenced by pressure since brought 
               <br />
               to bear, the majority would be the other way. 
               <br />
               IIe denied that the bill of last year had been a 
               <br />
               suoeess in the country. Even admitting that in 
               <br />
               some pepulous districts it had met with support, 
               <br />
               that was no answer to the fact that the large 
               <br />
               majority of districts lying outside of these were 
               <br />
               deprived of the means of education altogether. 
               <br />
               He disclaimcd all idea in opposing this bill, of 
               <br />
               wishing to embarrass the government. If it 
               <br />
               had that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> they had brought it on their 
               <br />
               own heads. He opposed it because he knew 
               <br />
               it to be obnoxious to his constituents. If it was 
               <br />
               a good bill, he called upon the government to 
               <br />
               appeal to the people and allow them to pass 
               <br />
               their judgment upon it' but he did not think 
               <br />
               that ever they believed that it was in accor— 
               <br />
               dance with the wishes of the people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> e call-

               Opinions upon this question, according to their 
               <br />
               own convictions and what they knew was the 
               <br />
               feeling of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> country. He did not think that 
               <br />
               it was the duty of any gentlemen, however 
               <br />
               much they might desire to sustain the govern- 
               <br />

               the people.
