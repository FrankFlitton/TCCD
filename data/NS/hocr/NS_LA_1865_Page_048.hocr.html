               one of the grandest schemes ever offered to a

               pose of this meeting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight?</span> Emdentl to 
               <br />
               mislead the people o England as to. the eel- 
               <br />
               ing of this country on the sub ect of Confede- 
               <br />
               ration. The steamer that ta es these dele- 
               <br />
               gates home will also carry the account of this 
               <br />
               demonstration, and the impression which 
               <br />
               would naturally be conveyed would be that it 
               <br />
               reﬂected the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings</span> of the whole Province. 
               <br />
               This he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denied</span> most emphatically; and he 
               <br />
               thought it was the duty of every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> 
               <br />
               opposed to the measure thus publicly to de- 
               <br />
               nounce so unfair an attempt to produce a wrong 
               <br />
               impression. As re ards the opinions of Gen. 
               <br />
               Williams, he woul say that they all res ted 
               <br />
               him; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lt”</span> must be remembered that alt on h 
               <br />
               a N ova Scotian by birth, he was thorough y 
               <br />
               English in all his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ideas,</span> and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought</span> upon 
               <br />
               this subject as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all‘Enghshmen</span> did.

               Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SHANNON</span> was surprised at the re- 
               <br />
               marks that had been made, and he could not 
               <br />
               understand what reference this demonstration . 
               <br />
               had to the Legislature, or how it could be con- 
               <br />
               strued into an insult upon the people’s repre- 
               <br />
               sentatiVes. That time last year there was a de- 
               <br />
               monstration‘of another character, in honor of 
               <br />
               Shakspeare, and the house adjourned to hear 
               <br />
               the oration that was then delivered-hut this 
               <br />
               demonstration would not interfere <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the 
               <br />
               public duties of any hon. gentleman. It was to
