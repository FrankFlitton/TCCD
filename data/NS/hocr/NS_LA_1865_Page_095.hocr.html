               to the impropriety of the course pursued by

               ness of the house was done in that way. On 
               <br />
               the subject of railway extension, he would say 
               <br />

               had been proposed by itself, whether it would 
               <br />

               <br />

               out injury to other important services. 
               <br />
               But there certainly could be no doubt that the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances of this province would not admit of 
               <br />

               the public convenience. With regard to the 
               <br />
               Annapolis line he could only look up it as an 
               <br />
               accomodation to one or two counties at the ex- 
               <br />

               <br />

               He thought that if there was no other reason 
               <br />
               for opposition if the Finl. Secy. was obliged to 
               <br />
               admit that he could not expect to meet this

               gentlemen in regard to it. The hon. member

               concluded by referring to the haste with which

               <br />
               were asked with scarcely any discussion on

               <br />

               have to pay on the completion of the Pictou
