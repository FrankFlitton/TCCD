               ege of choosing the subject upon which I would 
               <br />
               address them. I took that occasion to proclaim

               not only to the people of my own province

               <br />
               what was the first thing that met me ? Some

               might make me a little giddy, immediately

               they were borrowed from my political

               of this great scheme of Union. I felt

               <br />
               of the country, to promote the consummation of 
               <br />
               this great scheme. I came back to this city.

               plishment of this great project. I went up, then, 
               <br />
               into the neighbouring counties of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rants.</span> and 
               <br />
               Kings, and Colchester. and there proclaimed
