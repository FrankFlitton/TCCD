               give much attention to the debate, but I will now

               urged against a certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure</span> by the Go-

               vernment He was a member of the Committee 
               <br />
               on Public Accounts, and, in connection with his

               his duty to the other members of the Committee, 
               <br />

               having complaints to make, he 'did not bring

               Now itlmust be borne in mind that though the 
               <br />
               contract is dated lst April, 1865, yet up to the 
               <br />
               year terminating 30th Sepr , we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> used only 
               <br />
               2000 cords from Mr. Hyde, and yet the average

               that the wood furnished by Mr. Hyde will be. 
               <br />
               worth ten per cent more than that furnished here-

               <br />
               if it is to be worth ten per cent more, then its cost 
               <br />
               would only amount to $2 00. .

               wood by the department was 4,150 cords; the con-
