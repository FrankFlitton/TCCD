               this great scheme which I was advocating was 
               <br />
               received as an open question, upon which ali 
               <br />
               political parties could co-operate. After I had 
               <br />
               thus re-opened this question, the leader of the 
               <br />
               government to which I was opposed, recommit— 
               <br />
               ted himself to the principles of British Colonial 
               <br />
               Union, by moving a series of resolutions on the 
               <br />
               subject. These resolutions originating with the 
               <br />
               government, of which he was the leader, broad- 
               <br />
               ly stated that so manifold and so great were the 
               <br />
               advantages that would result from union, that 
               <br />
               the government asked for power from this 
               <br />
               House to have a conference for the purpose of 
               <br />
               taking it up and placing it in a position so that 
               <br />
               it might receive the solemn ratiﬁcation of the 
               <br />
               Legislature of this country. Consistent with 
               <br />
               the views I had always entertained, I gave my 
               <br />
               earnest cc-operation to the government on this 
               <br />
               question, and a similar course <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> pursued by 
               <br />
               every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative</span> sitting on the benches with 
               <br />
               me. The Lieutenant Governor was requested 
               <br />
               to appeal to the British Parliament on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. Mr. Howe having received the authority 
               <br />
               from the Imperial Government immediately, 
               <br />
               under his own hand, urged upon Canada and 
               <br />
               the other British North American Colonies the 
               <br />
               importance of dealing with the question. In a 
               <br />
               statesmanlike spirit he pointed out to them that 
               <br />
               there was only one mode in which this question 
               <br />
               could be dealt with—that the only true consti- 
               <br />
               tutional course was not to refer it to the 
               <br />
               people at the polls, but to the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture. I challenge the gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site, instead of indulging in mere empty de- 
               <br />
               clamation addressed not to members inside this 
               <br />
               House but to uninformed persons outside—to 
               <br />
               point out a single authority here or elsewhere, 
               <br />
               in this province or in the mother country whence 
               <br />
               we obtained our system of government, that has 
               <br />
               ever propounded such a principle as the resolu- 
               <br />
               tion lays down ; and when they are able to do 
               <br />
               so, I shall be prepared to extend to this 
               <br />
               amendment an amount of consideration that 
               <br />
               I feel now it is not entitled to. In Mr. Howe’s 
               <br />
               letter, under his own hand, he says there is only 
               <br />
               one way of dealing with the matter—that there 
               <br />
               should be a conference of the different pro- 
               <br />
               vinces to arrange a scheme of Union—but there 
               <br />
               is not one word said about submitting the ques- 
               <br />
               tion to the people. but on the contrary, he propos- 
               <br />
               ed that it should be disposed of by the legislature. 
               <br />
               Mr. Howe, sustained by all his colleagues in 
               <br />
               the government, claimed for the Legislature of 
               <br />
               this country the right of dealing with this ques- 
               <br />
               tion—a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ptänoiple</span> which the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Yarmouth has himself just acknowledged as the 
               <br />
               correct one, though it conﬂicts with the position 
               <br />
               he has taken in ascending the present amend- 
               <br />
               ment. That hon. gentleman said that he was 
               <br />
               imbued witha love for British principles. He 
               <br />
               was one of the earliest and strongest advocates 
               <br />
               ot‘ colonial responibility, and true to his prin- 
               <br />
               ciples what has he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> told you? “The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represents</span> the people.” That is the 
               <br />
               reason when Mr. Young led that side of the 
               <br />
               House—when er. Howe led the government 
               <br />
               of the Liberal party,—when Mr. Johnston, on

               ed the responsibility of the Ministry to the

               <br />

               potic France, where the universal popular fran-

               <br />
               the most iron despotism that ever existed. All

               try is the place where this question should be 
               <br />
               discussed and decided. But that is not all. The 
               <br />
               Duke of Newcastle was appealed to, and what 
               <br />
               did he reply ? You have only to go to the jour-

               nals and you will ﬁnd him endorsing the same 
               <br />
               principles. Mr. Cardwell was subsequently ap-

               pealed to, and you'see that gentleman himself
