               Sir. there is something in this language that 
               <br />
               should arrest the attention of every man not 
               <br />

               What is the meaning of this “ agitation” w th 
               <br />
               which we are threatened? Is the repeal of the 
               <br />
               Reciprocity Treaty merely the initiation of a 
               <br />
               systematic design to undermine our allegiance 
               <br />
               and annex us? Have the Government of the 
               <br />
               United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> their agents in this country for 
               <br />
               this purpose, as insinuated by the Herald ? If 
               <br />
               they have, it. will not‘ long remain a secret, for 
               <br />
               the hour of action is at hand,!when we all must 
               <br />
               be judged by the sympathies we avow, and the 
               <br />
               compan we keep. I am aware that no man 
               <br />
               would are openly advocate annexation, but 
               <br />
               if there be any among us who desire it, they 
               <br />
               will take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> more safe and insidious means 
               <br />
               of attaining their end by exciting disaﬁ'ection 
               <br />
               ou any pretext that will offer itself. The lan~ 
               <br />
               gangs of the Herald aﬂ'ords reasonable grounds 
               <br />
               for watchfulness, and it is only right that the 
               <br />
               country should be on its guard. -
