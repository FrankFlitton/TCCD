               and I was not fully determined as to whether 
               <br />
               I should support or oppose Union. .In the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place I found on reading attentively that the 
               <br />
               opinions of the most intelligent men in Eng-‘ 
               <br />
               land were favourable to Confederation; then I 
               <br />
               saw that the organs of the various religious 
               <br />
               (lenominations were likewise favorable, and 
               <br />
               that the poposition had received the support 
               <br />
               of thelcading men of every political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">creed.—</span> 
               <br />
               Everywhere evidence was to be found that the 
               <br />
               wish of the Imperial Government was to see 
               <br />
               Union consummated; then came the Fenian 
               <br />
               excitement, and the abrogation of the Recipro- 
               <br />
               ty Treaty; and, at length, when our own terri- 
               <br />
               tory was menaced, I felt that the moment had 
               <br />
               arrived when a. true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> patriotic lovor of his 
               <br />
               countrv should decide. I then came to the re— 
               <br />
               solution that I should support Confederation, 
               <br />
               in order that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be prepared to meet the. 
               <br />
               emergencies which were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approaching.</span> I gave 
               <br />
               the proposition my support, however, with the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understanding</span> that the Quebec scheme should 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undergo</span> modiﬁcation, and I am pleased to ob- 
               <br />
               serve that there is a great improvement in the 
               <br />
               Bill, which is likely to become the law of the 
               <br />
               land. The Quebec Scheme gave us 1011mm- 
               <br />

               <br />

               proportion to our population than Canada, 
               <br />
