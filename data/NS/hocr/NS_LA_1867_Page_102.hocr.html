               that gentleman’s associates have proclaimed 
               <br />
               that instead of seeking an onward course for 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia their only motto is obstruction. 
               <br />
               ‘l‘he hon. gentleman’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sentiments</span> having been 
               <br />
               thus repudiated, he must come out from the 
               <br />
               company of his associates or must. take the res- 
               <br />
               ponsibility of standing in the company <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">otwmen</span> 
               <br />
               whose only aim is to impede the country’s pro- 
               <br />
               gress. Am I not right, then, in saying that 
               <br />
               under certain circumstances there is a possibility 
               <br />
               of the railway stopping at our borders? But I 
               <br />
               believe that when the true position of these 
               <br />
               gentlemen is placed before the intelligent con- 
               <br />
               stituencies of the country; when they are called 
               <br />
               upon to choose between the friends of union 
               <br />
               who will be prepared to combine in making the 
               <br />
               union as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely</span> beneﬁcial to the.oountry as 
               <br />
               possible and their opponents who are Opposed 
               <br />
               to everything like progress, there is not a con- 
               <br />
               stituency but will turn their backs with con. 
               <br />
               tempt upon the men who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> unable to carry 
               <br />
               out their individual opinions are prepared to 
               <br />
               trample underfoot the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperity</span> of the coun— 
               <br />
               try. The men who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crossed</span> the water as the 
               <br />
               people’s delegates, the hen. member knows 
               <br />
               have defamed and liheiled the fair credit of the 
               <br />
               country, giving the lie to all their past lives, 
               <br />
               and stating that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway</span> which they had 
               <br />
               held out as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">highest</span> boon would not pay 
               <br />
               grease for its engines, and were compelled to 
               <br />
               admit that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">urged</span> the British Government 
               <br />
               to spend their money in iron-clads and every— 
               <br />
               thing but in giving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t.)</span> the Province that position 
               <br />
               which God and nature intended she should oo- 
               <br />
               cnpy. And in what position are these gentle-

               men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day?</span> Is it the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> of myself and 
               <br />
               my colleagues who having fought the battle 
               <br />
               through and accomplished the great union, are 
               <br />
               prepared to commit their fame and future for-
