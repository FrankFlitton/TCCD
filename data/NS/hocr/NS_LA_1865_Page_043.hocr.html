               Mr. ANNAND—I know that in the Financial 
               <br />
               Secretary’s county the manufacture of iron was 
               <br />
               attempted by his friend, Mr. Davis, and it failed. 
               <br />
               He found he could import the pig iron from Scot- 
               <br />
               land more cheaply than he could manufacture the 
               <br />
               inferior iron ore in the neighborhood of the 
               <br />
               Albion Mines. Although they have no coal in 
               <br />
               Canada, yet at the present day coal can be ob- 
               <br />
               tained at a cheaper rate in Montreal than in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ha,-</span>

               <br />
               may be established at Sydney, where there are 
               <br />
               large deposits of coal; but I fear, the period is yet 
               <br />
               far cﬂ'. But if you think you can compete with the

               manufactures of Canada, who have so much the

               <br />
               trade now just as well as under Confederation. 
               <br />
               All that the Government has to do, is to introduce 
               <br />
               a resolution for a Conference at Quebec, and I

               pay under the former arrangement. One <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> rea- 
               <br />
               son why I have a strong feeling against this 
               <br />
               Union with Canada is, because I have no faith- 
               <br />
               in Canadian statesmen. I remember the way 
               <br />
               we were treated with respect to the Interco— 
               <br />
               lonial Railway—how the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment agreed to the scheme, and put it in the 
               <br />
               form of a treaty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engagement—how</span> they went 
               <br />
               to England and. violated the promises they 
               <br />
               made to the delegates from the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces—how they attempted to persuade the 
               <br />
               British government to look upon their share In 
               <br />
               the cost of the Intercolonial Railway asa con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tribution—towards</span> local defences. Mr. Glad— 
               <br />
               stone made every effort he could to meet their 
               <br />
               views in reference to the sinking fund— roun- 
               <br />
               sing to invest the amount, if they wishe lt, m 
               <br />
               their own securities; but even then the refused 
               <br />
               te ratify the solemn agreement which ad been 
               <br />
               made between the Provinces in 1862. We are 
               <br />
               told that this Railroad isto be procured only 
               <br />
               under Confederation. But let it be remember- 
               <br />
               ed that that work is far more necessary to 
               <br />
               Canada than to ourselves. We have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hved</span> 
               <br />
               and prespered without it, and we can contmue 
               <br />
               to do so; but its construction is to Canada a 
               <br />
               necessity. Some of their most eminent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men“</span> 
               <br />
               have said, they must have the Intercolomal 
               <br />
               Railway at any cost—they must either have 
               <br />
               a Federal Union or annexation to the States. 
               <br />
               Are they obliged tohave annexation with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> 
               <br />
               United States? Cannot they now enter into 
               <br />
               commercial relations with us? Cannot all of 
               <br />
               the advantages they desire be obtained with- 
               <br />
               out the political union intowhich it is attem t-
