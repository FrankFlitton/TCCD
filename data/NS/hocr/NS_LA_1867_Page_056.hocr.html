               aught than treat with contempt the- un- 
               <br />
               founded insinuations of the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               whose own openly avowed sentiments this 
               <br />
               evening have placed him in so unenviable 
               <br />
               a position. I feel that the question can be 
               <br />
               safely left to the patriotism and intelligence 
               <br />
               of this deliberative Assembly who have al- 
               <br />
               ways approached it in a spirit that proves 
               <br />
               themworthy of the free institutions they
