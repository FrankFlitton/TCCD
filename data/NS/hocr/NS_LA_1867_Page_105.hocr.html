               the selection of four merchants and a gentleman

               from the shore to represent the constituenCy of 
               <br />
               Halifax will be proved by the result to be a re- 
               <br />
               spectable and taking nomination. We have 
               <br />
               been told that the friends of Confederation will 
               <br />
               carry the county four to one. We were only 
               <br />
               afraid this morning that our candidates would 
               <br />
               have no opposition, and I am relieved to hear 
               <br />
               the hon. member for West Hatifar say that 
               <br />
               there will be opposition, and that the game is 
               <br />
               not up yet. I have a' strong desire to see that 
               <br />
               gentleman upon the hustings, and I sincerely 
               <br />
               ' regret that the Provincial Secretary has retired 
               <br />
               from the contest. for I should like to see him 
               <br />
               face the constituency of Halifax, where it has 
               <br />
               been said. that the Union sentiment prevailed 
               <br />
               more strongly than in any other place. The 
               <br />
               men who formerly supported Confederation in 
               <br />
               this city feel that they cannot rally to the sup- 
               <br />
               port of these gentlemen who have deprived 
               <br />
               them of the privileges of freemen. I was 
               <br />
               amused to hear him speak the other day as one 
               <br />
               of the sovereign people. What right has he to 
               <br />
               speak here in that capacity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span> The sovereign 
               <br />
               people have been denied the right to speak, and 
               <br />
               the measure of Union has been forced on them 
               <br />
               contrary to their well known sentiments. They 
               <br />
               were almost told in terms that they were not 
               <br />
               intelligent enough to decide the question, and 
               <br />
               are now appealed to by the very men who con- 
               <br />
               sidered them so besotted and ignorant that the 
               <br />
               measure should be passed over their heads.— 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman seemed surprised that the 
               <br />
               anti-Unionists shhuld aspire to a seat at Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa. They will go there as the Nova Scotian 
               <br />
               party, not to be mixed up with the politics of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chanda,</span> ' to commit themselves to the support 
               <br />
               of either party, or to identify themselves with 
               <br />
               Canadian factions, but to be there to watch over 
               <br />
               the interests of Nova Scotia and to throw them- 
               <br />
               selves into any scale in which they may secure 
               <br />
               the best advantages for their country. The 
               <br />
               House has been told that I shrank from 
               <br />
               oﬂering myself to a constituency ; it is well 
               <br />
               known that four years ago I decided upon 
               <br />
               the course which I have taken, and when I re- 
               <br />
               turned from England, and before I learned the 
               <br />
               result of the exertions of the delegates, I visit- 
               <br />
               ed my constituency and gave those who sup- 
               <br />
               ported me to understand, as I had previously 
               <br />
               given my family to understand, that it was not 
               <br />
               my intention again to offer. When asked if I 
               <br />
               would serve in the Dominion Parliament, I an- 
               <br />
               swered no. When asked if I would serve in the 
               <br />
               Local Parliament, I answered no, and when 
               <br />
               asked if I would continue in this House provi- 
               <br />
               ded no change were made, my answer was “no ; 
               <br />
               'I have had twenty-live years’ public service, 
               <br />
               and you had better select a younger man for the 
               <br />
               work.” When the Union measure passed, and 
               <br />
               the time came for consultation, I was pressed 
               <br />
               urgently to allow myself to be put in nomina- 
               <br />
               tion by leading Conservatives and Liberals. I 
               <br />
               still firmly refused. and will continue to do so

               leges of the country, its free government, its

               that the road will be built, ut if Canada alone
