               Hon. Pnov. SECY. said that he hoped that

               means by which the interests of the pu lic, as

               well as those of private individuals, would be 
               <br />
               equally protected. He was not prepared to

               say that sub-contractors might not occasional- 
               <br />

               <br />
               parties to remonstrate was when the Railway 
               <br />
               Act was being passed. The House should not‘ 
               <br />
               forget that an expenditure of $2,000,000 was 
               <br />
               now going on for a great public work, which, 
               <br />
               whilst of undoubted advantage to the whole 
               <br />
               Province, would especially beneﬁt Pictou, and 
               <br />
               largely increase the value of property within 
               <br />
               miles of the railway. Under such circumstan- 
               <br />
               ces he thought it strange to see persons object-

               ing to incur a small amount of inconvenience 
               <br />
               in connection with a work which was'to be of 
               <br />
               such signal advantage to them. He had no ob-

               jection to the introduction of the bill, though 
               <br />
               he would like to see how the public as well as 
               <br />
               private interests were to be at the same time 
               <br />
               protected. He had heard of parties who had 
               <br />
               combined to put a price of 60 cents upon rail’— 
               <br />

               <br />
               got the contracts. It was as well to understand 
               <br />
               whether those engaged in the construction of 
               <br />
