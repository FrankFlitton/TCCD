               gards the position of the city of Halifax, they

               which had never been carried out; and his ob- 
               <br />
               ject was to get a law that could be carriedout. 
               <br />
               This bill had been for sometime before the

               titions from the city against it? Not one. It 
               <br />
               was true that the City Council were now mov-' 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion is against the whole bill. If they had said

               they objected to the mode of appointment of 
               <br />

               <br />
               they went against the whole principle of assess- 
               <br />

               Luke’s had an admirable school ouse. If an

               arrangement could be made with them—not to

               hand over the school monies to the Dean and
