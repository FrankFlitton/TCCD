               self expressed opinions favorable to a Union. 
               <br />
               I have wished that the timewould come when 
               <br />
               we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> form a great nation. If a humble

               <br />
               or chan e’ of these views. A great stress has 
               <br />
               been lai upon the nationality that these Pro— 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁcant dependencies, they would form a nation 
               <br />
               that would :be respected abroad. I believe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               the formation of such a nation would lead to
