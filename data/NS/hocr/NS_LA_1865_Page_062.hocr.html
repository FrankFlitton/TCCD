               The city of London, with a population of- nearly

               <br />
               in question, she ought to have one-tenth of the 
               <br />
               whole number in Parliament. The reason why it 
               <br />
               is not c:~"'1111ed out, is the Parliament meets there, 
               <br />
               and that the inﬂuence given the city thereby, is 
               <br />
               suﬁicient for her. Un examination of a table pre-
