               ence of political grievances. Canada, wc are 
               <br />
               told again, is greatly in debt. It she has an 
               <br />
               amount of debt which is greater than that of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia at the present day, but not equal 
               <br />
               to that of New Brunswick in comparison with 
               <br />
               their respective populations, she has an amount 
               <br />
               of wealth to show for it that perhaps no other 
               <br />
               Province amongtlic whole can show. I think 
               <br />
               the debt of Canada is about $21.60 a head; in 
               <br />
               New Brunswick it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">32:.</span> Nova Scotia is get— 
               <br />
               ting fast on to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the;stage</span> that Canada has reached. 
               <br />
               The last estimate was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$16</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$17.</span> By the time 
               <br />
               all her public works are completed, she will have. 
               <br />
               as large a debt as Canada, but whether she will 
               <br />
               have as much to show for itas Canada is quite 
               <br />
               another question. With regard to thc product- 
               <br />
               ive wealth of Canada, there are no lcss than 
               <br />
               500,000 persons who cultivate the soil directly 
               <br />
               or indirectly There are 237,654 persons who 
               <br />
               own and occupy farms. The value of the farms 
               <br />
               is put down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at,$464,322,2l7</span> . The value of pro- 
               <br />
               ducts annually raised is no less than $100,000,000. 
               <br />
               She has 2000milcs of railway,216 miles of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">canals,</span> 
               <br />
               valued at $16,000,000. She has 40 collencs, with 
               <br />
               8,000 students; 8,000 Grammar and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Common</span>

               perfect system of education in the world. If 
               <br />
               this is a country that is dangerous to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unite</span> 
               <br />
               with, it appears to me that the gentlemen

               around these benches misunderstand the resour-
