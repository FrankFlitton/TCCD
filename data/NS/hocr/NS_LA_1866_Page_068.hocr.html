               The hon. member for East Halifax told us

               that the necessities of Canada forced them to

               was spoken of, and introduced by the gentle-

               thought of seriously in Canada. They had no 
               <br />
               necessities that forced them to a union with 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces. All that they had to 
               <br />

               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> is settled they have no important 
               <br />

               ly, it has been aided by the resolution that his
