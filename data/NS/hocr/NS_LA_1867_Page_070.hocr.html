               <br />

               from them the American ﬁshermen, unless

               we received from them such concessions as 
               <br />
               would be equivalent to the privileges they

               would obtain. He contended that the pre-

               ther from the disunion of the Provinces. As 
               <br />
               it was now, the voice of the Legislature 
               <br />
               was unable to influence Provinces which 
               <br />
               were not now bound to us by those social, 
               <br />
               political and commercial ties that would 
               <br />
               exist when British merica was one Confe- 
               <br />
               deracy, animated by a common sympathy 
               <br />
               and interest. When gentlemen who now 
               <br />
               so forcibly expressed their views in refer- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> it ought to have. The papers on the 
               <br />

               <br />

               disputable right of British America to enjoy 
               <br />
               them exclusively. So far as the policy of 
               <br />
               Canada went, it was to modify the proposal 
               <br />
               of the Imperial Government. The course 
               <br />
               pursued by the Government of this Province, 
               <br />

               <br />
               those two counties, whose population was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">excess</span> of that of the others. As 
               <br />
               respects the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> Council, it was pro- 
               <br />
               posed to ask the house to agree to a resolu- 
               <br />
               tion requesting the Crown to reduce the 
               <br />
               number of that body to 18 or 19 members: 
               <br />
               that is to say, one for every county, and 
               <br />
               one additional for the metropolitan county, 
               <br />
               if it should be deemed advisable. The 
               <br />
               House would see that henceforth the elec- 
               <br />
               tors of the Province would possess larger 
               <br />
               electoral powers than ever before. They 
               <br />
               would have to elect two members for the 
               <br />
               Local Legislature, and one for the General 
               <br />
               Parliament, except, of course, in Halifax 
               <br />
               and Pictou, to which additional members 
               <br />
               were given ; but in no case would the num- 
               <br />
               ber of votes given at the poll be less than

               three. He believed that the policy pt0p0°
