               gone to. But beforeI conclude, let me allude 
               <br />
               to another matter which was a disputed point 
               <br />
               between us. He questioned the accuracy of 
               <br />
               my memory as to the amount expended in con- 
               <br />
               nection with laying the corner stone of the Asy- 
               <br />
               lum. I gave the amount at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£300,butihe</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span> it 
               <br />
               was only £320. Now I must admit that I was 
               <br />
               wrong, and I cheerfully make the correction 
               <br />
               required. But how was I mistaken? Why, I 
               <br />
               understated the amount. I ﬁnd on referring 
               <br />
               to a speech of Mr. Ilowe,.that that gentleman 
               <br />
               givesit at £313 79. 10. I hope, therefore, the

               hon. member will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledge</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> my ver-

               would not pay grease for the wheels was the 
               <br />
               remark of an eminent engineer who had given 
               <br />
               the su‘njeC-t his attention,—and I must say that 
               <br />
               my faith in that road, as a means of through 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Fleming. After a very thorough examina- 
               <br />
               tion, that gentleman demonstrated that the 
               <br />
               railway would not be a paying concern, and he 
               <br />
               led us to believe that the terminus would be 
               <br />
               at St. John. But, as Mr. McLelan proved the 
               <br />
               other day, our revenues would have enabled 
               <br />
               us to build the road ourselves, and would aln-

               Mr. ANNAND continued :—I am not able to 
               <br />
               state the facts from_my own knowledge, but 
               <br />
               the general impression in the community to 
               <br />
               this day is that the assertions were true, and 
               <br />
               that being the case, it was the duty of the ress 
               <br />
               to represent the facts. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincial,</span> ocre— 
               <br />
               tary has said that we cannot expect to‘ get so 
               <br />
               large a sum hereafter for our roads and bridges, 
               <br />
               but let me ask why not? We have seen the 
               <br />
               revenueincrease in one year by $185,000, being 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$353,000</span> more than the interest on the Pictou 
               <br />
               railway, and if our customs revenue had not 
               <br />
               been taken away, and handed over to another 
               <br />
               country, we could have covered the country 
               <br />
               from end to end with roads. I would like to 
               <br />
               see the face of the Province covered with rail- 
               <br />
               ways; and as to the Annapolis road,’ I may say 
               <br />
               that I think that line should have been carried 
               <br />
               on by paying acompany a subsidy for twenty 
               <br />
               years, and then we would be done with the 
               <br />
               liability, and could have gone on with our ex- 
               <br />
               tensions. The subsidy would then have been 
               <br />
               returned to the treasury, to be re-employed in 
               <br />
               the construction of other railways and public 
               <br />
               works. Thus the country would have gone on 
               <br />
               and prospered, and blossomed as the rose. But
