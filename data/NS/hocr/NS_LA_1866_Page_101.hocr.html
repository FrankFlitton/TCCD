               <br />
               importance that I cannot allow the resolution 
               <br />
               to pass with a silent vote. There is no doubt 
               <br />
               that of all the momentous questions that have 
               <br />
               agitated this country, this is, beyond measure, 
               <br />
               the most important. The step we are about to 
               <br />
               take, in every probability, will affect for all 
               <br />
               time to come the destinies of our native Pro-

               <br />
               varsity, and therefore, demands grave and 
               <br />
               careful consideration. No one should assent 
               <br />
               to the measure unless assured that it is calcu- 
               <br />
               lated to promote our future safety and happi- 
               <br />
               uess. There is no doubt that a large majority 
               <br />
               of the reﬂecting men throughout British Ame- 
               <br />
               rica, as well as in Britain herself, viewing the 
               <br />
               condition of aﬁ‘airs on this continent, have 
               <br />
               come to the conclusion that the time has ar- 
               <br />
               rived when these valuable provinces can no 
               <br />
               longer continue in their present disconnected

               for protection in our time of need, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unmistake-</span> 
               <br />
               ably points to a similar conclusion. If we

               desire to ensure a continuance of that protec-

               the matter we may entertain, the parties from 
               <br />

               tection can be best provided, and our safety

               united under one common head. With the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial features of the' case I will not at- 
               <br />
               tempt to deal as it has been viewed in all its 
               <br />
               aspects, by gentlemen who have given to this 
               <br />
               branch of the subjectmuch care and research. 
               <br />
               It was fully gone into during the debate of last 
               <br />
               session, and even under the Quebec scheme, I 
               <br />
               have been unable to discover where the in- 
               <br />
               tercsts of the province are not fairly guarded. 
               <br />
               I cannot however, say, that I was ever a de- 
               <br />
               fender of the entire scheme of Union agreed 
               <br />
               upon. Its basis undoubtedly is sound and the 
               <br />
               measure was prepared as far as possible to 
               <br />
               guard the interests of the weaker provinces. 
               <br />
               But where the independent judgments of a

               number of gentlemen with different interests
