               my ﬁrst appearance in this Legislature up to

               the present time, I have been favorable to an 
               <br />
               union of these Provinces. Lam chargeable 
               <br />
               with no sudden conversion to that opinion— 
               <br />
               nay, more, I am chargeable with no inconsist- 
               <br />
               ency in regard to it. Every one who under- 
               <br />
               stands the diﬁ‘erence between the principle of 
               <br />

               in supporting the principle of any scheme a 
               <br />
               party does not commit himself to its details. 
               <br />
               The absurdity of any other assumption is too

               does not follow that we oppose its principle. I 
               <br />

               more ﬁrmly convinced at the present moment 
               <br />
               than ever, of the desirability of an Union of

               <br />
               every British American who is not insensible 
               <br />
               to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10%ic</span> of events, should desire an Union

               <br />
               that the whole aspect of things around us have 
               <br />
               been changed within one short year. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neighboring</span> republic, twelve months ago, was 
               <br />

               prestige will not diminish the characteristic 
               <br />
               arrogance of her international policy. It will 
               <br />
               certainly not lessen her disposition to oñ‘en- 
               <br />
               siveness in her intercourse with foreign na- 
               <br />
               tions, as it has increased her necessities; it will 
               <br />
               not lessen her desire to aggrandize herself at 
               <br />
               the expense of her neighbors. We have 
               <br />
               grounds of apprehension in this respect pecu—

               <br />
               in America has created a feeling of animosity

               <br />
               Britain and these colonies. I need not specify 
               <br />
               these assumed grievances; they are familiar 
               <br />
               to every one. They may culminate at no dis-
