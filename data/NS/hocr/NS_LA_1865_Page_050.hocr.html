               nity of testing the feelings of the country al- 
               <br />
               ready. He went up into the County of Hauts,

               and at a large public meeting held in the town 
               <br />
               of Windsor, lad conclusive proof that the 
               <br />
               sentiment there, at all events, was in favor of 
               <br />
               the scheme. Again, at a meeting held at 
               <br />
               Kentville-—one that was calfed by the oppo- 
               <br />
               nents of Confederation, in a County where the 
               <br />
               most deceptive and fallacious statements had 
               <br />
               been promulgated—after a lengthy discussion, 
               <br />
               a resolution to defer the consideration of the 
               <br />
               question was voted down at the close. Again, 
               <br />
               he had delivered a lecture. on the subject in

               strations given were of the most satisfactory 
               <br />
               character. Then he had attended a meeting in

               Colchester, and he would ask gentlemen op—

               ——from Mill Village to Cornwallis—and found

               the public sentiment, not only of one, but of 
               <br />
               both political parties, in favor of the scheme. 
               <br />
               Then he went into Annapolis, and attended a 
               <br />
               meeting called at Bridgetown by the oppo-

               stand alone there, but was supported by some 
               <br />

               Over in New Brunswick the opponents of
