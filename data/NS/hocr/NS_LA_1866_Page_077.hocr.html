               Queen of these realms, one whom, by virtue

               of her position no less than by the virtues that

               nations attest her worth and admire her exam-

               decorum to mention that name here. Disloy-

               <br />
               as one I repel it With indignation. It is not in 
               <br />
               my nature, as it is not in my name, to harbour 
               <br />
               for an instant a disloyal sentiment. I can 
               <br />
               proudly appeal to the history of our country 
               <br />
               and ask if any who have borne the name 
               <br />
               which I have the honour to bear, could ever 
               <br />
               be supposed to be tainted with that vile 
               <br />
               trait? Sir, as a British subject, entitled to 
               <br />
               the free exercise of an undoubted right, I 
               <br />
               intend to deal with this question, and if, 
               <br />
               in doing so, any aspersion touching my loy- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> to my Sovereign be cast upon me, I 
               <br />
               shall hurl it back with utter contempt and tho- 
               <br />
               rough indignation upon its author. Sir, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret,</span> 
               <br />
               deeply that Her Majesty’s name has been 
               <br />
               brought into this discussion; I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> 
               <br />
               it as of so much consequence that Her Minis- 
               <br />
               ters have been mentioned, because it is at all 
               <br />
               times the privilege and indeed the duty of 
               <br />
               every subject to cri'icise their acts. We have 
               <br />
               been told too that the Queen’s representative 
               <br />
               in this country was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of the present

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iiieiisure;—sir,1</span> attach the same importance 
               <br />
               and distinction to the representative of the 
               <br />
               crown as to the crown itself; it is Her Majesty 
               <br />
               speaking by her properly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authorized</span> agent, 
               <br />
               and the rules which apply to the exclusion of 
               <br />
               the Queen’s name from debates in Parliament 
               <br />
               should apply equally to the exclusion of the 
               <br />
               Lieut. Governor’s name. We have been also 
               <br />
               told that the General in command and other 
               <br />
               distinguished individuals, civil, religious and 
               <br />
               military, are combined in favor of the measure. 
               <br />
               But, sir, notwithstanding all this potential 
               <br />
               phalanx that is arrayed in its favor-I feel that I 
               <br />
               am a free man, I claim the rights and attributes 
               <br />
               of a free man, speaking in the presence ofa 
               <br />
               British free Assembly, I have the right to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">criticise</span> the judgment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> formed 
               <br />
               and an equal right to give expression 
               <br />
               to my own. Therefore when this list 
               <br />
               of authorities is paraded before us I can- 
               <br />
               not hut feel that it is an empty parade—- 
               <br />
               it is worth nothing in my estimation --it does not 
               <br />
               weigh a. tittle in the scale. I feel, sir, and I 
               <br />
               claim the right to express the sentiment, that 
               <br />
               those individuals, eminent though they be, are 
               <br />
               not more capable of forming an opinion upon 
               <br />
               this subject than myself, and I might add that 
               <br />
               …y judgment is formed under the inﬂuence of 
               <br />
               a responsibility which does not attach to them. 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying</span> this I mean no disres ect to any of 
               <br />
               their), and I feel well assure that none of 
               <br />
               them would charge me With any design ofdis- 
               <br />
               respect. I therefore think that the allusions 
               <br />
               to which I have referred were unjust and re- 
               <br />
               prehensible attempts to inﬂuence this Assem- 
               <br />
               blv. What is the measure that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> now

               called upon to sanction? TWist it or turn it 
               <br />
               as you please, it is no less than a decided 
               <br />
               change in our constitution; and how has the

               <br />
               sir. This house was elected entirely independ- 
               <br />
               ent 01' that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question—</span> it was not before the peo—

               ple when We were elected. Had the case been 
               <br />
               otherwise we should not perhaps have seen 
               <br />

               <br />
               here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> It seems, however, that a good 
               <br />
               many years ago the uestion of a. Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r</span> orth American Colonies 
               <br />
               was propounded in this house:-—I would ask 
               <br />
               those who were present at that time whether 
               <br />
               it was intended to he a practical measure—a 
               <br />
               proposition to result in anything, or was it a 
               <br />
               more theoretical declaration of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abstract</span> ad- 
               <br />
               vantages of union? No one can presume to 
               <br />
               say that it was anything more than the latter. 
               <br />
               Again, some years ago this house, by a pretty 
               <br />
               large majority, declared it expedient that a. de— 
               <br />
               legation should proceed to England to confer 
               <br />
               with delegates from the neighbouring Provin- 
               <br />
               ces to ascertain whether it was not desirable 
               <br />
               and practicable to effect a union between the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces of British North America. 
               <br />
               But, sir, that was a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> idea from 
               <br />
               that now pressed upon our attention. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“That</span> 
               <br />
               is the condition of these Maritime Provinces? 
               <br />
               Their people are situated in connection with 
               <br />
               each other-are possessed of the same inter- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ests,</span> have the same common sympathies, resi- 
               <br />
               ding on each other’s borders, and having daily 
               <br />
               intercourse with each other. Is that the cha- 
               <br />
               racter of the people with whom this scheme is 
               <br />
               to force us to unite? Why, as we know, there 
               <br />
               is a wilderness between the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               and Canada, we have no sympathies or inter- 
               <br />
               ests in common with the people of that coun- 
               <br />
               try. They are as much strangers to us as the 
               <br />
               people of West Indies. Surely those gentlemen 
               <br />
               who talk so vociferousl y about disloyalty can 
               <br />
               have no sympathy with the people of a Colony 
               <br />
               in which disloyalty has been so rife as it has 
               <br />
               been in Canada. This House proposed a dele- 
               <br />
               gation for a union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> a people with whom, 
               <br />
               as I have said, we had many interests in com- 
               <br />
               mon, and who, if the union were consummated, 
               <br />
               would form with us one homogeneous whole. 
               <br />
               What then happened? F <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1“</span> some reason or other 
               <br />
               those charged with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authority</span> to perform 
               <br />
               this duty which I have mentioned felt them- 
               <br />
               selves at liberty to disregard the authority of 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">F‘ouse.</span> They went to Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island and there they found another body of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gen'lemen</span> from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,—instead</span> of turning 
               <br />

               <br />
               this Legislature to concent to a. conference with 
               <br />
               delegates from that country they ignored our 
               <br />
               feelings and authority and went straight into 
               <br />
               the arms of the Canadains delegates. That 
               <br />
               was the ﬁrst step and it was a fatal step—a 
               <br />
