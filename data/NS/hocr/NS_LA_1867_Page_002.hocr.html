               tary at the end of the last ﬁnancial year, aft-er 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paying</span> all demands against the treasury,shews 
               <br />
               a large surplus. I must now refer to the ab- 
               <br />
               rogation of the reciprocity treaty and its cﬂ'ect 
               <br />
               upon our commercial prosperity. We all know 
               <br />
               that the country has felt that abrogation to a 
               <br />
               considerable extent, more especially in the 
               <br />
               high duties which have been imposed upon 
               <br />
               our principal exports. In relation to this sub- 
               <br />
               ject I may say that I am of opinion that bye- 
               <br />
               and-bye the old system will be revived, and in 
               <br />
               this view I am supported by many persons of 
               <br />
               experience. Since the abrogation of the treaty 
               <br />
               this country has prospered to a degree that 
               <br />
               was not at all anticipated, and there is one 
               <br />
               circumstance in connection with it to which 1 
               <br />
               would especially refer: namely, the mission to 
               <br />
               Brazil and the West Indies, the report on 
               <br />
               which is in our hands. That report contains 
               <br />
               valuable statistics showing new channels into, 
               <br />
               which our commerce can‘ proﬁtably be turned. 
               <br />
               In Upper Canada. alone there is a consumption 
               <br />
               of 200,000 or 300,000 tons of coal. Why cannot

               Then there is the other topic of the Paris 
               <br />
               Exhibition Commission. 1 was glad to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the commissioners had bestowed so much 
               <br />
               attention upon their duties, and believe that at 
               <br />
               the Exhibition we will appear to great advan- 
               <br />
               tage, taking a place second only to Canada 
               <br />
               among the .3. American colonies. Our column 
               <br />
               of coal and our specimens of gold would alone 
               <br />
               make us prominent in any exhibition. There 
               <br />
               is one circumstance in connection with this 
               <br />
               topic which rather puzzles me. I am curious 
               <br />
               to know why the commissioners selected 
               <br />
               Louisburg as a. place to be represented by a 
               <br />
               painting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> the exhibition. Was it to remind 
               <br />
               the French that there they had sustained a de- 
               <br />
               feat, or was it show the present nakedness 
               <br />
               and desolation of the old city? The contrast is 
               <br />
               great between the present and past condition 
               <br />
