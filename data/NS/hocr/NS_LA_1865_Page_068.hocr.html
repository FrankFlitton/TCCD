               But honourable gentlemen lay stress upon the point 
               <br />
               that, while the one enterprise is to be undertaken at

               <br />
               and the reason for it is simply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this—the</span> money has

               They must be well aware that the late Government 
               <br />
               (the Macdonald-Sicotte Administration) agreed to 
               <br />
               build the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intex—colonial</span> Railway, and obtained from 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government a guarantee of the deben- 
               <br />
               tures for building it—so that money is ready at a very 
               <br />
               low rate of interest, whenever required. We know 
               <br />

               must be gone onwith if this union isto be consummated.

               fend us. He does not, however, say that with an

               <br />
               Canada is our own. That may be, but I regard the 
               <br />
               safety of Nova Scotia as more essential to the 
               <br />
               maintenance of our connection with the British 
               <br />
               Empire than is that of any other of‘ the British 
               <br />
               Colonies. I answer, Nova Scotia. is the keystone 
               <br />
               to the whole—when she falls, the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow——</span> 
               <br />
               Great changes have taken place of late years in 
               <br />
               the character of the navies of the world. Steam 
               <br />
               has taken the place of wind as the motive power 
               <br />
               rendering the ships more eﬁ’ective but more de- 
               <br />
               pendent upon their base of supply. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               here the power—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coal—which</span> must be re.— 
               <br />
               gularly supplied to the British ﬂeet from our 
               <br />
               mines, in case of hostilities on this side the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ar—</span> 
               <br />
               lantic. And if this base of supply should fall into 
               <br />
               the hands of an enemy, then the whole navy of 
               <br />
               England would be powerless for the protection of 
               <br />
               these Colonies, and must'leavc them to their fate. 
               <br />
               How essential, then, is it that local inﬂuences in” 
               <br />
               Canada shall not have the power. to call away our
