               great measure such as this, especially tl… 
               <br />
               members ot'the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> of the country, 
               <br />
               should ever feel it incumbent upon them 
               <br />
               so to guard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> in this respect that 
               <br />
               no one here or elsewhere can possibly oh‘er 
               <br />
               an objection to the course they have pursued. 
               <br />
               And sir, I feel in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observing</span> on this portion ot 
               <br />
               the discussion, that I have reason to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charge</span> 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincial</span> Secretary with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span> im ort- 
               <br />
               ed into this debate matters which shoult ne— 
               <br />
               ver have been brought here. He has alluded 
               <br />
               to the press—that is a. branch of our constitu— 
               <br />
               tion, ifI may so term it, that ought not to be 
               <br />
               so frequently and so prominently referred to 
               <br />
               here. We know that on all sides and on all 
               <br />
               subjects <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">characters</span> are apt to speak 
               <br />
               and write <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strongly</span> and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> those extremes 
               <br />
               which cannot be justiﬁed in or out ot Parlia— 
               <br />
               ment. But in my View, it was unjust in him 
               <br />
               to attribute licentiousness to one portion of 
               <br />
               the press rather than to others, for on all sides 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd observations, criminations, and reori- 
               <br />
               minations, which render both liable to censure. 
               <br />
               The less that is said in this place about the 
               <br />
               press the better, and with this remark I shall 
               <br />
               dismiss all further allusions to that branch of 
               <br />
               the subject. Butthe Provincial Secretar was 
               <br />
               not coulent with references to the press, c in-

               <br />
               inﬂuences that should not have been referred 
               <br />
               to here. Least of all should he have brought 
               <br />
               here the name of that illustrious lady, the
