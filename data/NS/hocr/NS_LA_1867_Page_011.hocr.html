               <br />
               existence at the present moment. Well, it was only 
               <br />
               in April last that that Parliament came to a distinct 
               <br />
               resolution in favour of confederation—a resolution as 
               <br />
               distinotns words could express it. That resolution 
               <br />

               stances the colonial local authorities and legislatures
