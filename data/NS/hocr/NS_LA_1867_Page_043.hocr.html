               Since the house adjourned last year I have 
               <br />
               had an opportunity of visiting Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> I was 
               <br />
               at Ottawa when the Legislature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">waaopcncd.</span> 
               <br />
               and when the Fenian excitement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prévailed.</span> ] 
               <br />
               was also at Malone and along <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the;</span> line; but 
               <br />
               nothing gave me greater pleasure during my 
               <br />
               visit than the manner in which the Ottawa 
               <br />
               Parliament was opened. - I passed through 
               <br />
               Canada and leoked- upon its fertile“ ﬁelds, its 
               <br />
               vast resources, and its great commerce—its 
               <br />
               hardy and thrifty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population—its</span> noble cities 
               <br />
               replete with energy and enterprize. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               It is only requisite for any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one-:</span> to pass

               which we ought to be proud to term aelose

               <br />
               on my return I had the honor of meeting at

               Portland the Provincial Secretary and Mr. 
               <br />
               Archibald, and we had a very pleasant time 
               <br />
               as far as St. John, and then we went up to 
               <br />
               Fredericton, and whilst they were in com-

               little capital of the sister Province. I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de«_</span>
