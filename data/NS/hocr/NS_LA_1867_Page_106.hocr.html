               ends, I ask where was the provision in the bill 
               <br />
               that these gentlemen passed some years a o ? 
               <br />
               If they were so careful of the interestso the. 
               <br />
               countr , why did they not provide, in the mea-

               sure w ich they passed by a party vote, that 
               <br />
               the work should be commenced at Truro ? If 
               <br />
               they did not consider any such provision neces- 
               <br />
               sary, I ask with what face he can get up and 
               <br />
               complain of our not doing what they thought 
               <br />
               was unnecessary ? For all time to come, there~

               procuring a larger guarantee, we will bein a 
               <br />
               position to say—‘ Go to these gentlemen who 
               <br />
               professed to represent the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> and ask 
               <br />
               them.” If they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hadnot</span> been t ere, no com-

               Mr. MCLELAN.—The hon. gentleman has 
               <br />
               made this important admission—that the de- 
               <br />
               legates only asked for three millions, and he 
               <br />
               says that this was the sum asked for in 1862. 
               <br />
               In 1862 it was supposed that that sum would 
               <br />
               build the entire road, but recent surveys have 
               <br />
               demonstrated the impossibility of that, and 
               <br />
               there is therefore an important distinction be- 
               <br />
               tween the position of the delegates and their 
               <br />
               predecessors. In view of the fact that such a 
               <br />
               sum had been shown insufﬁcient, the delegates 
               <br />
               were in duty bound to have asked for a larger 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guaranty.</span> The terms which they secured 
               <br />
               were not so advantageous as the terms <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obtain</span> 
               <br />
               ed in 1862, for then we were allowed a breath
