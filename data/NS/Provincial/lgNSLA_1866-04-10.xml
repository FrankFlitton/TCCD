     [...] ed by an act relating to the Baddeck church 
     <lb/>
     property some years ago. There was some<lb break="no"/>thing in the face of the matter so insulting to 
     <lb/>
     the intelligence of the House that he felt it 
     <lb/>
     hardly right to ask members to listen to any 
     <lb/>
     arguments. The language used in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the Inspector of schools was strong but it 
     <lb/>
     was entirely justified by that officer's conduct. 
     <lb/>
     A fear had been previously expressed that the 
     <lb/>
     Inspectors instead of attending to their duties 
     <lb/>
     would be made the tools of the government 
     <lb/>
     and the conduct of this Inspector afforded a 
     <lb/>
     complete indication of the remark. The man 
     <lb/>
     who should of all others endeavour to recon<lb break="no"/>cile angry feelings was stirring up strife. 
     <lb/>
     issuing warrants against the clergy and 
     <lb/>
     making himself the tool of the member for 
     <lb/>
     Victoria. While he, Mr. Archibald, and his 
     <lb/>
     friends were giving assistance to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the school bill, this officer whose acts 
     <lb/>
     were a stain upon the man who recommended 
     <lb/>
     him and the government who would continue 
     <lb/>
     him a day in office, was using every effort to 
     <lb/>
     destroy its good effect. The very petition 
     <lb/>
     written by him showed him to be destitute of 
     <lb/>
     acquaintance with the principles of an English 
     <lb/>
     education, it contained blunders in every part 
     <lb/>
     of it, and this was the man who had charge of 
     <lb/>
     the education of the County of Victoria. After 
     <lb/>
     being appointed a Justice of the Peace, this in<lb break="no"/>dividual had issued a warrant against twenty- 
     <lb/>
     five persons for going into a church and listen<lb break="no"/>ing to a minister, and had fined them from $10 
     <lb/>
     to $20 each, although the prosecutor swore that 
     <lb/>
     no breach of the peace had been committed. 
     <lb/>
     In the Act relating to the Union, a clause had 
     <lb/>
     been inserted providing that no congregation 
     <lb/>
     deciding to remain separate, within three 
     <lb/>
     months after the passage of the law, should be 
     <lb/>
     embraced in the union. He would be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that the House should decide the matter on the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the member for Victoria, who ap<lb break="no"/>peared as the representative of a body that dis<lb break="no"/>owned him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>, said that the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature was in the habit of dealing fairly 
     <lb/>
     with the rights of every religious body. If the 
     <lb/>
     question was considered in the proper spirit, 
     <lb/>
     there need be no fear as to any injustice being 
     <lb/>
     done to any set of men. He regretted that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Colchester had not provided 
     <lb/>
     in the bill of 1862 for the security of private 
     <lb/>
     rights. He could tell that hon. gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     his own personal knowledge, that at the first 
     <lb/>
     circuit in Cape Breton after the act had passed, 
     <lb/>
     he was met by deputations of religious bodies 
     <lb/>
     asking what could be done to protect their 
     <lb/>
     property. By the time they got the requisite 
     <lb/>
     advice, they were unable to give the 30 days 
     <lb/>
     notice required by the act. The act operated 
     <lb/>
     before the people knew what to do. It was not 
     <lb/>
     right for the Legislature to hand over the 
     <lb/>
     private property of one person to another.â€” 
     <lb/>
     Justice should be done where a man had put 
     <lb/>
     his hand into his pocket and contributed to the 
     <lb/>
     erection of a church, manse, or other property, 
     <lb/>
     If a majority of the congregation retired to an<lb break="no"/>other church, he should be remunerated and 
     <lb/>
     protected as far as the property was concerned. 
     <lb/>He regretted that the matter had been brought 
     <lb/>up, but now that it was there it should be 
     <lb/>given a fair and equitable hearing to the 
     <lb/>claims of the petitioners. He held that the true 
     <lb/>principle was this:â€”â€”that if a number of persons 
     <lb/>went over and joined another church, they 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
           
     should not take away the property but leave 
     <lb/>it to those that remained,â€”who belonged to 
     <lb/>the Free Church. He believed that it was only 
     <lb/>the intention of of the promoters of the act of 
     <lb/>1862 to receive power to manage their own 
     <lb/>internal affairs, but not to legislate away the 
     <lb/>rights of others. One congregationâ€”that of 
     <lb/>Mr. Gunnâ€”had been excepted at the time from 
     <lb/>the provisions of the act. Here the principle 
     <lb/>was established that it was unconstitutional 
     <lb/>and unjust to legislate away the rights of the 
     <lb/>parties who might object to the union. If it 
     <lb/>was right in one case, it was equally right in 
     <lb/>all othersâ€”to reserve the rights of clergymen 
     <lb/>in other parts of the country. Some little al<lb break="no"/>lowance ought to be made for a person like the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Victoria, who had the proper<lb break="no"/>ty which he had helped to create legislated 
     <lb/>away. No person could accept such a state of 
     <lb/>things without remonstrance. He did not think, 
     <lb/>however, that the present bill could meet the 
     <lb/>difficulty, and he would therefore suggest that 
     <lb/>it be referred to a special committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH2">Mr. ARCHIBALD</persName> said that the Free Church 
     <lb/>
     had united with another religious body with 
     <lb/>
     which it agreed in doctrine. It was to all in<lb break="no"/>tents and purposes the same church it was be<lb break="no"/>fore; it had the same right to the property it 
     <lb/>
     owned previously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The discussion was adjourned.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Dr. TUPPER</persName> then rose and said:â€”The house 
     <lb/>
     will recollect that, a few days ago, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Richmond put a question to the 
     <lb/>
     Government, in relation to a very important 
     <lb/>
     subject, and on that occasion I stated that the 
     <lb/>
     situation in which we stood in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     Union of the Colonies would preclude me from 
     <lb/>
     giving him an immediate reply, until I had an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of placing myself in communica<lb break="no"/>tion with my colleagues in the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and with the other gentlemen who had assisted 
     <lb/>
     in maturing the Quebec scheme. I stated, 
     <lb/>
     however, to the hon. member and to the house, 
     <lb/>
     that in view of the great importance of the 
     <lb/>
     subject,â€”of the events which were daily tran<lb break="no"/>spiring in connection with the questionâ€”I 
     <lb/>
     would take the earliest opportunity of giving, 
     <lb/>
     in my place, the policy which the government 
     <lb/>
     and the friends of the Quebec scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation in this Legislature are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     take in relation to the matter. In order to re<lb break="no"/>deem the pledge and bring the attention of this 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Assembly to the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     the gravest and most important question that 
     <lb/>
     has ever been submitted to itâ€”after due deli<lb break="no"/>beration with my colleagues, and consultation 
     <lb/>
     with the gentlemen who were associated with 
     <lb/>
     us at the Quebec Conferenceâ€”I rise for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of giving to the house and country the 
     <lb/>
     fullest information as to the policy which we 
     <lb/>are prepared to assume in relation to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. I regret deeply that in approaching a

            <fw type="num">212</fw>
            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
            
               
     question of such gravityâ€”which demands that 
     <lb/>
     the members of the house should rise to to the 
     <lb/>
     great emergency, and look with a single eye 
     <lb/>
     to the interests of the country; only to that 
     <lb/>course that is calculated to promote the 
     <lb/>advancement of our common country, and per<lb break="no"/>petuate the great privileges which, as British 
     <lb/>subjects, we enjoy; I regret, I say, Sir, in 
     <lb/>approaching a question of such deep import<lb break="no"/>ance, that the conduct of a portion of the press 
     <lb/>in this Province, controlled by a gentleman 
     <lb/>within this Legislature, occupying a high and 
     <lb/>responsible position, should make it my duty 
     <lb/>at the outset to notice, not the arguments-for 
     <lb/>that time has passed â€” but unfounded <choice><sic>cal<lb break="no"/>nmnies</sic><corr>calumnies</corr></choice> and misrepresentation. The time has 
     <lb/>passed when the opponents of a union of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America can meet the friends of that 
     <lb/>great question on the platform, in the press, or 
     <lb/>on the floor of Parliament, and discuss it as 
     <lb/>becomes public men and statesmen, upon the 
     <lb/>principles and leading features of the scheme 
     <lb/>proposed. Instead of that, the opponents of 
     <lb/>union have resorted to appeals to the passions, 
     <lb/>--to such an amount of personal vituperation 
     <lb/>as never before I believe in the history of this 
     <lb/>country, was dragged into the consideration of 
     <lb/>a great public question upon anyoccasion. I 
     <lb/>should fail in what 1 owe to myself and to the 
     <lb/>great question with which I am at this mo<lb break="no"/>ment undertaking to deal, and in what I owe to 
     <lb/>this deliberative assembly, if I did not in my 
     <lb/>place in Parliament, notice at the very outset 
     <lb/>the position that the opponents of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion have assumed, and the strange liberties 
     <lb/>they have taken with this Legislature. I would

     when the Government was called upon to

     deal with the question, they invited the aid

     <lb/>
     vital import, have acted from the first in entire 
     <lb/>
     unison with those who had asked their assist<lb break="no"/>ance. I do not mean to say that the members

     of the Government and the gentlemen

     opposed to them, who were delegates to the

     I do not mean to say that we were not obliged

     on many occasions to arrive at a common re<lb break="no"/>sult by a compromise of our individual opin<lb break="no"/>ions; but in the measure as a whole, that was

     presented to the world, we were all heartily

     the position of the organ of the party of which

     the hon. and learned member for Colchester,

     down the rights and liberties of his country.â€”

     I ask the house if the most spiritless member 
     <lb/>
     is prepared to allow a foul stigma like that 
     <lb/>
     to rest upon his character? I feel that all the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member has been doing is bringing down 
     <lb/>discredit and dishonour upon himself and the 
     <lb/>cause he thus upholds. I may have occasion 
     <lb/>to draw the attention of this house to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to how far these imputations of base, 
     <lb/>corrupt and dishonourable motives influenc<lb break="no"/>ing the members of this Legislature, have 
     <lb/>sprung from the belief in the mind of the hon. 
     <lb/>member that there are other gentlemen as 
     <lb/>open to such imputations as he himself may 
     <lb/>be. Now when a base and dishonourable mo<lb break="no"/>tive is imputed to a man of fair character, the 
     <lb/>party who attempts to put such a stigma upon 
     <lb/>him has a right to sustain it by showing it at 
     <lb/>there is some reason for the belief that it 
     <lb/>might possibly apply to the person in question. 
     <lb/>I have already said that these imputations are 
     <lb/>not levelled against the gov't party alone, 
     <lb/>but fall with the same weight upon gentle<lb break="no"/>men politically identified with the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber. It may be argued with reason that these 
     <lb/>imputations fall with far greater force upon 
     <lb/>the leader of the Opposition, with whom the 
     <lb/>hon. member has been long closely associated, 
     <lb/>and whose motives he may be supposed to 
     <lb/>know better than those with whom he has not 
     <lb/>been politically identified. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me call your attention to this charge of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     bribery. No one will deny the truth of the 
     <lb/>
     principle that it is only when you find a man 
     <lb/>
     lend himself to a dishonorable deed, that you 
     <lb/>
     have a foundation to impute a base motive. 
     <lb/>
     In what position are the promoters of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme? Were we in the position 
     <lb/>
     of having denounced a Union of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, and then, without anything to 
     <lb/>
     change their attitude, having suddenly as<lb break="no"/>sumed a position entirely antagonistic and at 
     <lb/>
     variance with that which we had previously 
     <lb/>
     taken? If it were so, then the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     might have something on which to base a 
     <lb/>
     suspicion. Before the question was mooted 
     <lb/>
     in this Legislature I was called to address a 
     <lb/>
     meeting in the city of St. John, in the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring Province, and chose for my subject 
     <lb/>
     the Union of British North America. From 
     <lb/>
     that day to this I have been found the con<lb break="no"/>sistent supporter of Union. When the late 
     <lb/>
     government brought down the question of 
     <lb/>
     Union I adhered to the principles on the plat<lb break="no"/>form and in the press, and gave them my cor<lb break="no"/>dial and enthusiastic support. So down to 
     <lb/>
     the present day I stand before the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country as a man who, in every position, 
     <lb/>
     has used every influence he possessed to pro<lb break="no"/>mote and carry forward that on which he 
     <lb/>
     believed the prosperity and security of the 
     <lb/>
     country depended. Can the hon. member find 
     <lb/>
     any foundation there for the imputation of 
     <lb/>
     base and corrupt motives? Again, if the pro<lb break="no"/>moters of Union are influenced by motives 
     <lb/>
     that are dishonourable to themselves and the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, in what position is Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     the Queen? When he sees the Queen, session 
     <lb/>
     after session, at the close and opening of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, coming down and urging in the most 
     <lb/>
     emphatic terms that the Royal lips can use, 
     <lb/>
     this question of Confederation upon the people 
     <lb/>
     of British North America, does he mean to 
     <lb/>
     say that she, too, is corrupted by base bribes? 
     <lb/>
     Coming down to Her Majesty's Ministersâ€”to 
     <lb/>
     the men who stand before the world as exemp<lb break="no"/>lars of the most distinguished patriotism, the 
     <lb/>
     most profound statesmanshipâ€”are they too 
     <lb/>
     corrupted by base means when they declare 
     <lb/>
     that the advancement of British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica is to be secured by carrying through this 
     <lb/>
     great question of a Colonial Union? What 
     <lb/>
     does he think influences Lord Derby and the 
     <lb/>
     statesmen opposed to Her Majesty's Ministers 
     <lb/>
     who, on every occasion, have stood forward 
     <lb/>
     and strengthened the hands of the government 
     <lb/>
     of England in carrying forward this great 
     <lb/>question of Colonial Union? What has in<lb break="no"/>uenced the press and people, as well as the 
     <lb/>Lords and Commons of Great Britain, when, 
     <lb/>with a unanimity which has never been 
     <lb/>exhibited on any other public question, they 
     <lb/>stand forward as the avowed supporters and 
     <lb/>advocates of this great measure? Is it at a 
     <lb/>crisis like thisâ€”when day by day these patriotic 
     <lb/>influences that are calculated to operate upon 
     <lb/>men's minds do operateâ€”that a member of 
     <lb/>this deliberative assembly should dare to 
     <lb/>dishonour this House by imputations of being 
     <lb/>influenced by base and unworthy motives? 
     <lb/>Go to Canada and you find in that great coun<lb break="no"/>try an overwhelming majority of both branches 
     <lb/>of the Legislature in favour of this great mea<lb break="no"/>sure; and you find Her Majesty's Representa<lb break="no"/>tive therein using his legitimate influence to

     undergone a great change in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     question of a union of the colonies. Looking 
     <lb/>
     at the events that are transpiring in this pro<lb break="no"/>vince no one can doubt the result. Then, I 
     <lb/>
     say, is it Canadian gold that is corrupting the 
     <lb/>
     Province and influencing it to assume an atti<lb break="no"/>tude so very different from what it assumed a 
     <lb/>
    year ago? Coming to our own Province what 
     <lb/>do I find? I am not going to speak of the 
     <lb/>Lieutenant Governor (Mr. Annandâ€”hear, 
     <lb/>hear), but the Government knows that the 
     <lb/>"Hero of Kars," in his capacity of Comman<lb break="no"/>der-in-Chief of British North America, used 
     <lb/>all the ability and talent at his command, by 
     <lb/>public speeches and written communications, 
     <lb/>in favor of a union of British North America. 
     <lb/>As one of the most distinguished soldiers of 
     <lb/>the empire he felt that the salvation and se<lb break="no"/>curity of British North America depended 
     <lb/>upon the promised union being carried into 
     <lb/>effect. What has corrupted that high-minded 
     <lb/>soldier, statesmen and patriot? Is it Canadian 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
           
     gold? If the features of the scheme are such 
     <lb/>
     as to bring to its advocacy a man so distin<lb break="no"/>guished, why is it that this deliberative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly is told that Canadian gold is the only 
     <lb/>
     means of inducing men to combine in carrying 
     <lb/>
     it forward? In what position is the brave and 
     <lb/>
     distinguished Admiral on this Station? He 
     <lb/>
     stood forth at the very inception of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, as he stands to-day,â€”he, one of the 
     <lb/>
     most distinguished heroes that ever graced the 
     <lb/>
     navy of Englandâ€”lending his voice and co<lb break="no"/>operation to the great scheme of a Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America, as the means by which 
     <lb/>
     we are to be elevated into a position of infi<lb break="no"/>nitely greater importance than we can now 
     <lb/>
     enjoy,â€”as the only means of preserving these 
     <lb/>
     provinces to the Crown of England. What is 
     <lb/>
     it that has corrupted him? Need I remind 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen that the same position is occupied 
     <lb/>
     by that universal favorite in this countryâ€”the 
     <lb/>
     gallant Major-General Doyle. Does not the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member know that that distinguished 
     <lb/>
     gentleman as a soldier, as a servant of the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, as a man upon whom the responsibi<lb break="no"/>lity of our protection depends, has used all the 
     <lb/>
     influence he can exercise by argument and 
     <lb/>
     persuasion in favour of a Union of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Thus we find all those illustrious 
     <lb/>
     men standing shoulder to shoulder in this 
     <lb/>
     great question. Then there is the distinguish<lb break="no"/>ed prelate, His Grace the Archbishop, who 
     <lb/>
     has stood forward in this province, and by 
     <lb/>
     his voice and pen, urged upon the people the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of this scheme of Union as the great 
     <lb/>
     means by which the safety and prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     our country must be promoted. There is His 
     <lb/>
     Lordship the talented and astute Bishop of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. His Lordship the Bishop of 
     <lb/>
     Arichatâ€”the united clergy of all denomina<lb break="no"/>tionsâ€”Episcopalian, Catholic, Methodist, Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian, Baptist, men of all shades of politi<lb break="no"/>cal opinions standing in a solid phalanx, such 
     <lb/>
     as was never exhibited in this country before, 
     <lb/>
     in the face of the people of this province as the 
     <lb/>
     supporters of Confederation,and giving all the 
     <lb/>
     assistance of their talents and exertions as 
     <lb/>
     the only means by which our country may be 
     <lb/>
     elevated, and our connection with Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain preserved. Side by side you find all the 
     <lb/>
     able and distinguished judiciary of our coun<lb break="no"/>try united in sustaining this Union of British 
     <lb/>
     North America. What has corrupted the en<lb break="no"/>tire religious Pressâ€”the "Presbyterian Wit<lb break="no"/>ness," the "Wesleyan," the "<choice><sic>Christain</sic><corr>Christian</corr></choice>Mes<lb break="no"/>senger? Here you see these journals reflect<lb break="no"/>ing the views of the clergy of various denomi<lb break="no"/>nations combining to press forward this great 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Union; and yet you find the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member standing forward and declaring that 
     <lb/>
     men who only look to the welfare and security 
     <lb/>
     of their country are influenced by the base 
     <lb/>
     and contemptible motives which he has ven<lb break="no"/>tured to insinuate. I am hold to say that if 
     <lb/>
     up to the present hour there has been a sin<lb break="no"/>gle dollar of Canadian gold brought into the 
     <lb/>
     country in connection with this question I 
     <lb/>
     am ignorant of it; if there has been a states<lb break="no"/>man in the whole of Canada that would dare 
     <lb/>
     to approach a member of this Legislature or 
     <lb/>
     any one else in this country by means such as 
     <lb/>
     that, he has not insulted me by taking me in<lb break="no"/>to his confidence. Standing here as I do with 
     <lb/>the knowledge of that factâ€”of the dishonor<lb break="no"/>able character of this insinuation, I feel I 
     <lb/>could afford to let it pass by with the contempt 
     <lb/>

     that it deserves if it was not sent abroad into 
     <lb/>
     the remotest hamlets of this country for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of creating strife and rebellion among 
     <lb/>
     the unsophisticated and less uninformed of 
     <lb/>
     our people. I ask the hon. member if it was 
     <lb/>
     under the influence of base bribes a great num<lb break="no"/>ber of the citizens of Halifax, when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion had been fully discussed on the public 
     <lb/>
     platform by the ablest men on both sides that 
     <lb/>
     could be found, were induced to stand for<lb break="no"/>ward as the avowed supporters of Union? I do 
     <lb/>
     not mean to say that on a question of such 
     <lb/>
     deep import, involving such weighty <choice><sic>consid<lb break="no"/>derations</sic><corr>considerations</corr></choice>, there are not high-minded men who 
     <lb/>
     differ from us, but I have never insinuatedâ€” 
     <lb/>
     never have been compelled to resort to such a 
     <lb/>
     despicable position as to say that they were 
     <lb/>
     influenced by other than patriotic motives. 
     <lb/>
     Then at Truro, in the heart of our agricultural 
     <lb/>
     counties, a large body of intelligent men, con<lb break="no"/>vinced by the arguments in support of Union, 
     <lb/>
     have stood forward as its firm friends. So at 
     <lb/>
     Windsor, Kentville, Bridgetown, Annapolis, 
     <lb/>
     Parrsboro, Amherst, Pugwash, and other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country you see men who had, in 
     <lb/>
     year's past, been diametrically opposed to 
     <lb/>
     each other on political matters, standing 
     <lb/>
     shoulder to shoulder and co-operating for the 
     <lb/>
     promotion of Colonial Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I regret to have to allude to a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who is not in this building, and I shall deal 
     <lb/>
     with him with greater delicacy than if he 
     <lb/>
     were here; but my duty as a public man com<lb break="no"/>pels me to sink every consideration of false 
     <lb/>
     delicacy in dealing with this question, and 
     <lb/>
     place it before my fellow-countrymen free 
     <lb/>from all disguise. I believe that the time has 
     <lb/>come when man should speak to man plainly 
     <lb/>and unhesitatingly, and when men who have 
     <lb/>taken up the position that the opponents of 
     <lb/>Union have, should be exposed to the naked 
     <lb/>gaze of the people ot the Province. Need I 
     <lb/>tell the House that in the same paper which 
     <lb/>sends broadcast over the face of this country 
     <lb/>these unfounded calumnies, we see Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>over his own signature assisting the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber by his pen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I touch upon that part of the subject, 
     <lb/>
     let me first call attention to the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member, at the close of my observations 
     <lb/>
     on Thursday last, addressed a challenge to 
     <lb/>
     me to show that he was at all responsible for 
     <lb/>
     ever having committed himself in any shape 
     <lb/>
     whatever to the Union of B. N. America; 
     <lb/>
     and I am here now to accept that challenge 
     <lb/>
     and to prove from the journals of this Legis<lb break="no"/>ture that if there is a gentleman in this House 
     <lb/>
     exposed to suspicionâ€”if we wanted an incon<lb break="no"/>sistent course of conduct on which to base an 
     <lb/>
     imputationâ€”it is to be found in the career of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member himself, and of the gentle<lb break="no"/>man whose mouth-piece he is in this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. This hon. member who now says that 
     <lb/>
     he has yet to hear the first argument in favour 
     <lb/>
     of Union, declared that "so many were the 
     <lb/>
     advantages of Union" that the time had ar<lb break="no"/>rived when it was necessary to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     question.

            <p>
     Near the close of the session of 1861, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe, then leader of the government of 
     <lb/>this Province, moved the following resolution,

     The hon. member does not require to say 
     <lb/>
     "hear, hear," to direct the attention of every 
     <lb/>
     intelligent gentleman in this house and coun<lb break="no"/>try to his shameful inconsistency. At a time 
     <lb/>
     when these gentlemen held the responsible 
     <lb/>
     position of Ministers of the Crown, we find the 
     <lb/>
     government of which he was a member bring<lb break="no"/>ing down to the house a resolution affirming 
     <lb/>
     in the most emphatic language that ever 
     <lb/>
     tongue can express the "many advantages of 
     <lb/>
     Union;" and in the face of that declaration 
     <lb/>
     you now see the hon member standing up and 
     <lb/>
     endeavoring to repudiate his former senti<lb break="no"/>ments so unequivocally expressed. The man 
     <lb/>
     who pledged his character as a statesman, as 
     <lb/>
     a man of integrity, to the statement that the 
     <lb/>
     great advantages accruing from a Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America should be considered 
     <lb/>
     by all the Provinces, now ventures to 
     <lb/>
     come into the House and tell us that 
     <lb/>
     he has "yet to hear the first argu<lb break="no"/>ment in favour of that Union." I ask 
     <lb/>
     you if a public man, after an exhibition 
     <lb/>
     like that, is in a position to ask that the slight<lb break="no"/>est weight should be given to any declaration 
     <lb/>
     that he may make? He may throw his base 
     <lb/>
     insinuations into the face of this deliberative 
     <lb/>
     Assemblyâ€”he may degrade himself by at<lb break="no"/>tempting to degrade this Home, but it will 
     <lb/>
     avail nothing with every man who knows that 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman who brought here a great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of public policy, and pledged his public 
     <lb/>
     character to its support, now unblushingly de<lb break="no"/>clares that it was a farce, a delusion, and a de<lb break="no"/>ception, which he had been passing upon this 
     <lb/>
     deliberative Assembly. If I stood in such a 
     <lb/>
     position,I would forgive the hon. member if he 
     <lb/>
     attributed base and dishonorable motives as 
     <lb/>
     the reason why I had been influenced to adopt 
     <lb/>
     a course so untenable and so at variance with 
     <lb/>
     the public policy to which I stood pledged as a 
     <lb/>
     public man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going now to deal with another gentle<lb break="no"/>man, outside of these walls, who brought that 
     <lb/>
     resolution here and declared himself in 
     <lb/>
     the face of this country as the great expon<lb break="no"/>ent of Union. The action of the house upon 
     <lb/>
     the above resolution was followed up by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe addressing, in his capacity of Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, a circular to the Governments of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, New Brunswick, and P. E. Island, 
     <lb/>
     asking them to agree to a Conference for the

     of a Union of British North America. We

     <lb/>
     one of the most distinguished statesmen of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. I speak of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     D'Arcy McGee, a gentleman who possesses 
     <lb/>
     the finest mind, the most wonderful eloquence, 
     <lb/>
     the most facile pen, and who has devoted all 
     <lb/>
     the powers of his mind, all the influence of his 
     <lb/>
     position, during the past ten years, to the work 
     <lb/>
     of uniting, consolidating, and strengthening 
     <lb/>
     the people and resources of British North 
     <lb/>
     America. Can the hon member designate in 
     <lb/>
     no other style the man whom her Majesty the 
     <lb/>
     Queen and her ministers have delighted to ho<lb break="no"/>nour who, whatever the indiscretions of his 
     <lb/>
     Youth mav have been, has devoted himself in 
     <lb/>British North America. to speak down and 
     <lb/>write down the antagonisms of race and of 
     <lb/>religion, and has contributed more than any 
     <lb/>other to unite the friends of British rule in 
     <lb/>these colonies. What was the language of 
     <lb/>Mr. Howe when this eminent statesman came 
     <lb/>among us in 1863? He visited this city year 
     <lb/>after year, and exercised his talents, as he has 
     <lb/>always done in Canada, for the elevation of 
     <lb/>our common country. He came on an invita<lb break="no"/>tion to Halifax and delivered an address in 
     <lb/>Temperance Hall on the union of British 
     <lb/>North America, and what was the opinion of 
     <lb/>Mr. Howe, as expressed on that occasion, of 
     <lb/>the man who came to this House and pledged 
     <lb/>his public reputation to the declaration that 
     <lb/>so great was the advantages of union that the 
     <lb/>Legislature ought to move in the matter for 
     <lb/>the purpose of bringing it to a happy consum<lb break="no"/>mation. Mr. Howe rose and seconded a vote 
     <lb/>of thanks to Mr. McGee in these words, as re<lb break="no"/>ported at the time:â€”

     "Mr. Howe went on to remark that it would be in<lb break="no"/>justice to the lecturer to say more, further than he

     all the British North American Provinces, but he was 
     <lb/>
     for an intercolonial Railroad first. Then the road 
     <lb/>
     would bring about the Union. It would enable the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians to see our faces, to become familiar with 
     <lb/>

     Colony; upon which it may be truly said the sun

     On that occasion, therefore, Mr. Howe stood forth 
     <lb/>
     to endorse everything that Mr. McGee had stated in 
     <lb/>
     reference to this great question of intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Union. Did the man who stood then, as he does now, 
     <lb/>
     at Mr. Howe's back, call the scheme of Union a snare 
     <lb/>
     and a delusion? No, he stood there to publish those 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of Mr Howe in his own paper, for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of proving that that gentleman was a far<lb break="no"/>seeing patriot, who recognized the position which 
     <lb/>
     British North America must occupy, and the mea<lb break="no"/>sures that were necessary to her security. But that 
     <lb/>
     is not all. ln 1864, subsequent to my having carried 
     <lb/>
     a resolution in this House in favor of a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union of the Maritime Colonies, a visit was made to 
     <lb/>
     this Province bv a large deputation of Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     headed by Mr. McGee, upon the invitation of promi<lb break="no"/>nent merchants of this city, who came forward and 
     <lb/>
     contributed their means towards receiving their 
     <lb/>
     guests, and declaring a resolution that it was of 
     <lb/>
     the greatest commercial and political importance that 
     <lb/>
     there should be a closer union between Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and Canada. A splendid banquet was given on that 
     <lb/>
     occasion in the drill shed to our visitors, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe was present to declare that no change had 
     <lb/>
     taken place in his views since in Temperance Hall 
     <lb/>
     he stood forward and endorsed the opinions express<lb break="no"/>ed by Mr. McGee. It will be remembered, that pre<lb break="no"/>vious to this time the Government of Canada had 
     <lb/>
     re-organized on the basis of endeavoring to obtain a 
     <lb/>
     federal union of British North America; and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McGee was present as the exponent of that policy. 
     <lb/>
     I spoke on that occasion, and expressed the slight 
     <lb/>
     with which I had witnessed the political coalition in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and the hope it gave me that when Cartier 
     <lb/>
     and Brown were rowing in the same best to the tune 
     <lb/>
     of "Row Brothers, Row," the result would be a 
     <lb/>
     Union of British North America. It was known, at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, I may here say, for it had been an<lb break="no"/>nounced in Parliament that Canada was about to 
     <lb/>
     send a deputation to the Maritime Convention to be 
     <lb/>
     held at Charlottetown, for the purpose of ascertain<lb break="no"/>ing whether the larger Union could not be carried 
     <lb/>
     out. I shall now quote from the remarks that were 
     <lb/>
     made by Mr. Howe on the occasion in question, as 
     <lb/>
     given by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sun</hi> newspaper which is now engaged in 
     <lb/>
     aspersing the character of public men more consist<lb break="no"/>ent than themselves upon this question of Union. 
     <lb/>
     The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sun</hi> says:â€” 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <quote><p>
     "Hon. Mr. Howe was received with most hearty 
     <lb/>
     cheers. His speech was short and appropriate. He 
     <lb/>
     was no stranger among them. His voice had been 
     <lb/>
     heard in almost every town in the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British America, and would again if occasion re<lb break="no"/>quired it; and he was in hopes of yet seeing the dream 
     <lb/>
     of his boyhood realized â€”the Union of these Provin<lb break="no"/>ces in one great federation under the old flag of 
     <lb/>
     England, an event which he hoped was at no distant 
     <lb/>
     date. We are sorry that our space will not allow us 
     <lb/>
     to give this gentleman's remarks at greater length."

            <p>
     Now what next? The government invited Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe as the exponent of a large portion of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic sentiment of this country to go upon the Delega<lb break="no"/>tion. He told me, as I have stated in his presence, 
     <lb/>
     that if there was any great work in which his ser<lb break="no"/>vices were required he was ready to give us his as<lb break="no"/>sistance: and accordingly we invited him, and his 
     <lb/>
     reply is on the journals of this House. That invita<lb break="no"/>tion remember, was tendered after he was aware of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian policy of extending the Union to all 
     <lb/>
     the Provincesâ€”after he had endorsed that policy by 
     <lb/>
     saying he hoped Union would be secured. Deeply do 
     <lb/>
     I deplore that Mr. Howe was unable to attend on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, for I believe that the difficulties and 
     <lb/>
     embarrassments that the friends of British American 
     <lb/>
     Union have had to encounter in dealing with this 
     <lb/>
     great question arose in a large measure from the fact 
     <lb/>
     that they were deprived at the Conference 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Howe's services. I am only repeating 
     <lb/>
     that which we hear from the warmest riends 
     <lb/>
     he has in this Province, that if he had attended 
     <lb/>
     at the Convention there would not be a man 
     <lb/>
     who would be more enthusiastic in pressing 
     <lb/>
     forward this great scheme than himself. 
     <lb/>
     However, he addressed me a letter in which he 
     <lb/>
     expressed his deep regret that he could not at<lb break="no"/>

     tend, and said he would be back by the <choice><sic>mid<lb break="no"/>le</sic><corr>middle</corr></choice> of October prepared to assist us in carrying 
     <lb/>
     out any measure we agreed upon. Now you 
     <lb/>
     see the same man who thus bound himself to 
     <lb/>
     assist us in promoting anything that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the day and his own political Â  
     <lb/>
     friends might concur in, to-day in the "Morn<lb break="no"/>ing Chronicle" denouncing these gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     his own tried political associates, as traitors, 
     <lb/>
     and holding them up to the execration of their 
     <lb/>
     countrymen all over the province. If there 
     <lb/>
     was a spark of gratitude in his heart he should 
     <lb/>
     know that the men he is denouncing as con<lb break="no"/>spirators are those to whom he owed the posi<lb break="no"/>tion and all the advantages that he has enjoy<lb break="no"/>ed for the past ten years. They are the men 
     <lb/>
     who sustained him in this house, who sent him 
     <lb/>
     to England and enabled him to secure the Im<lb break="no"/>perial office which he lately held, and this is 
     <lb/>
     their reward! If I stood in the position that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe stands in to-day on this great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of union, I would forgive the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for denouncing me as aÂ traitor and a con<lb break="no"/>spirator, and feel hat he had reason to insinu<lb break="no"/>ate that I was influenced by the most base and 
     <lb/>
     unworthy motives. Having said this much, 
     <lb/>
     having read the hon member for East Halifax 
     <lb/>
     a lesson which he will probably never forget, 
     <lb/>
     I come now to the ques ion as it lies before 
     <lb/>
     the house. I ask whether we are in a position 
     <lb/>
     to deal with this question. It has be n denied 
     <lb/>
     that we areâ€”it has been said that this is a 
     <lb/>
     change in the consitution of the country which 
     <lb/>
     must be ratified by the people at the polls, if 
     <lb/>
     it is to be constitutionally made. What, I 
     <lb/>
     ask, gave Nova Scotia her constitution? From 
     <lb/>
     what source does it come ? Looking at 
     <lb/>
     the quarter from which it comes do you find 
     <lb/>
     anything to lead us to suppose that there is 
     <lb/>
     anything unconstitutional in a Parliament 
     <lb/>
     dealing with a question of this character. You 
     <lb/>
     find her Majesty's ministers, the very sources 
     <lb/>
     from which our constitution was received, day 
     <lb/>
     by day urging, not that the Legislature shall be 
     <lb/>
     dissolved, and an appeal made to the people 
     <lb/>
     of this Province, but that the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the people here assembled, in virtue of the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional power they possess, should deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question. You find the very highest 
     <lb/>
     authority in reference to constitutional mat<lb break="no"/>ters, the British Government, committing it<lb break="no"/>self unhesitatingly to the only statesmanlike 
     <lb/>
     position, that the Parliament of the country, 
     <lb/>          
     the represen atives of the people, had the pow<lb break="no"/>er to deal wi h all such mattersâ€”that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of a country are assumed to be present in 
     <lb/>
     the persons of those whom they have elected 
     <lb/>
     to represent them. In that constitutional doc<lb break="no"/>trine or not? Is it sustained by British prac<lb break="no"/>tice which is our great exemplar, or opposed 
     <lb/>
     even to American practice, or to constitution<lb break="no"/>al usage in any part of the world where con<lb break="no"/>stitutional government exists. That the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of a country may not be changed by the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament? What do you see at this moment 
     <lb/>
     in England? When the present House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons was elected, the question of Reform 
     <lb/>
     was hardly mentioned at the Polls; the people 
     <lb/>
     had no opportunity of expressing their opi<lb break="no"/>nions on the subject; but now you see the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament thus elected, preparing to deal 
     <lb/>
     with its own constitution, by adding nearly 
     <lb/>
     500,000 electors to its list of voters. Members 
     <lb/>
     of Parliament have declared that the change 
     <lb/>
     is so fundamental that it will hand over the 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
     
     governing power to a different class; but no 
     <lb/>
     one has rendered himself ridiculous by declar<lb break="no"/>ing the Parliament was not competent to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question, and bring about this im<lb break="no"/>portant change in the constitution of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Is not Congress, at this moment, changing 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of the United States in the 
     <lb/>
     most important respects? The time to ascertain 
     <lb/>
     whether a question is constitutional or notâ€”to 
     <lb/>
     obtain a dispassionate opinion from the public 
     <lb/>
     mind in the countryâ€”is not when it is a subject 
     <lb/>
     of excitement and controversy. You must go 
     <lb/>
     back and study the pages of the history of our 
     <lb/>
     country to ascertain if you can find upon the 
     <lb/>
     record what are the real and deliberate utteran<lb break="no"/>ces of public men on both sides of politics. I 
     <lb/>am prepared to go back and turn up the page of 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia's history, and give to the house the 
     <lb/>statements of public men of all shades of politics, 
     <lb/>that will be clear and conclusive upon the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. The house will recollect that many years 
     <lb/>ago the Hon. Mr. Johnston, when sitting on the 
     <lb/>Opposition benches, proposed a resolution, pro 
     <lb/>viding for a Union of British North America. 
     <lb/>That resolution became the subject of calm and 
     <lb/>dispassionate discussion, as it should always ob<lb break="no"/>tain at the hands of the Legislature. Two of 
     <lb/>the ablest men who have ever figured in the af<lb break="no"/>fairs of the country were sitting on the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment sideâ€”I refer to Mr. Howe and Mr.
     <lb/>Young. These gentlemen discussed the question 
     <lb/>in all its aspects, and it was never questioned 
     <lb/>whether the Parliament had the power of dealing 
     <lb/>with the constitution, but, as I shall prove to 
     <lb/>you, the utterances of the ablest statesmen 
     <lb/>on both sides went to show that the power 
     <lb/>of the Legislature to change the constitution ol 
     <lb/>the Province was admittcd in the clearest and 
     <lb/>most conclusive manner:â€” 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     "Mr. Johnston said on this occasion:â€”"I do this, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that at the outset it may be seen to be my desire 
     <lb/>
     that the Imperial and Colonial Governments should 
     <lb/>
     be drawn to consider this great question and to mould

     it after full deliberation into some form fit to be

     dancing before the eyes of some hon. gentlemen

     still. Mr. Howe, however, in the course of his 
     <lb/>
     remarks, gave in his adhesion to some such plan 
     <lb/>
     as was devised at Quebec. He said:â€”

            <p>
     So, at a time when the question was calmly 
     <lb/>
     debated, and when there was no excitement, you 
     <lb/>
     have these distinct utterances of all these able 
     <lb/>
     statesmen, both British and Colonial, that the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of the country has power to change 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the country, and that that is 
     <lb/>
     the proper mode of dealing with such a subject. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I say that I am in a position to state 
     <lb/>
     that the Legislature is justified in taking such 
     <lb/>
     action upon the vital and important question, as 
     <lb/>
     in their deliberative opinion is calculated to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the best interests of the Province and of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. It will thus be seen that 
     <lb/>
     the issue that has been raised by parties for purpo<lb break="no"/>ses of their ownâ€”who wish to overthrow the ex<lb break="no"/>isting administration and come into power them<lb break="no"/>selves, is swept away like chaff before the wind 
     <lb/>
     neither constitutional principle nor precedent 
     <lb/>
     being found to support their views. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After having sustained my position by argu<lb break="no"/>ments like theseâ€”after having brought the opi<lb break="no"/>nions of all these eminent public men to prove 
     <lb/>
     the proper and constitutional mode of dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the subjectâ€”after having shown that in 
     <lb/>
     the whole history of Great Britain and of the 
     <lb/>
     United States no parallel can be found for the 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people which has been proposed â€” 
     <lb/>
     I think the opponents of Union are not in a sit<lb break="no"/>uation to challenge the right of this house in the 
     <lb/>
     exercise of its legitimate functions to pursue 
     <lb/>
     such a course as the interest of our common 
     <lb/>
     country demands. They cannot find one exam<lb break="no"/>ple of a question like this being referred to the 
     <lb/>
     people at the polls, either in Great Britain or the 
     <lb/>
     United States,â€”there is one, but it is not one 
     <lb/>which they are likely to adduce for adoption by 
     <lb/>a British Assembly. It is the occasion on which 
     <lb/>the people of France were driven at the point of the 
     <lb/>bayonet to the polls, to sustain a perfect despot<lb break="no"/>ism in the country, to part with every vestige of 
     <lb/>liberty that freemen value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having already stated in detail the arguments 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Union which weigh upon my own 
     <lb/>
     mind, I feel l would be trespassing upon the 
     <lb/>
     House if I were, on the present occasion, to go at 
     <lb/>
     any length into a question which has been so ful<lb break="no"/>ly discussed. I feel that when I have drawn the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House to the fact that, not only 
     <lb/>
     have gentlemen politically opposed to each other 
     <lb/>
     been brought to co operate on this question, but 
     <lb/>
     the greatest minds of the country who have ever 
     <lb/>
     taken a prominent share in public affairs are en<lb break="no"/>dorsing this action. It is unnecessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     weary the House with any lengthy observations. 
     <lb/>
     I am not surprised that Mr. Howe should have

            <fw type="running">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY</fw>
            <fw type="num">219</fw>
          
     brought forward this great question of Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Union. At a time when party conflict raged in 
     <lb/>
     this country as never before, in 1861, the opposi<lb break="no"/>on party in this House stated that they were pre<lb break="no"/>pared to sustain their oppnents in a measure 
     <lb/>
     that was calculated to advance the Union of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America. At that time the advocacy 
     <lb/>
     of that subject was popular to the last degree; nor 
     <lb/>
     was it till the last moment that men were found 
     <lb/>
     unpatriotic enough to ignore their own previous 
     <lb/>
     actions in order to antagonize a great national 
     <lb/>
     movement, in order to obtain an unfair advantage
     <lb/>
     over the Government of the day. Although by 
     <lb/>
     the dissemination of inflammatory productions, 
     <lb/>
     by conjuring up the frightful bugbear of taxation, 
     <lb/>
     a large body of the people have been brought to 
     <lb/>
     look upon the Quebec scheme with disfavor I am 
     <lb/>
     proud to know that the best minds of this country 
     <lb/>
     give their hearty sanction and are prepared to sus<lb break="no"/>tain this movement to unite British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica by every means in their power. Is it strange 
     <lb/>
     that such should be the case? What future can 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia have apart from a Union of British 
     <lb/>
     North America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Look at the comparatively insignificant position 
     <lb/>
     we occupy and tell me, surrounded as we are by 
     <lb/>
     hostile tariffs, with a mere handful of population, 
     <lb/>
     what future can we look forward to unless it is 
     <lb/>
     in connection with <choice><sic>theconsolidation</sic><corr>the consolidation</corr></choice> of British 
     <lb/>
     North America under one government. Look<lb break="no"/>ing only at the commercial aspect of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion-at the expansion of our trade and our 
     <lb/>
     great facilitiesÂ for manufactures, is it a matter 
     <lb/>
     for surprise that the most intelligent men in this 
     <lb/>
     country have combined, as they have never done 
     <lb/>
     on any other question? The geographical po<lb break="no"/>sition we occupy, can be of little service, and the 
     <lb/>
     great resources we possess are all comparatively 
     <lb/>
     useless and can never obtain full development 
     <lb/>
     except, as Mr. Howe has said, by making this 
     <lb/>
     province the Atlantic frontage for a mighty British 
     <lb/>
     American country. Let us turn our attention to 
     <lb/>
     the question of an Intercolonial Railway. Great 
     <lb/>
     as may be its commercial advantages, though it 
     <lb/>
     may make Nova Scotia the wharf of British 
     <lb/>
     North America, everybody knows that it has 
     <lb/>
     been stated time after time by Mr. Howe as lay<lb break="no"/>ing at the very foundation of the security and 
     <lb/>
     advancement of British America. He said 
     <lb/>
     he wanted the Intercolonial Railway because it 
     <lb/>
     would bring about Union. For twenty long 
     <lb/>
     years the ablest public men had combined all 
     <lb/>
     their talents and energies to bring about the con<lb break="no"/>struction of this great work but all their efforts 
     <lb/>
     have proved futile. The moment however the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Union is consummated, the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway becomes an accomplished fact.
            </p>
            
     <p>The delegates came back not only with the evi<lb break="no"/>dence that the general scheme gave that these 
     <lb/>
     Provinces would have all the legitimate influence 
     <lb/>
     that they were entitled to, but with the proof that 
     <lb/>
     the twenty millions of dollars required to build 
     <lb/>
     the Inter-colonial Railway were secured by Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Union. But the great commercial ad<lb break="no"/>vantages derived from Union have been so fully 
     <lb/>
     detailed on the platform and in the press in a 
     <lb/>
     manner that must carry conviction to every intel<lb break="no"/>ligent mind, that it is altogether superfluous for 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            
            <cb/>
           
            <p>
     me to dwell on this part of the subject. No man 
     <lb/>
     can look at the position of our country without 
     <lb/>
     recognizing at once that, surrounded, as we are, 
     <lb/>
     by hostile tariffs, our great facilities for manufac<lb break="no"/>tures must lie dormant. If, therefore, we wish to 
     <lb/>develope enterprize, and make this country a great 
     <lb/>bee hive of industry, we must, without delay, 
     <lb/>carry out this scheme of lnter-colonial Union. 
     <lb/>The Reciprocity Treaty has been swept away, 
     <lb/>and no intelligent man, whether opposed to the 
     <lb/>Quebec scheme or not, can fail to see that the 
     <lb/>basis on which our previous prosperity rested has 
     <lb/>been affected to a large extent and that there 
     <lb/>should be found some counterbalancing means 
     <lb/>by which our common interests may be promoted. 
     <lb/>Important, however, as these matters are, there is 
     <lb/>another question to which I have hardly referred, 
     <lb/>which lies at the foundation of the whole arguâ€” 
     <lb/>ment. Whilst I am prepared to support this 
     <lb/>Union under the belief that our political and com<lb break="no"/>mercial prosperity is indissolubly bound up in the 
     <lb/>measure, I would say that I would accept it at 
     <lb/>some sacrifice for the purpose of adopting the 
     <lb/>only means by which I could hand down to my 
     <lb/>children the priceless boon of British connection. 
     <lb/>I must here again invite the attention of the House 
     <lb/>to the following observations of Mr Howe on 
     <lb/>this subject, and for which the hon. member is 
     <lb/>responsible, for he was a member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment who brought them here. In a state paper 
     <lb/>in the Journals of 1862 Mr. Howe declared:

     <lb/>Democratic party that supports the President. 
     <lb/>Those who cherish hard feeling against the

     <lb/>a good many more. Out of these complica<lb break="no"/>tions no human being, at this moment, can tell

     The House will remember that when the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Halifax wrested the paper of which 
     <lb/>
     he was the responsible editor from one of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Delegates for the purpose of writing down 
     <lb/>
     this question of an Inter-colonial Union there ap<lb break="no"/>peared in its columns a series of letters entitled 
     <lb/>
     "The Botheration Scheme;' and it is now known 
     <lb/>
     that they were written by Mr. Howe-that has 
     <lb/>
     never been denied. What was the first position 
     <lb/>
     taken by Mr. Howe, the man who induced the 
     <lb/>
     House to declare that so many and so great were 
     <lb/>
     the manifold advantages of a Union of all these 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, that they should give the Government 
     <lb/>
     the power to deal with it? He come out as the 
     <lb/>
     avowed enemy of any union whatever, because it 
     <lb/>
     was going to destroy Responsible Government. Â  
     <lb/>
     You see the same thing stated in the communica<lb break="no"/>tion of this morning. If to unite British Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca under one Government and into one Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, is to destroy Responsible Government,
     <lb/>
     where was Responsible Government when the 
     <lb/>
     policy to which he had invited the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House adopted? Again, any Union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada was denounced because there were a mil<lb break="no"/>lion of Frenchmen in Canada. Were there any 
     <lb/>
     Frenchmen in Canada when that resolution offer<lb break="no"/>ed by Mr. Howe passed this House? Had there 
     <lb/>
     no rebellion in Canada when he persuaded the 
     <lb/>
     House to agree to that policy of Union? Having 
     <lb/>
     denounced all Unionâ€”having trampled under 
     <lb/>
     his feet all the principles of his previous life, 
     <lb/>
     what more? The next "Botheration" article 
     <lb/>
     treated us to an eulogium upon Republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions such as was hardly ever seen 
     <lb/>
     in a British paper. Mr Howe's language went 
     <lb/>
     to prove that the sooner the worthloss bauble of 
     <lb/>
     North American institutions is swept away and 
     <lb/>
     replaced by the priceless <choice><sic>g</sic><corr>gift</corr></choice> of Republican insti<lb break="no"/>tutions the better for us. I can forgive American 
     <lb/>
     statesmen holding such language those who owe 
     <lb/>
     their fealty to the institutions of thatÂ great Repub<lb break="no"/>lic; but I am not prepared to hear this language 
     <lb/>
     from the same man who on the platform in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, when a delegate from this Province to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial government, denounced the Republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions of the United States and held them 
     <lb/>
     up to the scorn and contempt of every British 
     <lb/>
     subject. When his own country is to be consoli<lb break="no"/>

            <cb/>

     dated, when a great scheme necessary to the 
     <lb/>
     security of British America is proposed does he 
     <lb/>
     still hold the opinions which he uttered when in 
     <lb/>
     England as the result of 20 years study of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can institutions? Doe he show himself a man 
     <lb/>
     of public principle? No! He shows that he can 
     <lb/>
     change his opinions at pleasure, and propound 
     <lb/>
     whatever views will best suit his interests, and 
     <lb/>
     that he is inflenced by considerations that ought 
     <lb/>
     not to influence any public man, and may thus be 
     <lb/>
     induced to sustain one set of principles to-day, 
     <lb/>
     and asserts others dramatrically opposed to these 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     I believe what the hon gentleman says in what 
     <lb/>
     I have read of his letter is true. It is consistent 
     <lb/>
     with all the information that the government 
     <lb/>
     possesses. The information coming to us from 
     <lb/>
     hour to hour shows the existence and widespread 
     <lb/>
     ramifications of the Fenian organization. What 
     <lb/>
     ought to be the conduct of a patriot and a states<lb break="no"/>man in the face of a danger like that. I believe 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe has not colored the matter too strongly 
     <lb/>
     that these parties are going to make an onslaught 
     <lb/>
     upon some portion of these provinces; and the 
     <lb/>
     men who will be responsible <choice><sic>far</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> all its terrors 
     <lb/>
     will be the men who are resisting Inter-colonial 
     <lb/>
     Union and indoctrinating our people with senti<lb break="no"/>ments that may shake their allegiance to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown. It is only last night the Lieut-Governor 
     <lb/>
     received a despatch that two hundred Fenians had 
     <lb/>
     arrived at Portland; and there is deep apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion that St John or Yarmouth may be the first 
     <lb/>
     object of attack. In the presence of a common 
     <lb/>
     danger like that, the duty of a patriot and states<lb break="no"/>man would be to sink all differences and combine 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of protecting the rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties of British North America. Let the agis of 
     <lb/>
     British protection be withdrawn and what can 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia do in the face of such danger as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe depicts? Simply nothing. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Halifax told us that the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America are looking to British North America, 
     <lb/>
     feeling that if they only possessed these Provinces Â  
     <lb/>
     they would become the first Naval Power in the 
     <lb/>
     world and able to dictate their terms of all nations. 
     <lb/>
     That statement carries conviction with it to the 
     <lb/>
     mind of every man. I will now ask the House if I 
     <lb/>
     were corrupted by American gold, enamoured of 
     <lb/>
     American institutions, believing that the best thing 
     <lb/>
     that I could do would be to transfer this country 
     <lb/>
     to the United States of America what are the 
     <lb/>
     most effective measures that I could take? 
     <lb/>
     Would it not be to keep the Provinces dis<lb break="no"/>united and repel the protection of the mother<lb break="no"/>country, and then button-hole every man whom 
     <lb/>
     I could influence, and undermine his confi<lb break="no"/>dence in our institutions by whispering into 
     <lb/>
     his ear the insidious statement that Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     could not protect us? That the power of the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States was too gigantic-that Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     herself would fail to protect even the city of Hali<lb break="no"/>fax against such ships as were now possessed by 
     <lb/>
     the American Government? And when I had in<lb break="no"/>doctrinated the minds of my countrymen with 
     <lb/>
     that idea, I would tell them that the best plan is 
     <lb/>
     to reject the policy of the Imperial Government. Â  
     <lb/>
     We all know that the feeling of loyalty to one's

     country, the pride in its institutions, lies to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that their institutions are able to afford protection 
     <lb/>
     to life and property. Therefore the moment you 
     <lb/>
     have carried conviction to the minds of the people 
     <lb/>
     that Great Britain is unable to protect us, and 
     <lb/>
     that they stand in the presence of so gigantic a 
     <lb/>
     power that it has only to will to take them, then 
     <lb/>
     you undermine their loyalty. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Now we have Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe in that attitude;</hi> since his return, in the 
     <lb/>
     streets, and in the clubs, and in the presence of 
     <lb/>
     the highest authorities of the land, you find him 
     <lb/>
     constantly holding forth the doctrine that Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain is <hi rendition="simple:italic">impotent</hi> to defend this Province that 
     <lb/>
     though British America might unite, yet with

     even Great Britain at her back, all she could do 
     <lb/>
     would not prevent her being swept away when the 
     <lb/>
     American Government wished it. If I stood in a 
     <lb/>
     position like that, the hon. mem. for Halifax might 
     <lb/>
     be justified in making us an object of suspicion 
     <lb/>
     and throwing out his taunts and <choice><sic>inuendos</sic><corr>innuendos</corr></choice> about 
     <lb/>
     base bribes having influenced public men. Here 
     <lb/>
     you see the man who stood but yesterday on the 
     <lb/>
     very watch tower of the question of intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Unionâ€”having indoctrinated the people with the 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of Unionâ€”having held up Republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions to scorn and derision; now standing 
     <lb/>
     forth and throwing his whole power into the 
     <lb/>
     scale of Opposition to Intercolonial Union 
     <lb/>
     magnifying the power of the United States 
     <lb/>
     extravagantly. What more? You have at the 
     <lb/>
     same time that this most insidious poison is being 
     <lb/>
     instilled into the ear of every one in the com<lb break="no"/>munity, the leading opponents of Union unhesi<lb break="no"/>tatingly avowing preference for Annexation to 
     <lb/>
     the United States. (Cheers) I ask you to put 
     <lb/>
     these facts together and I will not require to ad<lb break="no"/>duce the treasonable utterances of Mr. Annand 
     <lb/>
     on the streets which have been taken back and 
     <lb/>
     apologized for on the floors of the House. I say 
     <lb/>
     then, under such circumstances, I cannot come 
     <lb/>
     to any other conclusion than that the time has 
     <lb/>
     come when every man whether public or private, 
     <lb/>
     who wishes to save the county and preserve the 
     <lb/>
     connection with the mother country, should 
     <lb/>
     speak out boldly and manfully, irrespective of 
     <lb/>
     any personal consideration. Holding the senti<lb break="no"/>ments I do - believing that the crisis has come 
     <lb/>
     when we must decide whether we shall be annex<lb break="no"/>ed to the United States or remain connected with 
     <lb/>
     the Parent state. I would be the blackest traitor 
     <lb/>
     that ever disgraced a country if I did not by every 
     <lb/>
     means in my power urge upon this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     to prove equal to the emergency and take that 
     <lb/>
     course which, in a few months will secure that 
     <lb/>
     consolidation of British North America and the 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Crown of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     which I believe, which I know it is the sincere wish 
     <lb/>
     of the people to secure, and which can alone place 
     <lb/>
     these Provinces in a position that will at once 
     <lb/>
     give them dignity of position and ensure their 
     <lb/>
     safety. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having therefore, given the subject the most 
     <lb/>
     careful consideration, having submitted the pro<lb break="no"/>position of the hon member for Richmond to the 
     <lb/>
     Government and to the gentlemen who are opposed 
     <lb/>
     to us politically, but who are associated with us 
     <lb/>
     on this question, we have come to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that it is our duty to the House and to the coun<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
        
     try to meet in all frankness the proposal that has 
     <lb/>
     been made. We feel that difficulties have arisen 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the Quebec scheme which 
     <lb/>
     require such an arrangement as been proposed, 
     <lb/>
     in order to remove the objections that exist. I 
     <lb/>
     can only say, in reference to this matter, that 
     <lb/>
     Canada has accepted the basis of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme by a large majority, and that any altera<lb break="no"/>tion in the terms obtained from the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government must be even more favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. I believe that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     provided ample security for the interests of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, but at the same time there are none of us 
     <lb/>
     who have been associated with it who would not 
     <lb/>
     be too glad to obtain any concession that may be 
     <lb/>
     still more favorable to the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The Imperial Government and Parliament will 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity of largely improving that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, and giving us an amount of consideration 
     <lb/>
     that otherwise we might not obtain. It must be 
     <lb/>
     remembered that let Canada, Nova Scotia, and 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick pass any scheme they please, that 
     <lb/>
     does not unite British North America. The only 
     <lb/>
     means by which we can be united is by an act of 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament. The Government can 
     <lb/>
     only say what bill they will submit to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament; they cannot tell what will 
     <lb/>
     come out of that Parliament. This resolution, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, provides all the guarantees that can be 
     <lb/>
     had for a plan of Union being adopted by the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament, advised, during the passage 
     <lb/>
     of the act, by able and intelligent representatives 
     <lb/>
     of all parties, while it is under consideration.

     Mr. ARCHIBALD said:â€”After the very long 
     <lb/>
     and elaborate address to which we have listen<lb break="no"/>ed, it would not be good taste on my part to 
     <lb/>
     detain the House long, but I feel that occupy<lb break="no"/>ing the position which I have occupied on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, I could not sit silent on the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of such a resolution as that before the 
     <lb/>
     House. I regret greatly that in the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of this subject, it has been thought necessary 
     <lb/>
     by the Provincial Secretary to address the 
     <lb/>
     House in the impassioned tone and style of 
     <lb/>
     the speech to which we have just listened. I 
     <lb/>
     do not affect to be surprised at the course he 
     <lb/>
     has taken. Perhaps I could hardly have ex<lb break="no"/>pected him, under the circumstances, to take a 
     <lb/>
     different course; still I feel that if there ever 
     <lb/>
     was a question in which passion should be si<lb break="no"/>lent, which should be considered with calm<lb break="no"/>ness and deliberation, it is this. The question 
     <lb/>
     before us is the greatest that could be submit<lb break="no"/>ted to this country or this legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     requires that we should look at it soberly and 
     <lb/>
     thoughtfully, in the light of the events which 
     <lb/>
     are transpiring around us. The Pro. Sec. has 
     <lb/>
     referred to the action of Her Majesty's gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on the question of Reform, as afford<lb break="no"/>ing evidence that it is competent for us to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the question without necessarily refer<lb break="no"/>ing it to the people. He has alluded to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the effect of the proposition now be<lb break="no"/>fore the Imperial Parliament is to make an 
     <lb/>
     enormous transfer of power from the class 
     <lb/>

     appeal to the people we cut off one-fourth 
     <lb/>
     of the entire constituency of the country. 
     <lb/>
     Now whether it was right or not, is not the 
     <lb/>
     point. The question now is the power a Le<lb break="no"/>gislature possessed with reference to any 
     <lb/>
     change in the constitution. The moment the 
     <lb/>
     power is conceded in that case, it is conceded 
     <lb/>
     in this. If we can abridge the authority and 
     <lb/>
     power of those who elect us, we can deal in 
     <lb/>
     the same way with ourselves and with the 
     <lb/>
     power of the Legislature. I am free to admit 
     <lb/>
     that it is a power which should be exercised 
     <lb/>
     only in cases of emergency, and where prompt 
     <lb/>
     action is demanded. We have been told, and 
     <lb/>
     I am astonished to hear the statement, that 
     <lb/>
     we are proceeding to strike down the princi<lb break="no"/>ples of responsibility which have given free 
     <lb/>
     government to the people of this country.â€” 
     <lb/>
     Now, what is stamped on the very forefront of 
     <lb/>the Quebec scheme? That the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment shall be conducted on the principles 
     <lb/>of responsibility to the entire people, just as our 
     <lb/>own now is at this moment, so that the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the Federal Government are precise<lb break="no"/>ly those which we possess in this country.â€” 
     <lb/>Our Legislature is left to be moulded as we 
     <lb/>choose; our local administration, unless we 
     <lb/>wish otherwise. will be the same as at present, 
     <lb/>so that every principle of responsibility to the 
     <lb/>people is retained as it is now. In the local 
     <lb/>administration the responsibility lies to this 
     <lb/>people,â€”in the general administration, to the 
     <lb/>people of the entire group. The old altars re<lb break="no"/>mainâ€”the worshippers have still the same 
     <lb/>faith; but in the metropolitan cathedral, or to 
     <lb/>borrow a figure from the Presbyterian church, 
     <lb/>in the National Assembly, will be those who 
     <lb/>have the care of all the churches. Therefore, 
     <lb/>while we leave intact the government of the 
     <lb/>country, all we do is to have these matters, 
     <lb/>which are of common and general concern, 
     <lb/>transferred to the General Legislature. We 
     <lb/>are told that the time for changing institutions 
     <lb/>is the time of peace and prosperity, that the 
     <lb/>only time for union is when we can calmly 
     <lb/>and deliberately consider all the arguments 
     <lb/>and objections. Such a doctrine falsifies the 
     <lb/>entire current of history. When was ever a 
     <lb/>union effected between i dependent commu<lb break="no"/>nities with jealousies and rivalries which in<lb break="no"/>dependence begets, except under the presence 
     <lb/>of the most cogent necessities? What gave 
     <lb/>birth to the union over our border? Was the 
     <lb/>proposition submitted to the different States 
     <lb/>in time of peace? Not so. The union, such as 
     <lb/>it was at first, was cemented only under the 
     <lb/>pressure of a war, with the mother country. 
     <lb/>If the people of the States had waited for union 
     <lb/>till that pressure had ceased to exist, they 
     <lb/>would have been destroyed <choice><sic>peace-meal</sic><corr>piecemeal</corr></choice>, and 
     <lb/>would have had no union at all. From 1774 
     <lb/>till the time of peace the government had been 
     <lb/>carried on under a Congress which arose at 
     <lb/>the promptings of necessity, and assumed a 
     <lb/>centralized power, but when peace came the 
     <lb/>centralization ended, the States pulled apart, 
     <lb/>prejudice and passion denuded them, and it 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>
 
            <p>
     was not until ruin stared them in the face that 
     <lb/>
     they were again forced to unite with closer 
     <lb/>
     bands and in a more solid union. The same 
     <lb/>
     has been the case with the other unions of the 
     <lb/>
     world. The merest tyro in history knows that 
     <lb/>
     the United Provinces of the Old World com<lb break="no"/>bined only under the iron heel of Spanish des<lb break="no"/>potism. It was the hostile legions of Alva 
     <lb/>
     that created a union which peace and prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty would never have produced. All the other 
     <lb/>
     unions of independent States, that have had 
     <lb/>
     any permanence, are those which have been 
     <lb/>
     cemented under the pressure of urgent neces<lb break="no"/>sities. The Prov. Sec. has referred to a letter 
     <lb/>
     which has recently appeared, and which will 
     <lb/>
     have great influence. I will not undertake to 
     <lb/>
     say that I consider the picture of our dangers 
     <lb/>
     from Fenian invasion rather overdrawn, but 
     <lb/>
     this I do say that if I were addres<lb break="no"/>sing this house, and desired to make the 
     <lb/>
     strongest appeal on behalf of Union, I 
     <lb/>
     would have rested it on the very premises 
     <lb/>
     which that letter contains. I should have 
     <lb/>
     drawn conclusions from it the very opposite 
     <lb/>
     of these of the very able and eloquent author. 
     <lb/>
     There are certain considerations connected 
     <lb/>
     with the dangers so powerfully descanted on 
     <lb/>
     in that letter, which should press upon us with 
     <lb/>
     great force. Our position is this: We stand 
     <lb/>
     alongside a country which has suddenly deve<lb break="no"/>loped itself into the greatest military power in 
     <lb/>
     the world. It contains large numbers of armed 
     <lb/>
     and trained men, at this moment hordes of 
     <lb/>
     them are threatening an inroad upon our ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. We have opposed to us not merely 
     <lb/>
     the irradicable hatred of British power which 
     <lb/>
     distinguishes the descendants of Ireland who 
     <lb/>
     have emigrated to the United States, and who 
     <lb/>
     compose the Fenian element, but we have 
     <lb/>
     that hatred sympathised in by the great body 
     <lb/>
     of the American people, and no man can tell 
     <lb/>
     at what moment our soil may be invaded. Let 
     <lb/>
     us, then, look at England, and see how she 
     <lb/>
     stands. England fought for seven years to 
     <lb/>
     subjugate the rebellious States, and yet with 
     <lb/>
     only three millions to fight with, she was 
     <lb/>
     obliged to retire unsuccessful. Now thirty 
     <lb/>
     millions of people occupy the place of the 
     <lb/>
     three. They have been baptized in the blood 
     <lb/>
     of civil war, and acquired the skill and the da<lb break="no"/>ring which experience alone can give. Then 
     <lb/>
     look at the responsibilities which England has 
     <lb/>
     now thrown upon her. The entire Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Empire at the Revolution consisted of the 
     <lb/>
     American and West India Islands. For five 
     <lb/>
     years after the peace of 1783 Australia, a con<lb break="no"/>tinent larger than the United States and now 
     <lb/>
     divided into six separate governments with 
     <lb/>
     the dimensions and revenues of principalities, 
     <lb/>
     remained undiscovered; New Zealand was 
     <lb/>
     unknown. The 140 millions of India were go<lb break="no"/>verned by native princes, with the exception 
     <lb/>
     of a few thousands who owned the sway of a 
     <lb/>
     commercial company; Canada East was in 
     <lb/>
     the power of the French, Western Canada 
     <lb/>
     was a wilderness. Now the myriads of India 
     <lb/>
     are direct subjects of the British crown, and 
     <lb/>
     on her Majesty's government devolve the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of ruling this enormous popula<lb break="no"/>tion, itself fourfold greater than that of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. They have the care and pro<lb break="no"/>tection of the vast continent of Australia; 
     <lb/>
     they have still to defend the Islands of the 
     <lb/>
     West and of the East Indies. So long as she 
     <lb/>
     retains her ascendancy at sea she can protect 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
           
     these; but contemplating the whole Empire, 
     <lb/>
     including over thirty colonies, scattered over 
     <lb/>
     all parts of the world, consisting of every peo<lb break="no"/>ple and tongue, and situate in every climate, 
     <lb/>
     is it possible to conceive of a power but that 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain that could have so long dis<lb break="no"/>charged such immense responsibilities as the 
     <lb/>
     possession of this Empire throws upon 
     <lb/>
     her, and that too almost within the life time 
     <lb/>
     of a man, necessarily involves. See how dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from ours is the position of all these 
     <lb/>
     Colonies. Australia is at the antipodes, and 
     <lb/>
     is defended by its distance from a foe. India 
     <lb/>
     is separated from the only power that is likely 
     <lb/>
     to interfere with British rule by impassable 
     <lb/>
     mountains and trackless deserts, the islands 
     <lb/>
     of the Pacific and Australasia are protected 
     <lb/>
     by distance and their remote position; but 
     <lb/>
     here, all along the two thousand miles of con<lb break="no"/>terminous boundary between us and Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca, we have in our immediate presence 
     <lb/>
     the military power which makes British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica the weakest spot in the Empire. No Bri<lb break="no"/>tish statesman can fail to see that of all the
     <lb/>
     points at which the Imperial power can be 
     <lb/>
     assailed, this presents the elements which 
     <lb/>
     make a war most to be dreaded. Do we won<lb break="no"/>der, then, that despatch after despatch has 
     <lb/>
     been sent by the home authorities, requiring 
     <lb/>
     us to put ourselves in such a position that 
     <lb/>
     England, if called upon to defend us, can do 
     <lb/>
     so successfully. Is it any wonder that we find 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Secretary, time after time, al<lb break="no"/>most imploring us, if we have any desire to 
     <lb/>
     retain our allegiance to the Crown, to put our<lb break="no"/>selves in such an attitude that the Crown 
     <lb/>
     can protect us? I feel that if there were 
     <lb/>
     no commercial advantages to be derived 
     <lb/>
     from striking down antagonistic barriers; if 
     <lb/>
     our material interests even were not promoted 
     <lb/>
     by Union, we could not gracefully resist the 
     <lb/>
     expression of such desire on the part of those 
     <lb/>
     to whom we are indebted for protection, and 
     <lb/>
     of whom we are even new imploring aid. For 
     <lb/>
     they say, "we are ready to place the whole 
     <lb/>
     resources of the Empire at your back, we will 
     <lb/>
     defend you as long as you desire to remain 
     <lb/>
     with us; but we claim it a right which our 
     <lb/>
     position gives us to offer you advice as to 
     <lb/>
     the attitude you shall assume, and in which, 
     <lb/>
     we think, you can best be defended." Even 
     <lb/>
     admitting that there were no commercial 
     <lb/>
     advantages in the proposed Union, admitting 
     <lb/>
     even that we did not agree that the British 
     <lb/>
     government were right in the belief that Union 
     <lb/>
     would aid our defence, is there a man in the 
     <lb/>
     country who could look a British statesman 
     <lb/>
     in the face and say "we will accept your pro<lb break="no"/>tection, but we decline your advice?" This 
     <lb/>
     argument alone, the deference which is due 
     <lb/>
     from our position as the protected and defend<lb break="no"/>ed, to those who protect and defend, I feel to 
     <lb/>
     be irresistible. I have never hesitated in this 
     <lb/>
     assembly from the first hour when the propo<lb break="no"/>sition for Colonial Union was mooted, from giv<lb break="no"/>ing it my support. Since it assumed a definite 
     <lb/>
     shape and I became a party to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme I have felt my conviction of the 
     <lb/>
     soundness of the principles upon which that 
     <lb/>
     scheme was based, strengthened by reason 
     <lb/>
     and reflection. I claim no right to dictate to 
     <lb/>
     others their course of action. The gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     with whom I have been associated, have a 
     <lb/>
     right, if they choose, to change their views, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not feel at liberty to do so while I retain 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     my <choice><sic>presest</sic><corr>present</corr></choice> conviction. I have put my hand 
     <lb/>
     to public documents which bind me in honor 
     <lb/>
     to the same course to which my convictions 
     <lb/>
     lead. As I have said my opinion of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme is entirely unchanged. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that it guards our interests as far 
     <lb/>
     as we had a right to expect them to be 
     <lb/>
     guarded in an Intercolonial arrangement; but 
     <lb/>
     if larger concessions can be obtained, there is 
     <lb/>
     no member of this House or of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Convention, belonging to the lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     who would not willingly accept them. The 
     <lb/>
     resolution now before us leaves the question 
     <lb/>
     open only to a change in our favorâ€”Canada is 
     <lb/>
     bound by her Legislature to go at all events 
     <lb/>
     as far as the Quebec scheme. The Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces alone are dissatisfied, and if any 
     <lb/>
     alterations are made, they must be in the line 
     <lb/>
     of concessions to them. If we can secure 
     <lb/>
     guarantees and privileges not embodied in that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, it will be in entire accord with the 
     <lb/>
     feelings of this House and those members of 
     <lb/>
     it that attended the Convention, and as the 
     <lb/>
     proposition now before us will secure us at 
     <lb/>
     least the benefit of that scheme, and possibly 
     <lb/>
     some others, I do not hesitate to give it my 
     <lb/>
     support, and have much pleasure in seconding 
     <lb/>
     the resolution.
