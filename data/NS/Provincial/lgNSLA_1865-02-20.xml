               work would be found as satisfactory as was

               Mr. BLANCHARD did not mean to convey 
               <lb/>
               the impression that the work was perfect, but 
               <lb/>
               he' could say that it was the result et a great 
               <lb/>
               deal of labor. It would be remembered by the 
               <lb/>
               House that the hon. member for Kings, for a 
               <lb/>
               few days last session, professed a great desire 
               <lb/>
               to assist in the revision, but he soon get tired 
               <lb/>
               of the work. The hon. gentleman would not 
               <lb/>
               deny that in his own profession of medicine 
               <lb/>
               new works were continually coming out, an 
               <lb/>
               new modes of treatment suggested.

               Hon. PROV. SEC. said that to refer the work 
               <lb/>
               to a committee as suggested by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Colchester would be tantamount to 
               <lb/>
               making another revision. He hoped if that 
               <lb/>
               were done, they would turn their attention to 
               <lb/>
               an act which was at present giving the govern<lb break="no"/>ment a 2good deal of trouble—that is the, chap<lb break="no"/>ter on ' Public Instruction." (Lauehter.)
