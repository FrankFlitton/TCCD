     pay duties upon the goods that were exported 
     <lb/>
     from this Province and then go to a district 
     <lb/>
     which had no representation in the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of the island, where the government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, in fact, had no jurisdiction whatever. 
     <lb/>
     The only excuse for the law was the allegation 
     <lb/>
     that certain parties had been in the habit of 
     <lb/>
     carrying on an illicit trade. Goods were ex<lb break="no"/>ported in bond ostensibly for the trade, and 
     <lb/>
     were subsequently brought back here without 
     <lb/>
     payment of any duty. He believed that there 
     <lb/>
     was only one way of preventing such proceedings, 
     <lb/>
     and that was, the imposition of an extremely 
     <lb/>
     high penalty upon the guilty parties. Mr. To- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     bin also took occasion to allude to the Consular 
     <lb/>
     fees, which were considered a great nuisance to 
     <lb/>
     trade. He then presented a petition, signed by 
     <lb/>
     56 leading merchants of the City of Halifax, re<lb break="no"/>lative to the act in question. He also presented 
     <lb/>
     two certificates from masters of vessels, in illus<lb break="no"/>tration of the subject he had brought to the 
     <lb/>
     notice of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The papers in connection with the subject 
     <lb/>
     were referred, on motion of Mr. Tobin, to the 
     <lb/>
     committee on Trade and Manufactures.

            <p>
     The House then adjourned.

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     bear in other dependencies of the empire. For 
     <lb/>
     instance, they are taxed for the support of schools, 
     <lb/>
     though they have some of their own. The me<lb break="no"/>morial was accompanied by letters from His

     Excellency the Lieutenant Governor and from 
     <lb/>
     General Doyle in support of the prayer of the 
     <lb/>
     petitioners.

     he did not rise to present any petition on the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName> said:—I beg 
     <lb/>
     leave to lay on the table copies of correspon<lb break="no"/>dence relative to the fisheries and, in doing so, 
     <lb/>
     I may express my satisfaction that the time has 
     <lb/>
     at last arrived when it is the power of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to vindicate themselves from the mis<lb break="no"/>representation to which their action on this im<lb break="no"/>portant question has been subject during the 
     <lb/>
     past year. For many months the charge 
     <lb/>
     has been circulated all over this Province 
     <lb/>
     by a considerable portion of the press that 
     <lb/>
     the Government had ignored the rights and in<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>


          terests of the fishermen of this country. I can 
     <lb/>
     only say that I think that the course pursued by 
     <lb/>
     the Government at the last session of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature—the great interest which they evinced in 
     <lb/>
     the protection of the fisheries, ought to have 
     <lb/>
     been sufficient to show the fallacy of the charges 
     <lb/>
     which have been brought against them. It will 
     <lb/>
     be in the recollection ot the house that I moved 
     <lb/>
     for a special committee to inquire into the 
     <lb/>
     question of the fisheries. That committee was 
     <lb/>
     composed of the Attorney General. and a large 
     <lb/>
     number of leading men on both sides, and I had 
     <lb/>
     the honor, as chairman, of bringing in its re<lb break="no"/>port, which asserted, in the clearest and most 
     <lb/>
     emphatic manner, the rights of this Province to 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries, and recommended that every pos<lb break="no"/>sible means should be taken for the purpose ct 
     <lb/>
     protecting them from the encroachments of the 
     <lb/>
     American fishermen. The American Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had, by their own act, and without refer<lb break="no"/>ence to their own fishermen, deprived them of 
     <lb/>
     the rights which for ten years they had enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     in our waters. The Government of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, therefore, emphatically committed them<lb break="no"/>selves to the policy of excluding American fish<lb break="no"/>ermen at once from the waters belonging to this 
     <lb/>
     country. That report, submitted by myself, 
     <lb/>
     was adopted unanimously by the Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     and the Government immediately took action 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject, and addressed a despatch to 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General and the Lieutenant Gov<lb break="no"/>ernors of the other Provinces inviting their co<lb break="no"/>operation—a cooperation which appeared to be 
     <lb/>
     most essential in dealing with this question, in<lb break="no"/>asmuch as the fishing grounds resorted to by 
     <lb/>
     the Americans do not exclusively belong to 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, but are also within the territorial 
     <lb/>
     domain of Canada and New Brunswick. Our 
     <lb/>
     object in addressing this despatch. with which 
     <lb/>
     was enclosed the report of the committee of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. was for the purpose of devising 
     <lb/>
     with the other Provinces a system of protection 
     <lb/>
     by which American fishermen might be exclud<lb break="no"/>ed from the fishing grounds of British North 
     <lb/>
     America. In order that no time might be lost 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with this question, the Government 
     <lb/>
     proposed that a member ot the Canadian Cabi<lb break="no"/>net should meet one of ourselves at Fredericton 
     <lb/>
     during the last Session of the Legislature there, 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of taking such measures as 
     <lb/>
     would effectually accomplish the object which 
     <lb/>
     we had in view. I mention these tests to the 
     <lb/>
     house to show how far we were from being in<lb break="no"/>different to the fishing interests of this country. 
     <lb/>
     A perusal of the papers which I am about to 
     <lb/>
     lay on the table will show that the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government. at an early stage of this question 
     <lb/>
     formed the opinion that if the American fisher<lb break="no"/>men were suddenly excluded from the privileges 
     <lb/>
     which they had enjoyed for so long a time, dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties of a very serious character might arise 
     <lb/>
     between the United States and Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     which would operate against the renewal of a 
     <lb/>
     treaty. This view was presented in a very 
     <lb/>
     strong manner, as will be seen by a Minute of 
     <lb/>
     Council from their Government in reply, em<lb break="no"/>bodied in these papers. It is impossible, I must 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
          

     state, to bring the whole of this correspondence 
     <lb/>
     here, because certain portions of it were ot a 
     <lb/>
     confidential character that precluded theirbeing 
     <lb/>
     presented to the house. twill, however, call 
     <lb/>
     attention to a statement in the Canadian Minute 
     <lb/>
     of Council which shows that the Imperial Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had applied to the Canadian Ministry 
     <lb/>
     to allow American fishermen to fish in British 
     <lb/>
     American waters for the past year:

            <p>
     The Imperial Government were led to believe, 
     <lb/>
     from whatever source they got the information, 
     <lb/>
     that the peremptory exclusion of American 
     <lb/>
     fishermen from our waters would lead to such 
     <lb/>
     unpleasantness between the two countries as 
     <lb/>
     would prevent the accomplishment of a renewal 
     <lb/>
     of reciprocal trade between British America 
     <lb/>
     and the United States. This policy, it will be 
     <lb/>
     seen, did not originate with the Canadians, but 
     <lb/>
     was pressed upon them by the Imperial autho<lb break="no"/>rities, as is clearly shown by the clause that I 
     <lb/>
     have read. The Canadian Government went 
     <lb/>
     on to show the great interest that British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica had in these fisheries, and the great impor<lb break="no"/>tance of protecting them, and the inconvenience 
     <lb/>
     that would arise from any step that would seem 
     <lb/>
     an apparent concession to American fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     or would raise a doubt as to the entire right of 
     <lb/>
     British America to exclude the citizens of any 
     <lb/>
     other country from resorting to their fishing 
     <lb/>
     grounds. Yielding finally to the policy pressed 
     <lb/>
     upon them, they proposed as a compromise that, 
     <lb/>
     for one year only, a system of licensing Ame<lb break="no"/>rican fishermen should be pursued. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment of Canada drew up this Minute of 
     <lb/>
     Council, and sent it to the Imperial authorities, 
     <lb/>
     as embodying their views, and to show how far 
     <lb/>
     they were prepared to meet the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     latter in relation to this question. The answer 
     <lb/>
     sent by the Government of Nova Scotia will 
     <lb/>
     show that so far from their at once yielding to 
     <lb/>
     the proposal thus made, they drew up a Minute 
     <lb/>
     of Council expressing in the strongest terms 
     <lb/>
     their great objection to any such policy being 
     <lb/>
     pursued. They pointed out, as will be seen, 
     <lb/>
     at considerable length, the serious objections 
     <lb/>
     they had to a system of licensing American fish<lb break="no"/>ermen. The same despatch which they had 
     <lb/>
     sent to the Governor General and the Lieut. 
     <lb/>
     Governors, was transmitted to her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State for the Colonies. We there<lb break="no"/>fore placed the Imperial Government  in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to learn the views of this Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     also the fact that we had called upon the other 
     <lb/>
     colonies to join us in carrying Out these views. 
     <lb/>
     The answer of the Governor General contained 
     <lb/>
     the despatch of the Imperial Government on 
     <lb/>
     this subject, and in transmitting it he said that 
     <lb/>
     it was torwarded for the information of this Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, and that they would not reply to our 
     <lb/>
     previous proposal until they ascertained what 
     <lb/>
     were our own views on the question as it was 
     <lb/>
     then presented to us.

 <p>
     Having given that despatch of the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General and the Minute of the Canadian Go<lb break="no"/>vernment the fullest consideration, we felt 
     <lb/>bound to adhere to the policy which we had 
     <lb/>previously expressed ; and we drew up a strong 
     <lb/>remonstrance to the proposal which the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Cabinet, in deference to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>Imperial authorities, had agreed to. We ad<lb break="no"/>dressed this remonstrance to the British Gov. 
     <lb/>ernment, and we urged by every argument we 
     <lb/>could devise the adoption of our own policy. In 
     <lb/>the meantime the House will perceive that 
     <lb/>the Government of Canada had yielded the 
     <lb/>point, and had agreed, as far as they were con<lb break="no"/>cerned, to adopt the system for a year. We 
     <lb/>were placed in a very difficult position, but, 
     <lb/>nevertheless, we persevered in it until the 
     <lb/>very last extremity. We stood out until 
     <lb/>we received a despatch from her Majesty's 
     <lb/>Government expressing the strongest dissa<lb break="no"/>tisfaction with the refusal on our part, on 
     <lb/>a question of Imperial import, to be guided 
     <lb/>by their wishes, and even going further, 
     <lb/>and intimating in pretty strong language that 
     <lb/>if we continued to disregard their wishes we 
     <lb/>would not be in a position to claim their assist<lb break="no"/>ance in the event of our fishing grounds being 
     <lb/>encroached upon. The Colonial Minister sta<lb break="no"/>ted in a despatch which is among these papers, 
     <lb/>that they urged the adoption of this system for 
     <lb/>a single year, under the belief that such a con<lb break="no"/>cession on our part would lead to the renewal 
     <lb/>of reciprocal trade between the United States 
     <lb/>and the British American Provinces. If we 
     <lb/>had continued to resist the wishes of the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government we would therefore not 
     <lb/>only have given the deepest offence, but have 
     <lb/>laid ourselves open to a charge of having pre<lb break="no"/>vented the re-establishment of satisfactory com<lb break="no"/>mercial relations with the United States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It is to me a matter of intense pride that I am 
     <lb/>able to stand here and vindicate the course 
     <lb/>which the Government have pursued, and prove 
     <lb/>to the Legislature that everything that was pos<lb break="no"/>sible was done to carry out the scheme of this 
     <lb/>House, and the views of gentlemen on both 
     <lb/>sides. It will be seen that that Government 
     <lb/>only yielded to the wishes of the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment when expressed with a vigor and terse<lb break="no"/>ness that are not usual in the despatches of the 
     <lb/>Imperial authorities, and when it was urged that 
     <lb/>the policy which we had adopted as the true one 
     <lb/>would be detrimental to the best interests of 
     <lb/>this country. It may be said that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada yielded a much more ready 
     <lb/>deference to the Imperial authorities than did 
     <lb/>the Government of this Province. That may 
     <lb/>be offered as one reason why it is not advisable 
     <lb/>that Nova Scotia should unite her interests more 
     <lb/>closely with those of Canada. I receive, how<lb break="no"/>ever, an entirely different impression from the 
     <lb/>history of this question. In this instance the 
     <lb/>Canadian authorities have given weight and 
     <lb/>force to other more important and pressing in<lb break="no"/>terests, and have not exhibited that deep anxie<lb break="no"/>ty in these fisheries which they must do when 
     <lb/>they are immediately interested in them under 
     <lb/>the scheme of union. When the Provinces are 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     united, then the Canadians will have the same 
     <lb/>
     direct interest in the British American fisheries 
     <lb/>
     that this Province has. Then you will have 
     <lb/>
     brought to bear on Canada the same influences 
     <lb/>
     that prevail with us ; but I go a step further, 
     <lb/>
     and I call the attention of hon. members and 
     <lb/>
     of the intelligent people of this country to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the government of Nova Scotia is here 
     <lb/>
     proved to have been unable to oppose a policy 
     <lb/>
     which was concurred in by Canada. That pro<lb break="no"/>vince, on account of her immense territorial 
     <lb/>
     area, of her large population compared with 
     <lb/>
     that of Nova Scotia, now possesses an influence 
     <lb/>
     which overshadows that of all the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The moment, however, that union is 
     <lb/>
     consummated, the interests of Canada become 
     <lb/>
     identical with those of Nova Scotia. Connect<lb break="no"/>ed with her sister province, Nova Scotia will 
     <lb/>
     possess an amount of power and influence 
     <lb/>
     that, now isolated, she can never expect to 
     <lb/>
     have. We shall have the means, in the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of a united British America, of making 
     <lb/>
     the influence of this province felt in reference 
     <lb/>
     to a question in which so large a proportion 
     <lb/>
     of the people have the deepest interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This tax was simply imposed for a single year 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of establishing in the most un<lb break="no"/>equivocal manner the right of British Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans to exclude the citizens of any foreign 
     <lb/>
     power from their fishing grounds. I may be 
     <lb/>
     asked what shall be the course during the pre<lb break="no"/>sent year. I must frankly state to you that the 
     <lb/>
     same policy must probably be pursued, simply 
     <lb/>
     for the reason that the delay which has taken 
     <lb/>
     place in accomplishing the union of the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     would prevent the question receiving the only 
     <lb/>
     decisive consideration that it would have been 
     <lb/>
     possible to give it. As far as I have been able 
     <lb/>
     to learn by communication with the members of 
     <lb/>
     the Governments of Canada and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, the policy of the present year will be to 
     <lb/>
     double the charge upon every ton of shipping 
     <lb/>
     which is allowed to fish in our waters—thus 
     <lb/>
     again re establishing the entire right of British 
     <lb/>
     America to exclude foreigners from its fishing 
     <lb/>
     grounds, and to admit them on whatever terms 
     <lb/>
     it may deem proper. The object of Canada, let 
     <lb/>
     me say in conclusion, was to defer to the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government until we were united and able to 
     <lb/>
     devise such a policy as the United Parliament 
     <lb/>
     may think proper to pursue. If the United 
     <lb/>
     States will not agree to liberal commercial ar<lb break="no"/>rangements, then I entertain no doubt that the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the Government of British America 
     <lb/>
     will be immediately to exclude the fishermen of 
     <lb/>
     that country from any anticipation in our fish<lb break="no"/>ing grounds. When I had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     conferring with the Canadian Government at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa on this subject, it was decided that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians should only receive such portion of 
     <lb/>
     the duty collected as was required to meet the 
     <lb/>
     expenses of issuing the licenses. The amount 
     <lb/>
     received by the authorities in this Province for 
     <lb/>
     licenses was $9371.69. The amount taken by 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Government must have been very 
     <lb/>
     much larger, and when ascertained, it will be 
     <lb/>
     divided between the Governments of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with the exception 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName> was not prepared to say that the 
     <lb/>
     Government could have acted differently in the 
     <lb/>
     position in which they were placed. It was 
     <lb/>
     exceedingly humiliating to think that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Province should have been so 
     <lb/>
     perfectly powerless. He had very strong opin<lb break="no"/>ions on the subject of the tonnage duty, and re 
     <lb/>
     gretted deeply that it should ever have been 
     <lb/>
     agreed to. He could not help seeing in the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada in reference to this question 
     <lb/>
     conclusive evidence of the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     this Province would be treated hereatter under 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. It was very obvious that our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries would no longer be protected, now that 
     <lb/>
     we were to become a part of Canada. He 
     <lb/>
     thought that the Government might have made 
     <lb/>
     even stronger remonstrances than they actually 
     <lb/>
     did, and not permitted the Canadians to place 
     <lb/>
     them in such a position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> looked upon this matter in 
     <lb/>
     the same light that his hon friend viewed it. 
     <lb/>
     He looked upon the action of the Canadian Go<lb break="no"/>vernment and the British Government combin<lb break="no"/>ed as the first step towards the entire depriva<lb break="no"/>tion of our people's rights in the fisheries At 
     <lb/>
     no time hereafter would we have the same 
     <lb/>
     rights that we have hitherto enjoyed. Gentle<lb break="no"/>men looked at the question in a <hi rendition="simple:italic">couleur de rose</hi> 
     <lb/>
     aspect when they stated that this Province 
     <lb/>
     would be better situated under Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     If the British Government, which we had al<lb break="no"/>ways regarded as the mightiest power in the 
     <lb/>
     world, did not feel itself able to assert the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this country, what could we 
     <lb/>
     expect from that feeble "Dominion" which was 
     <lb/>
     about being formed? The impression made on 
     <lb/>
     his mind by hearing the despatches read was 
     <lb/>
     that the Canadians were at the bottom of this 
     <lb/>
     arrangement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TOBI2">Mr. TOBIN</persName> believed that if the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces had been represented in the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Government, this system of licensing American 
     <lb/>
     vessels would never have been agreed to. When 
     <lb/>
     Canada and New Brunswick admitted the sys<lb break="no"/>tem it was impossible for Nova Scotia to take 
     <lb/>
     any other course than she did. This was a for<lb break="no"/>cible illustration of the detrimental effects of the 
     <lb/>
     system of isolation that now prevailed among 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces of British America. He disap<lb break="no"/>proved entirely of the license system, and trust<lb break="no"/>ed it would not be continued. The American 
     <lb/>
     Government had not made a single concession 
     <lb/>
     to these Provinces. For instance, when an at<lb break="no"/>tempt was made in Congress to reduce the duty 
     <lb/>
     on coal, it was defeated. Such a fact was cer<lb break="no"/>tainly surprizing in view of the large interest 
     <lb/>
     Americans had in the collieries of this country. 
     <lb/>
     He was not prepared to grant a single license 
     <lb/>
     whether for one or for five dollars. Mr. Tobin 
     <lb/>
     then went on to refer to the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries were carried on in the Gulf by 
     <lb/>
     American fishermen. Our most valuable 
     <lb/>
     shore fisheries had been almost entirely destroy<lb break="no"/>ed by the system persued for some years by the 
     <lb/>
     Americans. He believed that under Confed<lb break="no"/>eration this question of the fisheries would re<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
         

ceive the most ample consideration, and our in<lb break="no"/>terests would be better protected than they 
     <lb/>
     could be under existing circumstances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COFF1">Mr. COFFIN</persName> did not attribute any blame to 
     <lb/>
     the government for the course they had taken, 
     <lb/>
     for apparently they had done all in their power 
     <lb/>
     to protect the fisheries. He looked with much 
     <lb/>
     astonishment and regret upon the action of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial government, and he was much afraid 
     <lb/>
     that our fisheries might now be considered vir<lb break="no"/>tually taken from us. He did not expect that 
     <lb/>
     when we were confederated with Canada, 
     <lb/>
     our rights and interests would be any better 
     <lb/>
     considered than they are now.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS10">Mr. ROSS</persName> could not be persuaded that this 
     <lb/>
     great Confederation, from which hon. Gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite appeared to expect so much, would 
     <lb/>
     ever be able to protect our fisheries. He did 
     <lb/>
     not believe that the large majority of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     representatives who would control the Confed<lb break="no"/>erate Parliament would take the same view of 
     <lb/>
     the fishery question that our representatives 
     <lb/>
     would. The large agricultural interests of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada would be predominant and overwhelm the 
     <lb/>
     voice of Nova Scotia, which is so deeply inter<lb break="no"/>ested in these fisheries. There were certain 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen even in this house who regarded the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the fishermen as inferior to import<lb break="no"/>ance to other interests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> said that he had lived for 
     <lb/>
     very many years in the centre of the great her<lb break="no"/>ring and mackerel fishery. His opinion, deriv<lb break="no"/>ed from observation and experience, was that 
     <lb/>
     the protection of the fishermen of this Province 
     <lb/>
     is utterly valueless. It should not be forgotten 
     <lb/>
     that Canada, New Brunswick and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island possess ten miles of valuable fish<lb break="no"/>ery ground for every one belonging to Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. Our mackerel fishery really extended 
     <lb/>
     from Port Hood to Cheticamp; as respects that 
     <lb/>
     between Scattarie and Cape North, it was com<lb break="no"/>paratively valueless. No one, however, would 
     <lb/>
     be better pleased than himself if the question 
     <lb/>
     of the fisheries could be used successfully to 
     <lb/>
     bring back the Americans to reciprocity. He 
     <lb/>
     thought the Government had done their duty in 
     <lb/>
     remonstrating as they did against the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of the license system. The history of the 
     <lb/>
     whole question showed the necessity of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. As at present situated, we could not 
     <lb/>
     influence the action of Canada and the other 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, which had large territorial rights in 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries of British America.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TOBI2">Mr. TOBIN</persName> said that it was the abuse of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries by the Americans that had so largely 
     <lb/>
     injured some of the fishing grounds, which 
     <lb/>
     years ago had been very valuable to our people. 
     <lb/>
     For many years the mackerel fishery of this 
     <lb/>
     country had declined, in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     system pursued by the Americans. St. Mar<lb break="no"/>garet's Bay, where fish had formerly been so 
     <lb/>
     plentiful, was a case in point; the fishermen of 
     <lb/>
     that bay were now obliged to go to the Labra<lb break="no"/>dor and the North Shore to catch fish. The 
     <lb/>
     system of feeding the fish, pursued by the Ame<lb break="no"/>ricans to so large an extent, was among the 
     <lb/>
     causes that had tended to injure the fishery

     ground close to our own shores.

     <lb/>
     Americans could catch. It was an exploded 
     <lb/>
     idea that the Americans drew off the fish by 
     <lb/>
     feeding them. He believed that our own ves<lb break="no"/>sels caught as much fish as the same number 
     <lb/>
     of American vessels that name into our bays. 
     <lb/>
     One sudden gale of wind, he knew, did more 
     <lb/>
     damage to the fisheries, did more to drive them 
     <lb/>
     off than any system pursued by the Americans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROV. SEC</persName>. said that no one could 
     <lb/>
     presume to say that it was not of the most 
     <lb/>
     vital consequence to the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     Province that our fishing grounds should 
     <lb/>
     be protected, and that we should exclude 
     <lb/>
     from them the American fishermen, unless 
     <lb/>
     we received from them such concessions as 
     <lb/>
     would be equivalent to the privileges they 
     <lb/>
     would obtain. He contended that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent position of the fisheries arose altoge<lb break="no"/>ther from the disunion of the Provinces. As 
     <lb/>
     it was now, the voice of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     was unable to influence Provinces which 
     <lb/>
     were not now bound to us by those social, 
     <lb/>
     political and commercial ties that would 
     <lb/>
     exist when British America was one Confe<lb break="no"/>deracy, animated by a common sympathy 
     <lb/>
     and interest. When gentlemen who now 
     <lb/>
     so forcibly expressed their views in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the fisheries were able to make 
     <lb/>
     themselves heard in a Confederate Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, no doubt their voice would have the 
     <lb/>
     effect it ought to have. The papers on the 
     <lb/>
     table proved conclusively that the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Government was fully alive to the great va<lb break="no"/>lue of these fishery grounds, and of the in<lb break="no"/>disputable right of British America to enjoy 
     <lb/>
     them exclusively. So far as the policy of 
     <lb/>
     Canada went, it was to modify the proposal 
     <lb/>
     of the Imperial Government. The course 
     <lb/>
     pursued by the Government of this Province, 
     <lb/>
     he was glad to find, was heartily approved 
     <lb/>
     by gentlemen opposite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS10">Mr. ROSS</persName> said that it was well known to 
     <lb/>
     the members from Cape Breton that from 
     <lb/>
     Cape North to Scattarie there was hardly a 
     <lb/>
     creek or harbour Where valuable fisheries 
     <lb/>
     did not exist. During the year 1855 Ame<lb break="no"/>rican vessels got fares off the harbor of Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, and indeed within it. He only called 
     <lb/>
     attention to this fact for the purpose of cor<lb break="no"/>recting a misapprehension of the hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Inverness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The papers presented by the Provincial 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PROVINCIAL SECRETARY</persName> then asked 
     <lb/>
     permission to introduce an Act to amend 
     <lb/>
     Chapter 3 R. S., " of the duration of and re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the General Assembly." He 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       

     explained that in consequence of the great 
     <lb/>
     change which was about being made in the 
     <lb/>
     government of British America, a very large 
     <lb/>
     portion of the duties which had hitherto de<lb break="no"/>volved upon the Local Legislature of this 
     <lb/>
     Province would be transferred to the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of the "Dominion of Canada." Under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances it was necessary to re<lb break="no"/>model our local constitution, and according<lb break="no"/>ly in the present act it was proposed to 
     <lb/>
     diminish the number of representatives in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Assembly. It was proposed 
     <lb/>
     to give each county in the Province two 
     <lb/>
     members. To Pictou and Halifax respect<lb break="no"/>fully, however, there would be given an 
     <lb/>
     additional member, in consequence of their 
     <lb/>
     large population compared with other coun<lb break="no"/>ties. Of course it would be at once appar<lb break="no"/>ent that the bill did not provide an equal 
     <lb/>
     representation according to population for 
     <lb/>
     the several counties. The government of 
     <lb/>
     which he was a member had in 1859 intro<lb break="no"/>duced a bill—which was now law—by 
     <lb/>
     which the representation was placed on a 
     <lb/>
     far more equable basis than it had ever been 
     <lb/>
     before, but, nevertheless, some considerable 
     <lb/>
     inequalities still remained. Such inequal<lb break="no"/>ties, however, existed in all countries, but 
     <lb/>
     nowhere less than in Nova Scotia. It did 
     <lb/>
     not seem practicable to reduce the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation from two members to a single 
     <lb/>
     one for the smallest counties. It was deem<lb break="no"/>ed most advisable to place every county on 
     <lb/>
     the same footing, with the exception of 
     <lb/>
     those two counties, whose population was 
     <lb/>
     so largely in excess of that of the others. As 
     <lb/>
     respects the Legislative Council, it was pro<lb break="no"/>posed to ask the house to agree to a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion requesting the Crown to reduce the 
     <lb/>
     number of that body to 18 or 19 members: 
     <lb/>
     that is to say, one for every county, and 
     <lb/>
     one additional for the metropolitan county, 
     <lb/>
     if it should be deemed advisable. The 
     <lb/>
     House would see that henceforth the elec<lb break="no"/>tors of the Province would possess larger 
     <lb/>
     electoral powers than ever before. They 
     <lb/>
     would have to elect two members for the 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature, and one for the General 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, except, of course, in Halifax 
     <lb/>
     and Pictou, to which additional members 
     <lb/>
     were given ; but in no case would the num<lb break="no"/>ber of votes given at the poll be less than 
     <lb/>
     three. He believed that the policy propo<lb break="no"/>sed would recommend itself to the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of the house and country.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. S. CAMPBELL</persName> said that the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of the bill was tantamount to a declara<lb break="no"/>tion that Confederation was finally passed

     <lb/>
     at this stage, but he would ask whether it 
     <lb/>
     was intended to alter the duration of the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     change was proposed in the bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAN2">Mr. BLANCHARD</persName> enquired if district rep<lb break="no"/>resentation was abolished:

     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO. SEC</persName>. replied in the affirmative. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> stated that in the Confede<lb break="no"/>racy there would be a variety of electoral 
     <lb/>
     arrangements. In Canada there would be 
     <lb/>
     district representation, whereas, in this pro<lb break="no"/>vince it would be all county representation. 
     <lb/>
     Again, whilst the majority of the counties 
     <lb/>
     would have three votes, others would have 
     <lb/>
     four and five.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO. SEC</persName>. said that the present ar<lb break="no"/>rangement was as fair as could be devised 
     <lb/>
     under existing circumstances. It would be 
     <lb/>
     in the power of the new house, he added, 
     <lb/>
     to make any changes they deemed advisa<lb break="no"/>ble.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LOCK1">Mr. LOCKE</persName> thought that perhaps it would 
     <lb/>
     be as well to do away with the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council altogether, in pursuance of the 
     <lb/>
     course adopted by Ontario.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO. SEC</persName>. said that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber would have an opportunity of dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the question when the resolution was 
     <lb/>
     introduced. He need hardly say that the 
     <lb/>
     Government believed it would be best for 
     <lb/>
     the interest of the country to have two 
     <lb/>
     houses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. KILLAM</persName> thought it questionable poli<lb break="no"/>cy to reduce the house down to 38 members 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. The matter ought to 
     <lb/>
     be fully considered. He doubted the pro<lb break="no"/>priety of the present house at all touching 
     <lb/>
     so important a question : it ought to be left 
     <lb/>
     to the new legislature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO. SEC</persName>. said it was certainly sur<lb break="no"/>prising to hear any one oppose a reduction 
     <lb/>
     of the house, when it was well known that 
     <lb/>
     a large portion of the duties it had hitherto 
     <lb/>
     discharged would be transferred elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
     He remembered reading, many years ago, 
     <lb/>
     the debates of the house, and was struck 
     <lb/>
     with the tactics pursued by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Yarmouth in respect to railways in 
     <lb/>
     this country. When he was unable to pre<lb break="no"/>vent their construction, he proposed a road 
     <lb/>
     vote of an enormous amount, with the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of making the country bankrupt as ra<lb break="no"/>pidly as possible, and unable to build rail<lb break="no"/>ways or anything else. Following a simi<lb break="no"/>
  

            <cb/>
         

     lar policy he would make Confederation as 
     <lb/>
     expensive as possible, since he could not 
     <lb/>
     prevent its consummation. He (Mr. Kil<lb break="no"/>lam) had, obviously, concluded that his 
     <lb/>
     whole efforts should be directed towards 
     <lb/>
     substantiating the arguments of himself and 
     <lb/>
     friends, that we would not have money 
     <lb/>
     enough, under Confederation, to carry on 
     <lb/>
     the Local Government. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>

            <p>The bill having been read a first time, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. PRO. SEC</persName>. then laid on the table a 
     <lb/>
     bill in reference to the departmental offi<lb break="no"/>cers and their salaries. It was obvious to 
     <lb/>
     the house, he stated, that the same reasons 
     <lb/>
     which would require a reduction in the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature would exist in respect to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic departments. It was therefore proposed 
     <lb/>
     to abolish the office of Financial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     and devolve his duties upon the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, whose salary would be reduced 
     <lb/>
     to £600 a year. The office of Deputy Sec<lb break="no"/>retary would also be abolished, but there 
     <lb/>
     would be a chief clerk in the office with a 
     <lb/>
     salary of $1200 a year. lt was also intend<lb break="no"/>ed to abolish the office of Solicitor General, 
     <lb/>
     whilst the salary of the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     would be reduced to £400 a year. As the 
     <lb/>
     larger portion of the duties now devolving 
     <lb/>
     on the Board of Works would be transferred 
     <lb/>
     to the General Government, it was proposed 
     <lb/>
     to abolish that office. In order to provide 
     <lb/>
     for the efficient discharge of the public bu<lb break="no"/>siness, it was intended to appoint a Treasu<lb break="no"/>rer, with a salary of £500, instead of a Re<lb break="no"/>ceiver General, and who must have a seat 
     <lb/>
     in the Legislature. To this officer will be 
     <lb/>
     given a clerk with a salary of $1000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     It was also proposed to have a Commission<lb break="no"/>er of Public Works and Mines, with a sala<lb break="no"/>ry of £500 a year, as is now paid to the head 
     <lb/>
     of the Mines Department, who will have a 
     <lb/>
     Clerk of Works and a Clerk of Mines, each 
     <lb/>
     at $1000 a year. In view of the great im<lb break="no"/>portance of this department, its head would 
     <lb/>
     be required to have a seat in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. He had no doubt that the house and 
     <lb/>
     country would accept the measure as an 
     <lb/>
     evidence of the desire and intention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government to make our local constitution 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation economical, and at the 
     <lb/>
     same time fully equal to all the duties 
     <lb/>
     which would have to be performed under 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The bill having been read a first time the 
     <lb/>
     house adjourned.
