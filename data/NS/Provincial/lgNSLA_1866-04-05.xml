  <!--   community, and there was no doubt that some 
     <lb/>
     remedy ought to be provided for the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that now existed. Under the law, Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial and City Debentures; were exempted 
     <lb/>
     from taxation, and the result had been that a 
     <lb/>
     large number of them had been sold for some 
     <lb/>
     time past. They had absorbed to some extent 
     <lb/>
     all the capital that was available, and citizens 
     <lb/>
     could now scarcely obtain the money they re<lb break="no"/>quired on mortgages at 6 per cent., which are 
     <lb/>
     liable to taxation. Lenders of money of course 
     <lb/>
     gave preference to those securities—Provin<lb break="no"/>cial and City Debentures—which they could 
     <lb/>
     obtain at 6 per cent , free from taxation. The 
     <lb/>
     result was, that persons engaged in building 
     <lb/>
     houses, and making any improvements, were 
     <lb/>
     actually brought to a stand still in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the want of money. Parties who 
     <lb/>
     had money out in mortgages were calling it in 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of investing it more satisfacto<lb break="no"/>rily, and a great many people were according<lb break="no"/>ly put to very great inconvenience, for they 
     <lb/>
     could not find any one willing, under existing 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, to supply them with the money 
     <lb/>
     they required. He therefore felt that it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary that the question should be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with immediately by the house. He was not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to say that the time had come when 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country would be willing to 
     <lb/>
     see the Usury Laws repealed. Some persons, 
     <lb/>
     however, contended that the legal rate of inte<lb break="no"/>rest might be properly fixed at 7 per cent.— 
     <lb/>
     Certainly it was not right that the industrious 
     <lb/>
     men of this country should be exposed to the 
     <lb/>
     great inconveniences they were now subject 
     <lb/>
     to from the causes to which he had made refe<lb break="no"/>rence. It was therefore necessary for the 
     <lb/>
      house to consider whether it would be wise to 
     <lb/>
     raise the legal rate of interest, or subject the 
     <lb/>
     securities in question to taxation, so as to place 
     <lb/>
     every one in the same position. He would, 
     <lb/>
     however. take another opportunity of bringing 
     <lb/>
     the question before the house in a more defin<lb break="no"/>ite shape. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. SHANNON said that there. was no 
     <lb/>
     doubt the money market in the city at the pre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sent time was very seriously affected, but it 
     <lb/>
     was well to bear in mind that the same state 
     <lb/>
     of things also prevailed in Europe. Some 
     <lb/>
     years ago money could be obtained easily for 
     <lb/>
     3 and 4 per cent in England, but for the last 
     <lb/>
     three or four years the average of interest had 
     <lb/>
     been about 7 per cent. A gentleman, now in 
     <lb/>
     London, had been of late withdrawing his mo- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ney from this city, and investing it in England 
     <lb/>
     since he found he could do so more profitably. 
     <lb/>
     Capitalists, no doubt, would be, satisfied if 
     <lb/>
     they got six per cent., but the fact was they 
     <lb/>
     did not get it, since their money invested in 
     <lb/>
     mortgages must pay taxation. It was neces- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sary to devise some means that would meet 
     <lb/>
     this difficulty arising from a conflict of securi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ties. There was no doubt. that money on mort- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     gages was, under ordinary circumstances, the 
     <lb/>
     most desirable mode of investment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon ATTY. GENERAL said that the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     had arisen from an attempt that had been suc- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cessfully carried out in the city of Halifax to 
     <lb/>
     tax the same property twice. It should be 
     <lb/>
     also remembered that the value of money had 
     <lb/>
     arisen very considerably in England on ac- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     count of the mania for speculation, and other 
     <lb/>
     causes. The money market in England natu- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     rally influenced the state of things in this 
     <lb/>
     country. It should also be taken into account 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     that other Banks had been established in this 
     <lb/>
     country. All these things contributedto make 
     <lb/>
     a scarcity of money. He did not think that 
     <lb/>
     the princrple upon which city taxation was 
     <lb/>
     levied was the right one. Was it right that the 
     <lb/>
     man who owned the property should pay taxes 
     <lb/>
     on it, as well as the man that lent him £500 on 
     <lb/>
     it? Considering the thing in its true light, 
     <lb/>
     the man who borrowed the money was 
     <lb/>
     taxed twice. This fact taken in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the causes to which he had referred , ex- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     plained the difficulties that were stated to ex— 
     <lb/>
     ist in Halifax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. TOBIN differed from the hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General as to the double  taxation on which he 
     <lb/>
     dwelt so strongly. A merchant occupying a 
     <lb/>
     store filled with merchandize, is taxed for 
     <lb/>
     every dollar of that visible property. On the 
     <lb/>
     other hand here is a man sitting in an office, 
     <lb/>
     with only desk and stationary before him, he 
     <lb/>
     has no other visible property ; but yet he is 
     <lb/>
    perhaps dealing in very many thousand dol- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>ars. Should not such a man be taxed for his 
     <lb/>business—moneylending—as much as he who 
     <lb/>is taxed for his barrels of flour and hogsheads 
     <lb/>of molasses? In fact the money lender had 
     <lb/>better security in mortgages than a. merchant 
     <lb/>could by any possibility have in his business 
     <lb/>relations with his customers.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    
   
            <p>
     After a few further remarks from Mr. Shan- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     non, the Attorney General, the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary laid on the table the resolution from 
     <lb/>
     the Halifax Chamber of Commerce referred 
     <lb/>
     to by Mr. Tobin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
     The House then adjourned.

     <p rendition="simple:centre"><emph>UNION OF THE COLONIES.</emph></p>
           
         

<p>
     Mr. ANNAND said :---I felt, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. member for Inverness, Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Donnell, addressed the House, that the time 
     <lb/>
     had come when I should define my position on 
     <lb/>
     the question of a Union of the Colonies, and I 
     <lb/>
     shall now invite the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>
     that position. I have alwavs been in favor of 
     <lb/>
     a union of the Maritime Provinces, and my 
     <lb/>
     views upon that subject entirely accord with 
     <lb/>
     views expressed by members on both'sldes. I 
     <lb/>
     need not now recur to the Convention held at 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, or to what took place 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere when the Convention was dissolved. 
     <lb/>
     These are matters of history, and I will mere<lb break="no"/>ly allude to the objections which I entertain to 
     <lb/>
     any union of the Colonies. I have always 
     <lb/>
     thought that the people of Canada were dis— 
     <lb/>
     similar to us in origin and pursuits, and that 
     <lb/>
     the fact of this Province being separated from 
     <lb/>
     communication with the world, excepting 
     <lb/>
     through hostile territory, rendered it politically 
     <lb/>
     impossible that a union in the present state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs could take place. I have also enter<lb break="no"/>tained, and have here expressed the opinion. 
     <lb/>
     that all the benefits of which we have heard 
     <lb/>
     can be obtained without union. Let me briefly 
     <lb/>
     refer to three of these,-in the first place, I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that all matters of material advan<lb break="no"/>tage relating to trade can be obtained without 
     <lb/>
     a. political union. What is there to hinder us 
     <lb/>
     to-day from arranging a treaty of free trade 
     <lb/>
     in the manufactures of the different Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces? I may be told that Canada will not 
     <lb/>
     entertain the proposition now; — perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     having the objects she has at present 'in view, 
     <lb/>
    might refuse, but in 1862 she was pressing 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="196" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-05_Page_196.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">196</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
            
     
    upon us such a mutual exchange. She felt 
     <lb/>then, and her leading manufacturers feel now, 
     <lb/>that they are the manufacturing people of 
     <lb/>British America. We are lower in the scale 
     <lb/>than New Brunswick, and it is therefore to 
     <lb/>the advantage of Canada. to have free trade 
     <lb/>between the Provinces. As regards the cur<lb break="no"/>rencies, I take it for granted that these could 
     <lb/>be arranged by the various Financial Secre<lb break="no"/>taries in a week—I said in an afternoon last 
     <lb/>year. It is not necessary then for these pur<lb break="no"/>poses to have a. political union. It is said 
     <lb/>again that we must have such a union before 
     <lb/>we can obtain the Intercolonial Railway, ena<lb break="no"/>bling us to have free and rapid commu<lb break="no"/>nication with each other—I deny it, and I 
     <lb/>point to the action of Canada in 1862, when 
     <lb/>she agreed with our delegates for its construc<lb break="no"/>tion. Why it was not built it is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary to say, and I will not say, because I do 
     <lb/>not desire to create irritation between the go<lb break="no"/>vernments of these colonies. That railway, 
     <lb/>thus bringing us into connection with Canada, 
     <lb/>however valuable it may be in time of war, as 
     <lb/>affording a passage for troops, I never regard<lb break="no"/>ed as of much importance in relation to trade, 
     <lb/>because while communication is open with 
     <lb/>Portland, there will be little or no traflic across 
     <lb/>the Intercolonial line. Though we may attach 
     <lb/>considerable importance to that line, yet I 
     <lb/>maintain it is not necessary to our existence. 
     <lb/>We live by the sea, and have free access to 
     <lb/>other countries,-but it involves the existence 
     <lb/>of Canada. She would have no access to the 
     <lb/>United States in time of war, and that railway 
     <lb/>would afford the only means of communication 
     <lb/>which she would have with the mother 
     <lb/>country. I therefore hold as I held in 1862 that 
     <lb/>however valuable the intercolonial railway 
     <lb/>may be to New Brunswick and Nova. Scotia, 
     <lb/>it involves the existence of Canada. I say that 
     <lb/>no political union is necessary, unless Cana<lb break="no"/>dian statesmen, using it as a lever, say you 
     <lb/>shall have no railway unless you unite with 
     <lb/>us. Holding these opinions, I ask why is this 
     <lb/>union pressed? Two years ago our country 
     <lb/>was undisturbed and our people were quiet; 
     <lb/>now this Province is a scene of agitation from 
     <lb/>Cape Sable to Cape North. These difliculties 
     <lb/>did not arise with us, our people were content<lb break="no"/>ed and happy until Canada, embarrassed in her 
     <lb/>own condition pressed the proposals for union 
     <lb/>upon us, and I can pointto speeches of Canadian 
     <lb/>statesmen which show that this was the cause 
     <lb/>of the agitation. There is another branch of 
     <lb/>the subject to which I will now refer,—the 
     <lb/>question of defence. It is said that if all the 
     <lb/>questions of trade, of postage, of the currency, 
     <lb/>and of the railway, could be arranged, the 
     <lb/>great question of defence yet remains. There 
     <lb/>would have been some force in the argument 
     <lb/>a year ago, but what has transpired since then? 
     <lb/>We have seen these two Provinces threatened 
     <lb/>by a. lawless set of men, who contemplated an 
     <lb/>attack upon us; and what was their programme 
     <lb/>of operations? If these Colonies were to be 
     <lb/>attacked at all,they wereto be simultaneously 
     <lb/>attacked ,-then away goes the argument about 
     <lb/>Union as a means of Defence. Does it require 
     <lb/>a political union to arm the people of these 
     <lb/>Provinces? No, Sir, it is quite sufficient to shew 
     <lb/>them a common danger and they rally with one 
     <lb/>will in the common defence as is being practi<lb break="no"/>cally illustrated at this hour. Take another 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     view of the question. I will assume that a 
     <lb/>
     union of the Colonies is desired, if not by us, by 
     <lb/>
     the mother country, and in speaking of the 
     <lb/>
     mother country I may say that all suggestions 
     <lb/>
     coming from that quarter I regard with the 
     <lb/>
     greatest respect, one reason tor this is that we 
     <lb/>
     owe her much—we have contributed but little 
     <lb/>
     to our own support and defence, and that gov<lb break="no"/>ernment throws its protection over us whenever 
     <lb/>
     it is required; therefore I say I yield great de<lb break="no"/>fence to the opinion of the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment but the question after all comes back to 
     <lb/>
     our own country and leak who are the best 
     <lb/>
     judges of the institutions, under which they 
     <lb/>
     should live? The Home Government have 
     <lb/>
     given us institutions of which we are proud, 
     <lb/>
     and which we work out practically,—they have 
     <lb/>
     never shown a disposition to deprive us of these. 
     <lb/>
     It is not necessary that I should repeat my 
     <lb/>
     objections to the Quebec scheme, but I will say, 
     <lb/>
     whether owing to a break-down of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to union, or owing to the opinions of the 
     <lb/>
     British Government, if a union should become 
     <lb/>
     desirable, and I should give up my own views, 
     <lb/>
     believing as I now do that sucha union is unde<lb break="no"/>sirable, which is the best way to bring that 
     <lb/>
     union about? Assuming it to be desirable, and 
     <lb/>
     that it will not lead to independence of the 
     <lb/>
     mother country as I believe it will; assuming 
     <lb/>
     that the relations between the Provinces should 
     <lb/>
     be changed, I believe and hold that the railway 
     <lb/>
     should precede the union Suppose, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, that difiiculty arose from a. Fenian raid, 
     <lb/>
     or for any other cause, and that a declaration of 
     <lb/>
     war being made, communication between the 
     <lb/>
     United States and Canada was severed—sup<lb break="no"/>pose union consummated, and parliament con<lb break="no"/>vened to meet at Ottawa, how would we get there 
     <lb/>
     now? We should have to travel through the 
     <lb/>
     wilderness of New Brunswick, and I therefore 
     <lb/>
     maintain that the railway should precede the 
     <lb/>
     union. Suppose again that on a sudden outbreak 
     <lb/>
     of hostilities it became necessary to suspend the 
     <lb/>
     Habeas Corpus actt, how would Parliament be 
     <lb/>
     assembled? '! The Government might assume the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility, but that responsibility is seldom 
     <lb/>
     assumed by any Gevemmunt, and we saw a few 
     <lb/>
     weeks ago that Sir George Grey introduced a bill 
     <lb/>
     into the Imperial Parliament in reference to that 
     <lb/>
     subject. Then I maintain we should have free 
     <lb/>
     trade before the union,—we ought to know more 
     <lb/>
     of each other—at present the men of Canada 
     <lb/>
     West know more of the people of the United 
     <lb/>
     States than of us—that state of things should be 
     <lb/>
     reversed before going into the union, we should 
     <lb/>
     become familiar with each other and have large 
     <lb/>
     business intercourse, I believe that by a union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada the Maritime Provinces must suffer 
     <lb/>
     largely in treasure, in power, and in influence.—_ / 
     <lb/>
     1 think I may safely say that not one other of 
     <lb/>
    these Provinces will have this scheme, it has  
     <lb/>been refused in Prince Edward Island and in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland, and they will have nothing to do 
     <lb/>with it now in New Brunswick, and need I say 
     <lb/>that at present nine—tenths of the people of Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia would reject it? Under these circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces, and yielding deference to the views of the 
     <lb/>Imperial Government, and assuming a union to

     be desirable I ask what is the best mode of 
     <lb/>
     bringing the union about ? I reply, by aban<lb break="no"/>doning the Quebec scheme in the first place. The 
     <lb/>
     action of our Government can be of no avail in 
     <lb/>
     this particular unless the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     express the same determination, because the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen composing the delegation to Quebec 
     <lb/>
     are bound to carry that scheme it possible, and it 
     <lb/>
     will rtquire the consent of all o them to abandon 
     <lb/>
     it. Supposing the scheme abandoned, there are 
     <lb/>
     three ways of approaching the question. One 
     <lb/>
     mode is to assemble the leading minds of the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces—and when I say the leading minds, I 
     <lb/>
     mean not merely the gentlemen representing the 
     <lb/>
     views of those who went to Quebec, but gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have taken a prominent part against the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme, gentlemen opposing any union at 
     <lb/>
      all, with a view to the full conside ation of the 
     <lb/>
     subject, just as that which any question requires. 
     <lb/>
     Public men from all the Provinces should then be 
     <lb/>
     assembled in such numbers that all cause of 
     <lb/>
     jealousy should be removed. Let me here say, 
     <lb/>
     to guard myself from misinterpretation, that any 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union, after being thus considered, 
     <lb/>
     must come back to the Parliaments and to the 
     <lb/>
     people for ratification. I care not how perfect or 
     <lb/>
     how advantageous the scheme may be unless the 
     <lb/>
     Parliaments and the people are consulted, it must 
     <lb/>
     fail to satisfy the country. Another mode would 
     <lb/>
     be to assemble Delegates, composed of the same 
     <lb/>
     elements, at the Colonial Office, where, in pre<lb break="no"/>sence of Her Majesty's Ministers, the question 
     <lb/>
     could be discussed ; but even in that case it must 
     <lb/>
     come back to be settled by our people.  but there 
     <lb/>
     is a third mode that recommends itselt to me : there 
     <lb/>
     is great diversity between the interests of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and those of the Maritime Provinces while the 
     <lb/>
     latter have many interests in common, I would 
     <lb/>
     therefore convene delegates from the four Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces and see if they can agree on a 
     <lb/>
     platformfor a union with Canada. I maintain 
     <lb/>
     that if the delegates were to assemble at the Colo<lb break="no"/>nial office, acting in detached parties, they wou d 
     <lb/>
     be cut into fragments, they would have no pol ic 
     <lb/>
     in common, and would be at the mercy of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian influences by which they would be sur<lb break="no"/>rounded in London. Any policy, therefore, re<lb break="no"/>commending itself to the people, must be ma<lb break="no"/>tured as I think by the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. Then would come up this 
     <lb/>
     question: -Should not these four Provinces go in 
     <lb/>
     as one asking for equal representation with either 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadas and claiming it as their right and  
     <lb/>
     throwing overboard the unsound principle of re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population, - taking care also, 
     <lb/>
     that their revenues should be properly secured.— 
     <lb/>
     If the Maritime Provinces could thus be brought 
     <lb/>
     to agree upon a platform then let the debate be 
     <lb/>
     adjourned to the Colonial office, and our dele<lb break="no"/>gates being thus brought face to face with Canad<lb break="no"/>an representatives, we might expect Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty's Government to force Canada to accept such 
     <lb/>
     terms as reason would recommend. Even then 
     <lb/>
     the scheme must come back to us to be ratified, 
     <lb/>
     and do you think that the people, having confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the Maritime Convention and in' the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government, would reject fair and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable proposals ? I do not recognize the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     necessity for a union, but I believe that in de<lb break="no"/>ference to the wishes of the British Government 
     <lb/>
     a scheme so arranged would be accepted.  That 
     <lb/>
     was what I meant when I wrote the article refer<lb break="no"/>red to the other day ; but I meant more—I meant 
     <lb/>
     that our relations with the parent country should 
     <lb/>
     be strengthened What is there in the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme to prevent a separation? I may be mis<lb break="no"/>taken, but I thought I could see in England, 
     <lb/>
     during my recent visit there, a desire to get rid of 
     <lb/>
     these Colonies, and an impres ion that by Con<lb break="no"/>federation England would be relieved of a portion 
     <lb/>
     of the expense which we cause at present. I was 
     <lb/>
     sorry to see in high quarters a desire that these 
     <lb/>
     Colonies should be got rid of ; and I apprehend 
     <lb/>
     seriously that Confederation, pure and simp e, is 
     <lb/>
     only another name for independence. I wish to 
     <lb/>
     guard against that ; my desire is that British 
     <lb/>
     America should remain British America I wish 
     <lb/>
     to strengthen our relations with the parent state, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe that the only mode of accomplishing 
     <lb/>
     that is by having representation in the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. With that connecting link we would 
     <lb/>
     always form a part of the Empire. What is it 
     <lb/>
     that makes California or Texas a part of the 
     <lb/>
     American Union? It is their representation in 
     <lb/>
     Congress and in the Senate. Take away that 
     <lb/>
     representation, and how long will they form a 
     <lb/>
     part of the Union ?  They are each large enough 
     <lb/>
     and far enough away to set up for themselves. 
     <lb/>
     The time may come when these Colonies will be 
     <lb/>
     required to come forward in defence of the mother 
     <lb/>
     country ; and if I were an Englishman I 
     <lb/>
     would never consent to any step approach<lb break="no"/>ing independence. I saw a calculation the 
     <lb/>
     other day which showed that the coal fields 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain, upon which her enormous 
     <lb/>
     prosperity to so great an extent depends, will 
     <lb/>
     be exhausted in about 112 years, but at 
     <lb/>
     the present rate of consumption that period 
     <lb/>
     would probably be reduced to fifty years, and 
     <lb/>
     America being in possession of the coal mines of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, of her fisheries, and of her maritime 
     <lb/>
     facilities, would become immediately the first 
     <lb/>
     maritime power in the world. Looking to her 
     <lb/>
     manufacturing interests alone England should 
     <lb/>
     preserve the colonies, and f she would make 
     <lb/>
     them a part of the Empire, the great field of ma<lb break="no"/>nufacture might be transferred from the old world 
     <lb/>
     to the new. Looking at the matter as an Eng<lb break="no"/>lishman, I would say, suppose Confederation 
     <lb/>
     takes place and the Province: become independ<lb break="no"/>ent their connection with the mother country is 
     <lb/>
     gone, and what if annexation should follow ?— 
     <lb/>
     Suppose America were to ally herself with Rus<lb break="no"/>sia. and she has strong proclivities in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion, even the safety of the British islands. would 
     <lb/>
     be imperilled British statesmen should view the 
     <lb/>
     matter in the light of expediency, and instead of 
     <lb/>
     endeavoring to get rid of as on account of our 
     <lb/>
     expensiveness, they should draw us nearer to 
     <lb/>
     England, making us a part of the Empire, and 
     <lb/>
     giving us representation in her Parliarneut. Any 
     <lb/>
    scheme wanting that element will. I believe, be de<lb break="no"/>fective, and any scheme which does not improve 
     <lb/>our relations with the Mother country will certain<lb break="no"/>ly eventuate in independence. Suppose that by the 
     <lb/>repeal of the reciprocity treaty Canada should

     <lb/>
     of union that will not contain a provision for an 
     <lb/>
     improvement in the relations of the Empire.— 
     <lb/>
     Looking at it from an English point of view it 
     <lb/>
     will be seen that the Colonies having separated 
     <lb/>
     from the parent state the Empire will become, to 
     <lb/>
     use a common phrase, demoralized, and its extent 
     <lb/>
     will be confined to the limits of the British 
     <lb/>
     Islands. That is the view in which the question 
     <lb/>
     shoud be regarded by British Statesmen. By 
     <lb/>
     such a scheme as that which I have proposed the 
     <lb/>
     onus of a. settlement would be thrown on those 
     <lb/>
     who really oppose it That is the mode in which 
     <lb/>
     I would approach the question of union,—I 
     <lb/>
     would be willing to advocate such a cause if the 
     <lb/>
     subject be pressed upon us, but I have yet to hear 
     <lb/>
     the first substantial argument in favour of Con 
     <lb/>
    federation. lf the policy of union be pressed 
     <lb/>upon us by the Imperial Government let us 
     <lb/>labour to) procure such a scheme as will be 
     <lb/>acceptable to the Colonies, — let it be a union of 
     <lb/>the hearts and wills of the people not one forced 
     <lb/>upon them. We were elected for a different pur 
     <lb/>pose,—the questions before the people at the 
     <lb/>time when we were elected were violations of 
     <lb/>law and order, questions relating to retrench<lb break="no"/>ment, to the suffrage, the question of turning 
     <lb/>out of office one set of gentlemen who had held 
     <lb/>power for four years. The question of a change 
     <lb/>in their constitution was therefore not 
     <lb/>before them. It would be a rash thing 
     <lb/>on the part of this legislature to say 
     <lb/>that the men elacted to carry ont the " well 
     <lb/>understood wishes of the people " should ratify a 
     <lb/>scheme of union against the repeated protests 
     <lb/>which have been made. if we are to be united 
     <lb/>let us approach the question in a right spirit, and 
     <lb/>not in the tone of temper which was indulged in 
     <lb/>the other day. Looking at the great future of 
     <lb/>these Provinces let us consider, not only what 
     <lb/>would be best for us, but what will be best for our 
     <lb/>children coming after us.

     Dr. TUPPER said :—The hon. gentleman has

     interest to the people of the Province that I feel

     it my duty, as a. member of the Legislature, to 
     <lb/>
     take immediate notice of the observations 
     <lb/>
     which has fallen from him. When an hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentleman undertakes, in the face of this 
     <lb/>Legislature, to lead the public sentiment of this 
     <lb/>country on a question of deep import to the 
     <lb/>whole Province, it becomes necessary that he 
     <lb/>should place himself in a position to receive the 
     <lb/>confidence and respect of the members 
     <lb/>of the House, and the peeple they , re<lb break="no"/>present. I think it there is a gentle<lb break="no"/>man in this Legislature-I will go further 
     <lb/>and say if there is a gentleman in this country, 
     <lb/>who, by his own conduct, has forfeited all 
     <lb/>claim to the respect and confidence of this 
     <lb/>House in relation to a great question of public 
     <lb/>policy, it is the hon. member who has just sat 
     <lb/>down, and I shall feel it my duty to put briefly 
     <lb/>before this House and country the grounds up<lb break="no"/>

     House what are they to think of a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     claiming the position, not of a leader of a. party, 
     <lb/>
     but even of an honest and straight-forward re<lb break="no"/>presentative of this legislature, who will dare to 
     <lb/>
     utter such a sentiment as that, when they know 
     <lb/>
     that here recorded in the public journals of the 
     <lb/>
     country is the declaration of that hon.member, 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     as a member of the Executive Council, 
     <lb/>
     asking the House to confirm the declara<lb break="no"/>tion which he had made, that so great and so 
     <lb/>
     many were the advantages of a. union of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America, that the time had arrived 
     <lb/>
     when it was necessary to clothe the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the country with power to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the question? (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     Dr. Tupper—The hon. member may deny   
     <lb/>
     what he likes. It is not a. question of affirma<lb break="no"/>tion or denial. The journals under my hand 
     <lb/>
     have only to be opened, and there upon the 
     <lb/>
     page stands the indelible record that no denial 
     <lb/>
     will wipe away, by which the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     committed himself to the policy of a Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     Dr. TUPPER—I shall turn to them for the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's satisfaction as he seems to 
     <lb/>
     have a very short memory, and show him the 
     <lb/>
     resolution, and the action of the government in 
     <lb/>
     relation to it. He, as a member of the Cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     actually initiated the policy of a Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America—he called not only the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House to the subject, but 
     <lb/>
     asked the several governments of British 
     <lb/>
     North America to hold such a Convention as 
     <lb/>
     would ascertain the best mode of dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the question. What are we to think of a gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who, having come forward as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the government and affirmed such a 
     <lb/>
     principle as that, and obtained the support of 
     <lb/>
     the House to that principle, now attempts to 
     <lb/>
     insult the intelligence of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country by telling them, years afterwards, 
     <lb/>
     " that he has yet to hear the first argument in 
     <lb/>
     favour of a Union of British North America."— 
     <lb/>
     He has professed respect for the British Go<lb break="no"/>vernment—but he has trampled down the 
     <lb/>
     authority of the government under his feet. I 
     <lb/>
     ask him to read the despatches which have 
     <lb/>
     emanated from the Imperial Government, and, 
     <lb/>
     if they are entitled to such respect, do they 
     <lb/>
     not contain arguments enough in favour of a 
     <lb/>
     Union of British North America? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have shown you in the outset that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member has treated the Legislature as devoid 
     <lb/>
     of ordinary intelligence when he has under— 
     <lb/>
     taken to say that the action to which he invited 
     <lb/>
     the attention of this House on a former occasion 
     <lb/>
     was invited dishonestly by him. Are we or are 
     <lb/>
     we not to suppose that the views and sentiments 
     <lb/>
     which he placed before the Legislature then 
     <lb/>
     were entirely at variance with those he 
     <lb/>
     actually held? If the hon. member had told us 
     <lb/>
     that like a weathercock be shifted with every 
     <lb/>
     changing breeze—that he changed his views 
     <lb/>
     from hour to hour, then I could feel that 
     <lb/>
     though his views were unworthy of respect, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="199" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-05_Page_199.jpg"/>
            <fw type="running">OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.</fw>
            <fw type="num">199</fw>
            <p>
     yet he had not attempted to insult the in<lb break="no"/>telligence of the House. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     has a policy for every day in the week—if he 
     <lb/>
     has not a public policy of his own he is the 
     <lb/>
     mouth-piece of every changing wind that 
     <lb/>
     blows. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member has referred to a question 
     <lb/>
     which is at this moment engaging the attention 
     <lb/>
     not only of the Legislature, but of the best 
     <lb/>
     minds not only in this Province, but in the 
     <lb/>
     whole Empire, and that is, the defence of the 
     <lb/>
     country. He felt, in view of the prominence 
     <lb/>
     this question has now assumed, that it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary that he should show to the House 
     <lb/>
     how he proposed to deal with it. He says we 
     <lb/>
     would he exposed to simultaneous attack, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore Union would be of no avail, inas<lb break="no"/>much as New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     Canada would have each to defend themselves. 
     <lb/>
     The Government of which he was a member, 
     <lb/>
     the delegates and representatives of that Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, did not state that the Union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America would be of no avail 
     <lb/>
     for the security of Nova Scotia. Is he not 
     <lb/>
     bound by the public record of his views, given 
     <lb/>
     as a member of the Government, that the 
     <lb/>
     citadel of Halifax was insecure without an 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway, which would enable 
     <lb/>
     Canada at the hour of need to come to the 
     <lb/>
     rescue of this Province? Then the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber must show this House that he can hold 
     <lb/>
     these sentiments one day and change them the 
     <lb/>
     next, and at the same time ask the Confidence 
     <lb/>
     of any man that sits on these benches. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
    hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND: I referred to the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway as a valuable measure of defence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. TUPPER: I would ask the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     when he comes here with his story of simulta<lb break="no"/>neous attack, whether 250,000 souls in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and 350,000 in Nova Scotia are as 
     <lb/>
     secure from the possibility of invasion as four 
     <lb/>
     millions of people sustained by the mightiest 
     <lb/>
     Empire in the world? Is not his story of 
     <lb/>
     simultaneous attack then swept away? But I 
     <lb/>
     will turn that hon. gentleman to his own re<lb break="no"/>corded declaration in another place. The 
     <lb/>
     Morning Chronicle, which has long been the 
     <lb/>
     property of the hon. member, was edited for 
     <lb/>
     years by a gentleman in the other branch of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature, and it is well known that a 
     <lb/>
     change was suddenly made in the editorial 
     <lb/>
     management of that paper. It was wrested 
     <lb/>
     from the hands of the gentleman in question, 
     <lb/>
     and the sole responsibility of editorship was 
     <lb/>
     assumed by the hon. gentleman who has just 
     <lb/>
     sat down. The hon. member felt that the 
     <lb/>
     question of defence lay at the very threshold. 
     <lb/>
     On the platform, in the press, and in the House 
     <lb/>
     he has proposed that the Legislatures of all 
     <lb/>
     British North America should pass laws by 
     <lb/>
     which they would supply the means to render 
     <lb/>
     defence practicable. He has proposed that 
     <lb/>
     laws should be passed under which the man 
     <lb/>
     on whom might rest the responsibility might 
     <lb/>
     draw the very last man from one Province for 
     <lb/>
     the defence of the other. Who is there that 
     <lb/>
     does not know that, having propounded that 
     <lb/>
     policy—giving the authority to draft our 
     <lb/>
     people to a power in another Province over 
     <lb/>
     whom we had no control—then, in the same 
     <lb/>
     paper, he held up, as a bagbear to frighten the 
     <lb/>
     people against Confederation, that they would 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation be dragged away from 
     <lb/>
     their homes for the defence of Canada. When 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     I feel that the hon. member propounds state<lb break="no"/>ments that are so entirely antagonistic, I feel 
     <lb/>
     that it is right that I should expose him, and 
     <lb/>
     Show the House and country how worthless are 
     <lb/>
     any views he may offer. I ask him, too. 
     <lb/>
     whether, feeling the deep importance of this 
     <lb/>
     question of defence, he did not propose the 
     <lb/>
     following mode in the pages of his journal, a 
     <lb/>
     year ago last January :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " We would provide for the defence of the Em<lb break="no"/>pire by a general tax, equally levied by an Impe— 
     <lb/>
     rial statute all over the Empire. This might be 
     <lb/>
     either a tax on property, on polls. or on im<lb break="no"/>ports, to take precedence of all other taxes, and to 
     <lb/>
     be paid into the Imperial treasury. About £28,<lb break="no"/>000,000 are annually required for naval and 
     <lb/>
     military expenditure. A property tax, if that 
     <lb/>
     were preferred, would raise the whole amount. 
     <lb/>
     But if it was thought better to collect the £28,<lb break="no"/>0.000 upon imports, the commerce of the Em<lb break="no"/>ire would yield the whole without any portion of 
     <lb/>it feeling the burthen." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     " Is there a Novascotian that would not, pay 
     <lb/>
     his portion of this tax cheerfully, and turn out, 
     <lb/>
     with arms in his hands, to defend the Empire 
     <lb/>
     besides? Is there one who will not cheerfully 
     <lb/>
     pay pound for pound with the Canadians, or 
     <lb/>
     with his fellow subjects in any other part of 
     <lb/>
     the Queen's dominions? Here is a scheme of 
     <lb/>
     National Defence, of which a statesman need 
     <lb/>
     not be ashamed, and our public men could not 
     <lb/>
     be much better employed than in pressing it on 
     <lb/>
     the notice of Her Majesty's Government." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The man who has made the bold proposition, 
     <lb/>
     that we should pay pound for pound with those 
     <lb/>
     who live in Manchester and London, whose 
     <lb/>
     representatives in Parliament control the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of this money—this man who has 
     <lb/>
     proposed to levy this sum of money—that is, to 
     <lb/>
     place a burthen upon our shoulders by an Im— 
     <lb/>
     perial Statute, for the benefit of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Treasury—has, at the same time, in order to 
     <lb/>
     embarrass this great question, urged upon the 
     <lb/>
     .people that they must reject Confederation, be<lb break="no"/>cause they willhave to pay a few cents of addi<lb break="no"/>tional taxation. Am I not right, standing as 
     <lb/>
     I do on the threshold of the greatest constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes,—on the threshold of a question, 
     <lb/>
     the rightful decision upon which, I believe, is 
     <lb/>
     to decide our very existence as British sub<lb break="no"/>jects, to call your attention to these facts, and 
     <lb/>
     ask you whether the hon. member does not oc<lb break="no"/>cupy the humiliating position of having pro<lb break="no"/>pounded, from day to day, on every feature of 
     <lb/>
     this subject, views as antagonistic to each other 
     <lb/>
     as night is from day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member asks how is Union to help 
     <lb/>
     our defence? I shall give him an authority 
     <lb/>
     which he may treat with contempt, but I doubt 
     <lb/>
     if there is any man in this Legislature beside 
     <lb/>
     himself that will endorse the statements that 
     <lb/>
     he has uttered to-day. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     says he is prepared to yield the most respect<lb break="no"/>ful deference to the opinions of Her Majesty.— 
     <lb/>
     Where is his respect when he tramples down 
     <lb/>
     such a despatch as this and tells you that he, 
     <lb/>
     though the originator of this great question, 
     <lb/>
     has not, down to this hour, heard a single ar<lb break="no"/>gument in favor of it. The Imperial Govern— 
     <lb/>
     ment said on the 24th day of June, 1865:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " You will at the same time express the 
     <lb/>
     strong and deliberate opinion of Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government that it is an object much to be de<lb break="no"/>sired that all the British North American Co<lb break="no"/>lonies should agree to unite in one Government 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="200" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-05_Page_200.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
            
     In the territorial extent of Canada, and in the 
     <lb/>
     maritime and commercial enterprise of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, Her Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     see the elements of power, which only require 
     <lb/>
     to be combined in order to secure for these 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, which shall possess them all, a place 
     <lb/>
     among the most considerable communities of 
     <lb/>
     the world. In the spirit of loyalty to the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown, of attachment to British connexon,and 
     <lb/>
     of love for British Institutions, by which all 
     <lb/>
     these Provinces are animated alike, Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government recognize the bond by 
     <lb/>
     which all may be combined under one Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Such an union seems to Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government to recommend itself to the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince on many grounds of moral and material 
     <lb/>
     advantages —as giving a well-found prospect 
     <lb/>
     of improved administration and increased pros<lb break="no"/>perity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there is one consideration which Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government feel it more especially 
     <lb/>
     their duty to press upon the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. Looking to the determination 
     <lb/>
     which this country has ever exhibited to regard 
     <lb/>
     the defence of the colonies as a matter of Imperi<lb break="no"/>al concern, the Colonies must recognize a right 
     <lb/>
     and even acknowledge an obligation incum<lb break="no"/>bent on the Home Government to urge with 
     <lb/>
     earnestness and just authority the measures 
     <lb/>
     which they consider most expedient on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the Colonists with a view to their own 
     <lb/>
     defence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Nor can it be doubtful that the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America are incapable, when 
     <lb/>
     separate and divided from each other, of mak<lb break="no"/>ing those just and efficient preparations for 
     <lb/>
     national' defence which would be easily under<lb break="no"/>taken by a Province uniting in itself all the 
     <lb/>
     population and all the resources of the whole." 
     <lb/>
    I will admit, for the sake of argument, that 
     <lb/>Her Majesty's Government—composed of the 
     <lb/>greatest military and political minds in the 
     <lb/>world—which have spent millions upon mil<lb break="no"/>lions in our defence, are ignorant upon the 
     <lb/> subject. I will admit that the hon member's 
     <lb/>opinion is worthy of more consideration than 
     <lb/>theirs; but there is not an intelligent man in 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia today that will not then admit that 
     <lb/>our successful defence rests on the Union of 
     <lb/>British North America. When Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>Government have arrived at the conclusion 
     <lb/>that this most vulnerable point in the Empire 
     <lb/>is only to be placed in a. position that will ena<lb break="no"/>ble England to unite successfullyr with us in the 
     <lb/>defence of these Colonies by this Union—that, 
     <lb/>our future security depends upon the accept<lb break="no"/>ance or rejection of Union—that this is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Imperial concern, since the honor and 
     <lb/>integrity of the mother country are involved in 
     <lb/>the security of every portion of the Empire; 
     <lb/>when we are told all this by those who have 
     <lb/>the best right to advise us, I ask the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber whether he has to hear the first argument 
     <lb/>in favor of Union—whether her Majesty's sub<lb break="no"/>jects on this side of the Atlantic should not be 
     <lb/>prepared to meet the views of the Parent State, 
     <lb/>and adopt such a policy as will enable her to 
     <lb/>co-operate successfully with us in measures to 
     <lb/>defend British-North America.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
    

            <p>
     The hon. member rose to correct me' in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to the Intercolonial Railway. He says 
     <lb/>
     that railway should precede the Union. What 
     <lb/>
     has been the past history of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
    Railway? The hon. member himself has 
     <lb/>laboured for twenty years to obtain the con<lb break="no"/>

    
            <cb/>
            
     struction of that work. Other public men of 
     <lb/>
     all parties have exhausted every means, going 
     <lb/>
     so far as to place a burthen upon our shoulders 
     <lb/>
     beyond the capacity of the country to bear, for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of securing the railway; but all to 
     <lb/>
     no purpose. Every sc eme melted away like 
     <lb/>
     the " baseless fabric of a vision," and there is 
     <lb/>
     not the vestige of a chance to get an Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway except by that means that 
     <lb/>
     secures Union. When the hon. member stated 
     <lb/>
     that the Railway which this Union will give us 
     <lb/>
     was essential to the security of Halifax, he 
     <lb/>
     only said what every man feels. Situated 
     <lb/>
     as we are in the presence of a gigantic power, 
     <lb/>
     the only security that this county can have is 
     <lb/>
     to be found in the fact that the invader does 
     <lb/>
     not trample down the rights and privileges of 
     <lb/>
     330,000 people, but of four millions of freeman 
     <lb/>
     bound together by the closest political and 
     <lb/>
     commercial sympathy, and protected by the 
     <lb/>
     greatest nation in the world. There is not a 
     <lb/>
     thoughtful man in this country, whatever may 
     <lb/>
     be his opinion as to the advantages in indus<lb break="no"/>trial an commercial aspects, who will not feel 
     <lb/>
     that as regards our security, our immediate 
     <lb/>
     Union is not only desirable but absolutely 
     <lb/>
     necessary. I use the term IMMEDIATE UNION 
     <lb/>
     with a full appreciation of its significance.— 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency has laid on the table the 
     <lb/>
     Despatches in relation to the Fisheries. Is 
     <lb/>
     there a member in this House who does not 
     <lb/>
     feel what is the meaning of the silence ot the 
     <lb/>
     British Government on the subject. The Im— 
     <lb/>
     perial Government have been told that the 
     <lb/>
     territorial rights of British Americans are 
     <lb/>
     about to be invaded—that they have every 
     <lb/>
     reason to believe that the hour is approaching 
     <lb/>
     when our soil is to be desecrated by liberties 
     <lb/>
     being taken with it by foreigners. The fisher<lb break="no"/>men of the United States are fitting out, and in 
     <lb/>
     the Senate of the county public men are 
     <lb/>
     coming forward and saying that the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     are determined to come upon our fishing 
     <lb/>
     grounds and asking the government to protect 
     <lb/>
     them by a fleet. Who is there then, that does 
     <lb/>
     not feel the attitude which we occupy to-day, 
     <lb/>
     when having implored Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment months ago, for the means of protecting 
     <lb/>
     our territory, at this hour we are unable to 
     <lb/>
     put before the House and country the state<lb break="no"/>ment that the are prepared to assume that 
     <lb/>
     responsibility? The mperialGovernment are 
     <lb/>
     evidently waiting to see whether we 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to adopt the advice which 
     <lb/>
     she was bound in our interests to offer.— 
     <lb/>
     They have emplored us time and again to com<lb break="no"/>bine and put ourselves in a position in which 
     <lb/>
     they can efficiently defend us; and they are 
     <lb/>
     waiting to see whether we shall respect their 
     <lb/>
     advice before involving Britain in a war with a 
     <lb/>
     great power. The hon. member for Richmond 
     <lb/>
     called attention to the fact, that some 400,000 
     <lb/>
     desperate men, united by the deepest hatred of 
     <lb/>
     British institutions, and assisted by the sym<lb break="no"/>pathy of a powerful people, stand in a position 
     <lb/>
     to do everything that they can to foster and 
     <lb/>
     create a collision between the United States 
     <lb/>
     and Great Britain, if they do not attempt an 
     <lb/>
     invasion themselves. It is no secret that that 
     <lb/>
     organization have taken measures to fill the 
     <lb/>
     fishing vessels with men who are determined to 
     <lb/>
     provoke collision between the two countries. 
     <lb/>
     In view of circumstances like these, is it not 
     <lb/>
     time for every loyal subject to lay aside all 
     <lb/>
     party and [personal considerations and unite

            <p>

     The hon. member says that the Delegates are 
     <lb/>
     bound to the Quebec scheme. I shal be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to answer at an early day the question 
     <lb/>
     put by the hon. member for Richmond , and I 
     <lb/>
     am only surprised that the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Annand) should not have awaited that 
     <lb/>
     answer before addressing the house as he has 
     <lb/>
     to-day. I tell the hon. member that this was 
     <lb/>
     the obligation that rested upon every gentle<lb break="no"/>man that was engaged in that Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence; it was by every constitutional and 
     <lb/>
     honorable means in his power to endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     bring about the great results that that scheme 
     <lb/>
     proposed to accomplish. 1 ask him what is the 
     <lb/>
     position of this question to—day? Has it not 
     <lb/>
     changed in its aspect since the House was 
     <lb/>
     called together at this present session? Last 
     <lb/>
     year an appeal was made to the people of New 
     <lb/>
    Brunswick, and an overwhelming majority 
     <lb/>was returned opposed to the Quebec scheme; 
     <lb/>but what has taken place since? No one can 
     <lb/>believe that so great a change has suddenly 
     <lb/>taken place as we know has actually occurred. 
     <lb/>The fact is this: the question was referred to 
     <lb/>the people at the polls; but is there a man here 
     <lb/>who believes that the election was decided 
     <lb/>squarely and fairly on the question of Union? 
     <lb/>No, the Government had been in power for ten 
     <lb/>years; they had drawn upon themselves that 
     <lb/>unpopularity which all Governments must ex— 
     <lb/>pect to encounter, conduct the public affairs as 
     <lb/>they may.   The opponents of Confederation, 
     <lb/>combined with the great body of those who 
     <lb/>were determined at all hazards to have a 
     <lb/>change of government, and the result was that 
     <lb/>an immense majority was apparently returned 
     <lb/>against Union with Canada. What has occur<lb break="no"/>red since? This Government, thus brought 
     <lb/>into power by the action of the people   at the 
     <lb/>polls, have modified their opinions on Con<lb break="no"/>federation through the force of circumstances, 
     <lb/>and influenced by the legitimate power and in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the British Government, have come 
     <lb/>forward, and in the Speech at the opening of 
     <lb/>the session propounded   a policy of Union of 
     <lb/>British North America. It is not a matter of 
     <lb/>doubt that whether a dissolution takes place 
     <lb/>or not, or whatever may be the result of the 
     <lb/>vote of no-confidence that has been moved, 
     <lb/>and on which a discussion is proceeding, New 
     <lb/>Brunswick is prepared with an unanimity that 
     <lb/>cannot fail to produce the deepest impression 
     <lb/>on the mind of every man to come forward 
     <lb/>and accept the policy of the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and accomplish a union of British North 
     <lb/>America.        
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The hon. member took occasion to outline a 
     <lb/>
     scheme. He has entirely abandoned his 
     <lb/>
    policy of yesterday. In the journal which he 
     <lb/>has seized for the purpose of writing down 
     <lb/>Confederation,   he has had as many poli<lb break="no"/>cies on this as he has in relation to every<lb break="no"/>thing else, and it is only the other day that 
     <lb/>he took the attitude that he and the 
     <lb/>opponents of confederation would   not pro<lb break="no"/>pound any scheme whatever.   Let me invite 
     <lb/>the attention of the House to the paragraph 
     <lb/>from his paper which was read by the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Inverness , and ask   whether he 
     <lb/>(Mr. Annand)has yet to hear the first argu<lb break="no"/>ment in; favour of' a Union Of British North 
     <lb/>America. On the 24th January, 1866, he says: 
     <lb/>" And what then? Are we indifferent to the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     
     
     
    future of British America? Have we arrived   
     <lb/>at the conclusion that nothing should be done? 
     <lb/>That we can remain forever in our present con<lb break="no"/>dition? On the contrary, while we claim that 
     <lb/>these Colonies, at all events the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, never can be bettered by any change 
     <lb/>in their political situation, we feel that they 
     <lb/>cannot, in the very natureof things, always 
     <lb/>continue as they are. The may, it is true, go 
     <lb/>on for years, and enjoy the r present prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty, but after all the time must come when they 
     <lb/>will be required to form new relations, whether 
     <lb/>with each  other and the Mother Country will 
     <lb/>largely depend upon the exercise of great tact,. 
     <lb/>wisdom, and forethon ht on the part both of 
     <lb/>British and Colonial statesmen." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

    

    

    

            <p>
     "But it is because. we feel that we must, 
     <lb/>
    sooner or later, make our choice between the 
     <lb/>mother countryand the United States, that we 
     <lb/>desire to see this question of Colonial Union, 
     <lb/>now that it is fresh in the minds of the people, 
     <lb/>set at rest; it is because we earnestly and fer<lb break="no"/>vently pray that our connexion with England, 
     <lb/>instead of being weakened, shall be strength<lb break="no"/>ened,that we repeat the opinion uttered two 
     <lb/>months ago, that, with the sanction of the 
     <lb/>Crown, a new Convention shall be held for the 
     <lb/>purpose of considering the future of British 
     <lb/>America—— what are to be the relations of these 
     <lb/>Provinces with each other, what their relations 
     <lb/>with the mother country, and what guaran<lb break="no"/>ties will be required to secure the unity of 
     <lb/>all."    _ 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In the face of this declaration on made in Janu<lb break="no"/>ary last—that the time had 'come when the 
     <lb/>people of this colony had to chose between con<lb break="no"/>nectionwith the United States of British North 
     <lb/>America or connection with Great Britain— 
     <lb/>he now undertakes to tell you that he has yet 
     <lb/>to hear the first argument in favor of Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I ask the hon. member whether leading 
     <lb/>
     minds of these Provinces have not assembled 
     <lb/>
     already to confer- on this question of Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND—No!     
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. Terran—Did not the Government act in 
     <lb/>
    good faith when they undertook to deal with 
     <lb/>the question, as one entirely apart from party 
     <lb/>politcs? When they invited Mr. Howe, Mr. 
     <lb/>Anderson, Mr. Locke, Mr Archibald and Mr. 
     <lb/>McCully to combine with them? If there were 
     <lb/>gentlemen in either end of the Legislature that 
     <lb/>stood in more deep and strong antagonism to 
     <lb/>the present Government than others, they were 
     <lb/>the two gentlemen who co-operated with us on 
     <lb/>this great question. The hon. member may 
     <lb/>say we should have selected him. Why, he 
     <lb/>would not have reached Windsor before he 
     <lb/>would _change his' opinion half a dozen times.— 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.)) Why he would have signed 
     <lb/>his name to a declaration of his opinions, and 
     <lb/>repudiated it two months after. All that could 
     <lb/>be done in the interests of the people was done, 
     <lb/>and although the" Quebec scheme may not 
     <lb/>meet with general concurrence, yet I believe, 
     <lb/>that the interests of the Maritime Provinces 
     <lb/>were pressed to the last point to which they 
     <lb/>could be carried in an Intercolonial Conference, 
     <lb/>and the only means by which an improvement 
     <lb/>could be obtained would be by some measure 
     <lb/>that would bring an independent arbitrament 
     <lb/>to bear . The hon. member has expressed 
     <lb/>great respect for the Imperial Government, and 
     <lb/>yet he degrades  Her Majesty's Ministers by 
     <lb/>saying that men recognized as the most honor<lb break="no"/>able and able in the civilized world—men of 
     <lb/>

   he most thorough education, calm judgment, 
     <lb/>and inflexible integrity—would be mere child<lb break="no"/>ren in the hands of the Canadian Delegates. 
     <lb/>He has placed the statesmen of the Maritime. 
     <lb/>Provinces in a position so contemptible that if 
     <lb/>he is to be believed it would be better that the. 
     <lb/>people should throw themselves, upon the 
     <lb/>generosity and fairness of Her Majesty's Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, than send Delegates who will be so 
     <lb/>insignificant in the presence of three or four, 
     <lb/>Canadians, and unable to obtain justice at the 
     <lb/>hands of the. most excited. and disinterested 
     <lb/>tribunal in the world.       
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The hon. member says he is against Union 
     <lb/>Of what use will he then be in a Conference? 
     <lb/>His only object would then he to obstruct and 
     <lb/>defeat that which. is the desire of the over<lb break="no"/>whelming body the people to-day—to carry 
     <lb/>out the wishes of Her Majesty's Government. 
     <lb/>The hon. member holds a Conference in British 
     <lb/>America, and then carries us across the water, 
     <lb/>and then sails back again. Having got the 
     <lb/>Conference to unite in a common plan— 
     <lb/>and it would take ninety-nine years to 
     <lb/>effect it if the honorable member had his. 
     <lb/>own way—and having obtained the acquies<lb break="no"/>cence of Her Majesty's Government, he would 
     <lb/>bring it back for an appeal to the people. I do 
     <lb/>not intend to say much just now on this point. 
     <lb/>.I have most unswerving confidence in the 
     <lb/>patriotism and intelligence of the people of 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia and of British North America, but 
     <lb/>I tell the hon.member as much clamour as he 
     <lb/>has raised, there is not a man in this House 
     <lb/>that knows better than himself how impossi<lb break="no"/>ble it is get a direct verdict on a question 
     <lb/>like this. The facts in connection with New 
     <lb/>Brunswick prove that they did not get a verdict 
     <lb/>on Confederation pure and simple. He knows 
     <lb/>right well that let any government, I care not 
     <lb/>what party, even the remarkable government 
     <lb/>of which he was a member, go to the country 
     <lb/>and instead of being able to obtain an issue on 
     <lb/>any measure,however loudly they may put it, 
     <lb/>they have to face the opposition of every man 
     <lb/>that wishes to displaces them.' They have to 
     <lb/>meet many of their own former friends and 
     <lb/>supporters whose hostility they have provoked 
     <lb/>in some particular question. Is there any one 
     <lb/>here who does not know that were this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to appeal to the people on the ques-. 
     <lb/>tion of Confederation to-morrow so far 
     <lb/>from their getting an answer on that question 
     <lb/>they would have to meet first? a formidable 
     <lb/>combination for the purpose of placing the gen-. 
     <lb/>tlemen opposite in power, and again, those who 
     <lb/>were supporters of the Administration—and 
     <lb/>thousands there are of able and influent<lb break="no"/>tial supporters so situated—entirely at vari<lb break="no"/>ance with. them: on the great question of, 
     <lb/>Assessment for educational purposes— 
     <lb/>Therefore I would defy you in that 
     <lb/>way to not get a verdict. But I am, not    
     <lb/>going into that question now. No gentle<lb break="no"/>man who was here in the first session of 
     <lb/>the House (1864) would dare to say that it is   
     <lb/>unconstitutional the Parliament to 01181389 
     <lb/>the constitution . They recorded a resolution 
     <lb/>by unanimous consent on the journals of this   
     <lb/>Legislature which authorized the charge of our 
     <lb/>Constitution without any reference to the 
     <lb/>people whatever I moved the resolution my<lb break="no"/>self; it authorized the Lieutenant-Governor of 
     <lb/>this Province, in conjunction with the Govern<lb break="no"/>
            

    <cb/>
            
     ments of the other provinces, to appoint Dele<lb break="no"/>gates for the purpose of devising a scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Union for the Maritime Colonies. 
     <lb/>
     There is not man who does not know that 
     <lb/>
     this proposition was for a more extreme change 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution of this country than the one 
     <lb/>
     now proposed. |The Quebec scheme proposes 
     <lb/>
     to leave to Nova Scotîa her own Government 
     <lb/>
     and Parliament as far as local questions are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, and to have a General Parliament 
     <lb/>
     with general powers in reference to matters 
     <lb/>
     common to all the Provinces; but the resolution 
     <lb/>
     of 1864 was to surrender the entire constitution 
     <lb/>
     of the country   and take away the seat of Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in all probability from Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and place it in New Brunswick, or wherever it 
     <lb/>
     might be agreed upon. It provided that scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Legislative Union should go into operation 
     <lb/>
     and become law—not when it had received the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of the people—but the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Legislatures, and Her Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     approval. With that resolution recorded on 
     <lb/>
     our journals is there a man who can presume to 
     <lb/>
     rise here and say that it is unconstitutional for 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of the country to change the 
     <lb/>
     constitution without an appeal to the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. McLELAN—The hon. gentlemen knows 
     <lb/>
     that the votes was not taken on the proviso that 
     <lb/>
     the resolution should. not be entered "unani<lb break="no"/>mously" in the journals.     
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     DR TUPPER          Every gentleman who did not 
     <lb/>
     record his name against the resolution is com<lb break="no"/>mitted clearly to the proposition which it con<lb break="no"/>tains. The hon. member for Richmond (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Miller) took exception to allowing the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion to be entered "unanimously." but it was on 
     <lb/>
     different ground He was not in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed union—he preferred the larger one; 
     <lb/>
     but he did not take exception to the resolution 
     <lb/>
     as embodying an unconstitutional principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. McLelan—l was opposed to the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, but l did not explain it at the time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. TUPPER—Then the hon. member is ra<lb break="no"/>ther late. What will his constituents think of a 
     <lb/>
     member who said nothing on unimportant 
     <lb/>
     constitutional question, and three years after 
     <lb/>
     comes forward and says he was opposed to it ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      The hon member for East Halifax went on to 
     <lb/>
     say that when he was in England he saw there 
     <lb/>
     existed a great desire to get rid of these colonies. 
     <lb/>
     I was a so in England at the same time the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member I was there. He will admit that I had 
     <lb/>
     as many opportunities as he of meeting and as<lb break="no"/>certaining the opinions of the statesmen, and 
     <lb/>
     people of England from the present distinguished 
     <lb/>
     Premier down to the humblest person. I am 
     <lb/>
     proud to say, that if that hon. member came 
     <lb/>
     away with the belief that there was a general 
     <lb/>
     desire on the part of the government and the 
     <lb/>
     press; and leading men among the people that 
     <lb/>
     England should part with these colonies, he 
     <lb/>
     brought back with him an impression totally at 
     <lb/>
     variance with those that other gentlemen, either 
     <lb/>
     from this or the adjoining Province, received 
     <lb/>
    during their visit. There is no question that 
     <lb/>there is a party in the House of Commons, fa<lb break="no"/>mlllarly known as the Cobden and Bright party, 
     <lb/>

            <p>The hon. member for Richmond called atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the significant fact that the New York

     <lb/>North America. You find that journal inspir<lb break="no"/>ed by the utmost contempt of British institu<lb break="no"/>tions, holding the Fenian organization up to the 
     <lb/>support of the people of the United States and 
     <lb/>telling them that the opponents of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion deserve their confidence because their poli<lb break="no"/>cy is a United States policy, and that is to 
     <lb/>weaken the connection between the Crown and 
     <lb/>the Colonies. Be this as it may, it is quite ap<lb break="no"/>parrent that the difficulties that have been<lb/>thrown in the way of the policy approved and<lb/>urged upon us by the British government have<lb/>led the press of the United States to suppose<lb/>that the reason why these Colonies  have re<lb break="no"/>fused to acceptihis policy is because. they pre<lb break="no"/>fer Annexationatoi the; American Republic to re<lb break="no"/>taining the present connectione with the mother<lb break="no"/>country. Lsay therefore that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber never misrepresented the public more gross<lb break="no"/>ly than when he declared thasgthere is anything 
     <lb/>like a pervading desire in Great Britain to get 
     <lb/>rid of these Colonies Go to the Ministry,the 
     <lb/>Parliament, and the Press —every thing by 
     <lb/>which the. public sentiment can be guaged—and 
     <lb/>you will find that it is in favour of keeping up 
     <lb/>the connection and preventing the dignityof 
     <lb/>the Crown being. tarnished in. the slightest de<lb break="no"/>gree.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Where is the man in this House or country<lb/>that will sustain the policy which he propounds<lb/>in opposition to this proposed union. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion of representation in the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment was propounded on the floors of this House<lb/>with an ability and an eloquence such as the<lb/>hon. member himself knows he has not the <lb/>slightest pretenaion to. He knows it was put<lb/>forth in the most attractive manner that it was<lb/>possible to put it, but it fell still-born upon the<lb/>intelligent minds of this country, and never re<lb break="no"/>ceived the slightest favour in Nova Scotia or any<lb/>other part of British North America. He<lb/>knows it was only a few years ago that the <lb/>same eloquent speeches were reprinted and put<lb/>before the public of England, and down<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     to the present hour not a man, with the slight<lb break="no"/>est pretension to statesmanship, has been 
     <lb/>
     disposed to give it a word of encouragement. 
     <lb/>
     I ask, then. in the presence ot the grave emer<lb break="no"/>gency,—of the dangers that threaten British 
     <lb/>
     America—when everything we hold  dear is 
     <lb/>
     imperilled, is this the time to revive a project 
     <lb/>
     which has never obtained any favour among 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country ? This same gentle<lb break="no"/>man who considers that 19 of the ablest men 
     <lb/>
     that this Province can send to Ottawa would be 
     <lb/>
     powerless (though they would constitute a 
     <lb/>
     number greater than is found necessary to decide 
     <lb/>
     the fate of parties in England), would be satis<lb break="no"/>fied with two votes is a Parliament of 650 mem<lb break="no"/>bers. Suppose we had such a representation, I 
     <lb/>
     ask you is it for that Nova Scotians would be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to place the enormous and oppressive 
     <lb/>
     taxation upon the shoulders that would be re<lb break="no"/>quired to sustain the army and navy of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and the expenses of any wars in which 
     <lb/>
     the mother country might be engaged?  
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>When on a former occasion I confronted the 
     <lb/>hon. member with the statement that the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity Treaty was about to be abrogated, the 
     <lb/>country will remember that he entertained no 
     <lb/>such fears.  Well the hon. member has proved 
     <lb/>a false prophet, for the treaty has been abro-  
     <lb/>gated. The hon. member now tells you that 
     <lb/>the United States do not want these Provinces. 
     <lb/>I do not require to labour that question. He 
     <lb/>tells you himself that the United States, if they<lb/>could grasp this Province, would become the 
     <lb/>first Naval Power in the world—able to dictate 
     <lb/>terms to the world. Does he think that eludes 
     <lb/>the scrutiny of the keenest statesmen to be<lb/>found in that Country—whose policy is to grasp 
     <lb/>where they can gain a foothhold and extend their 
     <lb/>dominion. Therefore I ask the hon. member 
     <lb/>if he has not himself shown you that there is 
     <lb/>sufficient inducement for the United States to 
     <lb/>obtain these Colonies; and I do— not require to 
     <lb/>take up your time with showing that the only 
     <lb/>means we have of resisting their encroachments 
     <lb/>is Union. Therefore let every friend of British 
     <lb/>institutions, every loyal subject, every man 
     <lb/>who is not willing to see our rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges torn from us, combine in this great work 
     <lb/>of elevating these comparatively insignificant 
     <lb/>Provinces into a higher position in the eyes of 
     <lb/>America and of perpetuating those institutions 
     <lb/>which are essential to our happiness and pros<lb break="no"/>perity.      
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I shall refer, before I close, to a few remarks 
     <lb/>which the hon. member has made in another place. 
     <lb/>He has taken a liberty with this house, and 
     <lb/>proclaimed to the people that there are traitors 
     <lb/>within its walls—that there are men who have 
     <lb/>treasonable designs upon the rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties of the country._ He would hold up gentle<lb break="no"/>men to the execration of the people by one one in<lb break="no"/>flammatoty publication after the other. I am 
     <lb/>now going to make a statement which other<lb break="no"/>wise I would not feel called upon to make. The 
     <lb/>hon. member for Richmond, in the exercie of 
     <lb/>his privilieges as an independent member of this 
     <lb/>house, put a question across the floor to the 
     <lb/>vernment in regard to one of the most impor<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="204" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1866-04-05_Page_204.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">204</fw>
            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
            
     tant subjec's that was ever before the people. I 
     <lb/>
     answered as I best could in the position in 
     <lb/>
     which I was placed. I listened to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member as he spoke, and although I was un<lb break="no"/>able to agree with him in his opinions respect<lb break="no"/>ing one of my pet children, the Quebec scheme, 
     <lb/>
     I felt there was a cogency of argument, a rea<lb break="no"/>sonableness and solidity in the case as presented 
     <lb/>to the house, that could not but make a deep 
     <lb/>impression on the people of this country. The 
     <lb/>hon member gave in detail every thought and 
     <lb/>feeling which he stated has weighed upon his 
     <lb/>own mind, and which had brought him to his 
     <lb/>conclusions I am not his judge; I know not 
     <lb/>what may animate him ; I am quite free to ad<lb break="no"/>mit that a gentleman may profess one thing and 
     <lb/>may be influenced by considerations very differ<lb break="no"/>ent to those which he portrays to the house; I can 
     <lb/>easily suppose that possible after the exhibition 
     <lb/>we have had to day; but justice to the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Richmond compels me notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the strong antagonism that has ex<lb break="no"/>isted between us, to say here solemnly and de<lb break="no"/>liberately that if he was influenced by any con<lb break="no"/>sideration other than that he stated boldly to 
     <lb/>the House, it was without my knowledge 
     <lb/>If he was looking to place—to a position in any 
     <lb/>delegation that might take place hereafter, be 
     <lb/>has not intimated it to me. I do not know of 
     <lb/>it; I am free to assert that he has never ex 
     <lb/>changed a single word with me to that effect, 
     <lb/>nor has he down to the present hour. I feel 
     <lb/>after the manner in which that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>has been assailed, it is due to this House that I 
     <lb/>should make this statement. But from whom 
     <lb/>does th a charge of treason come? Who is the 
     <lb/>first man to suspect dishonesty in his fellow ? 
     <lb/>The man who is himself dishonest! Who is 
     <lb/>capable of giving the fullest rein to the basest 
     <lb/>suspicions? The man whose own heart tells 
     <lb/>him that he could be tempted ! Whoever there 
     <lb/>is in this House in a position to accuse any of 
     <lb/>his fellow men of being a traitor, it is not the 
     <lb/>hon. member for East Halifax. I tell him at 
     <lb/>this moment the public sentiment of this town. 
     <lb/>as well as of this House, is outraged by the 
     <lb/>traitorous declaration made by that hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber in the open streets in the presence —— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL—Order, order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr TUPPER—Was it a violation of the orders 
     <lb/>
     of this House when the hon. member rose here 
     <lb/>
     to day and insinuated that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Richmond had been bribed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND—I never said on the floors of 
     <lb/>
     this House that an hon member had been the 
     <lb/>
     subject of a base bribe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. TUPPER--Nobody could put any other 
     <lb/>
     interpretation on the statement he made. I say 
     <lb/>
     if there is an hon. member in this House who 
     <lb/>
     is not in a position to charge any man with dis<lb break="no"/>loyalty, it is the hon member. I tell him more; 
     <lb/>
     he is known to have reflected the opinions ot 
     <lb/>
    other gentlemen—to be in close alliance with 
     <lb/>those who have occupied positions of public 
     <lb/>trust—who have recently returned from the 
     <lb/>United States; and the most intelligent minds 
     <lb/>in this country are deeply excited at the present 
     <lb/>moment by the fact that these persons have 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     openly declared that it is impossible for Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain to defend us. They feel that if they can 
     <lb/>
     indoctrinate the public mind with the senti<lb break="no"/>ment that the safety of these Provinces lies in 
     <lb/>
     transferring their allegiance to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, the loyalty of our people will be paralyzed 
     <lb/>
     by despair. Is it for these men, for a Press 
     <lb/>
     which reflects their opinions, to accuse any hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of being a traitor? Sir the loyal 
     <lb/>
     spirit of my countrymen will repel such base 
     <lb/>
     and unmanly fears, and united with each other 
     <lb/>
     find a safe position tor these Provinces under 
     <lb/>
     the aegis of the British Crown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND—After the lengthy reply of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Provincial Secretary, in which he exhibi<lb break="no"/>ted a good deal of temper unprovoked on my 
     <lb/>
     past, it will be necessary for me to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks That hon. gentleman has referred to 
     <lb/>
     an orginzation in this city with traitorous in<lb break="no"/>tent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. TUPPER—I said no such thing; I referr<lb break="no"/>ed to traitorous language being used on the 
     <lb/>
     streets.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. ANNAND—Gentlemen, he said, of high 
     <lb/>
     position were endeavoring to weaken the allegi<lb break="no"/>ance of this people to the mother country. I 
     <lb/>
     ask the hon. member in view of the dangers 
     <lb/>
     that he says threatens the country—in the 
     <lb/>
     presence of the existing emergency when men 
     <lb/>
     of all parties, in all parts of the country are 
     <lb/>
     arming to resist the common fee, if it is right 
     <lb/>
     for him to come forward to make these rash 
     <lb/>
     statements. The people have become so exas<lb break="no"/>perated at the idea of their privileges being 
     <lb/>
     swept away, that they are almost ready to come 
     <lb/>
     into conflict with those who would deprive them 
     <lb/>
     of their rights. Is this,.then, the time. to excite 
     <lb/>
     the people, when you require moderation and 
     <lb/>
     calmness? The hon member says that the 
     <lb/>
     town has been excited by observations made on 
     <lb/>
     the street In the first place, I did not believe 
     <lb/>
     that any hon. member, much less the hon. Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary, could allow himself for a sin<lb break="no"/>gle moment to bring up street rumours to this 
     <lb/>
     house. But what are the facts? An old and 
     <lb/>
     esteemed friend of my own—who differs from 
     <lb/>
     me on this question—met me at the corner of 
     <lb/>
     the street, and a good deal excited uttered some 
     <lb/>
     very extravagant opinions—that the people 
     <lb/>
     should be coerced into Confederation; and I, in 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of out-Heroding Herod uttered expres<lb break="no"/>sions that may be construed into disloyalty, but 
     <lb/>
     which passed away with the moment they were 
     <lb/>
     uttered. I say the expression was a hasty one 
     <lb/>
     —it was drawn forth by equally hasty expres<lb break="no"/>sions; and I may add I regret that it was ever 
     <lb/>
     made.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon gentleman referred to the inconsis<lb break="no"/>tency of my position. He charged me with 
     <lb/>
     being a weather cock. I am prepared to say 
     <lb/>
     that in the presence of this great question my 
     <lb/>
     own views, like those at manv others,' have 
     <lb/>
     considerably modified The views that 
     <lb/>
     l entertain today may be modified as these of 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary himself to-morrow, 
     <lb/>
     before any decision on his question is arrived 
     <lb/>
     at But I challenge him. in the presence of 
     <lb/>
    his House and country. to read from any resolu<lb break="no"/>

     from the late Government, of which I was a

     Canada I might refer to these papers, but I 
     <lb/>
     shall content myself at present with challenging. 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member to show that there was a

     committed to any particular scheme of Union. 
     <lb/>
     Legislative or Federal, by the resolution to 
     <lb/>
     which he referred. What was the object of the 
     <lb/>
     resolution at that time? It proposed a delega 
     <lb/>
     tion should be held with representativeas of the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces to consider the question with 
     <lb/>
     a view of its being set at rest. It was consider<lb break="no"/>ed, but so little noticed was it by the delegates 
     <lb/>
     at Quebec that a record was not even kept of 
     <lb/>
     the proceedings relative thereto. It was set 
     <lb/>
     at rest—no one being bound by any resolution. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>The hon. gentleman has carried us to New 
     <lb/>Brunswick and talked of the change of senti<lb break="no"/>ment in that colony. I have to learn that the 
     <lb/>people of that province are in favour of Con<lb break="no"/>federation—or that they are prepared to unite 
     <lb/>on any terms with Canada. I believe that 
     <lb/>they are not. My vîew of the position is this— 
     <lb/>that the Government being composed of anta<lb break="no"/>gonistic elements does not unite .the confidence 
     <lb/>of the people; but as respects the Quebec 
     <lb/>scheme the people, I believe are as much op<lb break="no"/>posed to it as ever before   But let us pass from 
     <lb/>New Brunswick to our own Province, and 
     <lb/>what do we see. What have we had in 
     <lb/>thîs country since the question came up, We 
     <lb/>have had three elections! Has any one of them 
     <lb/>decided in favour of Confederation   of the 
     <lb/>Quebec or any other scheme! 1 sees before me 
     <lb/>the hon member for Annapolis (Mr. Ray) who 
     <lb/>occupies the seat filled by the late leader of the 
     <lb/>Government, was he returned to go for the 
     <lb/>scheme? Nay, was he not elected to oppose it!   
     <lb/>Again, there is my friend Mr.Hebb, from Lu<lb break="no"/>nenburg who in spite of the Provlncial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary's exertions, was returned by a two-third 
     <lb/>majority against Confederation. Again : in the 
     <lb/>county of Yarmouth' the government could not 
     <lb/>get a man to run for them—the feeling there in 
     <lb/>almost unanimous against Confederation. Every 
     <lb/>constituency that has been opened since the 
     <lb/>Quebec scheme' was propounded, has decided 
     <lb/>against it, and with the full knowledge that 
     <lb/>nine tenths of the electors of this Province are 
     <lb/>opposed to Union, we are invited to change the 
     <lb/>constitution of the country without an appeal to 
     <lb/>the people. I am unwilling to easusmn that we 
     <lb/>may be compelled by circumstances to accept 
     <lb/>some scheme of union, and my object in such 
     <lb/>an event is not so thwart any reasonable wishes 
     <lb/>that Her Majesty's Government may have on 
     <lb/>the subject, but to point out the best mode of 
     <lb/>arriving at a result that will be less objectiona 
     <lb/>ble to the people of this Provlnce than the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme. But this is not the time; the 
     <lb/>question is not sufficiently understood, and the 
     <lb/>people are not prepared for its acceptance.    
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The hon. member has referred to the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>colonial Railway. I have under my hand the 
     <lb/>speeches made by the Canadian ministers last<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     year in discussing this question. Do we not all 
     <lb/>
     know that whilst Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick desired the Intercolonial Railway. and were 
     <lb/>
     ready to fulfil their part of the obligation, 
     <lb/>
     the Canadians on two occasions shipwreck<lb break="no"/>ed the great scheme. These gentlemen would 
     <lb/>
     now give us an Intercoionial Railway, provided 
     <lb/>
     that they can couple it with Confederation? 
     <lb/>
     Does it follow that a union of the Provinces is   
     <lb/>
     necessary before the Railway can be built! 
     <lb/>
     We know it is not.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We know that the sense of the people is 
     <lb/>
     against all union with Canada. We all know 
     <lb/>
     the character of the public men that have been 
     <lb/>
     dominant in that country for very many years. 
     <lb/>
     We know that the money of the country has 
     <lb/>
     been corruptly squaudered by hundreds of ' 
     <lb/>
     thousands—that, they have proved themselves 
     <lb/>
     unworthy of all confidence by their action in 
     <lb/>
     respect to the lntercolonial Railway. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen talks about traitors, but let me turn 
     <lb/>
     your attention to the character of some of his 
     <lb/>
     Canadian friends, members of the government 
     <lb/>
     in that province. We find one of the leading 
     <lb/>
     spirits an expatriated rebel; another, the At<lb break="no"/>torney General, had been found in rebellion with 
     <lb/>
     arms in his hands; the Minister of Finance was 
     <lb/>
     at one time openly charged with Annexation.

     be looking towards W ashington. And these are 
     <lb/>
     the loyal men who are to govern this country 
     <lb/>
     in the event of Confederation! With the re<lb break="no"/>presentation this Province will have, with the 
     <lb/>
     tremendous influence that the Canadians will 
     <lb/>
     exercise—I would just as soon go into the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Parliament with only two Representatives. 
     <lb/>
    There the people of Nova Scotia might expect 
     <lb/>to obtain some justice, for their representatives 
     <lb/>would be speaking to a body of noble men, ani<lb break="no"/>mated by a high sense of honor and justice; 
     <lb/>while at Ottawa you would be speaking to cor<lb break="no"/>rupt men, some of whose arms have. it is said, 
     <lb/>been plunged up to their elbows in the public

     the "able statesmen" of British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica say that this question is not now better un<lb break="no"/>derstood than when they met at Que<lb break="no"/>bec!   Will they say that their ability

     is so great that they were able in 
     <lb/>
     .the midst of exhaustive festivities, to have a 
     <lb/>
    perfect constitution for these Provinces? They 
     <lb/>might give themselves that credit, but the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country do not. This question should 
     <lb/>not be dealt with hastily. There is no neces<lb break="no"/>sity why his scheme should be forced upon 
     <lb/>the people; if it is to come, let it come   
     <lb/>quietly; let the public mind be educated up to

     a second Ireland, to bring these Provinces into 
     <lb/>
    inextricable troubles, do not force Union upon 
     <lb/>them. I believe the people might be educated 
     <lb/>to accept a scheme of Union at it was just. I 
     <lb/>believe, influenced by a desire to meet the 
     <lb/>wishes of the {British government, they are 
     <lb/>ready to make large sacrifices ; but to force the 
     <lb/>measure upon them without their consent would 
     <lb/>be a grave; and fatal mistake. It would be 
     <lb/>fatal to the success of that Union which gentle 
     <lb/>mon are so anxious to bring about. We know 
     <lb/>how the Irish Union was accomplished; but I 
     <lb/>trust no such influences will prevail in this 
     <lb/>country I can suppose a majority of this 
     <lb/>House prepared to accept a Union, but unless 
     <lb/>they have the people behind them, any measure 
     <lb/>they might pass would not be worth the paper 
     <lb/>on which it was written. You must carry with 
     <lb/>you the-sentiment of the people. Even if you 
     <lb/>are entirely wrong on the question you should 
     <lb/>defer to their prejudice and give them time to 
     <lb/>consider the subject calmly and deliberately, but 
     <lb/>not to force it upon them at all hazards..

            <p>Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL --I am curious to

            <p>Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL—Why could not 
     <lb/>the hon gentleman wait until the question came 
     <lb/>up legitimately? Why all this anxiety on his 
     <lb/>part? If I know anything about th hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber his position was defined before or it remained 
     <lb/>undefined now. He did not utter a single new 
     <lb/>idea that 1 have not seen in his own paper time 
     <lb/>and again.  I cannot understand his course un<lb break="no"/>less he feels that his position is untenable; I 
     <lb/>will only say at present that it looks to me very 
     <lb/>much as if the hon. gentleman all along had 
     <lb/>this object in view only wait says he,until, 
     <lb/>three or four of us who have been opposing 
     <lb/>Union can be convinced by some means or oth<lb break="no"/>er, then we are all right. That is the substance 
     <lb/>of the hon. member's remarks. If two or three  
     <lb/>gentlemen could only be induced to assist the 
     <lb/>friends of Union, then there will be no difficul<lb break="no"/>ty about a reference to the people.

     <lb/>requesting that the Court of Sessions remain as 
     <lb/>at present.

            <p>THE FISHERIES<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  Mr. Ross called attention to the unprotected 
     <lb/>state of the Fisheries on the cast coast of Cape 
     <lb/>Breton. He said that the extent of the coast was 
     <lb/>about one hundred miles. On the 20th of last 
     <lb/>month, as he had been informed, the fishing— 
     <lb/>grounds had been visited by American fisher- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>men. He thought that every exertion ought to 
     <lb/>be made to ensure the protection of these grounds" 
     <lb/>from intrusion.     
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. PROV. SECY expressed gratification at

     THE EDUCATIONAL BILL<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     On the motion for the 3d reading of the bill for 
     <lb/>
     the better encouragement of education, Mr. S. 
     <lb/>
     CAMPBELL said he felt it his duty to protect 
     <lb/>
     against the clause imposing a tax of 30 cents a 
     <lb/>
     head on the inhabitants of the various counties. 
     <lb/>
     He moved that the bill be re-committed, for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of substituting 20 for 30 cents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON.PROV.SEC. said that the adoption of <lb/>such a motion would seriously cripple the mea-<lb break="maybe"/>sure.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. S. McDONNELL seconded Mr. Campbell's   
     <lb/>motion. He expressed himself in favour of a re-<lb break="maybe"/>duction of the tax, and said that the bill of last <lb/>year had given general satisfaction, and instead <lb/>of going further with a policy which had aroused <lb/>hostility to the cause of Education, he thought a <lb/>different course should be pursued. This mea-<lb break="maybe"/>sure had been very ingeniously placed before the <lb/>house by the Committee, but no attempt should<lb/>be made to force any obnoxious provisions upon<lb/>the people. He admitted that the State should<lb/>take charge of the education of its people so far<lb/>as to give to every child instruction in reading <lb/>and writing, but the operation of the law was<lb/>such as to force a man to give to his neighbour's <lb/>children a first-class education sufficient to qua-<lb break="maybe"/>lify them for any of the learned professions-\-<lb break="maybe"/>The deficiency caused by the proposed reduction<lb/>could be made up by an additional grant from<lb/>the Treasury.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jost expressed himself opposed to the <lb/>clause. He had not voted against it previously,<lb/>being under the impression that some modifica-<lb break="maybe"/>tion would be made.<lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. TOBIN remarked that the deficiency caused<lb/>by the change proposed would have to be made<lb/>up by the sectional assessment.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr.McDONNELL replied that the provincial<lb/>grant could be increased.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON PROV.SEC. said that the bill had gone<lb/>
