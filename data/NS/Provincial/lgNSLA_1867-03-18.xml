<!-- GL, 2018-06-05, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
<!--<p>
     about $120,000 more than the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     scheme would have given us for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses. There are other important modifica<lb break="no"/>tions but to these I shall not refer at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. The bill which has been introduc<lb break="no"/>ed into the Imperial Parliament has received 
     <lb/>
     the support of our late respected Governor, 
     <lb/>
     the Marquis of Normanby, of Earl Russell, of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Watkin, and of the foremost men of the 
     <lb/>
     mother country, and who are its opponents? 
     <lb/>
     The principal opponents are Mr. Bright and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ayrton, whose opposition is founded on 
     <lb/>
     the expense that will be caused by colonial 
     <lb/>
     defence, and on the indiposition which they 
     <lb/>
     feel to support the guarantee for the Interco- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     lonial Railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have the honor to represent the largest 
     <lb/>
     constituency in the province, with the excep<lb break="no"/>tion of Halifax, (for Pictou, which follows Ha<lb break="no"/>lifax in population, is divided), and I feel it 
     <lb/>
     gratifying to be able to say that I never pre<lb break="no"/>sented a petition against Confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     that no public meetings against it have been 
     <lb/>
     held in the county. lt is true I received a do<lb break="no"/>cument signed by a few persons, whom I high, 
     <lb/>
     ly esteem, shortly after the division had taken 
     <lb/>
     place, asking that I should oppose the measure, 
     <lb/>
     and I will frankly say that even had I received 
     <lb/>
     it before the division my action would 
     <lb/>
     not have been different, for I feel that 
     <lb/>
     I represent the whole of Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     and must regard the interests of all 
     <lb/>
     its people, rather than the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     few individuals to whom I refer. In looking 
     <lb/>
     at the prospects of the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     which is to be, I feel that we have all the ele<lb break="no"/>ments of greatness within us We have a ter<lb break="no"/>ritory larger then that of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     we have a supply of those minerals upon 
     <lb/>
     which the might and prosperity of England 
     <lb/>
     have so long rested, we have gold, we have 
     <lb/>
     our fisheries and our timber and the agricul<lb break="no"/>tural capabilities of Canada which is only se<lb break="no"/>cond among grain producing countries of this 
     <lb/>
     continent, and is one of the granaries 
     <lb/>
     of the world. Then there is our mer<lb break="no"/>cantile marine, the third or fourth in the world, 
     <lb/>
     and I feel that the time will come when we 
     <lb/>
     will stand among the very first on the list. 
     <lb/>
     Some of the subjects to which I have referred 
     <lb/>
     are of such importance that I could not refrain 
     <lb/>
     from these observations and I will now con<lb break="no"/>clude by moving the following reply to His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency's address:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     REPLY TO ADDRESS: 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>May it please Your Excellency ,— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. We thank Your Excellency for the speech 
     <lb/>
     with which you have been pleased to open the 
     <lb/>
     present session, and we are much gratified 
     <lb/>
     that your Excellency can again congratulate 
     <lb/>
     us upon the continued peace and prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     this Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. We are much pleased to learn that the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which the loyal population of this 
     <lb/>
     Colony responded to the call made upon them 
     <lb/>
     for the defence of our country, and the zeal 
     <lb/>
     and ability with which they discharged the du<lb break="no"/>ties required of them, were such as to earn the 
     <lb/>
     warm commendation of your Excellency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. It affords us much pleasure to find that the 
     <lb/>
     revenue has increased, and we will give our 
     <lb/>
     best attention to the public accounts when 
     <lb/>
     laid before us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. We are glad to know that the interruption 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     of the trade of this Province, caused by the ab<lb break="no"/>rogation of the Reciprocity Treaty, has been 
     <lb/>
     largely compensated by the increased impetus 
     <lb/>
     given to commercial intercourse with the other 
     <lb/>
     Provinces.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. We learn with much satisfaction that the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties in connection with the prosecution 
     <lb/>
     of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway have 
     <lb/>
     been overcome, and that the extension of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway to Pictou has been vigorously prose<lb break="no"/>cuted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. We trust the efforts made to represent the 
     <lb/>
     resources of Nova Scotia, at the International 
     <lb/>
     Exhibition about to be held at Paris will be 
     <lb/>
     productive of much good to the Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     7. We reciprocate the hope that the joint 
     <lb/>
     missions to Brazil and the West Indies will 
     <lb/>
     result in the extension of commerce between 
     <lb/>
     those places and British North America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     8. It is very gratifying to know that great  
     <lb/>
     progress is been made in the Education of all 
     <lb/>
     classes of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     9. We have learned with deep satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     that the efforts to effect a satisfactory Union 
     <lb/>
     of the British North American Colonies have 
     <lb/>
     been so successful, and entertain no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that the best interests of all these Provinces 
     <lb/>
     will be greatly enhanced, and that their con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Crown and the Parent State 
     <lb/>
     will be thereby permanently secured. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. CHURCHILL:—I rise to second the reply 
     <lb/>
     to the Address of the Lieutenant-Governor, 
     <lb/>
     and I do so with feelings of pleasure. I feel 
     <lb/>
     gratified at the fact that the Windsor and An<lb break="no"/>napolis Railway is under progress, and the 
     <lb/>
     Pictou line will be carried to early completion, 
     <lb/>
     for I feel that will wipe out the reproach so 
     <lb/>
     long resting upon us that we had two pieces 
     <lb/>
     of Railway beginning nowhere and ending no<lb break="no"/>where. In these facts I especially rejoice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL:—I rise to ask that 
     <lb/>
     the usual courtesy be shown in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the reply to the Address, and to request that 
     <lb/>
     it be allowed to lie on the table until Monday.

     It may be convenient for the government to 
     <lb/>
     know, and it is but candid in me to inform 
     <lb/>
     them, that it is our intention to move an 
     <lb/>
     amendment to the Address in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     subject of Confederation. In that amendment 
     <lb/>
     we desire solemnly to affirm the right of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country to be heard on a measure 
     <lb/>
     involving so largely their best interests.

            <p>
     Hon. PROV. SECY.:—I need hardly say that 
     <lb/>
     the usual course will be adopted and that the 
     <lb/>
     Address will be allowed to lie over for the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of gentlemen opposite. I am 
     <lb/>
     glad that the hon. member has frankly stated 
     <lb/>
     his intention to move an amendment, and I 
     <lb/>
     will await with the utmost confidence the 
     <lb/>
     decision of what I believe will be the over<lb break="no"/>whelming majority of the House upon this 
     <lb/>
     most momentous question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Address was laid on the table until 
     <lb/>
     Monday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     Mr. Speaker, it is with no ordinary feelings 
     <lb/>
     that I view my position in regard to the topic 
     <lb/>
     of to-day. Gladly would I exchange the pro<lb break="no"/>minency in which I have been placed for one 
     <lb/>
     of less responsibility, one calling upon me in a 
     <lb/>
     more subordinate capacity to advocate the 
     <lb/>
     principles which I am prepared to avow. 
     <lb/>
     Truly would I have rejoiced if the occasion 
     <lb/>
     which has rendered my election necessary 
     <lb/>
     had not arisen—if in short there had not been 
     <lb/>
     the necessity for presenting to the house the 
     <lb/>
     views of the people of this country as we con<lb break="no"/>ceive them to exist. But although on person<lb break="no"/>al grounds I would have preferred the substi<lb break="no"/>tution of another state of things, yet being 
     <lb/>
     placed in such a position, and feeling called 
     <lb/>
     upon as I am for action in this matter, I do 
     <lb/>
     not hesitate to approach this subject as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of a free legislature representing a free people 
     <lb/>
     In answer to His Excellency's Speech, I feel 
     <lb/>
     that we are called on to say that we cannot 
     <lb/>
     reciprocate the language in which it is couch<lb break="no"/>ed,—we cannot see that there is any ground 
     <lb/>
     for congratulating ourselves upon the success 
     <lb/>
     of a measure in which the people have no 
     <lb/>
     sympathy or concurrence. In ransacking the 
     <lb/>
     pages of history it is exceedingly difficult to 
     <lb/>
     find a case parellel to this. There are records 
     <lb/>
     of wrong, and spoliation, and injustice, in com<lb break="no"/>paratively modern times, but we must go 
     <lb/>
     back, very far back indeed to find an instance 
     <lb/>
     such as that which calls for this amendment. 
     <lb/>
     It is true we need only go back a hundred 
     <lb/>
     years to find an unhappy state of things sub<lb break="no"/>sisting between the mother country and her 
     <lb/>
     colonies on this side of the water, and we know 
     <lb/>
     the results of the disaffection then induced by 
     <lb/>
     arbitrary enactments affecting the integrity of 
     <lb/>
     the Empire as it then existed, but I can find 
     <lb/>
     no record of rejoicing in such a condition as 
     <lb/>
     that in which we are placed until I extend my 
     <lb/>
     retrospect and revert to a history of a tyrant, 
     <lb/>
     Emperor though he may be called, who fid<lb break="no"/>dled while Rome was burning. In that case 
     <lb/>
     alone can I find a similarity of circumstances 
     <lb/>
     and a paralleled contempt and disregard of na<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
         

     tional feeling. The delegation referred to in 
     <lb/>
     the Address was constituted under a resolution 
     <lb/>
     of this Legislature at its last session, which 
     <lb/>
     reads as follows:

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     be authorized to appoint delegates to arrange with

     will effectually ensure just provision for the rights

     That delegation was commissioned as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it to arrange with the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment a scheme of union, but was it even con<lb break="no"/>templated by the people or the house that that 
     <lb/>
     delegation was empowered to be parties to an 
     <lb/>
     Imperial act of Parliament, an arbitrary act? 
     <lb/>
     I am convinced that no such idea could have 
     <lb/>
     entered into the minds of gentlemen around 
     <lb/>
     these benches. Did we, the Parliament of No<lb break="no"/>va Scotia entrusted with and empowered to 
     <lb/>
     decide on the weal or woe of our country, and 
     <lb/>
     charged with the protection of the interests of 
     <lb/>
     the people, part with a right so deeply affect<lb break="no"/>ing their welfare as this Union will? No, sir. 
     <lb/>
     I conceive then that this delegation has ex<lb break="no"/>ceeded its authority, and that the commission 
     <lb/>
     under which they probably acted was not au<lb break="no"/>thorised by this resolution. We had delegates 
     <lb/>
     in connection with this subject on a previous 
     <lb/>
     occasion, and the resolution under which they 
     <lb/>
     were appointed was similar in its terms to 
     <lb/>
     this, but was it supposed that the delegates 
     <lb/>
     sent to Charlottetown and Quebec were em<lb break="no"/>powered to do anything but prepare a scheme 
     <lb/>
     to be submitted {or the ratification of this 
     <lb/>
     house? Not by any means, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     when those gentlemen went across the water 
     <lb/>
     and became parties to an imperial act, when  
     <lb/>
     they were engaged in the lobby of the British 
     <lb/>
     Parliament promoting that act, they exceeded 
     <lb/>
     the authority conferred upon them by this 
     <lb/>
     house and by their commission. In that view 
     <lb/>
     I think that the action of the delegation is such 
     <lb/>
     as the house and the people should not sustain. 
     <lb/>
     This is a matter which should have been 
     <lb/>
     brought back here and subjected to the consi<lb break="no"/>deration of the legislature. But they have 
     <lb/>
     consummated the act as far as it was in their 
     <lb/>
     power to do so, and under what circumstances 
     <lb/>
     have their proceedings transpired? It is well 
     <lb/>
     known that the people of this country in every 
     <lb/>
     section petitioned by thousands praying that 
     <lb/>
     the scheme should not receive any consum<lb break="no"/>mation at the hands of the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment until it had been submitted 
     <lb/>
     to them at the polls, but how have these peti<lb break="no"/>tions been treated? Have we heard that they 
     <lb/>
     have even been read or even presented, in or<lb break="no"/>der that the wishes of the country should be 
     <lb/>
     known? Then this bill, framed by the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, under an authority which they assumed 
     <lb/>
     but had not, was introduced into the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords, a body composed, I think, of between 
     <lb/>
     300 and 400 members, and how was it there re<lb break="no"/>ceived when presented for consideration? Of 
     <lb/>
     the hundreds of members, there could not be 
     <lb/>
     found one to witness its formal presentation 
     <lb/>
     one round dozen, and that important bill, 
     <lb/>
     touching the rights, the property and persons 
     <lb/>
     of our people for all time to come, was not 
     <lb/>
     even read. It was read by its title only, and  
     <lb/>
     the important details it embodied never 
     <lb/>

     reached the ears or the hearts of the members 
     <lb/>
     composing that branch of the Imperial Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. It passed the House of Lords with 
     <lb/>
     more facility than a bill imposing a tax on 
     <lb/>
     dogs would have done. It was hurried through 
     <lb/>
     in indecent and disgraceful haste, and sent to 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons. How was it received 
     <lb/>
     there? I cannot imagine how it should have 
     <lb/>
     met with any other reception than it did when 
     <lb/>
     I read the observations of members of that 
     <lb/>
     house—observations which must have pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded from information coming from a quar<lb break="no"/>ter from which sounder information should 
     <lb/>
     have been supplied. It was there stated by 
     <lb/>
     prominent members that this matter had been 
     <lb/>
     before the people just previous to the last elec<lb break="no"/>tion; that the Premier had gone to every hust<lb break="no"/>ings, and at every polling booth in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince had preached on the question of Union. 
     <lb/>
     It was on information such as that that the 
     <lb/>
     enlightened House of Commons proceeded 
     <lb/>
     and I need scarcely ask members whether 
     <lb/>
     that information was true or false. Is there a 
     <lb/>
     member of this house or a man in the country 
     <lb/>
     who will venture to say that previous to the 
     <lb/>
     last election—at the time when the canvass 
     <lb/>
     was taking place—this question was presented 
     <lb/>
     to the people, or that on any hustîngs it was 
     <lb/>
     even mentioned. And if not, I care not 
     <lb/>
     whether it had been at any previous time. In 
     <lb/>
     the course of my professional training I have 
     <lb/>
     learned this principle: that the last will which 
     <lb/>
     a man makes is that which must; be recogniz<lb break="no"/>ed. Whatever his previous dispositions may 
     <lb/>
     have been, they are cancelled and annulled by 
     <lb/>
     his subsequent wishes. When, therefore, at 
     <lb/>
     the last election, the matter was altogether 
     <lb/>
     ignored I am right in saying that it was not 
     <lb/>
     before the people, and that they did not then 
     <lb/>
     express their views upon it. But let me be 
     <lb/>
     more particular. I have in my hand a copy of 
     <lb/>
     the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, an authority which will be 
     <lb/>
     especially acceptable to members of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and it contains the debate on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. This report contains so many amusing 
     <lb/>
     pieces of misinformation that I must trouble 
     <lb/>
     the house with a few extracts. Mr. Watkins 
     <lb/>
     who, for many good reasons, but none of them 
     <lb/>
     referable to the interests of Nova Scotia, took 
     <lb/>
     a deep interest in the proceedings and action of 
     <lb/>
     the delegation is reported to have said in re<lb break="no"/>ference to this Province: " There was a gene<lb break="no"/>ral election in 1863, and the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     went through the country preaching this Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the provinces. It was brought 
     <lb/>
     under the notice of the electors at every poll<lb break="no"/>ing booth, and at every hustings the issue was 
     <lb/>
     distinctly raised " I am willing to give the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government credit for great <choice><sic>ver<lb break="no"/>satality</sic><corr>versatility</corr></choice> of talent, but I never knew that he had 
     <lb/>
     the qualifications of a, preacher, unless it 
     <lb/>
     be true which I do not assert, that a great sin<lb break="no"/>ner is likely to be most successful in convert<lb break="no"/>ing man from sin. If I read on further it 
     <lb/>
     would be still more apparent that the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of England has been grossly deceived at 
     <lb/>
     a time when there were present about them 
     <lb/>
     men who ought to have taken care that the 
     <lb/>
     subject  should be looked into most carefully. 
     <lb/>
     I find also that the debate embodied the idea 
     <lb/>
     that this measure was a treaty of peace be<lb break="no"/>tween these Provinces. I am rather disposed 
     <lb/>
     to view it as a declaration of war—war on the 
     <lb/>
     rights, the feelings, the interests and the liber<lb break="no"/>ties of the people of this country. Those gen<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
tlemen who, since the last session, have visit<lb break="no"/>ed their constituencies must be well satisfied 
     <lb/>
     of that opposition for no man with open eyes 
     <lb/>
     and ears could have travelled through the ru<lb break="no"/>ral districts without seeing and hearing that 
     <lb/>
     the measure was obnoxious to the feelings of 
     <lb/>
     the people. If it were a measure good instead 
     <lb/>
     of bad, if it had merits instead of demerits 
     <lb/>
     without number, I conceive that the people 
     <lb/>
     who are to be affected by its operation should 
     <lb/>
     be heard upon it in a constitutional manner at 
     <lb/>
     the polls, and until they are so heard you may 
     <lb/>
     pass this Act of Parliament, calling it an Im<lb break="no"/>perial Act if you will, but it will be a blank 
     <lb/>
     piece of paper until the hearts and sympathies 
     <lb/>
     of the people rally round it to give it effect. 
     <lb/>
     By the amendment which I have submitted we 
     <lb/>
     ask to obtain for the people the liberty to speak 
     <lb/>
     on the subject, and why should they not speak. 
     <lb/>
     According to the constitution of this house 
     <lb/>
     the day is not far distant when under any cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances the House would be dissolved,— 
     <lb/>
     its existence can last but for a few weeks and 
     <lb/>
     why this haste? I must say that we have 
     <lb/>
     approached a crisis of a momentous character 
     <lb/>
     in our history. This Province until a recent 
     <lb/>
     period was a loyal and happy Colony, having 
     <lb/>
     every reason to be loyal, every reason to be 
     <lb/>
     happy until this unfortunate and unhappy 
     <lb/>
     measure was brought in and cast among us. 
     <lb/>
     Shall I be told that loyalty exists now 
     <lb/>
     in the same richness among us as it once and 
     <lb/>
     recently did? Mr. Speaker, I strenuously 
     <lb/>
     opposed the measure last Session on the ground 
     <lb/>
     that the course about to be taken would en<lb break="no"/>danger the allegiance and undermine the loyal<lb break="no"/>ty of the people and since that time I have 
     <lb/>
     seen that that result is but too probable. We 
     <lb/>
     are told by members of the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment that it is desirable we should be separat<lb break="no"/>ed from the British Empire and further we are 
     <lb/>
     told that it is not alone for the interests of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia that the scheme has been projec<lb break="no"/>ted—that there are reasons making it desira<lb break="no"/>ble that we should be connected with a large 
     <lb/>
     country. To secure Canada from foreign in<lb break="no"/>vasion the right of Nova Scotians are to be in<lb break="no"/>terfered with and trampled upon I conceive 
     <lb/>
     that Nova Scotia has at least as just a claim 
     <lb/>
     to the protection of England as Canada, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia has been truly loyal, and in every hour 
     <lb/>
     of danger she had exhibited a disposition, to 
     <lb/>
     the uttermost extent of her resources to stand 
     <lb/>
     by and maintain the honor and integrity of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire. I conceive that the transactions of  
     <lb/>
     the past few months are exhibiting a poor re<lb break="no"/>turn for that loyalty and that allegiance. The 
     <lb/>
     loyalty which I desire to see is the loyalty of 
     <lb/>
     the heart, not the loyalty pampered and fed  
     <lb/>
     and fattened by the contents of the treasury 
     <lb/>
     The loyalty of the heart, springing from just and 
     <lb/>
     honorable motives—that is the loyalty which 
     <lb/>
     is desirable, and anything else is unworthy of 
     <lb/>
    the name. In this amendment we beg to ap<lb break="no"/>proach His Excellency with the respectable, 
     <lb/>submission that this is a most important crisis 
     <lb/>in our history. The men who best know the

     <lb/>length and breadth. Pass this act without re<lb break="no"/>ference to the people whose rights are to be 
     <lb/>affected, and do you make them its friends?  
     <lb/>Do you not rather create in them feelings pre<lb break="no"/>cisely the reverse? Do you not make them 
     <lb/>enemies and disloyal? Those who are in op<lb break="no"/>position have been denounced as disloyal, but

     that reproach can hardly come from men who 
     <lb/>
    by their conduct have brought about this state 
     <lb/>of feelings. The men who are open to the 
     <lb/>charge are those who are forcing it on the 
     <lb/>country. I have said that the country was. 
     <lb/>peaceable, loyal and happy before,—if it is not 
     <lb/>so now it is because of t is measure, and for no 
     <lb/>other reason whatever. The amendment sug<lb break="no"/>gests a solemn protest against the action of 
     <lb/>the delegation. For the reasons I have men<lb break="no"/>tioned, I think the house should concur in that 
     <lb/>protest. The delegates have exceeded their 
     <lb/>authority : they were delegates from the house 
     <lb/>for the purpose of preparing a scheme, not for 
     <lb/>converting that scheme into an Act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, while we had within our own borders a 
     <lb/>legislature with a right to exercise its own 
     <lb/>judgment, and one that has never done aught 
     <lb/>to induce an abridgement of its rights. I 
     <lb/>need hardly repeat that I desire to see the 
     <lb/>scheme of Union submitted to the people. 
     <lb/>That is the view that I have always main<lb break="no"/>tained and expressed, and I should view 
     <lb/>with sorrow rather than with anger, 
     <lb/>the adoption of any other course for I believe 
     <lb/>that any other course would endanger the hap<lb break="no"/>piness, the loyalty, and the best interests of 
     <lb/>our people. It is not my intention now to 
     <lb/>press upon the House any. other view than the 
     <lb/>necessity which exists for preserving this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince in a peaceful and happy condition, and I 
     <lb/>think it is our bounded duty to adopt the 
     <lb/>course which I have urged. I wish before de<lb break="no"/>taining the House further, to hear reasons 
     <lb/>why that course should not be pursued. I 
     <lb/>ask those gentlemen who stand in the the positions 
     <lb/>of guardians of the public liberties why they 
     <lb/>are not prepared to submit the measure to the 
     <lb/>people? Why this haste? What is the press<lb break="no"/>ing necessity? The more the subject is dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, the more averse are the people to its 
     <lb/>features. During the past summer the feeling 
     <lb/>was comparatively mild and moderate to what 
     <lb/>it is to-day, and the reason was that in the 
     <lb/>trustfulness of their hearts the people never 
     <lb/>could have supposed that a measure so seri<lb break="no"/>ously to aflfect them would have reached the 
     <lb/>point it has without their voice being heard in 
     <lb/>a constitutional manner. But the awful note 
     <lb/>has lately sounded in their ears telling them 
     <lb/>that their fate is approaching, that their con<lb break="no"/>stitution is about to be a thing of the past, that 
     <lb/>their liberties are to be abridged forever, and 
     <lb/>they now feel excited if not enraged. If that 
     <lb/>be their feeling they have just cause for it. 
     <lb/>Men in whom they trusted- men who held 
     <lb/>their positions and ate their bread by the 
     <lb/>breath of the people- these were the men who 
     <lb/>stood between them and their liberties. and 
     <lb/>sought to cut of their freedom forever. 
     <lb/>It is a painful thing to receive an 
     <lb/>injury at the hands of friend—it is a gall 
     <lb/>ing thing to receive the blow, of ingra<lb break="no"/>titude, and that is the state of feeling existing 
     <lb/>in the breasts of the people of. this country, 
     <lb/>They are indignant that the men whom they 
     <lb/>elevated to power for other and noble purpo<lb break="no"/>ses, should have been the instruments of the 
     <lb/>annihilation of their freedom. What should 
     <lb/>be the feelings of a representative? There 
     <lb/>should be some regard for the feelings of the 
     <lb/>men who sent him here and elevated him to 
     <lb/>so honorable a position, and if any among us 
     <lb/>should disregard these feelings, the day 
     <lb/>cannot be distant when their consciences 
     <lb/>
    

    
            <cb/>
          

     will be grievously disturbed. I trust none 
     <lb/>
     of these individuals will suffer from the re<lb break="no"/>morse which such considerations will induce; 
     <lb/>
     for my part I shall have the satisfaction of 
     <lb/>
     having in a humble way asserted the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the people on this question. I think that the 
     <lb/>
     friends of England and the friends of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia should require and acquiesce in no oth<lb break="no"/>er course then t at which 1 have advocated, 
     <lb/>
     for he is no friend to this country and an enemy 
     <lb/>
     to England who would force this measure on 
     <lb/>
     the necks and hearts of an unwiiling people

     and act in conformity with the views I ex<lb break="no"/>pressed. What placed him in the position he

     <lb/>
     No, not for that, and when he next appeals to 
     <lb/>
     his constituents for their suffrages if ever he 
     <lb/>
     ventures to do so, I hope they will tell him so. 
     <lb/>
     He was placed here to preserve the the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the country and to perpetuate its

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KILL2">Mr. Killam</persName> :—I rise for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     seconding the amendment which has just been 
     <lb/>
     moved by the hon. member for Guysboro, 
     <lb/>
     with whose remarks I fully agree. It is well 
     <lb/>
     known in this house that I do not make any 
     <lb/>
     pretentions to the eloquence of other gentle<lb break="no"/>men, but the views I entertain on this question 
     <lb/>
     are the result of deep conviction. I may not 
     <lb/>
     be able to express these views as I would wish, 
     <lb/>
     but I feel them very strongly. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has referred to the recent delegation 
     <lb/>
     and the manner in which the authority given 
     <lb/>
     by this house has been exceeded, but he hardly 
     <lb/>
     went deep enough into that, matter in my opi<lb break="no"/>nion. He must recollect that when the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary was pressing his resolution 
     <lb/>
     upon the house, last session, he referred some 
     <lb/>
     years back for the purpose of strengthening his 
     <lb/>
     argument. He stated that the leaders of the 
     <lb/>
     political parties in this Legislature had moved 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in favour of this scheme of Union 
     <lb/>
     but did he ever hear of a single resolution that 
     <lb/>
     had not coupled with it the condition that the 
     <lb/>
     question would be referred back to the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and that means the people. Mr. John<lb break="no"/>ston, Mr. Young, Mr. Howe were all quoted 
     <lb/>
     in illustration of his argument, but can he as<lb break="no"/>sert that the question was ever treated by them 
     <lb/>
     in a practical point of view. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has in England quoted these gentlemen as 
     <lb/>
     the advocates of this scheme and tried to make 
     <lb/>
     the public men of that country believe that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Nova Scotia are in favour of a Union 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces with Canada. These dele<lb break="no"/>gates were to go and see if they could agree on 
     <lb/>
    some measure that would suit the members of

     this Legislature better than the Quebec scheme. 
     <lb/>
     There has never been any measure of Union 
     <lb/>
     submitted to this house for its deliberation. In<lb break="no"/>stead of bringing back what they agreed on they 
     <lb/>
     have put their hands to an Act of Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     We are hereafter to be bound by a paper con<lb break="no"/>stitution which has never been submitted to us 
     <lb/>
     for our consideration. No more important 
     <lb/>
     question than this was ever before the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country. If this bill is passed we are de<lb break="no"/>prived of the power of hereafter legislating for 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. We shall certainly have a voice in 
     <lb/>
     the General Parliament, but that the people 
     <lb/>
     don't want at all. Nothing can reconcile the 
     <lb/>
     people to the manner in which this measure is 
     <lb/>
     being forced upon them. They might have 
     <lb/>
     submitted to an Act of Union, if the British 
     <lb/>
     Parliament and people had declared that it was 
     <lb/>
     positively necessary for Imperial purposes, but 
     <lb/>
     that has not been the case. It appears by the 
     <lb/>
     papers that Her Maiesty's Ministers have all 
     <lb/>
     the time been under the delusion that in pro<lb break="no"/>moting the measure they are pleasing the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Nova Scotia—a delusion created and fos<lb break="no"/>tered by the delegates. It is not difficult to 
     <lb/>
     understand the motives that have prompted the 
     <lb/>
     delegates to take the course they have. These 
     <lb/>
     politicians wish to put themselves out of the 
     <lb/>
     power of the people—to obtain place and emo<lb break="no"/>lument without the wishes of the people being 
     <lb/>
     at all consulted. The public men ot New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick dissolved the legislature when they 
     <lb/>
     returned from Quebec, and the people returned 
     <lb/>
     a large majority opposed to Union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Another election subsequently took place. and 
     <lb/>
     the people, for some reason or other, reversed 
     <lb/>
     the verdict they had given previously. So the 
     <lb/>
     the people of New Brunswick have been ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to twice on this question, whilst the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Nova Scotia have not been consulted 
     <lb/>
     even once. The course pursued by these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen is, as far as I know. unprecedented in 
     <lb/>
     the history of legislation. Even Napoleon did 
     <lb/>
     better than they have done. I look upon this 
     <lb/>
     Act of Parliament, if it is passed, as destroying 
     <lb/>
     the colonial system 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If British colonies anywhere find that their 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges can be transferred at any 
     <lb/>
     time to another country against their wishes— 
     <lb/>
     to some other people with whom they can have 
     <lb/>
     no sympathy—thev will feel that their security 
     <lb/>
     and prosperity rest upon a very insecure basis. 
     <lb/>
     The people of Nova Scotia are not the only 
     <lb/>
     ones opposed to that measure ; for we have rea<lb break="no"/>son to believe that a large number of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians entertain similar views. Nearly one 
     <lb/>
     half of the people of New Brunswick are op<lb break="no"/>posed to the measure. We know how few peo<lb break="no"/>ple it takes to turn the scales in an election. It 
     <lb/>
     is quite true that measures often pass the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature which are very objectionable to the 
     <lb/>
     people, but they know that the time will come 
     <lb/>
     when they will be able to express their opinions 
     <lb/>
     on these obnoxious measures, and have them 
     <lb/>
     repealed. Now. however, you are to fasten a 
     <lb/>
     measure upon them which will fetter them for 
     <lb/>
     all time—hand them over to Canada for ever. 
     <lb/>
     I agree with the hon. member for Guysboro', 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     that this scheme states a fatal blow at the con<lb break="no"/>nection between these colonies and the mother 
     <lb/>
     country. Nova Scotia has always hitherto been 
     <lb/>
     considered a loyal province. I feel as loyal as 
     <lb/>
     any person in this house ; I have not been 
     <lb/>
     ready to bow down to the authority of every 
     <lb/>
     person, but I pay respect to the laws and the go<lb break="no"/>vernment under which I live. I have British 
     <lb/>
     feelings in my breast, I feel proud to see Eng<lb break="no"/>land great and prosperous, but a measure of this 
     <lb/>
     kind must create discontent among the whole 
     <lb/>
     population of this province. The majority in 
     <lb/>
     this house who decide against the people as<lb break="no"/>sume a very grave responsibility Many of 
     <lb/>
     them will regret it deeply if they act contrary 
     <lb/>
     to the sentiments of the people. We are too 
     <lb/>
     near a great country to be trifled with in a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of this kind. Let no one attempt to make 
     <lb/>
     the people believe that the British government 
     <lb/>
     would barter away their rights unfairly. Let 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen consider, therefore, the great re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility that rests upon them in the present 
     <lb/>
     important emergency, and decide wisely before 
     <lb/>
     it is too late.

     <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Dr. Tupper</persName> replied as follows:—I feel by no 
     <lb/>
     means disposed to find fault with the mode and 
     <lb/>
     temper in which this subject has been approach<lb break="no"/>ed. No doubt the hon. mover of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, in confining himself mainly to the con. 
     <lb/>
     stitutional point which he has raised, felt that 
     <lb/>
     the peculiar circumstances under which the 
     <lb/>
     House meets—the very advanced period of the 
     <lb/>
     session and the necessity of dealing immediately 
     <lb/>
     with certain portions of the public business 
     <lb/>
     which will not admit of postponement—induced 
     <lb/>
     him to limit his remarks to the range he has 
     <lb/>
     done. The hon. member who has seconded the 
     <lb/>
     resolution, with that due regard to the public 
     <lb/>
     time which he has always shown, felt also that 
     <lb/>
     this was not an occasion when a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     debateable matter should be opened up. I in<lb break="no"/>tend to follow the example of these hon gentle<lb break="no"/>men, and shall as succinctly as possible deal 
     <lb/>
     with the constitutional point that has been rais<lb break="no"/>ed, without going into any lengthy observations 
     <lb/>
     on the great subject which is brought under the

            <p>
     It would have been perhaps too much to ex<lb break="no"/>pect that the hon. members opposite who en<lb break="no"/>tertain very strong opinions on this question

     should not have availed themselves of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent opportunity ot putting upon record their 
     <lb/>
     views and opinions in reference to the Address. 
     <lb/>
     As one of the advisers of His Excellency I 
     <lb/>
     would have been glad, had it been possible, if a 
     <lb/>
     different course had been pursued and no deba<lb break="no"/>teable issue had been raised on the Address. 
     <lb/>
     That course on the present occasion seems to 
     <lb/>
     have been impossible, and I must frankly ad<lb break="no"/>mit that I was fully prepared for an amend<lb break="no"/>ment from the hon. gentlemen. I may say 
     <lb/>
     with a great deal ot pride and pleasure that I 
     <lb/>
     feel I can approach this question under cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances upon which I may congratulate

     concerned, I need hardly tell the house that 
     <lb/>
     from the first hour I felt it necessary as a public 
     <lb/>
     man to give my earnest consideration to public 
     <lb/>
     matters—from the first hour I felt it due to the 
     <lb/>
     people, the management ot whose affairs I had 
     <lb/>
     undertaken, to express my opinion on public 
     <lb/>
     questions—I have never hesitated openly, at all 
     <lb/>
     times and everywhere, to avow my deep and 
     <lb/>
     settled conviction that in a union of British 
     <lb/>
     North America lay the only great future for 
     <lb/>
     any portion of these provinces. True to these 
     <lb/>
     principles, whether in power or in opposition, 
     <lb/>
     to the best of my ability I advocated and sus<lb break="no"/>tained these views,—I pledged myself to my 
     <lb/>
     countrymen, at all times and under all circum<lb break="no"/>stances, that whatever power and influence 
     <lb/>
     they might place in my hands, I would feel bound 
     <lb/>
     to use for the purpose of advancing the inter<lb break="no"/>ests, elevating the character and promoting the 
     <lb/>
     security of our common country, by a union of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. Believing as I do that 
     <lb/>
     not only the most marked prosperity would 
     <lb/>
     have followed, but that the only security and 
     <lb/>
     guarantee for the continued possession of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish principles in any portion of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, was involved in that great question, I 
     <lb/>
     have never hesitated to declare my opinion that 
     <lb/>
     it would have been wise on the part of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia to have entered into that union under the 
     <lb/>
     terms propounded by the Quebec scheme.— 
     <lb/>
     There were many gentleman around me, how<lb break="no"/>ever—many for whom I entertain great re<lb break="no"/>spect—who felt that better terms should be ob<lb break="no"/>tained for the Maritime Provinces than were 
     <lb/>
     contained in that scheme. To-day I stand 
     <lb/>
     in the proud position of being able to claim con<lb break="no"/>fidently the support of gentlemen who were un<lb break="no"/>able to give it to me before because whilst their 
     <lb/>
    general principles were in favour of Union they 
     <lb/>did not consider that the scheme of Union devis<lb break="no"/>ed at Quebec gave to these provinces all the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages and consideration to which they are 
     <lb/>entitled. The position, therefore, that we oc<lb break="no"/>cupy on this question is one of no little pride 
     <lb/>for we are able to say that we have not only ob<lb break="no"/>tained everything which was granted at Que<lb break="no"/>bec, but that very important concessions have 
     <lb/>been made in the arrangements that are now 
     <lb/>being consummated, and that all these altera<lb break="no"/>tions are most favorable to the interests of these 
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces The narrow range taken 
     <lb/>by those gentlemen who have opened up this 
     <lb/>question precludes me from dwelling on this 
     <lb/>particular feature of it, but an occasion will of<lb break="no"/>fer itself later for discussing the scheme in all 
     <lb/>its bearings Then gentlemen in this house 
     <lb/>will have ample opportunity to place before the 
     <lb/>legislature and country an expression of their 
     <lb/>opinion on this great question. It will be there<lb break="no"/>fore only necessary that I should briefly call the 
     <lb/>attention of the house to the position that this 
     <lb/>question now assumes, and deal with the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional point which has been raised by gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the opposite side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     I need not remind the House that no man 
     <lb/>
     can pretend that this is one of the occasions on 
     <lb/>
     which a great surprise is attempted. No man 
     <lb/>
     can contend that this question of a Union of 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     

     British North America is not one to which the 
     <lb/>
     public mind and consideration of all classes of 
     <lb/>
     the intelligent people of this country have not 
     <lb/>
     been again and again turned, until it has be<lb break="no"/>come perfectly familiar to all. I need not go 
     <lb/>
     into any lengthy review of circumstances that 
     <lb/>
     took place on this question, but twenty-five years 
     <lb/>
     ago the whole subject, in all its bearings, was 
     <lb/>
     placed in the report of Lord Durham before the 
     <lb/>
     people of British America and of the whole Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Empire, and attracted an amount of atten<lb break="no"/>tion that few other great public measures 
     <lb/>
     ever received. We might claim the proud dis<lb break="no"/>tinction that this question  has been examined 
     <lb/>
     and discussed within these walls with an acu<lb break="no"/>men and ability that did the greatest honor to 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on both sides. If there was a sec<lb break="no"/>tion of British America ready to come to the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of this question and pass upon it 
     <lb/>
     intelligently, it was the Province of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, familiarized as the people have been with it 
     <lb/>
     in all its aspects. So far as I am personally 
     <lb/>
     concerned I have never hesitated to express my 
     <lb/>
     sentiments whether as a member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment or Opposition. When opposed to the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the day in 1860 I was invited 
     <lb/>
     to deliver a lecture at the Mechanics' Institute 
     <lb/>
     of St. John, and I was permitted the privil<lb break="no"/>ege of choosing the subject upon which I would 
     <lb/>
     address them. I took that occasion to proclaim 
     <lb/>
     not only to the people of my own province 
     <lb/>
     but of British North America, that all the pow<lb break="no"/>er and influence that I might ever obtain should 
     <lb/>
     be exerted to accomplish and consummate the 
     <lb/>
     great scheme of British American Union which 
     <lb/>
     had been so ably discussed in previous days. I 
     <lb/>
     returned from the neighbouring province, and 
     <lb/>
     what was the first thing that met me ? Some 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite who perhaps felt that the 
     <lb/>
     eulogiums which that address had received 
     <lb/>
     might make me a little giddy, immediately 
     <lb/>
     declared that after all there was no<lb break="no"/>thing novel in these sentiments, that 
     <lb/>
     they were borrowed from my political 
     <lb/>
     opponents, and that the gentleman then at 
     <lb/>
     their head, Mr Howe, was one of the origina<lb break="no"/>tors—as I have never denied he was— 
     <lb/>
     of this great scheme of Union. I felt 
     <lb/>
     there was no originality in my views, 
     <lb/>
     that all I had endeavored to do was to give 
     <lb/>
     favor and substance to the question—to pledge 
     <lb/>
     myself as a public man, devoted to the service 
     <lb/>
     of the country, to promote the consummation of 
     <lb/>
     this great scheme. I came back to this city, 
     <lb/>
     and at one of the largest assemblages that I 
     <lb/>
     have ever addressed, repeated these senti<lb break="no"/>ments and pledged myself, in the face of my 
     <lb/>
     country, that, it entrusted with power by the 
     <lb/>
     people of this Province, I would use that power 
     <lb/>
     as energetically as I was able for the accom<lb break="no"/>plishment of this great project. I went up, then, 
     <lb/>
     into the neighbouring counties of Hants and 
     <lb/>
     Kings, and Colchester. and there proclaimed 
     <lb/>
     plainly to the people of this country my senti<lb break="no"/>ments on the same great question; I did so by 
     <lb/>
     public invitation, and delivered these sentiments 
     <lb/>
     amid the united plaudits of men of all shades of 
     <lb/>
     politics. Everywhere I was proud to find that 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
        

     this great scheme which I was advocating was 
     <lb/>
     received as an open question, upon which all 
     <lb/>
     political parties could co-operate. After I had 
     <lb/>
     thus re-opened this question, the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government to which I was opposed, recommit<lb break="no"/>ted himself to the principles of British Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Union, by moving a series of resolutions on the 
     <lb/>
     subject. These resolutions originating with the 
     <lb/>
     government, of which he was the leader, broad<lb break="no"/>ly stated that so manifold and so great were the 
     <lb/>
     advantages that would result from union, that 
     <lb/>
     the government asked for power from this 
     <lb/>
     House to have a conference for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     taking it up and placing it in a position so that 
     <lb/>
     it might receive the solemn ratification of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of this country. Consistent with 
     <lb/>
     the views I had always entertained, I gave my 
     <lb/>
     earnest co-operation to the government on this 
     <lb/>
     question, and a similar course was pursued by 
     <lb/>
     every Conservative sitting on the benches with 
     <lb/>
     me. The Lieutenant Governor was requested 
     <lb/>
     to appeal to the British Parliament on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Mr. Howe having received the authority 
     <lb/>
     from the Imperial Government immediately, 
     <lb/>
     under his own hand, urged upon Canada and 
     <lb/>
     the other British North American Colonies the 
     <lb/>
     importance of dealing with the question. In a 
     <lb/>
     statesmanlike spirit he pointed out to them that 
     <lb/>
     there was only one mode in which this question 
     <lb/>
     could be dealt with—that the only true consti<lb break="no"/>tutional course was not to refer it to the 
     <lb/>
     people at the polls, but to the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. I challenge the gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site, instead of indulging in mere empty de<lb break="no"/>clamation addressed not to members inside this 
     <lb/>
     House but to uninformed persons outside—to 
     <lb/>
     point out a single authority here or elsewhere, 
     <lb/>
     in this province or in the mother country whence 
     <lb/>
     we obtained our system of government, that has 
     <lb/>
     ever propounded such a principle as the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion lays down ; and when they are able to do 
     <lb/>
     so, I shall be prepared to extend to this 
     <lb/>
     amendment an amount of consideration that 
     <lb/>
     I feel now it is not entitled to. In Mr. Howe's 
     <lb/>
     letter, under his own hand, he says there is only 
     <lb/>
     one way of dealing with the matter—that there 
     <lb/>
     should be a conference of the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to arrange a scheme of Union—but there 
     <lb/>
     is not one word said about submitting the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the people, but on the contrary, he propos<lb break="no"/>ed that it should be disposed of by the legislature. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe, sustained by all his colleagues in 
     <lb/>
     the government, claimed for the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     this country the right of dealing with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion—a principle which the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Yarmouth has himself just acknowledged as the 
     <lb/>
     correct one, though it conflicts with the position 
     <lb/>
     he has taken in seconding the present amend<lb break="no"/>ment. That hon. gentleman said that he was 
     <lb/>
     imbued with a love for British principles. He 
     <lb/>
     was one of the earliest and strongest advocates 
     <lb/>
     of colonial responibility, and true to his prin<lb break="no"/>ciples what has he to-day told you? "<hi rendition="simple:italic">The 
     <lb/>
     Legislature represents the people</hi>." That is the 
     <lb/>
     reason when Mr. Young led that side of the 
     <lb/>
     House—when Mr. Howe led the government 
     <lb/>
     of the Liberal party,—when Mr. Johnston, on 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     this side, led the Conservative party,  each and 
     <lb/>
     all, recognizing the fact that we enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     responsible government in all its completeness, 
     <lb/>
     on every occasion when this question came up, 
     <lb/>
     maintained the indisputable right of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature to deal with this question. When Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howe and Mr. Killam were demanding that 
     <lb/>
     the people should have the principle of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government extended to them, they affirm<lb break="no"/>ed the responsibility of the Ministry to the 
     <lb/>
     people—that the Ministry should have the peo<lb break="no"/>ple's representatives to sustain them, and that 
     <lb/>
     whilst they had that support, they were quali 
     <lb/>
     fied to discharge all the duties of legislation in 
     <lb/>
     such a manner as they thought was consistent 
     <lb/>
     with the interests of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member (Mr. Killam) has referred 
     <lb/>
     to Napoleon, and given us the only precedent 
     <lb/>
     that these gentlemen can adduce in support of 
     <lb/>
     their position. The hon. member for Guys<lb break="no"/>boro', a gentleman of legal attainments—who 
     <lb/>
     has sat in the chair you, sir, now occupy.—who 
     <lb/>
     has, therefore, held the highest constitutional 
     <lb/>
     position in this Legislature, was obliged to sit 
     <lb/>
     down without having been able, from the whole 
     <lb/>
     range of constitutional history, to bring forward 
     <lb/>
     a single example in support of his course. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Yarmouth, who has himself a 
     <lb/>
     pretty wide acquaintance with the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional system we enjoy, did at last find a pre<lb break="no"/>cedent; but was it under the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     principles which it is our pride and glory to 
     <lb/>
     have received from Englang ? Did he find it 
     <lb/>
     in Great Britain or in any portion of her colo<lb break="no"/>nial empire ? No; but he had to travel to des<lb break="no"/>potic France, where the universal popular fran<lb break="no"/>chise had placed the country under the heel of 
     <lb/>
     the most iron despotism that ever existed. All 
     <lb/>
     the public men in this house, Liberal or Conser<lb break="no"/>vative, have placed on record their deliber<lb break="no"/>ate sentiment that the Legislature of the coun<lb break="no"/>try is the place where this question should be 
     <lb/>
     discussed and decided. But that is not all. The 
     <lb/>
     Duke of Newcastle was appealed to, and what 
     <lb/>
     did he reply ? You have only to go to the jour<lb break="no"/>nals and you will find him endorsing the same 
     <lb/>
     principles. Mr. Cardwell was subsequently ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to, and you see that gentleman himself 
     <lb/>
     taking the same view of the question, and de<lb break="no"/>claring the right of the Legislature to deal with 
     <lb/>
     it. The present Marquis of Normanby, reflect<lb break="no"/>ing the views of the government of the day as 
     <lb/>
     he does now his own, embodied in a state 
     <lb/>
     paper his opinion that the Legislature is the 
     <lb/>
     proper place to deal with the matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was stated that if the British Government 
     <lb/>
     had only proper information on this question— 
     <lb/>
     if that dark cloud which prevented them from 
     <lb/>
     seeing the real facts of the case was only blown 
     <lb/>
     away, they would sustain the views of gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite. Well all that has been done ; I 
     <lb/>
     hold in my hand the statement of the late Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Secretary, the Earl of Carnarvon, who sub<lb break="no"/>mitted this question with great ability to the 
     <lb/>
     House of Lords. But first let me ask when 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen were advocating responsible 
     <lb/>
     government in this country, what did they tell 
     <lb/>

     us they were going to give us? The institu<lb break="no"/>tions of Republican America? No. The des<lb break="no"/>potism of France ? No. They said that they 
     <lb/>
     intended giving us Responsible Government, 
     <lb/>
     the British system of government, so that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country might be governed in 
     <lb/>
     precisely the same manner that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the British Islands are governed Who are the 
     <lb/>
     best interpreters of the British system ? When 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen raise an issue upon constitutional 
     <lb/>
     practice, they should sustain their course by re<lb break="no"/>ference to the authorities of that country from 
     <lb/>
     which we take our system. Now this whole 
     <lb/>
     question was put fully before the statesmen and 
     <lb/>
     people of England by a gentleman second in 
     <lb/>
     ability to none in this country—who is one of 
     <lb/>
     those who can almost make the worse appear 
     <lb/>
     the better reason—who can put his views before 
     <lb/>
     the public in the most conclusive manner that it 
     <lb/>
     is possible to place them. Now when this gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had exhausted months in enunciating 
     <lb/>
     his views, before the statesmen of the mother 
     <lb/>
     country, what did Lord Carnarvon say after full 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the whole question? Lord 
     <lb/>
     Carnarvon said:—

     " Then the noble lord has founded an argument on 
     <lb/>
     the franchise of Nova Scotia, but really if this House 
     <lb/>
     is to go into all the intricacies and details of colonial 
     <lb/>
     government there can be no end to the matter. Such 
     <lb/>
     a course would have the effect of raising questions on 
     <lb/>
     every clause of the bill. The House has simply to as<lb break="no"/>certain who are the constituted authorities of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, whom we are bound to listen to and whose 
     <lb/>
     opinion we are bound to accept. Now, what have 
     <lb/>
     they said? In 1861 the then parliament of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia passed a resolution in favour of confederation 
     <lb/>
     in general terms. In 1863 that Parliament was dis<lb break="no"/>solved and a fresh Parliament was elected and is in 
     <lb/>
     existence at the present moment. Well, it was only 
     <lb/>
     in April last that that Parliament came to a distinct 
     <lb/>
     resolution in favour of confederation—a resolution as 
     <lb/>
     distinct as words could express it. That resolution 
     <lb/>
     empowered certain gentlemen to proceed on their be<lb break="no"/>half to  England to negotiate with her Majesty's Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. These accredited envoys were accordingly 
     <lb/>
     sent and the terms have been negotiated and embo<lb break="no"/>died in this measure. It appears to me that it is not 
     <lb/>
     competent for us to look behind that vote of the No<lb break="no"/>va Scotia Parliament, and to inquire what other par<lb break="no"/>ties may be in the colony and under what circum<lb break="no"/>stances the colonial local authorities and legislatures 
     <lb/>
     were elected. If responsible government means any<lb break="no"/>thing, it means this—that you not only give to a co<lb break="no"/>lony free institutions and enable the inhabitants to 
     <lb/>
     elect their own Parliament, but you also undertake, 
     <lb/>
     in matters of colonial policy, to deal only with that 
     <lb/>
     colony through the legally constituted authorities. 
     <lb/>
     Any other view of the case would lead us to endless

     This is the opinion of a gentleman to whom the 
     <lb/>
     whole press, irrespective of party, has awarded 
     <lb/>
     unqualified praise for the able and perspicuous 
     <lb/>
     manner in which he dealt with this question. 
     <lb/>
     In fact, we have the opinion of the statesmen 
     <lb/>
     and press of all parties in England in support of 
     <lb/>
     the principle—that our Legislature has the au<lb break="no"/>thority of legislating on all matters touching 
     <lb/>
     the constitution for this country save where it 
     <lb/>
     conflicts with Imperial interests. I confess I 
     <lb/>
     feel mortified when we enjoyed the great prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of responsible government—when these 
     <lb/>
     principles had been worked out so as to reflect 
     <lb/>
     the highest credit upon all parties—when Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia had advanced to that position of intelli<lb break="no"/>gence that she could be entrusted with the ma<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
         
nagement of her own affairs; I felt mortified, I 
     <lb/>
    say, to see the very men who had laid claims to 
     <lb/>having given us this constitutional system,going 
     <lb/>to the foot of the Throne and attempting to 
     <lb/>prove, as far as all the evidence they could ga<lb break="no"/>ther would prove, that this province was unfit 
     <lb/>for the government she enjoys—that we were in 
     <lb/>that condition of corruption and ignorance that 
     <lb/>the Parliament of the country could not be 
     <lb/>trusted to discharge thoae legislative duties 
     <lb/>which had been entrusted to them under our 
     <lb/>constitutional system. If these petitions had 
     <lb/>any effect—if the British Government had ac<lb break="no"/>cepted such statements as true, they would have 
     <lb/>been greatly misled, and would have estimated 
     <lb/>the character, education, and intelligence of this 
     <lb/>country at a very low standard indeed. We 
     <lb/>can point with pride to evidence that under the 
     <lb/>institutions we have enjoyed the people have 
     <lb/>chosen the best men they have as their represen<lb break="no"/>tatives, whose acts may challenge the closest 
     <lb/>scrutiny of the mother country and of the world. 
     <lb/>If it had been shown that the action of the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature had been unworthy of the confidence 
     <lb/>of Parliament and Government of England,then 
     <lb/>we would have occupied a position that would 
     <lb/>indeed be most humiliating to us all. But we 
     <lb/>have another construction of this resolution be<lb break="no"/>sides Lord Carnarvon's. Here is the <choice><sic>declara<lb break="no"/>tien</sic><corr>declaration</corr></choice> not of the late Colonial Secretary only but 
     <lb/>the Queen's Speech, in which the United Cabi<lb break="no"/>net of England give expression to their senti<lb break="no"/>ments :-" Resolutions in favor of a more inti<lb break="no"/>mate union of the provinces of Canada, Nova

     <lb/>party and opinion</hi> have concurred in the condi<lb break="no"/>tions upon which such a union may be effected 
     <lb/>in accordance with their wishes. A bill will be 
     <lb/>submitted to you which by the consolidation of 
     <lb/>colonial interests and resources will give 
     <lb/>strength to the sovereign Provinces as members 
     <lb/>of the same empire, and animated by feelings of 
     <lb/>loyalty to the same sovereign." I have given 
     <lb/>you the authority of the leading men of this 
     <lb/>country — of the Colonial Minister, of 
     <lb/>the British Ministry — and in addition 
     <lb/>you have the authority of the Houses 
     <lb/>of Peers and Commons of Great Britain. 
     <lb/>Let detraction assail that parliament as it may, 
     <lb/>the hon. member may endeavour to throw 
     <lb/>odium upon it, but there is not a freeman

     <lb/>body which, amid the convulsions that have 
     <lb/>shaken nations from centre to circumference, 
     <lb/>has maintained the proud pre-eminence of Eng<lb break="no"/>land. It does not become a colonial public

     <lb/>Britain is attracting the admiration of the 
     <lb/>civilized world — when it is the great 
     <lb/>object of other nations to assimilate 
     <lb/>their institutions as nearly as possible to 
     <lb/>those of the mother country, to attempt to 
     <lb/>cast obloquy upon such a body. But they re<lb break="no"/>quire no defence at my hands; the proud posi<lb break="no"/>tion that they occupy—the eminent character of

     the statesmen who are called upon to discharge 
     <lb/>
     the functions of legislation in that country need 
     <lb/>
     no eulogium from me. It is with pride that I am 
     <lb/>
     able to state that having sat in the one House 
     <lb/>
     and stood in the other, I listened to the dis<lb break="no"/>cussions on this great question, and not only the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional points which are at issue, but the 
     <lb/>
     true character of this union were clearly and ably 
     <lb/>
     propounded by the Parliament and statesmen of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain. Having had both sides of 
     <lb/>
     this question before them they were able to ren<lb break="no"/>der such a verdict as they never gave before on 
     <lb/>
     a great public measure. We are able to stand 
     <lb/>
     here and claim that the friends of Union were 
     <lb/>
     sustained by the friends of British institutions 
     <lb/>
     everywhere—that they have had the support and 
     <lb/>
     co-operation of the friends of the colonial em<lb break="no"/>pire in the Parliament of England ; and what 
     <lb/>
     do you find to-day ? In the " Morning Chroni<lb break="no"/>cle"—the organ of the gentlemen opposite— 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the question has been given in 
     <lb/>
     full, as I am happy to see, and what 
     <lb/>
     do you find in the House and Commons? 
     <lb/>
     You find this striking fact to which I wish to 
     <lb/>
     call the attention of gentlemen opposite who 
     <lb/>
     have said that this Union would weaken the 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Crown, that the states<lb break="no"/>men of Great Britain, without regard to party, 
     <lb/>
     Liberal and Conservative, Whig and Tory, 
     <lb/>
     united in one common acclaim that the colo<lb break="no"/>nies would not only be rendered more prosper<lb break="no"/>ous, but that the ties that now bind them to the 
     <lb/>
     Empire would be strengthened. The very few 
     <lb/>
     members who could be induced by gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite to reflect their sentiments did so on the 
     <lb/>
     ground that the colonies were a burthen, and 
     <lb/>
     that the sooner they were got rid of the better. 
     <lb/>
     These are the views of Mr. Bright who com<lb break="no"/>plained that if this Union was accomplished the 
     <lb/>
     result would be to burthen the Empire with the 
     <lb/>
     defence of these provinces and what position did 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ayrton take? He would not commit himself 
     <lb/>
     so far as to oppose Union, but what he com<lb break="no"/>plained of was that millions of British money 
     <lb/>
     were to be expended in connection with a great 
     <lb/>
     highway between this provmce and Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Thus we find the British Government, and all 
     <lb/>
     statesmen who value the colonies as one of the 
     <lb/>
     great sources of the importance and influence 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain among nations arrayed in sup<lb break="no"/>port of colonial Union, whilst in opposition to 
     <lb/>
     to this great scheme we find only the men who 
     <lb/>
     wish to get rid of the colonies altogether. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must for a single instant call the attention 
     <lb/>
     of gentlemen opposite to the fact that they are 
     <lb/>
     bound by their own recorded votes in 1864 to 
     <lb/>
     vote against this resolution. I had the honour 
     <lb/>
     to move in the session of that year a resolution 
     <lb/>
     authorizing a conference to make a much more 
     <lb/>
     radical change than it is now intended to make 
     <lb/>
     in our constitution. It proposed a scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Union that would have merged our local insti<lb break="no"/>tutions altogether—the Parliament and capital 
     <lb/>
     would have been transferred to another place. 
     <lb/>
     When I moved that resolution to appoint dele<lb break="no"/>gates for a Conference to bring about such a re<lb break="no"/>sult, was there a man to raise an objection that 
     <lb/>
     as it would change the constitution, there should 
     <lb/>

<cb/>


     be an appeal to the people. Where were the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who now raise these objections when 
     <lb/>
     I declared that this House had the power to do 
     <lb/>
     what I have said? There was no one then to 
     <lb/>
     raise an objection to such a course. They bound 
     <lb/>
     themselves to the constitutional principle that 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament had the undoubted power, and 
     <lb/>
     right to change the constitution of the country 
     <lb/>
     without an appeal to the people at the polls. 
     <lb/>
     But I can give them another illustration how 
     <lb/>
     lately it is that they have discovered this new 
     <lb/>
     constitutional doctrine—that it is not constitu<lb break="no"/>tional for the peoples' representatives, here in 
     <lb/>
     Parliament assembled, to discharge what they 
     <lb/>
     believe to be a solemn duty to the country. 
     <lb/>
     Can it be possible that these gentlemen have 
     <lb/>
     forgotten that in 1863, just before an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people, the Government of the day 
     <lb/>
     brought forward one of the most radical 
     <lb/>
     changes, a change in the constitution   which, I 
     <lb/>
     have no hesitation in saying, would revolution<lb break="no"/>ized England it propounded there to-morrow. 
     <lb/>
     This measure was to strike down one-third of 
     <lb/>
     the electoral body who were about to go to the 
     <lb/>
     polls. When we, on this side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     urged specific grounds that it had already been 
     <lb/>
     proved that the entire majority which they had 
     <lb/>
     obtained at the last general election had been 
     <lb/>
     subsequently lost at the polls, that they were 
     <lb/>
     only nominally the government, and that there<lb break="no"/>fore they ought not to propose so radical a 
     <lb/>
     change before going to the people, we heard no 
     <lb/>
     such pathetic speeches from gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     as we have had to-day, intended to have effect 
     <lb/>
     in the back settlements of the country ? What 
     <lb/>
     had the hon. member for Guysborough 
     <lb/>
     then to say in favour of the people who 
     <lb/>
     were so ruthlessly to be deprived of their pri<lb break="no"/>vileges. He stood here then one of the 
     <lb/>
     most violent and declamatory supporters of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, declaring that they would 
     <lb/>
     carry this measure, that they had the consti<lb break="no"/>tutional right to do so. Then he backed up 
     <lb/>
     his leader, Mr. Howe, who had put on record 
     <lb/>
     the most unequivocal testimony of the views 
     <lb/>
     of himself and the Liberal party on this 
     <lb/>
     question. It will be remembered that some 
     <lb/>
     26,000 electors, rather taken aback at this 
     <lb/>
     attempt to change the election law, appealed 
     <lb/>
     to the Lieutenant Governor asking for a dis<lb break="no"/>solution of the Legislature, and what was the 
     <lb/>
     answer? That the petitioners had a right to be 
     <lb/>
     heard? That such constitutional changes 
     <lb/>
     must be preceded by an appeal to the people? 
     <lb/>
     No! I hold in my hand the declaration of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the Government stating that it 
     <lb/>
     was the undoubted right of "Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     pass a law in defiance of the people. Yet the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who voted in support of such de<lb break="no"/>clarations are here to-day to express a mock 
     <lb/>
     sympathy which the people will never give 
     <lb/>
     them credit for. Mr Howe said:—"I am not 
     <lb/>
     one of those who shrink from the performance 
     <lb/>
     of a duty. I have never yet backed down 
     <lb/>
     through outside pressure, or waived my 
     <lb/>
     sense of right because of popular influence." 
     <lb/>
     He goes on to say:—"The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     complained that no answer was ever re<lb break="no"/>turned to the petitions for a dissolution. Had 
     <lb/>
     they been sent through the Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary, the proper official channel of communi<lb break="no"/>

     cation between the people and the Lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     Governor, no doubt they would have received 
     <lb/>
     an answer; but they pursued a different 
     <lb/>
     course—the petitions were sent by a deputa<lb break="no"/>tion, and handed in through a spokesman to 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency." These gentlemen, it ap<lb break="no"/>pears, considered that it was a sufficient reason 
     <lb/>
     to treat the petition of 26,000 electors of this 
     <lb/>
     Province with profound contempt because they 
     <lb/>
     did not come through the Provincial Secretary. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose, now, we say to these same gentleman 
     <lb/>
     that if they had sent in their petitions through 
     <lb/>
     the proper channel there would have been a 
     <lb/>
     dissolution long ago. (Laughter.) But they 
     <lb/>
     have never condescended to bring these docu<lb break="no"/>ments under our notice, and I think I know 
     <lb/>
     the reason why, they did not send them through 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary's Office 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was surprised at the contempt with which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member asserted that this measure 
     <lb/>
     was actually being passed in Parliament 
     <lb/>
     without these petitions having ever been read 
     <lb/>
     All I can say is that I sat in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons the night before I left England, and, 
     <lb/>
     up to that time, these petitions had never even 
     <lb/>
     been seen. I think when I put this and that 
     <lb/>
     together I may be able to venture a pretty 
     <lb/>
     good calculation why they had not been seen, 
     <lb/>
     and why they had not come through the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary's office. We know that all 
     <lb/>
     that men could do was done, by appeals in the 
     <lb/>
     press and by public lectures and a paid organi<lb break="no"/>zation, to excite and stir up disapproval that 
     <lb/>
     never existed and does not exist now. Yet 
     <lb/>
     despite all the exertions that were made for 
     <lb/>
     many months; they could not get 10,000 petition<lb break="no"/>ers to put their names on this table. When I 
     <lb/>
     know this fact—that after years of excitement 
     <lb/>
     and misrepresentation they were unable to get 
     <lb/>
     anything but a response of so feeble a charac<lb break="no"/>ter—I can understand why these 30,000 peti<lb break="no"/>tioners were not subjected to the scrutinizing 
     <lb/>
     eye of the Provincial Secretary or of any other 
     <lb/>
     person who would be able to verify whether 
     <lb/>
     there was any substance in these petitions or 
     <lb/>
     not. The reason why the Parliament of Eng<lb break="no"/>land had not seen these petitions down to the 
     <lb/>
     hour of the second reading of the bill in Com<lb break="no"/>mons, was probably that they were of a charac<lb break="no"/>ter that would have excluded them from being 
     <lb/>
     presented. I give this to the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     opposite as the excuse why these petitions 
     <lb/>
     have not been presented, although that apology 
     <lb/>
     is not demanded at my hands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But I must continue my quotations from the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional maxims of the late Government 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howe said: "But, sir, if they received no 
     <lb/>
     reply in words, they were completely answer<lb break="no"/>ed otherwise. The constituents of Digby un<lb break="no"/>constitutioually asked for a dissolution; we 
     <lb/>
     answered the prayer of the petition by con<lb break="no"/>structing <hi rendition="simple:italic">a valuable wharf in that locality</hi>." 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) Well, I think we have also con<lb break="no"/>structed a few wharves and bridges in that 
     <lb/>
     community and elsewhere. (Renewed Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter). Again Mr. Howe continued: "As fast 
     <lb/>
     as possible I am running a road through In<lb break="no"/>verness, that the life-blood of that county 
     <lb/>
     may flow on through a healthy channel." 
     <lb/>
     (Great laughter.) "Queen's has received a 
     <lb/>
     grant for deepening Liverpool harbour. To the 
     <lb/>
     counties through which the railway passes 
     <lb/>
     my answer is the balance in the treasury to 
     <lb/>
     the credit of the railway, at the close of the 
     <lb/>
     present year. To all the counties I reply, 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
        

     the general increase in your revenue—the ge<lb break="no"/>neral provincial prosperity—the peace and or<lb break="no"/>der that have reigned everywhere—these are 
     <lb/>
     the bases of my reply to this charge." 'Well, I 
     <lb/>
     think we can claim public support on much 
     <lb/>
     stronger grounds than those adduced by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. "But I tell the hon gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that even in a legal point of 
     <lb/>view he is wrong. I defy him to put 
     <lb/>his finger on an instance where Par<lb break="no"/>liament has been dissolved at the instiga<lb break="no"/>tion of petitions. A dissolution involves the 
     <lb/>exercise of the extreme power of the Crown, 
     <lb/>and should rarely, if ever, be resorted to, 
     <lb/>except under necessity most urgent and over<lb break="no"/>powering. * * * Let me now refer to the 
     <lb/>opinion of a very eminent divine, who has 
     <lb/>marked the operation of universal suffrage, 
     <lb/>and hear what this gentleman says on that 
     <lb/>subject. After describing the gigantic evils 
     <lb/>of the system, he says: 'What then is to be 
     <lb/>done? Universal suffrage is the law of our 
     <lb/>land. Every one knows that this law cannot 
     <lb/>be repealed, for I repeat it the masses must 
     <lb/>vote its repeal; and this, of course, they will 
     <lb/>not do. There are many indications that of 
     <lb/>late years, through the vast flood of immi<lb break="no"/>gration, through the infamous conduct of 
     <lb/>designing demagogues, through the increase 
     <lb/>of intemperance, these degraded masses are 
     <lb/>gaining in number and in power.' We have 
     <lb/>the power, if we possess the will, to repeal 
     <lb/>this law—to strike down once and forever 
     <lb/>the evil—to relieve ourselves from the charge 
     <lb/>of being the only British colony, save Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia, governed by universal suffrage—to 
     <lb/>purge our constitution, and purify our elec<lb break="no"/>toral system. Let no man at this crisis hesi<lb break="no"/>tate or falter, but manfully and honestly 
     <lb/>perform his duty, to himself and to his coun<lb break="no"/>try. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     This is the doctrine that suited gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in 1863,—they endorsed it to the fullest ex<lb break="no"/>tent they possibly could. In 1863 to make a 
     <lb/>
     radical change in the constitution was right 
     <lb/>
     and proper—to ignore the voice of the 26,<lb break="no"/>000 petitioners was right and proper—to 
     <lb/>
     force a law upon the statute book, to pre<lb break="no"/>vent a large body of the people passing no. 
     <lb/>
     on their acts, was fully sustained by these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I am glad that I cannot include 
     <lb/>
     the hon member for Yarmouth in these ob<lb break="no"/>servations, l'or he was then on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House.

     the hon. member state that the delegates had 
     <lb/>
     exceeded the powers which they had received 
     <lb/>
     from the house in dealing with this question. I 
     <lb/>
     must confess I have had occasion sometimes to 
     <lb/>
     find fault with gentlemen opposite for their very 
     <lb/>
     short memories, but I was hardly prepared for 
     <lb/>
     a statement like that. Is there a man in this 
     <lb/>
     house with the exception of the mover of this 
     <lb/>
     amendment who does not know that this ques<lb break="no"/>tion was debated in this parliament plainly upon 
     <lb/>
     the basis that under that resolution the dele<lb break="no"/>gates were to be empowered to go to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities and obtain the passage of an 
     <lb/>
     Act without future reference to this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture? Is there a single man on either side who 
     <lb/>
     will endorse the statement made by the mover, 
     <lb/>
     that the delegates exceded their authority in the 
     <lb/>
     slightest degree, or that the whole question was

     It was, therefore, perfectly plain that the

     delegates were to go to England and arrange 
     <lb/>
     with the Imperial Government a plan of Union 
     <lb/>
     which would become the law through the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament, and yet in the face of this 
     <lb/>
     well known fact we have heard the hon gentle<lb break="no"/>man declaring that the delegates had exceeded

     it was everywhere known that the delegates

     <lb/>
     been appealed to twice. Why is it that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Nova Scotia have not been allowed to 
     <lb/>
     express their opinions even once ? At Quebec 
     <lb/>
     it was agreed that the scheme of Union should 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the several Parliaments. It 
     <lb/>
     was the last session of the Legislature of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, and the Government found that they 
     <lb/>
     had not a majority to carry the measure. They 
     <lb/>
     appealed to the people, who decided against the 
     <lb/>
     Government, and therefore all action in relation 
     <lb/>
     to the measure in this house was prevented, for 
     <lb/>
     every man felt that whatever were his opinions 
     <lb/>
     on the subject no Union was practicable unless 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick came into it. Action was ac<lb break="no"/>cordingly suspended in this province until a 
     <lb/>
     change should take place in New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
     Subsequently the people there, having had the 
     <lb/>
     question fully explained to them, reversed their 
     <lb/>
     former verdict and gave a large majority of 
     <lb/>
     Union. When it became obvious here that 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick would concur we submitted the 
     <lb/>
     question to this House. I ask the hon mover 
     <lb/>
     of the resolution as well as its seconder if either 
     <lb/>
     of them will venture to say to the House that 
     <lb/>
     the position of the government in this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture is in the slightest degree analogous to 
     <lb/>
     that of the government of New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
     They were called upon to take action upon the 
     <lb/>
     measure, and believed that by an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     country they would be sustained, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently they made that appeal. Subsequently 
     <lb/>
     it was found that the tide of public sentiment 
     <lb/>
     had turned—the explanations which were made 
     <lb/>
     on this question had shown the people that they 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     had been egregiously deceived before, and ac<lb break="no"/>cordingly the moment they were allowed to 
     <lb/>
     speak again they returned an overwhelming 
     <lb/>
     majority in favor of the great principle of union. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member said that the Government 
     <lb/>
     had pressed this matter here with "indecent 
     <lb/>
     haste." Does he not know that this scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Union was decided upon at Quebec in 1864 ? 
     <lb/>
     It was a subject of agitation for nearly two 
     <lb/>
     years, down to 1866, but more than that, are 
     <lb/>
     not these same gentlemen who now charge " in<lb break="no"/>decent haste" against us the men who, session 
     <lb/>
     after session, not only two years ago, but last win<lb break="no"/>ter as well, taunted the government and myself 
     <lb/>
     with cowardice, with failing in what was our 
     <lb/>
     duty to the house and country—for not having 
     <lb/>
     had the manliness to come forward and submit 
     <lb/>
     the question to the members of this Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     But when we knew that the time had come, 
     <lb/>
     when we could deal with this question not as a 
     <lb/>
     hypothetical measure, but one on which the 
     <lb/>
     House could take action in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     change of sentiment in New Brunswick in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Union—when we found that the duty we 
     <lb/>
     owed to the House and country demanded that 
     <lb/>
     we should bring the question before the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, to be dealt with in the proper constitu<lb break="no"/>tional manner, what did these gentlemen say 
     <lb/>
     and do? When they saw that they had mis— 
     <lb/>
     calculated the intelligence and patriotism of this 
     <lb/>
     House and the public sentiment of this country 
     <lb/>
     —that instead of having the overwhelming ma<lb break="no"/>jority that they had deluded themselves into 
     <lb/>
     believing they had, they were in an insignificant 
     <lb/>
     minority; then these gentlemen suddenly dis 
     <lb/>
    covered that we were not open to the charge of 
     <lb/>cowardice and want of statesmanship, but that 
     <lb/>we were pressing the matter with "indecent 
     <lb/>haste." (Applause) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The hon. member for Yarmouth asked why 
     <lb/>
     we did not submit the question to the people as 
     <lb/>
     they did in New Brunswick. No man, sir, in 
     <lb/>
     the history of constitutional legislation ever 
     <lb/>
     heard of so unstatesmanlike a course as a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment dissolving the parliament in which they 
     <lb/>
     had a clear, undoubted majority to carry a mea<lb break="no"/>sure which they believed would promote the gen<lb break="no"/>eral prosperity of the country. I do not appeal 
     <lb/>
     only to gentlemen who are ready to support the
     <lb/>
     government on the question—not to gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in opposition, who are ready to sacrifice the 
     <lb/>
     best interests of party at the shrine of patriotism 
     <lb/>
     —who think more of their country than of sub<lb break="no"/>serving the ends of party—but I ask the oppon<lb break="no"/>ents of this measure not to give their votes in 
     <lb/>
     favour of such a resolution, when its advocates 
     <lb/>
     are obliged to confess that they have not in the 
     <lb/>
     whole range of constitutional government a sin<lb break="no"/>gle precedent in favour of the course they have 
     <lb/>
     chosen to pursue. But what does the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Yarmouth say about the sat election in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick? " A very few votes did it, I 
     <lb/>
     would not be surprized if New Brunswick now 
     <lb/>
     went against it." Then the hon. member has 
     <lb/>
     himself given us a very clear idea of the futility 
     <lb/>
     of appeals to the people. He has seen New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick one day giving its decision in fa<lb break="no"/>vour of, and on the next against, Union. 
     <lb/>

<p>
     But certain gentlemen deputized by some one 
     <lb/>
    or other—I do not think there will be anybody 
     <lb/>hereafter ready to father the act—have written 
     <lb/>a remonstrance against Union to the Colonial 
     <lb/>Secretary. If ever there was a libel on the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish constitutional system—if responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment was ever brought down to the very depths 
     <lb/>degradation, as far as it was in the power of cer<lb break="no"/>tain parties to put it there, it was when the 
     <lb/>three unauthorized men, two of whom had been 
     <lb/>rejected by the people at the polls, presented 
     <lb/>themselves at the foot of the throne, and told 
     <lb/>the Imperial Government that notwithstanding 
     <lb/>our system of government the people are too 
     <lb/>ignorant, and the Parliament is too corrupt to 
     <lb/>be entrusted with the free institutions we enjoy, 
     <lb/>and asked that they should be considered the 
     <lb/>true constitutional authorities to whom 
     <lb/>the Government and Parliament of the 
     <lb/>mother country should pay respect. I know 
     <lb/>not who authorized this delegation, but I was 
     <lb/>not a little surprized to find these gentlemen 
     <lb/>who presented themselves with the authority of 
     <lb/>some one or other, asking the Government and 
     <lb/>Parliament of England to accept them as our 
     <lb/>representatives and to ignore the voice of the 
     <lb/>government and legislature of this country, but 
     <lb/>especially was I astonished to find them putting 
     <lb/>their names to a state paper in which they de<lb break="no"/>clared that the position of the people of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick—where the very thing they are 
     <lb/>are now asking for  has been done—is 
     <lb/>perfectly contemptible and compared the ver<lb break="no"/>dict they have given at the polls to that of a 
     <lb/>brow-beaten jury under Jeffreys. Yet these 
     <lb/>same gentlemen, professing to represent the 
     <lb/>sentiments of the people of Nova Scotia, ask the 
     <lb/>Government of England to allow the people to 
     <lb/>express their opinions at the polls—on the 
     <lb/>ground that they had such an appeal in New 
     <lb/>Brunswick.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman has taken exception to a 
     <lb/>
     statement made by Mr. Watkin. I admit freely 
     <lb/>
     that that statement was too strong, and to some 
     <lb/>
     extent inaccurate. I think, however, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Halifax who was one of the 
     <lb/>
     deputation will admit that it is not a very easy 
     <lb/>
     matter to get gentlemen constantly occupied 
     <lb/>
     with questions of great national importance im<lb break="no"/>mediately touching their own country to under<lb break="no"/>stand all the "ins and outs" of our colonial dis<lb break="no"/>cussions and struggles. I am glad, however, to 
     <lb/>
     be able to fully acquit myself of having misled, 
     <lb/>
     any one on this question in England. I took 
     <lb/>
     the liberty of placing in the hands of Mr. Wat<lb break="no"/>kin and every other member of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons an authentic statement of my own, 
     <lb/>
     and in that document I have shown accurately 
     <lb/>
     as I contend every step that has been taken in 
     <lb/>
     the progress of this questiton. I may state to 
     <lb/>
     the House, and I do it in all sincerity, that from 
     <lb/>
     the first I have never entertained but one opin<lb break="no"/>ion, and that is, the intelligent sentiment of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country is in favour of Union.  I 
     <lb/>
     do not say that I have ever felt it would 
     <lb/>
     be a wise experiment to appeal to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple on  this question; that would be an en<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
tirely unprecedented proceeding; but I know 
     <lb/>
     enough of appeals to the people to be 
     <lb/>
     aware that it is quite possible for the pub<lb break="no"/>lic sentiment to be in favour of a measure, 
     <lb/>
     and yet for this measure to be unsuccessful 
     <lb/>
     when put to the people. I believe a public man 
     <lb/>
     is bound in the advocacy of public measures to 
     <lb/>
     study as far as possible what is required to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the public good, and to go as far as he can 
     <lb/>
     in his public legislation as the public sentiment 
     <lb/>
     will sustain him. I have been, perhaps, as 
     <lb/>
     strong a party man as any in this country, but 
     <lb/>
     I am proud to be able to say, that anxious as I 
     <lb/>
     have been to promote the views of party, much 
     <lb/>
     as I believe in the existence of parties in the 
     <lb/>
     state, and the advantage of having a strong op<lb break="no"/>position as well as government,—anxious as I 
     <lb/>
     am to serve the partv from whom I have re<lb break="no"/>ceived such unqualified support and co-oper<lb break="no"/>ation—I am able to say that I have regarded 
     <lb/>
     one thing as of paramount importance, and that 
     <lb/>
     is, the interests of my country. It is not the 
     <lb/>
     first occasion on which as a public man, stand<lb break="no"/>ing in the responsible position in which it has 
     <lb/>
     pleased the people of this Province to place me, 
     <lb/>
     I have brought forward measures and advocat<lb break="no"/>ed them with all the zeal and earnestness that I 
     <lb/>
     could bring to their discussion, although at the 
     <lb/>
     same time I believed them to be as fatal to the 
     <lb/>
     interests of my party as it was possible for any 
     <lb/>
     measures to be. I need not tell the House what 
     <lb/>
     was the sentiment of the country in regard to 
     <lb/>
     taxation for the support of schools. I need not 
     <lb/>
     tell the House how perfectly I was satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that, in the ranks of the party which sustained 
     <lb/>
     me throughout this country, there was a 
     <lb/>
     very large body of people who would not only 
     <lb/>
     resist, but resent such a change in the law as 
     <lb/>
     would impose a large burthen upon the people 
     <lb/>
     for the support of the schools. But I came to 
     <lb/>
     this table, and imposed such a burthen, under 
     <lb/>
     the conviction that it was my duty so to do, for 
     <lb/>
     my conscience told me that that measure was 
     <lb/>
     imperatively required to promote the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country at large ; but although I    
     <lb/>
     expected to produce temporary dissatisfaction, 
     <lb/>
     I never had a doubt what the result would be 
     <lb/>
     after the people had had abundant opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of testing the merits of the law.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that the intelligent sentiment of the 
     <lb/>
     country is in favour of this Union, but then the 
     <lb/>
    mode by which it might be defeated would be 
     <lb/>this : Whilst the opponents of the measure in 
     <lb/>the ranks of the conservative party would with<lb break="no"/>draw their confidence and support from the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, gentlemen who oppose the measure, 
     <lb/>but prefer another party in this province, would 
     <lb/>combine with the former, for the purpose of de<lb break="no"/>feating the men in power. How could I have 
     <lb/>any doubt as to the intelligent sentiment of this 
     <lb/>country ? Long ago it was acknowledged as a 
     <lb/>question removed from party—one which pub<lb break="no"/>lic men, irrespective of party considerations, 
     <lb/>should unite in promoting. When it was found 
     <lb/>that the government must under all circum<lb break="no"/>stances stand or fall by this question, then for the 
     <lb/>first time were public men who had been them<lb break="no"/>

selves most enthusiastic advocates of Union pre<lb break="no"/>pared to take advantage of the opportunity thus 
     <lb/>
     afforded.—I will not say an unfair advantage, 
     <lb/>
     though I would be justified in saying so—for 
     <lb/>
     party purposes. Dcspite such facts, however, 
     <lb/>
     I feel convinced that not only the great body of 
     <lb/>
     the conservative party, but the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     liberals of this country—the standard bearers of 
     <lb/>
     which have given this question a support which 
     <lb/>
     does infinite credit to their patriotism—are just 
     <lb/>
    as warmly in favour of Union as when Mr. 
     <lb/>Howe was its most able exponent. I do not de<lb break="no"/>ny that there has been a large and formidable 
     <lb/>opposition to this measure, but I believe when 
     <lb/>the people look at it without reference to other 
     <lb/>public questions or any considerations of a par<lb break="no"/>ty character, when it is no longer <hi rendition="simple:italic">sub judice</hi> but 
     <lb/>become the law of the land, the constitution of 
     <lb/>the country for weal or woe, all classes will 
     <lb/>combine to sustain it, and the opponents of 
     <lb/>Union themselves will feel that there is but one 
     <lb/>course to pursue if they wish to lay claim to the 
     <lb/>character of statesmen and patriots—and that is 
     <lb/>to work out our new institutions in a manner 
     <lb/>that will be most conducive to the interests of 
     <lb/>the province at large. (Cheers.)

            <p>
     The hon. member referred to the London 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> as a great authority, but no person knows 
     <lb/>
     better than he does that that journal has been 
     <lb/>
     regarded as antagonistic to the interests of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish America, and that it has always favoured 
     <lb/>
     the Australian colonies. It will be also remem<lb break="no"/>bered that it has taken the same view of this 
     <lb/>
     question as has been taken by the opponents of 
     <lb/>
     Union in Parliament, that these colonies are a 
     <lb/>
     burthen to the mother country. The great ob<lb break="no"/>jection, in fact, which it has urged against this 
     <lb/>
     scheme is, that instead of dissevering the con<lb break="no"/>nection. Union has bound us for ever to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, and that the British Government are 
     <lb/>
     committed to the guarantee for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Intercolonial Railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Reference has been made to the defenceless po<lb break="no"/>sition of Canada. Now I have always regarded 
     <lb/>
     —and I am glad to find that every man who has 
     <lb/>
     had an opportunity of studying the question has 
     <lb/>
     coincided with me—it would be utterly im<lb break="no"/>possible to retain Nova Scotia unless Canada 
     <lb/>and New Brunswick were retained. New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick is especially defenseless, and if that pro<lb break="no"/>vince and Canada should fall into the possession 
     <lb/>of a foreign power there is no British statesman 
     <lb/>who will undertake to say that the security of this 
     <lb/>province could be maintained. Therefore this 
     <lb/>is not a question whether one province is more 
     <lb/>defenseless than another, but whether the combi<lb break="no"/>nation and the consolidation of the whole will 
     <lb/>not give increased security to all. The gentle<lb break="no"/>men who havc been deputed to advocate the 
     <lb/>views of the opponents of Union have placed on 
     <lb/>record what I suppose are the opinions of the 
     <lb/>gentlemen they represent. The organ of the 
     <lb/>party led by Mr. Howe was the first to propound 
     <lb/>the principle that British subjects in this country 
     <lb/>were bound to pay pound for pound for the de<lb break="no"/>fence of the empire with every other portion of 
     <lb/>the British Empire. When the " Morning 
     <lb/>Chronicle" was wrested from the hands of its 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     former editor because he had become the friend 
     <lb/>
     of British America Union, and the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers for East Halifax became its editor as well 
     <lb/>
     as proprietor, the first thing he did was to put on 
     <lb/>
     record what their scheme was for the defence of 
     <lb/>
     the country. If the hon. member says " Leave 
     <lb/>
     well enough alone," I will turn him to the re<lb break="no"/>cord of the leader of the Anti-Union party. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman (Mr. Howe) has given in the 
     <lb/>
     most authentic form his opinion that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince has in the present condition of affairs " no 
     <lb/>
     security for peace." A number of articles which 
     <lb/>
     are now known to be written by Mr. Howe were 
     <lb/>
     published in the hon. member's paper, and in 
     <lb/>
     these the declaration was made, in so many 
     <lb/>
     words, that their scheme for the defence 
     <lb/>
     of the Empire was to levy a tax upon the 
     <lb/>
     people equal to that borne by the rest of the Em<lb break="no"/>pire. The hon. member for East Halifax, in a 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet which he wrote as the representative 
     <lb/>
     of the Anti-Union party has put it on record that 
     <lb/>
     he is prepared to pay "pound for pound with 
     <lb/>
     the Canadians." I ask, then, the hon. mover of 
     <lb/>
     this resolution with the fact before him that the 
     <lb/> leader of the Anti-Union party has propounded 
     <lb/> a scheme—a scheme endorsed by the other Anti- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Union delegates—that would absorb the entire 
     <lb/>revenue of this province for defence alone; does 
     <lb/>it lie in his mouth or of any opponent of Union 
     <lb/>to charge us with having attempted to increase the 
     <lb/>burthens of the country in relation to defence. 
     <lb/>Not only is this scheme the only means by which 
     <lb/>British America can remain British America— 
     <lb/>by which we can retain the free British insti<lb break="no"/>tutions which it is our pride and happiness to 
     <lb/>possess—but it opens up to these countries an 
     <lb/>avenue to prosperity such as was never offered to 
     <lb/>any people before. Therefore I say this mea<lb break="no"/>sure of Union instead of increasing the 
     <lb/>burthens of these people is effected upon terms 
     <lb/>which are going to continue us under the aegis of 
     <lb/>Great Britain—to preserve to us her free institu<lb break="no"/>tions, to give us the largest amount proaperity; 
     <lb/>all this, too, with an immunity from burthens 
     <lb/>that might well make us the envy of the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Look across the borders, and what do you see 
     <lb/>
     the allies of our opponents doing? We see the 
     <lb/>
     Governor of Maine in his annual message de<lb break="no"/>claring his hostility to Confederation, and as<lb break="no"/>serting that the friends of the United States in 
     <lb/>
     these provinces were doing their utmost to pre<lb break="no"/>vent the consummation of that scheme. Is there 
     <lb/>
     a man in this country who can be so blind as not 
     <lb/>
     to see what that means? Can any one fail to see 
     <lb/>
     the opinion the sagacious statesmen of the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted Statcs entertain of the future which is in 
     <lb/>
     store for British America under the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. The statesmen-of that country 
     <lb/>
     are bound to do all in their power to promote 
     <lb/>
     the stability of the institutions which they pos<lb break="no"/>sess, but I am not less able to draw my deduc<lb break="no"/>tion from the course they are pursuing. In the 
     <lb/>
     report of the Parliament of Maine, founded upon 
     <lb/>
     that portion of the Governor's Address which 
     <lb/>
     refers to Confederation, you find a contrast 
     <lb/>
     drawn between British America and the United 
     <lb/>
     States. They tell you that the population of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick is increasing three times as 
     <lb/>

     rapidly as that of Maine, and look with disfavor 
     <lb/>
     upon a scheme which is going to increase the 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of that province as well as of all Bri<lb break="no"/>tish America. They see that this scheme will 
     <lb/>
     give an increase of power and influence to these 
     <lb/>
     provinces—will bring into them a large amount 
     <lb/>
     of capital and wealth—will enable them to enjoy 
     <lb/>
     an unparalleled amount of prosperity, free from 
     <lb/>
     that heavy load of taxation which is now weigh<lb break="no"/>ing down the people of the United States. It is 
     <lb/>
     for reasons like these that the statesmen of the 
     <lb/>
     United States look with a jealous eye upon the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of institutions that are going to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen the connection that now binds us to 
     <lb/>
     the parent state and to make us great and pow<lb break="no"/>erful. I ask gentlemen opposite to weigh care<lb break="no"/>fully the opinions which American statesmen ex<lb break="no"/>press in respect to this measure of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and ask themselves whether the are justi<lb break="no"/>fied in (pursuing a policy antagonistic to the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of institutions which are not only 
     <lb/>
     going to make us prosperous but to place us in a 
     <lb/>
     position that will excite the envy of one of the 
     <lb/>
     greatest nations of the world. (Cheers.)

     Speech of Mr. Annand. 
     <lb/>
            </head>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName> said — I have been for 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five years a member of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     —so long a time that, though not very far ad<lb break="no"/>vanced in years I have become the father 
     <lb/>
     of the house, but long as my experience has 
     <lb/>
     been, I never until the present occasion wit<lb break="no"/>nessed an evening session on the second day 
     <lb/>
     of our meeting. But I take this to be all of a 
     <lb/>
     piece with the arbitrary proceedings by which 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is to be forced upon the people 
     <lb/>
     of this Province—time is not to be given for 
     <lb/>
     deliberation and free discussion. We have 
     <lb/>
     been told that the season is advanced, and 
     <lb/>
     that the revenue laws will soon expire, but 
     <lb/>
     certainly we had a right to expect that upon 
     <lb/>
     so important a subject as changing the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the Province, at least a week's de<lb break="no"/>bate would have been allowed us without se<lb break="no"/>riously interfering with the public business. 
     <lb/>
     The revenue bills last year were brought down 
     <lb/>
     on the 28th of March, and we could therefore 
     <lb/>
     have been allowed ten days for this question, 
     <lb/>
     and still have left as much time as was deem<lb break="no"/>ed necessary last year for arranging the tariff. 
     <lb/>
     The Provincial secretary has said that he 
     <lb/>
     stood here last year as the defender of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme—that he was a consistent de<lb break="no"/>fender of that scheme—but I was surprised to 
     <lb/>
     hear him tell us that its terms were inferior to 
     <lb/>
     those which he and his colleagues at West<lb break="no"/>minster Palace Hotel have obtained for us. I 
     <lb/>
     was surprised at that statement, because after 
     <lb/>
     a calm examination I have come to the deli<lb break="no"/>berate conclusion that those terms are far 
     <lb/>
     worse. Let me remind the House of the re<lb break="no"/>marks made by the gentleman who made over<lb break="no"/>tures; to the Government to bring down a reso<lb break="no"/>lution for the appointment of delegates. He 
     <lb/>
     said he rose to condemn the Quebec scheme 
     <lb/>
     —that he desired to see it destroyed, and a bet<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
           

     ter one framed. Another gentleman, repre<lb break="no"/>senting a distant constituency, made similar 
     <lb/>
     observations, expressing his pleasure that the 
     <lb/>
     Government had abandoned the measure 
     <lb/>
     adopted at the Quebec Conference. But what 
     <lb/>
     do we find in the English press, and the speech 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Adderly in the House of Commons? 
     <lb/>
     That the bill introduced by the Earl of Carnar<lb break="no"/>von, at the instance of the Delegates, is in sub<lb break="no"/>stance the Quebee scheme. Whom then, are 
     <lb/>
     we to credit, the hon. Provincial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     or the Under Secretary for the Colonies? And 
     <lb/>
     then we have the bill, which speaks for itself. 
     <lb/>
     The delegates were charged under the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion of this house to arrange a scheme of union 
     <lb/>
     with the Imperial Government which would 
     <lb/>
     effectually ensure just provision for the rights 
     <lb/>
     and interests of this Province—far better terms 
     <lb/>
     than those embodied in the Quebec scheme, 
     <lb/>
     which the Government had virtually aban<lb break="no"/>doned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told that "better terms" have been 
     <lb/>
     obtained, and I ask the Provincial Secretary 
     <lb/>
     to point out in what respect the new Confede<lb break="no"/>ration scheme is an improvement on the old 
     <lb/>
     one. Why confine himself to a bald declara<lb break="no"/>tion upon a subject of such magnitude and 
     <lb/>
     deep interest to the people of this country? I 
     <lb/>
     join issue with the hon. leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on this point. I contend that the terms 
     <lb/>
     obtained by the delegates, instead of being 
     <lb/>
     better, are far worse than those embodied in 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions adopted at Quebec. Under 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec scheme our local legislature would 
     <lb/>
     have had the right to impose an export duty 
     <lb/>
     on coal, from which a large revenue might, if 
     <lb/>
     it was thought proper, be raised and applied 
     <lb/>
     to the local wants of the country. That right 
     <lb/>
     has been taken away from us, and transferred  
     <lb/>
     to the Government of Canada, who are clothed  
     <lb/>
     with the power of taxing as they please one of 
     <lb/>
     the most valuable exports of the Province. It 
     <lb/>
     is clear, then, that in respect to our minerals, 
     <lb/>
     worse instead of better terms have been the 
     <lb/>
     result of the negotiations on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the water. Then there is the much discussed 
     <lb/>
     subject of the Intercolonial Railway, estima<lb break="no"/>ted to cost four millions of pounds sterling, 
     <lb/>
     which it was said would be guaranteed by the 
     <lb/>
     British Government if the Provinces consent<lb break="no"/>ed to unite in a Confederation. But, as I un<lb break="no"/>derstand the present position of affairs, the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial authorities will not venture to ask 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to guarantee more than three mil<lb break="no"/>lions—a sum sufficient to carry the road into 
     <lb/>
     the midst of a howling wilderness, leaving it 
     <lb/>
     there, and benefitting no one but those charged 
     <lb/>
     with the expenditure of the money. But then 
     <lb/>
     I will be told that the financial terms are bet<lb break="no"/>ter—that much larger grants for local purpo<lb break="no"/>ses have been secured under the new arrange<lb break="no"/>ment than the old one. The delegates will 
     <lb/>
     say, " have we not procured $60,000 a year for 
     <lb/>
     defraying the expenses of your local govern<lb break="no"/>ment, over and above the 80 cents a head you 
     <lb/>
     were to receive under the Quebec scheme;— 
     <lb/>
     and have we not also made an arrangement 
     <lb/>
     by which you will continue to receive your 80 
     <lb/>
     cents a head until your population is 400,000?" 
     <lb/>
     This is quite true, but the concession will be 
     <lb/>
     estimated at its true worth when I inform the 
     <lb/>
     house of the large increase of revenue which 
     <lb/>
     has taken place in the Province since the adop- 4 
     <lb/>
     tion of the resolutions of the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence. These were framed in 1864, and the fi<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
         

     nancial arrangement which was to give us 80 
     <lb/>
     cents a head was based upon the revenues of 
     <lb/>
     1863. Since that time our customs revenues 
     <lb/>
     alone has increased $351,822—considerably 
     <lb/>
     more than the annual subsidy; and yet we are 
     <lb/>
     expected to be thankful when we are pro<lb break="no"/>mised an additional $60,000 a year—about one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     third of the increase of the revenue for a sin<lb break="no"/>gle year, 1866, under our present low tariff.— 
     <lb/>
     The terms may seem better, but are they such 
     <lb/>
     as we were entitled to receive—such terms, as 
     <lb/>
     with a full knowledge of the facts, the dele<lb break="no"/>gates were bound to secure for the people they 
     <lb/>
     professed to represent? $60,000 a year; what 
     <lb/>
     is it? By a single enactment the general gov<lb break="no"/>ernment could levy a larger export duty on 
     <lb/>
     coal every year. The increased taxes from 
     <lb/>
     the advalorem duties alone of a Canadian ta<lb break="no"/>riff, 50 per cent above ours. will add nearly 
     <lb/>
     $300,000 a year to our taxation. Talk of taxes! 
     <lb/>
     Our people are for the first time in their lives 
     <lb/>
     about to realize what taxation is under this 
     <lb/>
     precious scheme of confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     A great mistake was made in seeking to 
     <lb/>
     change the institutions of these Provinces, un<lb break="no"/>der which they have all grown to be free, hap<lb break="no"/>py and prosperous. They would not leave 
     <lb/>
     well enough alone,—and they must take the 
     <lb/>
     consequences of their folly in seeking to esta<lb break="no"/>blish a new nation, which can only exist upon 
     <lb/>
     the forbearance of a powerful and exacting 
     <lb/>
     neighbor. We are told that the country is 
     <lb/>
     familiar with the question. Yes, with the 
     <lb/>
     question in the abstract. It has been discuss<lb break="no"/>ed here from time to time. some favoring a 
     <lb/>
     Legislative and others a Federal Union, but 
     <lb/>
     no one having a clear and definite view of the 
     <lb/>
     subject. Mr. Howe, who I heartily wish was 
     <lb/>
     here to defend himself, has been charged with 
     <lb/>
     being the originator of Confederation. I deny 
     <lb/>
     the truth of that assertion, and challenge an in<lb break="no"/>vestigation of that gentleman's speeches and 
     <lb/>
     writings for a single instance in which he ad<lb break="no"/>vocated such a scheme as that now pressed 
     <lb/>
     upon our acceptance. My friend has written 
     <lb/>
     and said much on the subject of Union; he has 
     <lb/>
     discussed the subject in its various phases, 
     <lb/>
     but he raised objections to them all—to a Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Union, to a Federal Union, to union 
     <lb/>
     with the United States—and only gave in his 
     <lb/>
     adhesion to the larger and more comprehen<lb break="no"/>sive scheme known as the "Organization of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire." Mr. Howe never favored any scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Union that would have destroyed the auto<lb break="no"/>nomy of this Province, and certainly never 
     <lb/>
     would have been a party to any measure that 
     <lb/>
     would have handed over the revenues and re<lb break="no"/>sources of Nova Scotia to Canada, or any other 
     <lb/>
     country. The Provincial Secretary says that 
     <lb/>
     he (Prov. Secy.) held  meetings in various 
     <lb/>
    parts of the country, where he lectured upon 
     <lb/>Union. And if he did, what then? He does 
     <lb/>not pretend to say that he advocated a Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme like the present, but like 
     <lb/>Mr. Howe, whom he appears to have a mania 
     <lb/>for imitating, he was in favor of Union of some 
     <lb/>sort, without any very clear or definite views 
     <lb/>upon the subject. But suppose Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>had written all his life long in favour of Union, 
     <lb/>or even in favour of Confederation, what then? 
     <lb/>We are here to decide for ourselves and for the 
     <lb/>people of this country, and we are bound to 
     <lb/>examine and see whether it is for their benefit 
     <lb/>or not to reject this or any other measure, but, 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
       

     above all, to claim their right to be heard before 
     <lb/>
     any change is made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Pro Secy. referred to the suffrage ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and told us the late Government intro<lb break="no"/>duced a bill to disfranchise a large body of 
     <lb/>
     the electors. They did. But the difference 
     <lb/>
     between that case and the present is: they did 
     <lb/>
     not succeed in passing the measure into law, 
     <lb/>
     and going to the elections their action was con<lb break="no"/>demned, and they paid the penalty. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple returned a majority in favor of universal 
     <lb/>
     suffrage—they rebuked the action of the late 
     <lb/>
     Government, but what chance have the elec<lb break="no"/>tors of reversing the Confederation policy 
     <lb/>
     and bringing back their constitution, when the 
     <lb/>
     Bill before the Imperial Parliament becomes 
     <lb/>
     law? The hon. member knows that they have 
     <lb/>
     none, and that the cases are not parallel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He has asked us to show a precedent for the 
     <lb/>
     course which we urge. It is not for him to 
     <lb/>
     ask that of us, but we demand of him where 
     <lb/>
     in the history of the world any such attempt 
     <lb/>
     has been made to deprive a people of their 
     <lb/>
     government and institutions against their 
     <lb/>
     will—without even the Parliament being al<lb break="no"/>lowed to review the measure. Such a policy 
     <lb/>
     may be tried with impunity in a province like 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia with its 350,000 people, but could 
     <lb/>
     it be safely tried in the Canadas with their 
     <lb/>
     two and a half millions? Could it be tried in 
     <lb/>
     England? Suppose any ministry in the moth<lb break="no"/>er country were to bring forward a measure 
     <lb/>
     for the annexation of the British Islands to 
     <lb/>
     Austria or any other any other kingdom— 
     <lb/>
     could it be done without a revolution? We 
     <lb/>
     are too weak to rebel if we had the disposi<lb break="no"/>tion, but it is a fair principle that what could 
     <lb/>
     not be done constitutionally in England 
     <lb/>
     should not be done here. It is said that the 
     <lb/>
     resolution of 1861 introduced by Mr. Howe 
     <lb/>
     committed the late Government and every 
     <lb/>
     member of the house to the support of Union. 
     <lb/>
     That resolution merely declared that the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of union had been frequently discussed, 
     <lb/>
     and that the time had come when it should 
     <lb/>
     be set at rest. That resolution speaks for 
     <lb/>
     itself—it bound no gentleman to support 
     <lb/>
     any particular form of union, or union at  
     <lb/>
     all; much less a scheme prepared three years 
     <lb/>
     afterwards at Quebec containing provisions 
     <lb/>
     which no one could have dreamed of in 1861. 
     <lb/>
     That resolution led to a conference in 1862 at 
     <lb/>
     at which were present delegates from Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick, and the whole 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council of Canada. I was one of 
     <lb/>
     the delegates, and was present when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of colonial union was discussed. And what 
     <lb/>
     was the decision? This House had asked that 
     <lb/>
     the question should be " set at rest." and the 
     <lb/>
     answer they received was that it was premature 
     <lb/>
     even to discuss the question. The delegates 
     <lb/>
     considered it premature to consider the subject 
     <lb/>
     until the Intercolonial Railway had been built, 
     <lb/>
     and free trade between the Provinces established. 
     <lb/>
     That then is the answer to the argument drawn 
     <lb/>
     from the resolution of 1861 which, it should be 
     <lb/>
     remembered, was not even debated in this 
     <lb/>
     House. The Prov. Sec. spent nearly an hour 
     <lb/>
     in enlarging upon the rights and powers of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. No one disputes the power of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament.—what we were discussing is not 
     <lb/>
     the power, but the sound and wise exercise of 
     <lb/>

     the country under the existing constitution. 
     <lb/>
     We are told by high authority that Parliament 
     <lb/>
     can do anything but make a man a woman, and 
     <lb/>
     while we may admit that it might be tight on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the Imperial Parliament to override 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of a Colony were a great State 
     <lb/>
     necessity to arise, we have no right under the 
     <lb/>
     limited powers which we possess to transfer to a 
     <lb/>
     body of men assembled on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     water our legislative functions. This fact 
     <lb/>
     must be borne in mind; that this measure is 
     <lb/>
     not the result of the action of the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of the country; the Quebec scheme and the 
     <lb/>
     bill before the Imperial Parliament have never 
     <lb/>
     been before us, and I deny the right of any 
     <lb/>
     body of delegates, however appointed, to make 
     <lb/>
     laws for us. We are told that there never was 
     <lb/>
     such an attempt to violate the principles of 
     <lb/>
     Responsible Government as was manifested by 
     <lb/>
     the minority in this house endeavoring to 
     <lb/>
     counteract the action of last winter by which 
     <lb/>
     the delegates were clothed with power to pre<lb break="no"/>pare a scheme. My idea of Responsible Go<lb break="no"/>vernment is that the Administration shall be 
     <lb/>
     carried on according to the well understood 
     <lb/>
     wishes of the people, and I hold that the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who crossed the sea as delegates knew 
     <lb/>
     that the people were opposed to any such change 
     <lb/>
     as they proposed to make; that they were ar<lb break="no"/>bitrarily seeking to change the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the well known sentiments of the 
     <lb/>
     people. The Prov. Secretary calls upon us to 
     <lb/>
     show him an example in the history of the 
     <lb/>
     world where a statesman was idiotic enough  to 
     <lb/>
     dissolve the house when he had a majority at 
     <lb/>
     his back. We do not ask a dissolution. Let 
     <lb/>
     the duration of the house run down, and the 
     <lb/>
     question come before the people in its natural 
     <lb/>
     course. But was not Mr. Tilley, who had 
     <lb/>
     such a majority, "idiotic" enough to dissolve 
     <lb/>
     the house in New Brunswick? We all know that 
     <lb/>
     he did, and the consequence was that he and 
     <lb/>
     his Government were defeated at the polls. His 
     <lb/>
     was the manly course, for which he fairly earn<lb break="no"/>ed the respect of the people of that Province. 
     <lb/>
     This may not be a very inviting precedent, but 
     <lb/>
     that is the answer I give to the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman. If there can be any doubt about the 
     <lb/>
     force of this precedent, I will give another: It 
     <lb/>
     was asked in the Canadian Parliament whether 
     <lb/>
     Confederation should not be placed before the 
     <lb/>
     country, and Mr. Brown, the President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, said that if there could be any doubt 
     <lb/>
     about the feelings of the people, then, decidedly, 
     <lb/>
     the question should be referred to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One reason why this Union is to be forced 
     <lb/>
     upon us maybe gathered from a conversation 
     <lb/>
     between two Canadian gentlemen who were 
     <lb/>
     present on the opening of the present Session. 
     <lb/>
     When that part of the Lieutenant Governor's 
     <lb/>
     Speech was read which referred to the large in<lb break="no"/>crease of our revenue, one remarked to the other 
     <lb/>
     " Good for us." It is " good for us," says Cana<lb break="no"/>da, to get these Maritime Provinces, with their 
     <lb/>
     surplus revenues, with unlimited power to tax 
     <lb/>them as we wish. The Provincial Secretary<lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     asked why the petitions of the people against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation had not been forwarded through 
     <lb/>
     the Lieutenant Governor I will tell him. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, these petitions were addressed 
     <lb/>
     to the House of Commons. The Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary made a complaint of their not being 
     <lb/>
     sent through him, but I was not aware before 
     <lb/>
     that it was customary to send such petitions 
     <lb/>
     through the Secretary of the Colony. Peti<lb break="no"/>tions to the Queen are in a different position ; 
     <lb/>
     but the hon. gentleman is incorrect in inti<lb break="no"/>mating that he never saw the petitions, for 
     <lb/>
     one of them was forwarded to the Lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     Governor, and there were other proceedings 
     <lb/>
     that passed through his office to which he 
     <lb/>
     has not referred There were petitions and 
     <lb/>
     addresses from eight counties. There were 
     <lb/>
     addresses asking the members from six coun<lb break="no"/>ties to resign their seats, because they voted 
     <lb/>
     for Confederation; and let me say that if such 
     <lb/>
     proceedings had taken place in England—pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings affecting the entire majority in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, no ministry dare attempt 
     <lb/>
     to resist such an appeal. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     spoke about the subject being familiar with 
     <lb/>
     prominent men in England; let me ask how 
     <lb/>
     many members of the houses of Lords and Com<lb break="no"/>mons read " The case of the Maritime Provin<lb break="no"/>ces," as put before them by the People's Dele<lb break="no"/>gates? I use the term " People's Delegates" be<lb break="no"/>cause we did represent the people; for though 
     <lb/>
     a tyrannical majority may rob us of our consti<lb break="no"/>tution, yet there is an overwhelming majority 
     <lb/>
     behind us who denounce the arbitrary manner 
     <lb/>
     in which the measure was pressed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What where the facts in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation Bill? A more indecent proceed<lb break="no"/>ing never took place, even in this house than 
     <lb/>
     was witnessed in the House of Lords on the 
     <lb/>
     third reading of that bill. When delay was 
     <lb/>
     urged by one peer, although the house had been 
     <lb/>
     comparatively full at the commencement of his 
     <lb/>
     speech, there were but nine members on the 
     <lb/>
     benches when he ceased speaking. That is an 
     <lb/>
     illustration of the wicked indifference to the 
     <lb/>
     wishes and interests of the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince which has prevailed throughout. My 
     <lb/>
     hon and learned friend from Guysboro' very 
     <lb/>
     justly said, this afternoon, that more interest 
     <lb/>
     would have been excited by a bill imposing a 
     <lb/>
     tax on dogs than by a measure involving the fu<lb break="no"/>ture welfare of these British North American 
     <lb/>
     Colonies. I was in England for some time, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore have had a pretty good opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of guaging the public mind, and I know that the 
     <lb/>
     recent yacht race across the Atlantic, at which 
     <lb/>
     everybody laughed on this side of the water, ex<lb break="no"/>cited the greatest attention in England, and pro<lb break="no"/>duced articles in the press which were nauseat<lb break="no"/>ing to read, while the ablest writers of the day 
     <lb/>
     were unable to interest the public in a measure 
     <lb/>
     affecting the interests and welfare of these loyal 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and involving perhaps their separ<lb break="no"/>ation from the mother country. What took 
     <lb/>
     place in the House of Commons? The bill was 
     <lb/>
     sent down one day, and for the first time in the 
     <lb/>
     history of that house, it was read a second time 
     <lb/>
    on the following day. Before the papers illust<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="running">DEBATES AND PROCEEDINGS</fw>
         
rating the subject had been presented—before 
     <lb/>
     our " case was printed—the indecent spectacle 
     <lb/>
     was witnessed of the bill being hurried through 
     <lb/>
     a second reading. I give that has a reason why 
     <lb/>
     the petitions were not laid before the house. 
     <lb/>
     The bill was brought down, as it were, yester<lb break="no"/>day, and before they could be presented on the 
     <lb/>
     following day, it was read a second time 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I can fancy I understand the influences that 
     <lb/>
     were brought to bear upon some members of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, among whom was the late Under- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Secretary of State for the Colonies There 
     <lb/>
     was evidently a feeling that it was necessary 
     <lb/>
     to smuggle the measure through. But al<lb break="no"/>though there was hot haste as to the 
     <lb/>
     second reading, time was afterwards given 
     <lb/>
     for consideration, and I am not without hope 
     <lb/>
     that there may yet be manly spirit enough to 
     <lb/>
     send the scheme back to the people of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. That second reading was carried by 
     <lb/>
     declarations that we had no grievance at all, 
     <lb/>
     that the subject had been before the people at 
     <lb/>
     the last general election, that the opposition 
     <lb/>
     was factious and did not represent popular opin<lb break="no"/>ion. One very significant fact has already trans<lb break="no"/>pired; last year it was said that the Queen desir<lb break="no"/>ed Confederation—that the Secretary for the 
     <lb/>
     Colonies, the Parliament, press, and people of 
     <lb/>
     England all desired it, but now, when the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility is thrown on the British Cabinet, what 
     <lb/>
     do they say? Her Majesty says that the bill has 
     <lb/>
     been prepared in conformity with the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     the delegates from the various provinces. 
     <lb/>
     And what does the act itself say? It says it 
     <lb/>
     is introduced because the delegates desire the 
     <lb/>
     measure. Her Majesty's Ministers, fearing 
     <lb/>
     that trouble may come—that the new nationality 
     <lb/>
     may come to grief—shake themselves clear of 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility, and can hereafter point to the 
     <lb/>
     bill and say—" This is no measure of ours ; we 
     <lb/>
     merely gave the force of law to the enactment, 
     <lb/>
     which you desired." I was amused to hear the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Secretary say that the friends of union 
     <lb/>
     were sustained by the friends of British connec<lb break="no"/>tion in England. I have had opportunities un<lb break="no"/>surpassed by any Colonist of ascertaining the 
     <lb/>
     feelings of gentlemen connected with the press 
     <lb/>
     of England, and I here declare that 
     <lb/>
     the leading opinion of the governing 
     <lb/>
     classes of England is, that these colonies 
     <lb/>
     should be made into an independent nation, 
     <lb/>
     and they would gladly have separated Cana<lb break="no"/>da from the Maritime Provinces, but they 
     <lb/>
     felt that a maritime frontage was essential for 
     <lb/>
     her existence. The opinion, I repeat, of the 
     <lb/>
     friends of Confederation is that we should be 
     <lb/>
     united, and put in such a position that by a 
     <lb/>
     single stroke of the pen we may be separated 
     <lb/>
     from the parent state. Examine that bill and 
     <lb/>
     you will find that the only link of connec<lb break="no"/>tion which it will leave us is the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General who is to receive out of our revenues 
     <lb/>
     a salary of $50,000 a year. Do you suppose 
     <lb/>
     that when we are charged with our foreign 
     <lb/>
     relations; as was intimated by Mr. Adderly, 
     <lb/>
     when we have our own army to maintain; for 
     <lb/>
     the troops are evidently to be withdrawn un<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
           

     less we are prepared to pay them, when 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of the Governor General by 
     <lb/>
     the Crown is the only connecting link, can it be 
     <lb/>
     supposed that it will be long before we have our 
     <lb/>
     President? You cannot engraft this mongrel 
     <lb/>
     system upon monarchical institutions,—when 
     <lb/>
     you change you must become a Republic, and 
     <lb/>
     the game played by the American Gov.<lb break="no"/>ernment in Mexico will be played over 
     <lb/>
     again here. I look upon this scheme as 
     <lb/>
     the first step towards a separation from 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country, and I prophecy that ten 
     <lb/>
     years will not pass before this new nationality 
     <lb/>
     will drift into the United States. Look how 
     <lb/>
     easily the thing can be done—just as easily as the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme was accomplished.— 
     <lb/>
     Several gentlemen were appointed, at the in<lb break="no"/>stance of this house, to attend a conference 
     <lb/>
     in Prince Edward Island to mature a scheme 
     <lb/>
     for the union of the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The Canadians came down and spirited them 
     <lb/>
     to Quebec where, for reasons best known to 
     <lb/>
     themselves, they all agreed to go in for the 
     <lb/>
     larger union. They afterwards by some 
     <lb/>
     means succeeded in securing the assent of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick and of this house, though 
     <lb/>
     not of the people, and they are now about to 
     <lb/>
     consummate it. Can it be supposed that the 
     <lb/>
     Americans will not imitate an example which 
     <lb/>
     has been so successful, and that by the 
     <lb/>
     exercise of that acute diplomacy for which 
     <lb/>
     they are famous, and by the expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     money, when it is required, sweep the whole 
     <lb/>
     concern into the American Union? The Cana<lb break="no"/>dians are just the men, and the Confederate 
     <lb/>
     Government will be just the place to try such 
     <lb/>
     an experiment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have ever felt that the moment we cea<lb break="no"/>sed to be separate provinces, and came un<lb break="no"/>der the dominion of Canada, her fate must 
     <lb/>
     be our fate, and we must be dragged wher<lb break="no"/>ever she might be pleased to carry us. Many 
     <lb/>
     leading men in England entertain that opi<lb break="no"/>nion strongly, and tell us that it would be 
     <lb/>
     our advantage to join the American Union 
     <lb/>
     There is another reason given why we should 
     <lb/>
     confederate and be got rid of, and it has 
     <lb/>
     force from an English point of view. It is 
     <lb/>
     said in England, " as long as we maintain 
     <lb/>
     these colonies, particularly Canada, with its 
     <lb/>
     long and defenseless frontier, so long must 
     <lb/>
     we have a running sore ; but if we were rid 
     <lb/>
     of them, we would talk to the Americans in 
     <lb/>
     a different style; we would not submit to 
     <lb/>
     insult and indignity which we are now 
     <lb/>
     obliged to do from day to day." But we 
     <lb/>
     are told that the friends of British connec<lb break="no"/>tion are the friends of union. What, for ex<lb break="no"/>ample, says the Times? In a recent num<lb break="no"/>ber that great organ of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     wished Confederation God-speed, and trust<lb break="no"/>ed it would soon eventuate in the independ<lb break="no"/>ence of these colonies. But those support<lb break="no"/>ing our opinions took a larger and more 
     <lb/>

     statesmanlike view ; they held that when 
     <lb/>
     England loses the Maritime Provinces she 
     <lb/>
     begins to go down in the scale of nations— 
     <lb/>
     that when we are gone, with our 60,000 sea<lb break="no"/>men, our mercantile marine, our noble har<lb break="no"/>bours and fisheries, and our inexhaustible 
     <lb/>
     coalfields, then America becomes the first 
     <lb/>
     naval power in the world, and England 
     <lb/>
     must stand second on the list. I share in 
     <lb/>
     these opinions ; and it is because I see in 
     <lb/>
     Confederation the beginning of England's 
     <lb/>
     decline and fall, that I have been heartily 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the measure. It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that the people's delegates in England ma<lb break="no"/>nifested great contempt for responsible go<lb break="no"/>vernment. Sir, I hold that those who have 
     <lb/>
     had entrusted to them the petitions of well 
     <lb/>
     nigh 40,000 of the people—equal to about 
     <lb/>
     two-thirds of our adult male population— 
     <lb/>
     that they are not unauthorized men, and 
     <lb/>
     that the occupy a prouder position than 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen sent by the Government, but 
     <lb/>
     not representing the opinions of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. There are members sitting here who 
     <lb/>
     know that they, are here contrary to the 
     <lb/>
     wishes of their constituents—who have 
     <lb/>
     been requested to resign their seats, and 
     <lb/>
     who, if they had the spirit of English<lb break="no"/>men, would not for a day occupy their 
     <lb/>
     present positions. We were so far authoriz<lb break="no"/>ed as to be recognized as duly accredited de<lb break="no"/>legates at the Colonial Office, where we were 
     <lb/>
     treated with deference and respect. Mr. Bright 
     <lb/>
     on this subject holds the. language of every 
     <lb/>
     Englishman I ever met, he says, "give the 
     <lb/>
     people of these Colonies the right to speak, 
     <lb/>
     let them decide their own future, let them, 
     <lb/>
     if they please, confederate, join the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican States, or remain as they are in "con<lb break="no"/>nection with this country." Then we are 
     <lb/>
     told that the, intelligence of the country 
     <lb/>
     was in favour of Union. I should like the 
     <lb/>
     Prov. Secy. to tell us how he arrives at that 
     <lb/>
     conclusion. When'at the last General Elec<lb break="no"/>tion his party were returned with a large ma<lb break="no"/>jority he boasted that there was a large and 
     <lb/>
     enlightened public opinion in the country, 
     <lb/>
     but when he looks around the benches of 
     <lb/>
     this house and knows that not one of 
     <lb/>
     its members dare face a constituency, 
     <lb/>
     I ask him, how he can make the 
     <lb/>
     statement that the intelligence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try is in favor of this measure ? I have been 
     <lb/>
     taunted with saying that Nova Scotians 
     <lb/>
     should pay pound for pound with the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians towards the common defence. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the time has come when our peo<lb break="no"/>ple cannot escape paying a reasonable con<lb break="no"/>tribution, and the question has come-to this : 
     <lb/>
     shall we pay to the mother country, which 
     <lb/>
     with all her armaments of war is able to de<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
        
fend us, or to a new nationality without an 
     <lb/>
     army or a navy,or the means to create either? 
     <lb/>
     Or on the other hand shall we pay to the 
     <lb/>
     United States?- We must pay such reason<lb break="no"/>able sum for our defence as we can afford, 
     <lb/>
     and I ask if there is any doubt that Eng<lb break="no"/>land would grant us by far the most favoura<lb break="no"/>ble terms. I assert boldly that these Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces must belong to a great maritime 
     <lb/>
     power— the first in the world, if they are 
     <lb/>
     allowed—and if not to the second, they can<lb break="no"/>not and will not be governed by Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Our position forbids that we should be gov<lb break="no"/>erned by a people living .in the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     backwoods. We must, therefore, belong 
     <lb/>
     either to the mother country or to the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States, and if we are once separated 
     <lb/>
     from England there is no question about 
     <lb/>
     our final destination. And while on this 
     <lb/>
     point I may remark that in Great Britain I 
     <lb/>
     encountered highly intelligent gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     to whom I spoke of the strong feel<lb break="no"/>ing of loyalty and attachment which pre<lb break="no"/>vails among us, and the earnest desire 
     <lb/>
     of the people to remain forever connected 
     <lb/>
     with England, to equally share her dan<lb break="no"/>gers and glories,—I said we would like to 
     <lb/>
     be treated as a county of England, as Kent 
     <lb/>
     or Surrey, sending members to the British 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, and whatwas the reply: " Well 
     <lb/>
     your sentiments do you honour, but we can<lb break="no"/>not reciprocate them ; we care little or no<lb break="no"/>thing a out you." We have been asked 
     <lb/>
     for a precedent for the course that we urge, 
     <lb/>
     and I in return have asked gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site to show us a precedent for their action. 
     <lb/>
     It is an unfortunate precedent that I can 
     <lb/>
    point to for their conduct—that of legis<lb break="no"/>lating Ireland into the Union contrary 
     <lb/>to the sentiments of the people. But 
     <lb/>even for that measure a majority of the Irish 
     <lb/>Parliament was obtained,—by what means 
     <lb/>we know; By what means the majority was 
     <lb/>obtained in this Legislature we do not know 
     <lb/>now, but there the majority was secured by 
     <lb/>corruption most foul, and history is filled 
     <lb/>with the record of the misfortunes that have 
     <lb/>grown out of that forced union. Is it not 
     <lb/>plain that if this union be forced on us you 
     <lb/>will make Nova Scotia a second Ireland on 
     <lb/>this side of the Atlantic, but so near the 
     <lb/>United States that only a few miles of wa<lb break="no"/>ter separate us? By adhering to a policy of 
     <lb/>coercion you are breaking the loyal hearts 
     <lb/>of the people of this country. It is not yet 
     <lb/>too late to refer the scheme to our constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, and if we can get their consent I 
     <lb/>pledge myself to never again lift up my 
     <lb/>voice in opposition to it, but will use every 
     <lb/>effort to make the measure work well.  If, 
     <lb/>however, the people are forced into the 
     <lb/>

     union, I do not hesitate to say that I will 
     <lb/>
     dedicate the remaining years of my life, be 
     <lb/>
     they many or few, to endeavor to repeal a 
     <lb/>
     union so hateful and obnoxious. I am an 
     <lb/>
     Englishman in spirit, if not by birth ; I love 
     <lb/>
     the institutions of England, but if I am de<lb break="no"/>prived of them and of my liberties as a Bri<lb break="no"/>tish subject,—then all I can say is, that by 
     <lb/>
     every constitutional means, I will endeavor 
     <lb/>
     to overthrow and destroy a union brought 
     <lb/>
     about by corrupt and arbitrary means.

     Speech of Hon. Financial Secretary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO4">Hon. JAMES MACDONALD</persName> said:— It was not, 
     <lb/>
     my intention to address the House this evening 
     <lb/>
     but as no gentleman appears ready to speak 
     <lb/>
     just now I shall endeavor to compress the few 
     <lb/>
     observations I have to make in as brief a com<lb break="no"/>pass as possible. I did certainly expect, and the 
     <lb/>
    House had a right to expect, that when gentle<lb break="no"/>men claiming to possess the sympathy of a large 
     <lb/>number of the people challenged the action of an 
     <lb/>overwhelming majority of the representatives of 
     <lb/>the people assembled in their deliberative capaci<lb break="no"/>ty, on a great and important constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tion they would have been prepared to adduce 
     <lb/>some precedent and cite some authority in sup<lb break="no"/>port of the course they have thought proper to 
     <lb/>pursue. Especially had we a right to expect this 
     <lb/>from a gentleman who is a leading member of 
     <lb/>the legal profession, who has sat in the highest 
     <lb/>position in this House, and who appears to oc<lb break="no"/>cupy the position of leader of the Opposition on 
     <lb/>this great question. The hon. member for Guys<lb break="no"/>boro', the mover of this resolution, has challeng<lb break="no"/>ed the constitutionality of the action of this 
     <lb/>House in dealing with this question. That branch 
     <lb/>of the subject has been so fully and ably dealt with 
     <lb/>by the hon. Prov. Secretary, that it is unnecessa<lb break="no"/>ry for me to refer to it at an length, but I must 
     <lb/>recall to the recollection of hon. gentlemen that, 
     <lb/>during the debate of last year on the Union ques<lb break="no"/>tion, I took the liberty of laying before the House 
     <lb/>and country certain authorities which, I claimed, 
     <lb/>proved conclusively the right of the Legislature 
     <lb/>to deliberate and finally decide upon this or 
     <lb/>any other measure which in their judg<lb break="no"/>ment affected the right or interests of the 
     <lb/>people. On that occasion I challenged the hon. 
     <lb/>member and those holding similar views, to bring 
     <lb/>forward a single authority from the whole con<lb break="no"/>stitutional history of England or of any other 
     <lb/>country enjoying British constitutions in favour 
     <lb/>of the proceeding which they wish to pursue. 
     <lb/>Now these gentlemen have had a whole year to 
     <lb/>search for these authorities—a whole year during 
     <lb/>Which this question has been engaging the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the ablest minds of the Empire—but 
     <lb/>they have not been able this session any more 
     <lb/>than they were at the last, to do more than deal 
     <lb/>in the vaguest generalities and to substitute for 
     <lb/>argument and authority empty assertions and 
     <lb/>worthless declamation. It was not respectful on 
     <lb/>the part of the hon. member for Guysboro', to 
     <lb/>the members of this Legislature, it did not com<lb break="no"/>port with his own character and self-respect that 
     <lb/>he should fail to bring forward a single authority 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     in support of his position, and that he should 
     <lb/>
     have felt himself justified in being content to 
     <lb/>
     give us only the opinion of a gentleman whom I 
     <lb/>
     am not disposed to deal harshly with—but still 
     <lb/>
     only the opinion of merely a colonial lawyer 
     <lb/>
     against the opinions of the other lawyers in this 
     <lb/>
     House sustained and supported as those Opinions 
     <lb/>
     are by the leading statesmen and lawyers of the 
     <lb/>
     whole Empire; that is to say, the opinion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Stewart Campbell against that of the ablest and 
     <lb/>
     best authorities in the Empire at large. That 
     <lb/>
     hon. member had the audacity, then, influenced 
     <lb/>
     by an arrogant opinion of his own standing in 
     <lb/>
     this country not only to oppose every authority 
     <lb/>
     which has been produced, but tells you, asks this 
     <lb/>
     House to believe that the leading minds of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire, the Peers and Commoners of England— 
     <lb/>
     men who control the destinies of the greatest 
     <lb/>
     Empire in the world—who have passed trium<lb break="no"/>phantly through the storms and passions of 
     <lb/>
     parties, and of popular excitement—men who at 
     <lb/>
     this moment when the country is violently agitat<lb break="no"/>ed by a widespread movement for Reform, re<lb break="no"/>fuse to be actuated by impulse of mere party 
     <lb/>
     aims—that men like these are not entitled to the 
     <lb/>
     respect and confidence of the House and coun<lb break="no"/>try on a question like this. Without condescend<lb break="no"/>ing to produce one single sentence of law or au<lb break="no"/>thority, he asks the people of this province to 
     <lb/>
     take his unsupported word against the united 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the est minds of British America, 
     <lb/>
     and of the parent state besides.    
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I did expect that after the able and argumen<lb break="no"/>tative address of the Provincial Secretary we 
     <lb/>
     would have seen an effort made by gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite to combat the position he has taken, but 
     <lb/>
     it is quite evident from the remarks of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member who last addressed you that there is no 
     <lb/>
     wish on the part of members opposite to con<lb break="no"/>vince the members of this House. Their game 
     <lb/>
     is to excite, if it be possible, a feeling of dread 
     <lb/>
     and dislike to this measure outside these walls. 
     <lb/>
     The amendment of the hon. and learned mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Guysboro' raised only the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     feature of this question, but I am relieved from 
     <lb/>
     the duty which I felt incumbent upon me to pro<lb break="no"/>duce authority after authority, record after re<lb break="no"/>cord, from English constitutional history down 
     <lb/>
     to the present time; for the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Halifax says boldly, " I admit the autho<lb break="no"/>rity of Parliament; it has the right and the 
     <lb/>
     power to deal with this question; I do not deny 
     <lb/>
     that the position we took last winter and that 
     <lb/>
     taken by this amendment is entirely unconstitu<lb break="no"/>tional ; but all I ask you is, whether the exer<lb break="no"/>cise of that power at the present time is judicious 
     <lb/>
     or not." Who is right? Which is the best au<lb break="no"/>thority? I leave the hon. member for Guysboro' 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. member for Halifax to answer the 
     <lb/>
     question, and reconcile the respective positions 
     <lb/>
     they have taken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have to decide whether it "is at the present 
     <lb/>
     moment judicious—whether under circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which are transpiring in British America—whe<lb break="no"/>ther in view of the position of these colonies to<lb break="no"/>wards the mother country and the great power 
     <lb/>
     on our border—we should accept the terms of 
     <lb/>

     Union offered, or decline more intimate relations 
     <lb/>
     with our colonial brethren ? The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Halifax has answered himself. In a Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Englishmen—of gentlemen who all pro<lb break="no"/>fess to be devoted subjects of their royal Queen, 
     <lb/>
     who entertain respect for those institutions which 
     <lb/>
     have placed England so largely in advance of 
     <lb/>
     other countries, the declarations of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber ought to suffice, ought to be more than 
     <lb/>
     enough too for the opinions of the most undecided 
     <lb/>
     and irresolute. He has said, and said truly, that 
     <lb/>
     we must belong to the United States or to Eng<lb break="no"/>land. If he means anything, he intends that for 
     <lb/>
     a declaration of separation from England. He 
     <lb/>
     has undertaken to tell you that so regardless are 
     <lb/>
     English statesmen of the colonies that they do 
     <lb/>
     not know what they are. He has told you that 
     <lb/>
     the leading minds and governing classes of the 
     <lb/>
     old country desire the separation of the colonies. 
     <lb/>
     He has gone further and boldly declared that ra<lb break="no"/>ther than assist our brethren in Canada to build 
     <lb/>
     up a strong power on this side, which will estab<lb break="no"/>lish British institutions firmly on this continent, 
     <lb/>
     he is ready at a moment to rush into the arms of 
     <lb/>
     the neighbouring Republic. That is not the first 
     <lb/>
     occasion in which the hon. member for East Ha<lb break="no"/>lifax has taken a similar position. The policy of 
     <lb/>
     that hon. member and of the majority of the men 
     <lb/>
     associated with him, down to the present time, 
     <lb/>
     has been nothing more than annexation to the 
     <lb/>
     United States. I regret I have not under my 
     <lb/>
     hand just now the manifesto of the anti-Union 
     <lb/>
     delegates to the statesmen of England—the case, 
     <lb/>
     as they call it, of the Maritime Provinces—but 
     <lb/>
     I would ask the people of this country, all who 
     <lb/>
     have seen that document, whether it does not 
     <lb/>
     contain sentiments most obnoxious to those 
     <lb/>
     who desire to live under British laws and in<lb break="no"/>stitutions, and direct encouragement to those in 
     <lb/>
     the United States, who are engaged in promot<lb break="no"/>ing the annexation of these colonies. I have 
     <lb/>
     said that this hon. member is desirous of an<lb break="no"/>nexing this country to the United States, and 
     <lb/>
     this is an assertion which nothing but the 
     <lb/>
     strongest proof could justify. Let me then re<lb break="no"/>call to the recollection of the House some of 
     <lb/>
     the productions of that hon. member's pen—the 
     <lb/>
     position which he has assumed from the very 
     <lb/>
     commencement of the discussion on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. What do we find in the paper conducted 
     <lb/>
     by that hon. member? From the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     this discussion—from the "Botheration" arti<lb break="no"/>cles down to the present hour—the strongest 
     <lb/>
     declarations of the un-British and disloyal sen<lb break="no"/>timents of the hon. member are to be found. In 
     <lb/>
     the paper which the hon. member claims as pre<lb break="no"/>senting the case of the people of this country— 
     <lb/>
     in this paper, purporting to be a vindication of 
     <lb/>
     a British colony, the hon. member undertakes 
     <lb/>
     to compare the scheme of Union with the sis<lb break="no"/>ter colonies, and the scheme of annexation to 
     <lb/>
     the United States devised by Mr. Banks. Take 
     <lb/>
     that document and compare the description of 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation scheme—a description which 
     <lb/>
     could only emanate from a man imbued with 
     <lb/>
     hostility to the country which he pretends to 
     <lb/>
     love—with the description of a plan of Union 
     <lb/>
     which he proposes with the United States. Mr. 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     Banks' scheme is portrayed in the most flatter<lb break="no"/>ing colours; our colonial institutions are vilifi<lb break="no"/>ed, while those of the United States are bespat<lb break="no"/>tered with fulsome praise. But to what does he 
     <lb/>
     invite us ? To pay a portion of the enormous 
     <lb/>
     taxation which now weighs down the United 
     <lb/>
     States—to participate in the political struggles 
     <lb/>
     and convulsions of that country ; we are to see 
     <lb/>
     our mercantile marine, which is now progressing 
     <lb/>
     with a rapidity that no other country can equal, 
     <lb/>
     transferred to the United States. And what 
     <lb/>
     will be the result when that measure is so trans<lb break="no"/>ferred ? At the present time , according to the 
     <lb/>
     belief of the most eminent men of that country, 
     <lb/>
     the mercantile marine of the United Sates is at 
     <lb/>
     the lowest ebb, and it would not be at all sur<lb break="no"/>prising if a wiser commercial policy does not 
     <lb/>
     soon prevail in that country, to see almost all 
     <lb/>
     their trade eventually carried in foreign bottoms. 
     <lb/>
     Yet the hon. member and his friends would have 
     <lb/>
     us enter a union which, in the course of a very 
     <lb/>
     few years, has brought the formerly great com<lb break="no"/>mercial navy of the Republic to so deplorable a 
     <lb/>
     condition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me here call the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>
     another interesting fact in connection with this 
     <lb/>
     question. The hon. gentleman complains of the 
     <lb/>
     indifference of English statesmen to colonial mat<lb break="no"/>ters. When the bill of Union was introduced to 
     <lb/>
     a very full House by the Earl of Carnarvon, in 
     <lb/>
     a manner that has attracted the praise of journals 
     <lb/>
     of all parties, a noble Lord arose to speak in 
     <lb/>
     support of the anti-Union party. And what was 
     <lb/>
     the reception he met with? Whilst the suppor<lb break="no"/>ters of the Government sat in their places, every 
     <lb/>
     one of the friends of the noble Lord arose and 
     <lb/>
    left the House—so thoroughly did they disap<lb break="no"/>prove of the course pursued by him. Is it at all 
     <lb/>surprising that the Peers of England should have 
     <lb/>been disgusted when they read the sentiments ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by these Nova Scotians professing to be 
     <lb/>the delegates of the people in favour of annex<lb break="no"/>ation to the United States, and that they should 
     <lb/>have declined to compromise themselves by seem<lb break="no"/>ing to encourage their views. When they saw 
     <lb/>the disloyalty that appeared in every line of that 
     <lb/>document, I do not wonder that so many of the 
     <lb/>Peers should have manifested their contempt for 
     <lb/>those who wished to place them in a wrong posi<lb break="no"/>tion, by rising and leaving the House on the in<lb break="no"/>stant. The hon. member tells you that the Par<lb break="no"/>liament of England exhibits the most utter indif<lb break="no"/>ference to the interests of the colonies. Yet the 
     <lb/>same Parliament has always shown the deepest 
     <lb/>interest in the welfare and progress of the colon<lb break="no"/>ies, and we have only to look at the speeches of 
     <lb/>the leading men in the Peers and Commons to 
     <lb/>see how deeply desirous they are of promoting 
     <lb/>the welfare and progress of every section of their 
     <lb/>great Colonial Empire.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The hon. member says that the govern<lb break="no"/>ing classes of England desire the separation 
     <lb/>of the colonies from the mother country. I  
     <lb/>will take the liberty of joining issue direct<lb break="no"/>ly with him on that point. I believe that 
     <lb/>the governing classes of Great Britain have 
     <lb/>a higher appreciation of what constitutes 
     <lb/>

     the wealth and greatness of the Empire, 
     <lb/>
     and I think the people of this country will 
     <lb/>
     require higher authority than that of a dis<lb break="no"/>appointed partizan for the assertion that the 
     <lb/>
     men who have spent the blood and treasure 
     <lb/>
     of the Empire, for their colonial posses<lb break="no"/>sions, feel any disregard for their interests 
     <lb/>
     and the continuance of the connection, 
     <lb/>
     But we have higher authority on this point. 
     <lb/>
     The debates in the Houses of Lords and 
     <lb/>
     Commons are supposed to convey, in the 
     <lb/>
     most conclusive manner, the intelligent 
     <lb/>
     public opinion of the country—to dissemi<lb break="no"/>nate through the world the clearest views 
     <lb/>
     and ideas of the public sentiment; and eve<lb break="no"/>ry noble lord who rose to speak on this bill 
     <lb/>
     vindicated not only the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature of Nova Scotia, but the 
     <lb/>
     conditions upon which this Union is to be 
     <lb/>
    effected, but even went further and 
     <lb/>gave it as his deliberate opinion 
     <lb/>that the retention of the colonies was 
     <lb/>essential to the best interests of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Empire. Even a nobleman whom the 
     <lb/>hon. member thought he might fairly count 
     <lb/>upon—a nobleman from whom he perhaps 
     <lb/>fairly thought he might expect encourage<lb break="no"/>ment—told him frankly he could not sus<lb break="no"/>tain him because he believed the measure 
     <lb/>of Union was essential to the best interests 
     <lb/>of the country, and the Marquis of Norman<lb break="no"/>by even went further and declared to these 
     <lb/>people's delegates that his residence in this 
     <lb/>country enabled him to form a pretty ac<lb break="no"/>curate estimate of the value of such peti<lb break="no"/>tions as those which the delegates pretend<lb break="no"/>ed gave them authority to present them<lb break="no"/>selves in England on behalf of the people 
     <lb/>of Nova Scotia.

     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName>—I hope the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has authority for what he is saying.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>—The hon member will 
     <lb/>
     not  deny that the Marquis of Normanby 
     <lb/>
     was the friend of the government of which 
     <lb/>
     he was the Financial Secretary. It will be 
     <lb/>
     remembered that when the hon member 
     <lb/>
     was a member of Lord Mulgrave's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, some 26,000 petitioners approached 
     <lb/>
     that noble lord as the governor of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and the hon member took the liberty, 
     <lb/>
     as the constitutional adviser of his Excellen<lb break="no"/>cy, of putting on record the statement that 
     <lb/>
     these petitions were not worthy of, or enti<lb break="no"/>tled to be shown, credit. Lord Mulgrave 
     <lb/>
     took the advice of his government at that 
     <lb/>
     time, and now naturally feels disinclined to 
     <lb/>
     recede from the position he was advised to 
     <lb/>
     take. "Gentlemen," he says now, " I hold 
     <lb/>
     the same opinion of these petitions that you 
     <lb/>
     did when I was Governor. You appear to 
     <lb/>
     have changed your opinions: I have not." 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
        

     The Parliament of England was in session 
     <lb/>
     for five or six weeks before the delegates 
     <lb/>
     returned, and yet these anti-Union petitions 
     <lb/>
     had never been presented. The hon mem<lb break="no"/>ber must have been afraid to present them, 
     <lb/>
     or the House of Commons would not receive 
     <lb/>
     them. Let him tell us how this is. If the 
     <lb/>
     people of Nova Scotia entrusted him as 
     <lb/>
     their delegate with the petitions against 
     <lb/>
     Union, and he has failed to present 
     <lb/>
     them, then he forfeited the greatest trust 
     <lb/>
     that was ever reposed in any man.— 
     <lb/>
     If he has done this great wrong to the people who 
     <lb/>
     entrusted him with so sacred a duty, he should 
     <lb/>
     hide in humiliation and shame from an outraged 
     <lb/>
     people. But let me call the attention of the people 
     <lb/>
     to a most extraordinary and curious fact. What 
     <lb/>
     has become of the petitions which we have been 
     <lb/>
     told were entrusted to Messrs. Howe and An<lb break="no"/>nand? Who has seen them? Nobody in this 
     <lb/>
     country certainly and as far as we yet know no 
     <lb/>
     one in England has had that pleasure.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But I can acquit the hon. member of blame 
     <lb/>
     on one ground—he was <hi rendition="simple:italic">not</hi> the delegate of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Nova Scotia. The people repudiate 
     <lb/>
     the connection which the hon. member wishes to 
     <lb/>
     fasten upon them. The people are not only 
     <lb/>
     loyal to the Queen, but they are intelligent 
     <lb/>
     enough to appreciate the arguments by which. 
     <lb/>
     they are asked to change their condition. I 
     <lb/>
     must protest in their name against the belief  
     <lb/>
     that they are ready to tear down the Union Jack 
     <lb/>
     and associate themselves with the Republic on 
     <lb/>
     their borders. (Applause.) But what is the duty 
     <lb/>
     of the people in the present crisis? What will 
     <lb/>
     the loyal Scotchmen, Irishmen, and Englishmen 
     <lb/>
     of his country do? Are they ready to take the 
     <lb/>
     extreme step urged by the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Halifax to become rebels and traitors because 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Annand is a disappointed partizan?  I ask 
     <lb/>
     the intelligent people of this country to do this 
     <lb/>
     —to act as honorable, sensible men should do on 
     <lb/>
     every question—to consider it calmly and on its 
     <lb/>
     merits. I do not ask them to take the views of 
     <lb/>
     the politicians of Canada, of New Brunswick,  
     <lb/>
     or of Nova Scotia; but I ask them, and it is fair 
     <lb/>
     to ask them, to take the views of the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     and people of England, the body of men who, 
     <lb/>
     for centuries, have ruled the destinies of the 
     <lb/>
     world—who have worked out the free institu<lb break="no"/>tions of England in a manner that attracts the 
     <lb/>
     admiration of other nations. I ask the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country if with the unanimous  opinions 
     <lb/>
     of such a body in favour of this Union, .they are 
     <lb/>
     ready to attach any value to the sentiments of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentlemen opposite. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that the intelligent people of this country are 
     <lb/>
     the men to reject the public opinion of England 
     <lb/>
     at the dictation of gentlemen who have them<lb break="no"/>selves entertained views directly adverse to those 
     <lb/>
     they entertain now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Let me advert for one moment to another po<lb break="no"/>sition taken by the hon. member. The House 
     <lb/>knows that early in the commencement of this 
     <lb/>question a gentleman standing high in the esti<lb break="no"/>mation of the hon. member—who has occupied a 
     <lb/>

     prominent position in this country—offered a 
     <lb/>
     counter scheme of Union in lieu of that submit<lb break="no"/>ted to this Legislature. That scheme has been 
     <lb/>
     rejected as far as my observation goes by the 
     <lb/>
     whole Anti-Union press up to the present hour. 
     <lb/>
     I have heard of no opponent of Union who has 
     <lb/>
     had the hardihood to advocate the scheme for the 
     <lb/>
     organization of the Empire until the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber did so to-night. He has had the boldness to 
     <lb/>
     declare that this scheme is the one which he and 
     <lb/>
     his party favor. He says he does not deny that 
     <lb/>
     some political change in our condition is neces<lb break="no"/>sary, and has expressed his readiness to adopt the 
     <lb/>
     scheme propounded by Mr. Howe for the or<lb break="no"/>ganization of the Empire. By that scheme we 
     <lb/>
     are to pay for the wars of the whole Empire. 
     <lb/>
     He says he will make us pay pound for pound 
     <lb/>
     with the other portions of the Empire. 
     <lb/>
     That same idea was enunciated some years 
     <lb/>
     ago by Mr. Howe, but I never heard of any 
     <lb/>
     who was prepared. to consider it seriously 
     <lb/>
     until the hon. member to-night declared 
     <lb/>
     that he would make Nova Scotia as Kent 
     <lb/>
     or Surrey or any other county of England. 
     <lb/>
     The objection to the Quebec scheme was 
     <lb/>
     that our representation in the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature was too insignificant, and that 
     <lb/>
     we would have to pay for the defence of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, that our burthens would be much 
     <lb/>
     heavier than they are now. Yet under the 
     <lb/>
     plan prepounded by Mr. Howe our people 
     <lb/>
     may be summoned at any moment to Cana<lb break="no"/>da, or any portion of the world, wherever 
     <lb/>
     her broad empire extends, to fight the bat<lb break="no"/>tles of England ; we shall be taxed pound for 
     <lb/>
     pound with our fellow-subjects of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Islands—whilst we shall only have a 
     <lb/>
     representation of three or four men in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons. Are the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country prepared to accept such a 
     <lb/>
     scheme in preference to the one now offer<lb break="no"/>ed for their acceptance? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In concluding these few imperfect re<lb break="no"/>marks, I may say that perhaps I shall be 
     <lb/>
     able to address the House on another occa<lb break="no"/>sion when better prepared to deal with it; 
     <lb/>
     but I could not permit the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member to ass without immediate 
     <lb/>
     notice. I shall on y repeat what I said pre<lb break="no"/>viously that before the hon. member can lay 
     <lb/>
     claim to the favorable consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     loyal people of this province, he should ex<lb break="no"/>plain away the sentiments which say so 
     <lb/>
     little for his allegiance and loyalty to the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANNA1">Mr. ANNAND</persName>:—I desire to make an ex<lb break="no"/>planation in reply to the hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     I have never advocated annexation to the

     United States, I advocate nothing but that 
     <lb/>
     we all remain as we are, and maintain our 
     <lb/>
     present institutions. As to the taunt about 
     <lb/>
     my adhesion to the scheme for the organiza<lb break="no"/>tion of the Empire, I reply that I advocate

     we should become as a county of England

     I will leave it to his ingenuity to say.

     TUESDAY, March 19. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>The House met at 2 30 PM. 
     <lb/>The adjourned debate was resumed.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Speech of Mr. McLelan. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MCLELAN said :—We are told that this 
     <lb/>
     debate must be brought to a close this evening, 
     <lb/>
     and for those who have opinions to express 
     <lb/>
     the time is short. The Provincial Secretary 
     <lb/>
     says this haste is imperative, in order that the 
     <lb/>
     public business of the country may not be in<lb break="no"/>terfered with. The exigencies of the country 
     <lb/>
     may now require this, but I ask who produced 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances requiring such hasty delibe<lb break="no"/>rations and forcing us to decide so important a 
     <lb/>
     question in so short a period? We in the coun<lb break="no"/>try were prepared months ago to come here 
     <lb/>
     and discuss this subject and to attend to the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary business of the Legislature, but to 
     <lb/>
     suit the convenience of certain hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, the meeting of the House has been post<lb break="no"/>poned to such a late period as to require that 
     <lb/>
     the most momentous question ever submitted 
     <lb/>
     to Parliament should be passed over almost in 
     <lb/>
     silence. For that reason we are told that we 
     <lb/>
     must limit our remarks to this single point :— 
     <lb/>
     the right of the people to be heard upon the 
     <lb/>
     question, and to decide on it for themselves. 
     <lb/>
     The Provincial Secretary told us yesterday 
     <lb/>
     that he felt proud of the position which he 
     <lb/>
     occupied on this question—that he felt proud 
     <lb/>
     of the improvements in the bill which is soon 
     <lb/>
     to come before us, as compared with the re<lb break="no"/>solutions passed at Quebec. I do not see in 
     <lb/>
     the position which he occupies anything to 
     <lb/>
     warrant such utterances. He told us last ses<lb break="no"/>sion, as he has told us on every occasion, that 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec scheme was just and sound in its 
     <lb/>
     principles—that it gave to this Province all it 
     <lb/>
     had a right to demand ; and the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's colleagues in the delegation reiterated 
     <lb/>
     the assertion, and they stated that they were 
     <lb/>
     prepared to push that scheme through, and to 
     <lb/>
     make it the basis of a Union of the Colonies. 
     <lb/>
     If the bill gives us more than that scheme, 
     <lb/>
     then whatever it gives in addition is due to us ' 
     <lb/>
     who opposed the measure from its inception 
     <lb/>
     If the bill gives us five dollars more, the credit 
     <lb/>
     is due to the stern opposition the Anti-Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     federates have given the question. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is in this position: he has told us 
     <lb/>
     that the Quebec scheme was just and sound, 
     <lb/>
     and he has now come back from England 
     <lb/>
     claiming to have got more than justice. If 
     <lb/>
     these statements be true, he must have done a 
     <lb/>
     dishonest thing to some other people, from 
     <lb/>
            </p>
