<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> "Whereas under existing circumstances an

            <p> "Therefore Resolved, That in the opinion
of this <lb/>
House the negotiations for the Union of Nova Scotia, <lb/>

            </head>


            <p> In moving the resolution it will be respectful  <lb/>
to this house and to the people of this province,
<lb/>
that I should explain the proceedings which <lb/>
were taken upon the resolution which was pas<lb break="no"/>sed at the last session of this
Legislature, and<lb/>
the various circumstances connected with
the<lb/>
even's that occurred in the consideration
of that <lb/>
resolution. This house passed a resolution
au<lb break="no"/>thorizing the appointment of five
delegates to<lb/>
confer with others to be appointed by the
pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of New Brunswick and P. E. Island,
for<lb/>
these three Maritime provinces. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the discharge of the duty devolving<lb/>
upon them by the resolution, appointed five<lb/>
delegates who attend a conference which <lb/>
was arranged at Charlottetown between the<lb/>
different provinces for the purpose of
deal<lb break="no"/>ing with that question. Previous, however,
<lb/>
to that conference being assembled the
Gover<lb break="no"/>nor General applied to the Lieutenant
Gover<lb break="no"/>nors of the three Maritime provinces for<lb/>
permission for a deputation of the members
of<lb/>
the Canadian government to attend the
proposed<lb/>
Conference for the purpose of explaining to<lb/>
them the views and opinions of the
government<lb/>
of Canada, and the attitude which that
Province<lb/>
held at that time in connection with the
ques<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>
          
tion of Colonial Union. I presume that
there <lb/>
is no member in this House who would be dis<lb break="no"/>posed to question the entire propriety of these <lb/>
gentlemen being received at that Conference of<lb/>
the Maritime Provinces. I presume that when <lb/>
called upon to engage in the consideration of a <lb/>
question so great as a change in
the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of our country, that no intelligent man <lb/>
can be found within or without
those walls who <lb/>
would not consider that a Conference of these <lb/>
Maritime Provinces would have been wanting <lb/>
in their duty to the country, if
they hesitated <lb/>
for a single moment on such an occasion to avail <lb/>
themselves of every source of information in <lb/>
their power touching the
question of Colonial <lb/>
Union in British America. When I had the<lb/>honor of moving the resolution which received <lb/>
the unanimous concurrence of this House at its <lb/>
last session, I d d not disguise for
a single mo<lb break="no"/>ment that whilst I looked upon a Union of the <lb/>
Maritime Provinces as desirable,
that the go<lb break="no"/>vernment introduced that scheme
to the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature in the absence of any grounds of hope <lb/>
that the larger and more important Union of <lb/>
British North America was at
that time prac<lb break="no"/>ticable or could be effected. I
did not conceal <lb/>
from the house for a single instant the opinions <lb/>
which I conscientiously entertained, that the in<lb break="no"/>terests of British America would be largely pro <lb/>
moted by a union of Canada with the Maritime  <lb/>
Provinces; but I drew the
attention of gentle<lb break="no"/>men on that occasion to the grounds I had for <lb/>
believing that at that time such a union was im<lb break="no"/>practicable. I drew the attention of the house <lb/>
to the difficulties
that existed as I believed, on<lb/>
the part of both Upper and Lower Canada in re<lb break="no"/>lation to a union with the Maritime Provinces <lb/>
in relation to a union with Canada, and propo ed<lb/>
the resolution already referred to. Whilst ad<lb break="no"/>vocating, as zealously as I was able, the advan<lb break="no"/>tages that would accrue from the larger union I<lb/>
proposed that of the Maritime Provin<lb break="no"/>ces as the only step that was available<lb/>
to us at that time and a step which, so far from<lb/>
conflicting in the slightest degree with a Union<lb/>
of all British North America, was actually one<lb/>
in that very direction. It will be also recollect<lb break="no"/>ed that gentlemen on both sides of this house,<lb/>
whilst giving their concurrence and support to<lb/>
the resolution, did not hesitate to express the <lb/>
preference which they had for a union of all<lb/>
British North America, and even went at length<lb/>
into arguments to show that the advantages<lb/>
which were likely to come from a union of the <lb/>
Maritime provinces were comparatively insigni<lb break="no"/>ficant with those which would result from the<lb/>
larger scheme. In these sentiments I entirely <lb/>
and heartily concurred, as will be in the recoll<lb break="no"/>ection of gentlemen who refer to the Speech<lb/>
which I made on that occasion.</p>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE QUEBEC CONFERENCE.</head>


            <p>When the conference which, as I have al<lb break="no"/>ready stated, met at Charlottetown, they recei<lb break="no"/>ved a deputation of members of the Canadian<lb/>
government for the purpose of giving them an<lb/>

        <fw type="num">204</fw>   <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.</fw>

and opinions of the government of Canada <lb/>
in relation to this subject.
Several meetâ€” <lb/>
ings took place at which those
gentlemen <lb/>
at length explained the position
of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and the attitude which she then held
on <lb/>
the question of Colonial Union. I
need scarcely <lb/>
remind the House that the only
two objections <lb/>
which existed on the part of the Maritime
Pro<lb break="no"/>vincesâ€”the only two points in which I intimated <lb/>
that any hostility might be found in the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinccs to the union with Canada, were
<lb/>
the large debt which Canada had and the financial <lb/>
condition of that countryâ€”that
whilst her debt <lb/>
was very much larger than this of the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces, and the government had been obliged
<lb/>
to meet the Parliament annually with a large
<lb/>
deficit, we were able to exhibit
a large surplus <lb/>
revenue. When we ascertained that a govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been formed in Canada with the <lb/>
avowed and ostensible object of effecting a union <lb/>
of the Maritime Provinces with that
countryâ€” <lb/>
that both of the great parties
which existed in <lb/>
that Province had united upon a common
platâ€” <lb/>
form with a view of uniting all
British Americaâ€” <lb/>
that the debt of Canada and that
of the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces could be arranged in such a manner
<lb/>
as to enable all to enter the Confederation upon <lb/>
terms of perfect equality, and that Canada
was <lb/>
prepared to offer the Maritime Provinces that
<lb/>
for every dollar of less debt that any one of <lb/>
them had relatively
to Canada according to <lb/>
population they were prepared to
pay to such <lb/>
province interest annually â€” when we found in <lb/>
addition to that that the financial condition of <lb/>
the country had so improved that instead
of <lb/>
closing the financial year with a
deficit she was <lb/>
able to show a surplus â€” when we saw <lb/>
that the prominent objectionsâ€” those
which had <lb/>
been raiseed here as the only objections that lay <lb/>
in the way of a Union of the Maritime
Provin<lb break="no"/>ces with Canadaâ€”had been removed â€”
we felt <lb/>
we might then fairly arrive at the conclusion <lb/>
that we would be consulting not
only the inter<lb break="no"/>ests but the wishes of the respective Legisla<lb break="no"/>tures and people we represented, if we entered <lb/>
upon the larger and more important question of <lb/>
a Union of all British North America That ac<lb break="no"/>tion has been so strongly challenged upon the <lb/>
part of the Press and of a number of public men <lb/>
in these various provinces, that
I think it right <lb/>
I should detain the house for a few moments <lb/>
whilst I offer to them some of
the reasons which <lb/>
the government of this province had for believ<lb break="no"/>ing that in adjouming the question of a Union <lb/>
of these Provinces, and in taking up the larger <lb/>
question of a confederation of
all British North <lb/>
America, they were acting in accordance
With <lb/>
the views of the Legislatures and with the sen<lb break="no"/>timents of the people of this country.<lb/>

<div type="section">
   
            <head rendition="simple:centre">PAST
ASPECT OF THE QUESTION OF UNION.
            </head>

            <p> I need not go back ten years to remind the <lb/>
House of the position which this question oc<lb break="no"/>cupied in 1854 When Mr. Johnston, the <lb/>
leader of the Conserative party in this province, <lb/>
moved a resolution proposing
a union of the <lb/>
Brittsh North America or a union of Canada, <lb/>
with the Maritime Prevmces ; that sentiment
<lb/>
instead of exciting hostility - of meeting with<lb/>
            

            <cb/>

antagonism, received the favorable
consideration <lb/>
of the House, and, as for as
could be judged, <lb/>
of the people of this province. At that time I <lb/>
need hardly remind the House
that Mr. Young,<lb/>
a prominent member of this Legislature, gave
<lb/>
in his adherence to the advantages that
would <lb/>
be derived from a union of these provinces, and <lb/>
further expressed a strong
opinion in favor of a <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">federal</hi> union of British AmericaÂ  On that
oc<lb break="no"/>casion Mr Howe, also one of the
most promin<lb break="no"/>ent members of the Legislature,
instead of op<lb break="no"/>osing union, placed upon record
his opinion <lb/>
during the discussion of the
question, that if he <lb/>
were unable to obtain what he considered <lb/>
better, namely representation in
the Imperial <lb/>
Parliament, he would be prepared
to support <lb/>
a federal union of all B N. A. But
I shall <lb/>
come down to a latter period when I had the  <lb/>
honour of delivering a lecture at the opening of <lb/>
the Mechanics Institute at St. John, New. <lb/>
Brunswick, in 1860, and I took that
opportunity,Â  <lb/>
as a public man, of drawing the attention of <lb/>
these provinces to the great
importance of a <lb/>
union of all British North America, and to the <lb/>
great advantages that would flow from a conso<lb break="no"/>lidation of these provinces with Canada.Â  That
<lb/>
lecture was repeated, in various
parts of this <lb/>
province, and I can only say that testing as I <lb/>
did the public opinion of this country, neither in <lb/>
the press nor by any expression of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic sent ment in any shape whatever, was <lb/>
I led to believe that, the views which I had <lb/>
propunded as a public man did not meet
<lb/>
with the entire approval and concurrence
<lb/>
of the peoole of these provinces. A year
<lb/>
afterwards, in 1861, hon Mr.
Howe, then <lb/>
leader of the government in this Province,
<lb/>
proposed formally in this Legislature a series of <lb/>
resolutions in which he declared that
many and <lb/>
great advantages would result from the union ofÂ  <lb/>
all the Provinces, and in which he asked the <lb/>
concurrence of this House to just such a con<lb break="no"/>ference as was recently held at Quebec for
the <lb/>
purpose of examining the question, and ascer<lb break="no"/>taining whether it would be practicable
to unite <lb/>
these Provinces under one government. The <lb/>
House is well aware that although this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion was propose at a time when party antagon<lb break="no"/>ism

<lb/>
when parties were closely balanced in this houseÂ  <lb/>
â€” when a fierce struggle was
going on in this <lb/>
Legislature for the government of the countryâ€”
<lb/>
yet in the presence of that proposal
all party <lb/>
hostility gave way, and it met not only
with <lb/>
warm support from the opposition
benches, butÂ  <lb/>
with the entire approval and concurrence
of this <lb/>
Legislature. Certainly there were no grounds <lb/>
for supposing that the public
sentiment of this <lb/>
country was not in the highest
degree favorable <lb/>
to a union With Canada But coming down to
<lb/>a later period, Mr. McGee
visited these Prov<lb break="no"/>inces, and I cannot mention that hon gentle<lb break="no"/>man's name without paying at

just tribute to the great claims
he has upon theÂ  <lb/>

gratitude
of the people of these provinces
grea<lb break="no"/>ter than another it is owing to the fact that <lb/>
through his public Provincial
career his great <lb/>
intellect, his great powers have been directed <lb/>
towards consolidating all.British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca. His great powers have been
brought <lb/>
into play earnestly and effectually
in removing <lb/>
class, party, and religious
antagonism - in fact, <lb/>
every antagonism that could divide
the people <lb/>
that inhabit British North
America and to di<lb break="no"/>rect their mind and attention to the great value <lb/>
of the institutions they possess, and to the best <lb/>
means of consolidating and perpetuating those <lb/>
institutions  That hon gentlemen, in response <lb/>
to a request made to him, delivered a lecture on <lb/>
the consolidation of British North
America, and <lb/>
instead of being met by any
demonstration on <lb/>
the part of the people or the press of this coun<lb break="no"/>try that would lead any public
man to suppose <lb/>
that a Union of British North America
was not in <lb/>
the highest degree acceptable, he delivered that <lb/>
brilliant oration amid the plaudits of a large, <lb/>
influential and intellectual
audience in this city, <lb/>
and at the conclusion a vote of thanks was mo<lb break="no"/>ved by hon. Mr. Johnston and seconded by <lb/>
Mr. Hoew. Chllenged as the
government have <lb/>
been with having failed in their duty to the <lb/>
people of this country when they permitted <lb/>
the discussion of the question of Union with <lb/>
Canada, it is but right that I should turn to <lb/>
the sentiments not only delivered by leading <lb/>
statesmen of two parties in this
country, but <lb/>
delivered in the presence of an influential body <lb/>
of citizens and received and
accepted by the <lb/>
intelligent press of the country, us deserving,  <lb/>
in the highest degree, of the
approval of the <lb/>

said:</p>

            <p> These sentiments were delivered at the lecture <lb/>

of one of the most <lb/>
intelligent audiences in the city, and quoted by <lb/>
the press from one end of the
province to the other, <lb/>
and met the hearty approval of
this country, <lb/>
I do not make these quotations for the purpose <lb/>
of bringing into question the
attitude of any <lb/>
public man in this country. I am now asking
<lb/>
this house to consider whether the course the
<lb/>
government pursued in appointing delegates to<lb/>
confer upon thequestion of a
Union of British <lb/>
North America was not one that they had a
<lb/>
right to suppose would receive the hearty con<lb break="no"/>currence of this house, and meet with the en<lb break="no"/>thusiastic approval of the
people of this country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known that after the resolutions
<lb/>
which passed the legislatures or the respective
<lb/>
Provinces had been placed upon the journals, <lb/>
the Government of Canada was
reorganized by <lb/>
the combination of both, parties upon the avow<lb break="no"/>ed platform of endeavoring to form a Union of <lb/>
all British North America. When this fact was <lb/>
made
known, what did it evoke?Â  A senti<lb break="no"/>ment
of hostility on the part, of these Provinces?
<lb/>
No! Did we who had been suing at the hands <lb/>
of Canada as late as 1861 by
the actÂ  of this <lb/>
Legislature, and asking, as Mr. Howe did ask, <lb/>
for a conference such as that recently held at <lb/>
Quebec - did the people of these provinces when<lb/>
they learned that the government of Canada had<lb/>
been reformed and recons ructed upon the basis<lb/>
of endeavoring to bring about a Union of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America, view that proposition with<lb/>
disfavour? In the Province of New Brunswick, <lb/>
in the chief city, the citizens came together- <lb/> the Board of Trade at the head of the move<lb break="no"/>ment - and one of the firs acts which followed<lb/>
that declaration to the world that the government<lb/>
of Canada was reconstructed upon such a basis<lb/>

 as I have stated, was. an invitation from
St. <lb/>
John to the government and the united Legisla <lb/>
tures of that country to come down and receive <lb/>
an ovation at their hands. Nor was the city of<lb/>
Halifax slow in following the example, for at a <lb/>
meeting convened by the Mayor upon a public <lb/>
requisition in this city, an invitation was extend<lb break="no"/>ed by the citizens of Halifax to the Legislature <lb/>
of Canada to come here and receive an ovation <lb/>
also at their handsâ€”indicating, asf ar as it was <lb/>
possible, that the events which had taken place <lb/>
in Canada entitled the Government and Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of that country to courtesies such as had <lb/>
never been extended to them before. Although <lb/>
the Legislature of Canada was not able for<lb break="no"/>mally to accept that invitation,
a number of <lb/>
gentlemen connected with various public posi<lb break="no"/>tions in the country came down to St John <lb/>
and Halitax. I need hardly tell this House <lb/>
how they were received. So far from
having <lb/>
been met with any spirit of hostility, they were <lb/>
received with open arms, and the hospitalities <lb/>
of these two citi s in the two provinces extend<lb break="no"/>ed to them in a manner that was worthy of <lb/>
both. As late as a year ago in August 1864, <lb/>
at the public entertainment which was given <lb/>
in this city, and before the Conference had met <lb/>
at Charlottetownâ€”when these gentlemen were <lb/>
received here,â€”a member of the Canadian go<lb break="no"/>vernment, standing at the table, advocated in <lb/>
the most eloquent terms a Union of all British <lb/>
North America. That advocacy
was received, <lb/>
as had always been the case in the city of <lb/>
Halifax, by every demonstration of enthusiasm <lb/>
and approval that it was in the power of an in<lb break="no"/>telligent people to give; but more than that, on <lb/>
that occasion, I took the opportunity of observ<lb break="no"/>ing that when I had moved a resolution <lb/>
tor a Union of the Maritime Provinces,
I did it <lb/>
with the conviction that an immediate <lb/>
consolidation of all British North America <lb/>
was impracticableâ€”and that I hailed with <lb/>
the utmost satisfaction the evidence that <lb/>
had been since given that the smaller <lb/>
Union which we contemplated was
likely to be <lb/>
merged into a far greater and more comprehenâ€” <lb/>
sive scheme. On that occasion, I need not state <lb/>
to gentlemen who are resident in this city. Mr. <lb/>
Howe again responded in the terms which <lb/>
he had always been accustomed to use on <lb/>
this question. He said, although the hour <lb/>
was late it was oi little consequence, for
his <lb/>
voice had been heard in every chief city not <lb/>
only Nova of Scotia, and New
Brunswick, but of <lb/>
Canada advocating the consolidation of all Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America; and there he committed <lb/>
himself, in the most unqualified manner in faâ€” <lb/>
vour of such a unionâ€”declaring that it was the <lb/>
dream of his life, and that he would look for<lb break="no"/>ward to its realization with the highest satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion  I do not refer to this as attaching any <lb/>
great importance to what may fall from Mr. <lb/>
However myself, but I call
attention to these <lb/>
facts to show that when public men on various <lb/>
occasions gave in their hearty
adhesion to a pro<lb break="no"/>posal to unite Canada with the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, so far from the sentiments they pro<lb break="no"/>pounded
sinking them in public estimation - so <lb/>
far from the press and people of
this country ex<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>

pressing their dissent from the course
that was <lb/>
pursuedâ€”that in the light of the fact that a
<lb/>
Conference was to be held at Charlottetown,
and <lb/>
that a deputation of the Canadian Governmen <lb/>
were to attend this Conference with
a view of <lb/>
endeavouring to accomplish the larger Union
of <lb/>
British North America, as far as the public
<lb/>
men of this or the other
Provinces are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, there was every reason to believe that <lb/>
what was proposed met with the entire approval <lb/>
and the concurrence of the people. As I have <lb/>
already stated the Canadian deputation received <lb/>
â€”and after much consultation and deliberation, <lb/>
the most prominent public men in all these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces came to the conclusion that there was a <lb/>
fair and legitimate prospect to believe that <lb/>
at another conference they would be able to de<lb break="no"/>vise such measures for a Union as would se<lb break="no"/>cure the confidence, co operation, and assent of <lb/>
all these Provinces. Under these
circumstan-Â  <lb/>
ces the Canadian delegates returned home, and <lb/>
the Governor General, acting upon their ad<lb break="no"/>vice and under the sanction of the Crown,
<lb/>
given in the most emphatic terms, invited the <lb/>
appointment of delegates frdm the maritime <lb/>
provinces for the purpose of taking
into consi<lb break="no"/>deration the question of the wider Union. That <lb/>
action has been challenged as an unconstitu<lb break="no"/>tional proceeding. I will not, in an assembly <lb/>
like this, attempt any vindication of the strict <lb/>
constitutionality of such a course. Suffice <lb/>
it to say, there stood upon the journals of the <lb/>
legislature not only the approval
of such a <lb/>
course as that, but the declaration of the Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Secretary that the British government <lb/>
would be ready to pay the utmost deference to <lb/>
any proposalâ€” that might
emanate from any <lb/>
scheme that might be agreed upon by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernments of the different provinces, and author<lb break="no"/>izing a conference to be held. The resolution <lb/>
which passed the house at its last session pro<lb break="no"/>vided that whatever agreement was come to <lb/>
should receive the sanction of the different
<lb/>
legislaturesÂ  No action, therefore,
was proposed <lb/>
to be taken by
the conference at Quebec which <lb/>
did not involve the same legitimate course to <lb/>
be taken. All that the legislature had demand<lb break="no"/>edâ€”all that the several legislatures and the
<lb/>
imperial government as well had demanded -
<lb/>
as- he necessary constitutional course prelimi<lb break="no"/>nary to change the constitution, was observed <lb/>
by the Quebec conference, and
that was pro<lb break="no"/>posal to arrangeâ€”the scheme of
union for these <lb/>
provinces which should first be
submitted to <lb/>
the imperial government, then to the different <lb/>
legislatures of these provinces, previous to an <lb/>
application being made to the imperial
authori<lb break="no"/>ties to give effect to the
scheme by an act passed <lb/>
bythe British parliament. I
need not tell the <lb/>
house that a body of public men
assembled at <lb/>
Quebecâ€”similar to no other body that ever met
<lb/>
together in this or any other countryâ€”who not <lb/>
only represented the
governments but both <lb/>
leading political parties. The result
of their <lb/>
labors was beyond that which the most sanâ€”
<lb/>
guine person had a right to
expectâ€”that in the <lb/>
position which we considered British America <lb/>
to occupy the different public
men representingÂ  <lb/>
the different parties and
sections into which all <lb/>

            <p> The result of that Conference, it will be
now <lb/>
my duty to refer to, for let that scheme occupy <lb/>
what position it may at this hour, no one can <lb/>
hesitate to admit that the interests involved in <lb/>
it are of the most vital consequence. It be<lb break="no"/>comes me as a member of the government <lb/>
of my country,â€”as a public man respon<lb break="no"/>sible to the House and the people for the <lb/>
views I entertain upon a question of this kindâ€” <lb/>
that I should have an opportunity
of explaining <lb/>
and vindicating as I can, the grounds which led <lb/>
me to concur as I did most heartily in the scheme <lb/>
proposed for the Union of British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca. I need not tell the House that a great deal <lb/>
of discussion has taken place in times past as to <lb/>
whether a legislative or federal union would be <lb/>
<lb/>
 the best mode by which these Provinces
could <lb/>
be united, and I believe that I will be able to <lb/>
show this House that whilst a Legislative Union <lb/>
was really not practically before usâ€”for there <lb/>
were difficulties lying in its path such as to ren<lb break="no"/>der its adoption impossibleâ€”yet the Union <lb/>
which was devised by the Quebec Conference, <lb/>
possessed all the advantages of both without <lb/>
the disadvantages that attended each separately. <lb/>
 No person, who to acquainted with the
character <lb/>
of Legislative Union, but knows, when it is <lb/>
proposed for a country with the area and extent <lb/>
of territory that British
America possesses, its<lb/>
realization is attended with
great dlfiiculties if <lb/>
not with insuperable obstacles. No person, who <lb/>
is acquainted with what has taken
place in the <lb/>
Imperial Parliament, but knows that great as <lb/>
that country has become under a Legislative <lb/>
Union, yet the difficulties connected with the <lb/>
Union are such as at this moment to be occupy<lb break="no"/>ing the attention of the foremost
statesmen of <lb/>
Great Britam. The difficulties in the way of <lb/>
a Legislative Union are that the Legislature <lb/>
has not only to be occupied with the discussi n <lb/>
of the great and leading questions which touch <lb/>
the vital interests of every section ol the coun. <lb/>
try, but to give its attention largely to matters <lb/>
of merely local concern. At present, the Par<lb break="no"/>liament is obliged to take up and consider from <lb/>
five to six hundred local bills.
When we consider <lb/>
that this body of 600 men, â€” the
most influâ€” <lb/>
ential and important assemblage of statesmen <lb/>
in the world, are called upon to give their at<lb break="no"/>tention upon some five hundred bil s, which <lb/>
are not of general but of purely local concern, <lb/>
you can imagine the difliculty of
carrying on <lb/>
the legislation of such a country. It is not
<lb/>
strange that under such
circumstances the Par<lb break="no"/>liament is obliged to sit eight out of twelve <lb/>
months in order to accomplish the
legislation re<lb break="no"/>quired at their hands. If a Legislative Union<lb/>
were devised for British North America the<lb/>
people occupying the different sections would<lb/>
not have the guarantee that they have under the <lb/>
scheme devised, that matters of a local character<lb/>
would occupy the attention of the local legisla<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>

      tures, whilst those of a general nature
would beÂ 
<lb/> entrusted to the General Legislature. There<lb break="no"/>fore the scheme that was devised gave the cen<lb break="no"/>tralization and consolidation and unity that it <lb/>
           was absolutely indispensable should be given.<lb/>
           On the other hand, instead of having copied the <lb/>
           defects of the federal constitution - instead of<lb/>
            having the inherent weakness that must always<lb/>
           attend a system where the local legislatures<lb/>
          only impart certain powers to the government<lb/>
            of the country - quite a different course was <lb/>
          pursued, and it was decided to define the ques<lb break="no"/>tions that should be reserved for the local legis<lb break="no"/>latures, and those great subjects that should be<lb/>
           entrusted to the general parliament. Therefore, <lb/>
            whilst the unity and consolidation connected<lb/>
          with Legislative Union was obtained on the one<lb/>
         hand, due care and attention to the local matters<lb/>
          interesting to each Province were provided for<lb/>
         by the preservation of local parliaments, and <lb/>
           these powers were so arranged as to prevent any<lb/>
          conflict or struggle which might lead to any dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty between the several sections.<lb/>

the same bond which exists between Cana<lb break="no"/>da and England - between Nova Scotia, New<lb/>

that when the scheme contemplated that the<lb/>

          tion should be made as to the appointment

the Lieutenant Governors. But I would invite <lb/>
the attention of the house to the character of <lb/>
the alteration. What was
proposed? That the <lb/>

elect their gov <lb/>

was not the <lb/>
principle laid down by the conference at Quebec. <lb/>
It will be found that the the same
means by which <lb/>
the governor is appointed today
would exist <lb/>
under the scheme of the conference. Who <lb/>
appoints the Governor General and
the Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant Governors at this day?
If there is a por<lb break="no"/>tion of imperial patronage which is more than <lb/>
another placed within the personal control of <lb/>
the individual who exercises it,
it is the appoint <lb/>

a <lb/>
vacancy in any one of these dependencies,
the <lb/>
man who fills it up it the Right
Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Cardwell sitting in the Colonial office. I would <lb/>
ask, whether under this scheme, when it has<lb/>
been plainly stated by the British government<lb/>
that it would become necessary that they should<lb/>
supply from the ablest British statement a Go<lb break="no"/>vernor or Viceroy, whether the Crown and the <lb/>
people would not have the same guarantee for<lb/>
that influence and control over the appointment<lb/>
of local governors that is exercised now. The<lb/>
difference would be this: Instead of a Colonial<lb/>
Secretary appointing the Lieutenant Governor<lb/>
the Queen's representative sitting at the head<lb/>
of the government of United British America,<lb/>
himself asresponsible as a minister of the Crown,<lb/>
would be called upon to discharge that duty,<lb/>
and, at the same time, harmony would be   b<lb/>
tained between the local and general govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the influence of the crown would be<lb/>
as effective as it exists at the present moment.<lb/>
The people of British North America would be<lb/>
in a position to exercise an amount of
influence <lb/>
in the selection of the local governors which<lb/>
the , of course, cannot do under existing cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE QUESTION OF THE SUBSIDY.
            </head>

            <p> There
is another question that has occupied <lb/>
a great deal of attention, and that is the subsdy.<lb/>
It has been stated that the subsidy was insuffi<lb break="no"/>cient, and that a great mistake was made by the<lb/>
delegates who placed the amount at 80 cents<lb/>
a head, and based it on the census of 1861, in<lb break="no"/>stead of making it a larger sum in the first <lb/>
instance, and allowing it to increase according<lb/>
as the population increasedÂ  If the delegates<lb/>
from the m ritime provinces did not secure suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently good terms, I may say frankly, if we <lb/>
came back not having obtained that fair consi<lb break="no"/>deration and justice to the provinces which we<lb/>
had a right to demand at the hands of the <lb/>
conference, the fault was our own. The <lb/>
business of that conference was carried on<lb/>
by vote by provinces and the maritime<lb/>
colonies, instead of standing in a position<lb/>
to allow Canada to dictate her own terms, <lb/>
and being compelled to accept them, they<lb/>
help a position which gave them a great advan<lb break="no"/>tage. The vote upon every question, as I have<lb/>
said, was taken by provinces. Every member<lb/>
of that Conference had it in his power to advo<lb break="no"/>cate him individual opinions to the best of his<lb/>
ability; but when it came to a vote, the majo<lb break="no"/>rity of the delegates from each province decided<lb/>
what its vote should be; and therefore, when it<lb/>
is seen that Canada had only two votes, and <lb/>
that the Maritime Provinces had four, it is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that if the latter - whose interests were<lb/>
identical - did not receive a fair amount of con<lb break="no"/>sideration it was not because they did not <lb/>
stand in a position to obtain it. I have no hesi<lb break="no"/>tation, however, in going further and saying, if<lb/>
there is any fault to be found with the subsidy<lb/>
to carry on the local governments - the amount<lb/>
necessary to supplement the local funds that<lb/>
          

            <pb n="209" facs="final/images/NS_LA_1865-04-10_Page_209.jpg"/>
          <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.</fw> <fw type="num">209</fw>

 each province would have at its disposal to carry<lb/>
on the local governments - the blame must<lb/>
rest in a large degree, upon the delegates<lb/>
from the province, for that subsidy was<lb/>
fixed to a large extent upon the requirements<lb/>
of what we believed to be the necessities of Nova<lb/>
Scotia, and arranged upon a basis that we felt<lb/>
was necessary in order to meet local exigencies<lb/>
in this Province. We felt it was to the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of this Province as well as of British North<lb/>
America that the subsidy should be placed at as <lb/>
low a fugure as possible, for the simple reason<lb/>
that 80 cents a head was a tax that would rest<lb/>
upon the people of British North America and<lb/>
upon Nova Scotia in common. To have in<lb break="no"/>creased that subsidy to 90 cents would have<lb/>
made a very insignificant difference to be re<lb break="no"/>ceived by the people of this Province, but when<lb/>
applied to the million of Canada it would have<lb/>
amounted to a large aggregate to be drawn<lb/>
annually for ever from the general revenue of<lb/>
the whole country in which we would have a <lb/>
common interest  Therefore it was of the high<lb break="no"/>est importance to the people of this small pro<lb/>
vince with a small population to fix the subsidy<lb/>
at the smallest amount in order to lessen the<lb/>
burthens which the people of British North<lb/>
America, and especially of the lower provinces,<lb/>
would be called upon to sustain. We felt that<lb/>
the same principle dictated to us as a matter of<lb/>
common prudence that we should fix the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy upon the census of 1861. We felt, too,<lb/>
that the population of Upper Canada might be <lb/>
expected to increase in a greater ratio then any<lb/>
other part of British North America, and the <lb/>
result would be that an enormous drain would<lb/>
thus be made upon the general revenue if the <lb/>
subsidy were not stationary  As the population<lb/>
increased it would be but 70 then 60, then 50<lb/>
cents, instead of fixing forever 80 cents upon<lb/>
the people. We believed after making a care<lb break="no"/>ful calculation, which it will not be necessary<lb/>
to go into at this time, that in fixing the amount<lb/>
at 80 cents, we sufficiently consulted the local<lb/>
interests of the country, and the different ser<lb break="no"/>vices for which it was necessary to provide.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">REPRESENTATION
BY POPULATION.</head>

            <p>I must glance now at one or two points
that <lb/>
were arranged at that Conference for the go<lb break="no"/>vernment of British North America. The prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of representation by population was<lb/>
adopted, and there have been found people in<lb/>
this Province to question its soundness and<lb/>
judiciousness. It has been said that it is a<lb/>
false principle and that therefore it should<lb/>
have been repudiated and rejected - that it was<lb/>
not one which Conservatives ought to support.<lb/>
It will not be necessary to go into any elabo<lb break="no"/>rate defence of representation by population,<lb/>
as applied to British America. The principle<lb/>
was approved twenty-five years ago, by a <lb/>
statesman as distinguished as Lord Durham.<lb/>
It was stated by him, in a report which will <lb/>
make his name ever famous in the annals of <lb/>
British America, and I may say Great Britain,<lb/>
that it was the only true and safer principle<lb/>
which the Legislature and Governments<lb/>
could be constructed in British America. That<lb/>
eminent statesman predicted, 25 years ago,<lb/>
in reference to Canada, that if they undertook<lb/>
we ignore the principle of representation by po<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>


pulation, the day would come when the country<lb/>
would be rent in twain. Who does not know<lb/>
the difficulties that arose from the false princi<lb break="no"/>ple that was applied at the time of the union<lb/>
of the Canadas, in order to give the ascendan<lb break="no"/>cy to Upper Canada, whose population at the<lb/>
time was less than that of Lower Canada? - <lb/> Who does not know that the prediction of Earl <lb/>
Durham has been verified? and the time has<lb/>
come when that country has been convulsed<lb/>
in order to rid themselves of a principle so un<lb break="no"/>sound as that a certain number of people in a<lb/>
certain locality shall have an amount of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation arranged not according to their num<lb break="no"/>bers, but exhibiting a disparity with some<lb/>
other section. But were we to put ourselves in<lb/>
the position of saying that the intelligence of<lb/>
our people was such - that the want of intellect<lb/>
and ability amongst us was so marked, that, in <lb/>
order to have sufficient influence in a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive assembly in British North America, we <lb/>
should demand that the principle of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population should be ignored? - <lb/> When it is said that the principle should be<lb/>
discounted by Conservatives, I call the<lb/>
attention of the house to the fact that the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme has been submitted to the most<lb/>
severe ordeal that any scheme of constitutional<lb/>
government could be subjected to, and to a tri<lb break="no"/>bunal perhaps as competent to pass upon it as<lb/>
any in the world - I mean the Government and<lb/>
people in England, as the represented by a press<lb/>
which for standing, character, and intelligence<lb/>
is not equalled in any part of the civilized<lb/>
world. I ask any public man to show me, al<lb break="no"/>though the scheme has been rigidly examinined<lb/>
a single statement in the press of England, or<lb/>
of any other country, calling into question the<lb/>
soundness of the principle of representation by<lb/>
population, as applied to British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca. I have examined all the criticisms I could<lb/>
have access to, and I have yet to find a single<lb/>
press that has objected to the application of<lb/>
that principle. It has been said that, assum<lb break="no"/>ing the principle to be right, it would neverthe<lb break="no"/>less place these provinces in a position that <lb/>
would jeopardise the interests of the people in<lb/>
connection with this scheme of government. I<lb/>
would ask this house to consider that, in the <lb/>
first place, under the principle Nova Scotia<lb/>
would be entitled to 19 representatives in all<lb/>
in a parliament of 19+ members. I would ask <lb/>
this house, when any man ventures to question<lb/>
whether the 19 members or the 47, would not<lb/>
have a fair share of influence in the united parl<lb break="no"/>iament, to look at the only criterion by which<lb/>
it is possible to come to any conclusion on the <lb/>
subject. Look acorss the Atlantic at the par<lb break="no"/>liament of England - at the House of Commons<lb/>
of 600 members - where the parties into which<lb/>
the country are divided, the Liberals and Con<lb break="no"/>servatives, are separated by lines less strong<lb/>
than those which divide Upper and Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, and must divide them for a century to <lb/>
come. There you will see a dozen independ<lb break="no"/>ent men controlling parties and influencing the<lb/>
destinies of the country. Is not this evidence <lb/>
that in a British American parliament of 196<lb/>
members the representatives of the Maritime<lb/>
Provinces would render it impossible for their<lb/>
interests to be ignored or set aside. It may be<lb/>
said they would not be united - personal anta<lb break="no"/>gonism would arise to keep them divided. I <lb/>
grant it. But the moment that parliament<lb/>
would attempt to touch the interests of any<lb/>
part of these Maritime Provinces; would you<lb/>

not see them forced into such a
combination as <lb/>
would enable them todictate to any party that <lb/>
would attempt to override them. Go to Cana<lb break="no"/>da and take your illustration there. Not 19, <lb/>
but three or four members only, for years, have <lb/>
dictated which party should control the go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the country. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Therefore
I feel that this principle is not only <lb/>
just in itself but is one that gave to the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces all the control
and influence to <lb/>
which they were entitled. Look again at the <lb/>
Parliament of England and you
would see, <lb/>
although lreland has an insignificant number <lb/>
of membersâ€”insignificant in a
numerical point <lb/>
of view in comparison to what
Nova Scotia <lb/>
would send into a British
American Parlia<lb break="no"/>mentâ€”yet for years they have occupied that <lb/>
position that they can dictate to
the Parliament <lb/>
which party shall govern the
country. But I <lb/>
need not go to Canada, or Ireland, or England, <lb/>
for illustrations to bear out my
statement. I <lb/>
have only to look at our own legislature to see <lb/>
the comparatively small island
of Cape Bre<lb break="no"/>ton dictating its terms and policy to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the countryâ€”all that is necessary is <lb/>
for her small number of
representatives to <lb/>
combine upon any question of public policy, <lb/>
and she obtains what she requires. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr.
BOURINOTâ€”Cape Breton was not repre<lb break="no"/>sented at the Conference, and at
the present <lb/>
moment she has not a single representative at, <lb/>
the Council Board. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> Dr. TUPPERâ€” The hon. member knows right <lb/>
Well that all that is necessary at any time for <lb/>
the members of Cape Breton is to express their <lb/>
wishes on any question and they
will receive <lb/>
every consideration. Any government that
<lb/>
refused to meet them on their
own terms would <lb/>
receive a fatal blow. I confess I
would have <lb/>
been ashamed to say in the conference that. <lb/>
Nova Scotia's position was such that in order<lb/>
to have influence and control in
a parliament <lb/>
of 194 members she would require to send <lb/>
more than 19 men. Mr. Howe told the people <lb/>
of this country ten years ago that all that he <lb/>
required would be two men in the British Par<lb break="no"/>liament in or er to have the
mining monopoly <lb/>
broken down in a single night's
discussion. <lb/>
Ten years after hemade the statement, I would <lb/>
feel that I was occupying a
position that my <lb/>
countrymen would never forgive if
i said that <lb/>
the intellect of this Province was at so
low an <lb/>
ebb that she could not send 19 members that in <lb/>
point of weight and energy and ability would <lb/>
not protect our interests in the general parlia <lb/>
ment of united British America.  <lb/>

THE NECESSITY FOR UNIONâ€”A PLEA FOR <lb/>

            <p> I have glanced at the more leading features

and it will be <lb/>
perhaps desirable that I should
show what ne<lb break="no"/>cessity there existed, and what
ground there <lb/>
was for having this union. I have already
<lb/>
called the attention of the house to the singu<lb break="no"/>lar fact that rife as party feeling has

been,the divi<lb break="no"/>sions and lines of demarkation between exists<lb break="no"/>ing partiesâ€”from the time the great question<lb/>
of union was first submitted to
the notice of<lb/>
the legislature and people of this country, there <lb/>
has been an amount of unanimity of sentiment <lb/>
among all classes of public men of all parties, <lb/>
such as has never been exhibited
on any other <lb/>
question. It is not singular that such should<lb/>
be the case when we look at our present posi<lb break="no"/>tion. Who is there that does
not feel that the <lb/>
first principles of manhood

be ashamed? <lb/>
Who is there with a spark of manliness in his <lb/>
bosom that does not feel
that he has a right to <lb/>be proud of his country in proportion to the <lb/>
position it occupies in the scale of nationsÂ  I<lb/>
need not tell the house that
surrounded as we <lb/>
are by many blessingsâ€”owing
fealty as we do <lb/>
to the first empire in the world - enjoying the <lb/>
protection of one of the greatest powers on the <lb/>
globeâ€”having free institutions in
all their en<lb break="no"/>tirety â€” possessing as we do
peace and plenty, <lb/>
â€”that we enjoy advantages for which we <lb/>
ought to be profoundly grateful;- but I
can dis<lb break="no"/>cover no other cause why there has been so <lb/>
great a co-operation among all classes of intel<lb break="no"/>ligent people of our country in respect to a <lb/>
union of these colonies than the desire that<lb/>
possessing these advantages we should at the<lb/>
same time advance to a more national position<lb/>
and render our institutions more secure. Who<lb/>
does not feel mortified when he takes up the<lb/>
report of the discussion that recently took<lb/>
place in the Commons, and finds that although<lb/>
the subject under debate was the security of<lb/>
British America, yet the only one of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that appeared to be known to British<lb/>

at that time, to go in conjunction with Mr. <lb/>
Young to attend the meeting of the
delegates, for<lb/>
the purpose of considering the question. He<lb/>
found, however, that he was required to give<lb/>
his assent to what had been done already. - <lb/> Therefore, in the arrangement of a treaty so<lb/>
intimately affecting our interests, the views of <lb/>
not a single public man in Nova Scotia were<lb/>
considered worthy of attention, and I presume<lb/>
it was the same with New Brunswick.<lb/>

            <p>Where was New Brunswick when a large<lb/>
slice was cut off from her territory - when the <lb/>
whole of British North America was disfigured<lb/>
by the Ashburton Treaty? The opinion of a <lb/>

asked.</p>
            <p>The fact is, if we are known at all across

we happen to be contiguous to Canada. Every<lb break="no"/>thing connected with out interests tell us of<lb/>

is not a matter of surprise, in view of <lb/>
these facts, and of the position we occupy,<lb/>
that the intelligent men of these Provinces<lb/>
have long since come to the conclusin that, if<lb/>
these comparatively small countries are to<lb/>
have any future whatever in connection with<lb/>
the crown of England, it must be found in a <lb/>
consolidation of all British North America. I <lb/>

<p>There is nothing that lowers the credit of

that all the security that he would have for in<lb break="no"/>vestment might at any moment become en<lb break="no"/>tirely worthless. This is not a mere question<lb/>

is the established fact that the moment it was <lb/>
made known on the other side of the Atlantic<lb/>
that the interests of British North America<lb/>

improved. We have now all the dis-advan<lb break="no"/>tages of connection with Canada. Who does<lb/>
not know that you cannot have a vote<lb/>

Nova Scotia, and our funds are affected<lb/>

for the trade of a mighty nationality, of which<lb/>

willing to admit that the construction of this <lb/>
work was a matter of the most vital concern<lb/>
to the people of this country. I will not detain<lb/>
the house by going into any elaborate quota<lb break="no"/>tions by which the leading men of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have, from time to time, shown that<lb/>
they belived that the question of Intercoloni<lb break="no"/>al Railway was fraught with the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant consequences to the advancement of the <lb/>
Province of Noa Scotia, and when I state to<lb/>
the house that after every effort has been tried<lb/>
and failed, this scheme of union accomplished<lb/>
that work on terms such as no man had ever<lb/>
ventured to ask for this people. I feel that it <lb/>
is not only in the constitution of the House of <lb/>
Assembly and the Legislative Council, but<lb/>
also in respect to this great work that the de<lb break="no"/>legates from the Maritime Provinces brought<lb/>
back the indisputable evidence of the earnest<lb/>
disposition of Canada to unite their fortunes<lb/>
with our own in a common union which should<lb/>
be beneficial to all.</p>
            <p>It is true it was a matter of great
importance <lb/>
for Canada to obtain this union - that it opened<lb/>
a door for the removal of the great difficulties<lb/>
that have distracted the country,and whatever <lb/>
may be the extent and resources of Canada - <lb/> and they are inexhaustible, and I might almost<lb/>
say illimitable, -- it can never occupy the posi<lb break="no"/>tion it should except it has a free outlet to the<lb/>

back not only with the evidence that they<lb/>
would have in the upper and lower branch all<lb/>
the guarantees they would require for the ad<lb break="no"/>vancement of the coutnry, but actually obtain<lb break="no"/>ed a pledge that New Brunswick and Nova <lb/>
Scotia should secure the construction of the <lb/>

</div>

<div type="section">
            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE LESSON OF THE PRESENT.</head>


            <p>Yesterday. British America bordered upon a<lb/>
country great in its trade and peaceful pursuits<lb/>
- having a commerce second to none on the<lb/>
globe; but you have seen all that changed as it <lb/>
were in a day. Now you see alongside of us<lb/>
one of the most gigantic military and naval <lb/>
powers that the world has ever seen. There<lb break="no"/>fore it behoves us to consider whether any<lb/>
public man, in view of the changed attitude of<lb/>
that country would not be wanting in his duty<lb/>
to the Province if he attempted for a single<lb/>
moment to ignore these circumstances. I drea<lb/>
the attention of the house at its last session to<lb/>
the fact that British North America had owed<lb/>
a great deal of its security to the existence of<lb/>
slavery in the neighboring republic. Is it not<lb/>
necessary, in he light of events that have <lb/>
come to our knowledge to-day, we should con<lb break="no"/>sider how closee many be at hand the termination<lb/>
of the great struggle which has convulsed that<lb/>
great republic with civil war for four years<lb/>
past; but I think we may safely predict that,<lb/>
let the issue of that struggle end in any man<lb break="no"/>ner we can possible conceive, one thing is cer<lb break="no"/>tain, and that is, that slavery is doomed. The<lb/>
great slave power, which so long exercised<lb/>
control over the destinies of the States. I have<lb/>
ever looked upon as the best safeguard for <lb/>
British North America, since it was antagonis<lb break="no"/>tic to the acquistion of any anti-slavery terri<lb break="no"/>tory, and consequent increase of influence by<lb/>
the North. Therefore, when we see this gigan<lb break="no"/>tic republic relieved from that difficulty, and<lb/>
becoming one of the greatest military powers<lb/>
in the world, it is matter of deserving of our<lb/>
most serious deliberation. I regret to have to<lb/>
say - nor would it be right for me to ignore the<lb/>
fact - that whilst I feel it would be for the in<lb break="no"/>terests of British North America to preserve<lb/>
the most amicable relations with the United <lb/>
States, it is impossible for me to shut my eyes<lb/>
to the evidence before me that the tone of that<lb/>
power is decidedly hostile to this country. I <lb/>
deeply deplore that such should be the case<lb/>
but, at the same time, I would be recreant to<lb/>
my duty as a public man if I did not tell this<lb/>
house and explain the amount of influence<lb/>
that these considerations have had upon my <lb/>
own mind. Is is known that until recently the<lb/>
most kindly relations existed between the <lb/>
people of British North America and the <lb/>
United States. Trade was fostered in every<lb/>
way that was possible - every thing that would<lb/>
promote harmony and free commercial inter<lb break="no"/>course was done. But how do we stand to<lb break="no"/>day? Whether you regard the public senti<lb break="no"/>ment of the country though the declarations<lb/>
of its Press, its Parliament, or its Government<lb/>
you can arrive at but one conclusion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>(The hon. gentleman thenreferred, in sup<lb break="no"/>port of his statement, to the establishment of<lb/>
the passport system between these Provinces<lb/>
and the States - which was a great source of<lb/>
embarrassment to trade and intrecourse be<lb break="no"/>tween the two countries. He then alluded to <lb/>
the fact that the American Congress had made<lb/>

an appropriation for the construction of
the <lb/>
Niagara ship central by which vessels of large<lb/>
size may be sent through from American wa<lb break="no"/>ters into the Canadian lakes and for fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions on the frontier. Again, the treaty under<lb/>
which only a small armament was allowed on<lb/>
the lakes was to be immediately abrogated on<lb/>
the motion of the American Government.<lb/>
Then, again, there was the question that so vi<lb break="no"/>tally affected the people of British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica - the Reciprocity Treaty. He then con<lb break="no"/>tinued in reference to the latter subject:)</p>

</div>

<div type="section">
            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE RECIPROCITY TREATY.</head>

            <p>Under the treaty, whilst the trade of
British<lb/>
North America has been increased and impro<lb break="no"/>ved, it has been infinitely much more benefi<lb break="no"/>cial to the commerce of the United States.- <lb/>
Under the fostering influence of that treaty, the<lb/>
trade between British America and the States<lb/>
suddenly sprung in four years from fifteen to<lb/>
sixty million dollars. Whilst it has been in <lb/>
the highest degree useful and advantageous to<lb/>
the commerce and advancement of these Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North American Provinces, yet the ba<lb break="no"/>lance of trade has been largely in favour of the<lb/>
States. And who is there that does not know<lb/>
the great importance that keen and sadacious<lb/>
people attach to anything that will extend<lb/>
their commerce and improve their trade? But<lb/>
despite all that - although the Boards of Trade <lb/>
at New York, Detroit, and elsewhere, have <lb/>
made the most energetic appeals against the<lb/>
abolition of the treaty, the Board of Trade at <lb/>
Detroit actually demonstrating to their govern<lb break="no"/>ment that since the commencement of the <lb/>
treaty the balance of trade has been $162,000,000<lb/>
in their favour - notwithstanding all that, under<lb/>
the influence of that spirit which I deeply re<lb break="no"/>gret to see exhibitd, notice for the abolition of<lb/>
the treaty has been given. Not only so be it<lb/>
is conclusively shown that it is not the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of the American Government to enter into<lb/>
any negociations for the continuance of the <lb/>
treaty. A few days ago I laid on the table of <lb/>
this house a remarkable document. The treaty<lb/>
provides that there shall be a joint commis<lb break="no"/>sion under it - yet while the treaty must remain<lb/>
in forde for another year, Mr. Stewart has de<lb break="no"/>manded that the commission be immediately<lb/>
closed. It is impossible, in the view of<lb/>
such facts, to shut our eyes to the reality that<lb/>
while that great Republic has assumed such<lb/>
gigantic proportione and at the same time has<lb/>
taken such an attitude in reference to these<lb/>
Provinces, we have a right to come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that their determination is to close all<lb/>
communication, instead of fostering those<lb/>
peaceful and commercial relations with us, <lb/>
which in the past have been so remarkably be<lb break="no"/>neficial.</p>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE DUTY THAT LIES BEFORE US.</head>


            <p>It has been said that it is impossible for
us<lb/>
to put ourselves in an attitude that will
im<lb break="no"/>prove oour position in this respect. I am
not<lb/>
wrong in assuming that the desire of every<lb/>
British American is to remain in connection<lb/>
with the people of Great Britain. If there
is any<lb/>
sentiment that was ever strong in the
breast of<lb/>
our people, it is a disinclination to be<lb/>
separated in any way whatever from the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish empire, or to be connected in any
manner<lb/>
with the United States of America. But what<lb/>
is out present position? Isolated and
separat<lb break="no"/>ed as we are now, I ask the house whether
all<lb/>
the protection we have is not that which
the

            <cb/>
         

crawling worm enjoys - and that is its insigni<lb break="no"/>ficance is such as to prevent the foot being<lb/>
placed upon it? Does it comport with the po<lb break="no"/>sition and dignity of freemen, that we should<lb/>
have our only guarantee of security and pro<lb/>
-tection in our insignificance? I feel in our<lb/>
present isolated position, standing in the pre<lb break="no"/>sence of a power so gigantic and unfriendsly<lb/>
that we must take speedy and prompt mea<lb break="no"/>sures for security. I may be told that four mil<lb break="no"/>lions of people would still stand in the presence<lb/>
of thirty millions, and that we would be un<lb break="no"/>able to make any resistance that would ensure<lb/>
our safety; but I would ask the house to <lb/>
consider the fact that we have every reason to<lb/>
know - for no one can doubt the declaration of<lb/>
the ministry of England - that the resolve on<lb/>
the part of Great Britain is to stand in all her<lb/>
integrity by British America. provided these<lb/>
provinces assume such asn attitude as would<lb/>
make the power of the parent state to be put <lb/>
forth with a reasonable prospect of success. <lb/>
Although our numbers may be comparatively<lb/>
small still while we have the good fortune to<lb/>
be a part of the British empire, and know that <lb/>
all that is necessary is for us. bu union <lb/>
and consolidation, to take such a position <lb/>
as would give England the guarantee that<lb/>
we are prepared to do our duty, and her <lb/>
power would not be put forth in vain,<lb/>
we need not fear the future. Every man who<lb/>
wishes to keep the liberties and rights he now<lb/>
possesses as subject to the Crown of England<lb/>
- who values the institutions he now enjoys,<lb/>
must see the necessity of our taking such a <lb/>
course as would guarantee us security in the<lb/>
case of conflict with any power in the world,<lb/>
and what would be even better, the avoidance<lb/>
of conflict which out attitude would accom<lb break="no"/>plish.</p>

<div type="section">

            <head rendition="simple:centre">SHALL OUR BURDENS BE GREATER?</head>

            <p>I may be told, that great as are the advan<lb break="no"/>tages of Union, they will be purchased at too<lb/>
great a cost - that there will be an increase in<lb/>
the tariff - that the burdens that will be thrown<lb/>
upon the people will be greater that otherwise<lb/>
they would have been. I do not intend to <lb/>
weary the house with any elaborate state<lb break="no"/>ments on this point, except to say that I believe<lb/>
we have every reason to suppose, from the po<lb break="no"/>sition we occupy in connection with the parent<lb/>
state - from the expansion that would accede<lb/>
to the trade and commerce of the country- <lb/>
from the development that would be given to<lb/>
manufactures, and the extension of our public<lb/>
works - that our burdens would not be<lb/>
greater than if we remain in our present posi<lb break="no"/>tion. Are we not desirous at the present mo<lb break="no"/>ment to extend our public works and may we<lb/>
not fairly assume that if we were to remain<lb/>
out of Union that the burdens we have to<lb/>
bear would be increased. The time has passed<lb/>
when these Provinces would not have to con<lb break="no"/>tribute largely to the defences of the country.<lb/>
Either the fishing grounds, so valbuable to us, <lb/>
must be given up without a struggle to the <lb/>
parties who have been accustomed in the <lb/>

cost of defending them must be largely thrown<lb/>

            <p>Therefore I would ask whether in relation to<lb/>
the protection of our fisheries which will di<lb break="no"/>rectly have to engage our attention, it is not<lb/>
desirable to have these Provinces united and <lb/>
consolidated. I may be asked whether Union<lb/>

would
increase the number of men or the<lb/>

population. I believe that the moral force that <lb/>
would be given to the whole of British North<lb/>
America by a common union if her interests,<lb/>
would be such as I have stated before - to en<lb break="no"/>sure not only the safety, but the peace of the <lb/>
country.</p>
            <p>Assuming
that you are to reject a union on <lb/>
the ground that we are defenceless, what is our <lb/>
position? You are likely to be overwhelmed<lb/>
without a struggle, or, in the language of Mr. <lb/>
Howe, - without an Intercolonial Railway, or<lb/>
the means of communication with Quebec, the <lb/>
inhabitants of Nova Scotia would have to beg<lb/>
permission to haul down their own flag. Hu<lb break="no"/>miliating as is such a statement every man<lb/>
man knows that it is true, and how useless it<lb/>
would be for Nova Scotia to undertake any re<lb break="no"/>sistance. At the present, those who assail<lb/>
Nova Scotia in its isolated position, would only<lb/>
attack 350,000. but, with British America<lb/>
united, whoever put a hostile foot upon our<lb/>
1000 miles of sea coast would assail nearly four<lb/>
millions of freemen, sustained by the mightiest<lb/>
power in the world.</p>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE
POSITION OF THE OPPONENTS OF UNION<lb/>
ON THE DEFVNCE QUESTION.</head>


            <p>I will now turn the attention of the house
for<lb/>
a single moment to the fact that, on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of defence the opponents of Union have<lb/>
felt that it was so important that questions of <lb/>
tariff and expenditure sank into insignificance,<lb/>
and that it was aobsolutely necessary that some<lb/>
means should be given to a free and intelligent<lb/>
people, by which their rights and liberties<lb/>
should be secured. I regret to state that a lea<lb break="no"/>ding journal in this country changed its opi<lb break="no"/>nions, and for the first time in the history of<lb/>
the Province, this question of Intercolonial<lb/>
Union was endeavored to be made one of party,<lb/>
and that party influences and prejudices were<lb/>
awakened in order to excite hostility against<lb/>
the Government, and prevent the people of<lb/>
this Province accepting the proposed Union. - <lb/> They felt, however, that it was necessary, on a <lb/>
question so important as that of defence, that<lb/>
we should do somethingm, and accordingly they <lb/>
propounded to the people of this country their<lb/>
scheme, by which they would protect British <lb/>
North America. In the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> of <lb/>
Jan. 18, 1865, you read:-</p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>"<hi rendition="simple:italic">We would provide for the defence of the
Em<lb break="no"/>pire by a general tax equally levied by an Imper<lb break="no"/>ial statute all over the Empire.</hi> This might be <lb/>
either a tax on property, on polls, or on im<lb break="no"/>ports, <hi rendition="simple:italic">to take precedence, of all other taxes, and to<lb/>
be paid into the Imperial treasury.</hi> About Â£28,<lb/>

of the Empire, including the Eastern Provin<lb break="no"/>ces and dependencies, at 300,000,000, 2s. per<lb/>
head sterling would provide the whole sum re<lb break="no"/>quired. A property tax, if that were preferred, <lb/>
would raise the whole amount. But if it was <lb/>
thought better to collect the Â£28,000,000 upon<lb/>
imports, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">commerce of the Empire would yield<lb/>
the whole without any portion of it feeling the <lb/>
burthen.</hi>"</p></quote>

            <p>When I am told that our scheme of union<lb/>
would involve increasing the burthens upon the<lb/>
people of this country - that a yard of cotton<lb/>
might cost one cent more than it does now, -<lb/> and that it was a reason why we should not

            <cb/>

have union with all its advantages - an Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, expanded commerce, the de<lb break="no"/>velopment of manufactures, and intercommu<lb break="no"/>nion between 4,000,000 of British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans. When I am told this I think I have a <lb/>
right to ask the people of this country to ex<lb break="no"/>amine this scheme that is propounded on the <lb/>
great question of national defence by the oppo<lb break="no"/>nents of Confederation and compare it with<lb/>
that offered for your acceptance by the Quebec<lb/>
Conference. Then, I think, you will say that<lb/>
any charge of increased taxation that has been<lb/>
insinuated - the most extravagant estimate<lb/>
made of the cost, the scheme of the Quebec <lb/>
Conference is entirely thrown into the shade.<lb/>
I need not call attention to the disgraceful pro<lb break="no"/>posal that is made to a free people in the arti<lb break="no"/>cle I have just read. If I had not the evidence<lb/>
here it would have almost seemed incredible<lb/>
that such a proposition could have been made<lb/>
in this century to a free and intelligent people, <lb/>
that nay body of loyal men could propound<lb/>
the repetition of a policy that lost England her<lb/>
finest Colonies nearly a century ago. I believe I<lb/>
would be doing a gross injustice to the free spirit<lb/>
of this country if I were to suppose that even<lb/>
connection with the crown of England would be<lb/>
sufficient to induce the people of this country<lb/>
to allow an Imperial Statute to lay an Imperi<lb break="no"/>al tax upon us to go into the Imperial treasury.<lb/>
Deeply as the people value their institutions - <lb/> and greatly attached as they are to the mother<lb/>
country, - yet the free spirit of this country<lb/>

independence of the old colonies nearly a <lb/>
hundred years ago. Let me suppose that the<lb/>
independent spirit of the people should be so<lb/>
trampled-down as to induce them to submit to<lb/>
taxation by an Imperial statute - what then?<lb/>
This article says:-</p>

 try. It
would be soliciting the British Go<lb break="no"/>vernment to place us in a position which we<lb/>
should never be placed in ; it would be asking<lb/>
the Parliament of England to consent to that<lb/>
which would be only worthy of a century that<lb/>
is past. The person who has ventured to tram<lb break="no"/>ple down the scheme of the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, and bring forward the plan of the Anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Unionists, should have better informed him<lb break="no"/>self of the facts as they exist. Did he not <lb/>
know that 180 millions of people in British <lb/>
India could not have a farthing of that tax<lb/>
levied upon them, as they provide now for the <lb/>
defence of the British Empire in the East at an<lb/>
enormous annual cost.</p>
            <p>This Â£36,000,000 currency would, therefore,<lb/>
under this plan require to be levied upon about <lb/>
36,000,000 millions instead of 300,000,000. I will<lb/>
not presume that it was an attempt to mislead,<lb/>
but it is charitable to suppose that the parties<lb/>
who have attempted to instruct the people of<lb/>
this country in opposition to the great scheme<lb/>
of Union, did not know that this Â£8,000,000<lb/>
sterling for the Army and Navy was altogether<lb/>
irrespective of the Army and Navy of British <lb/>
India.</p>
            <p>Yet is by documents such as these that the<lb/>
people of these Maritime Provinces have been<lb/>
excited to hostility against a scheme which<lb/>
would have made the British American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces a great nationality, of which their people<lb/>
might be justly proud ; which would have ex<lb break="no"/>tended our commerce and promoted our welth<lb/>
and prosperity to an extent that is incalculable,<lb/>
and at the ame time connect us more closely <lb/>
with the Parent State, drawing around us that<lb/>
aid and co-operation which would have secured <lb/>
to us and our children after us, to the most <lb/>
remote posterity, that guarantee of peace and<lb/>
safety which every man amongst us feels it<lb/>
ought to be his privilege to enjoy.</p>

            <p>I need not allude to the commerce and ship<lb break="no"/>ping that British America would enjoy under<lb/>
Union. These statistics were known to all.<lb/>
But when I am asked the question, as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther British America is in a position to enter<lb/>
into the Union? I reply: Let us compare the<lb/>
position that these provinces now occupy with<lb/>
that which the American colonies had at the<lb/>
time of their independence. We find we have<lb/>
a larger population, and occupy a position in<lb/>
many respects superior to that which they <lb/>
then did. Look at their trade, and you find<lb/>
that they had only one third of what we have<lb/>
now. Their population and revenue were<lb/>
much smaller. In respect, therefore, to trade<lb/>
population and revenue, upon which the great<lb break="no"/>ness of a country rests, you find the position of<lb/>
British America is one of evident influence.<lb/>
The American colonies, by sweeping away<lb/>
hostile tariffs, and emerging from that position<lb/>
of isolation which they occupied, have attained<lb/>
their present wealth and prosperity. Look at<lb/>
our shipping, and see at this moment the ton<lb break="no"/>nage of British America, amounting to over<lb/>
900,00 tons occupying a place next to France<lb/>
- the fourth commercial marine in the world.<lb/>
But I need not go into any labored arguments<lb/>
to show that the time has come when we should<lb/>
assume a position of nationality under the aegies<lb/>
of old England. </p>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE POSITION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.</head>

            <p>It has been said that whilst the General

Those who make such a statement must ignore<lb/>
our past history. I would ask gentleman to <lb/>
look at the history of the past, and see whether<lb/>
there is evidence to sustain the proposition <lb/>
that the governments of these provinces would<lb/>
occupy so contemptible a position that no man<lb/>
of character and influence would be inclined <lb/>
to have anything to do with them. In the first<lb/>
place, the subsidy that this province would<lb/>
receive in connection with the revenue from<lb/>
the mines and minerals would be double the<lb/>
revenue that it had at the time when the men<lb/>
who have made the legislature famous occu<lb break="no"/>pied seats within those walls. Not only would<lb/>
we have double the amount of revenue, but<lb/>
we would have larger powers, and possess<lb/>
more commanding influence in relation to the <lb/>
public affairs of the province than the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and parliament of this province had at<lb/>
the time when Chief Justice Haliburton, the<lb/>

Masters of the Rolls (Archibald and Stewart)<lb/>
occupied seats in this house. Can we say<lb/>
then, when we shall have double the revenue,<lb/>

such a hold on the public mind of all these<lb/>

reaction on the part of the public men of that<lb/>

most deeply to be deplored in the interests of <lb/>
all B. N. A I regret, however, to say that a <lb/>
large amount of hostility has also been excited<lb/>
in various sections of Nova Scotia in res<lb break="no"/>pect to this question, and the petitions<lb/>
which are now on the table would render<lb/>
it exceedingly difficult for any government<lb/>
to ask an immediate decision, but whilst there<lb/>
has been a vast amount of energy, exhibited - <lb/> whilst thousands of people have been induced<lb/>
to petition this Legislative on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation a comparatively small<lb/>
number of these petitions have pronounc<lb break="no"/>ed against Confederation. There are not 3000<lb/>
persons in the entire Province who say they <lb/>
are opposed to the proposed Confederation,<lb/>
notwithstanding the scheme has been misre<lb break="no"/>presented, and arguments of the most falla<lb break="no"/>cious character used against it - and that party<lb/>
influences have been thrown largely into the <lb/>
scale - although the attempt has been made to<lb/>
induce people to oppose it by petitions largely<lb/>
circulated, the majority of the petitioners who<lb/>
are here state that they are not prepared to<lb/>
say whether it would be good or for evil,<lb/>
that we should have Confederation and ask<lb/>
the House to pause before irrevocably commit<lb break="no"/>ting itself to what would be, I believe, for <lb/>
the advantage of the country. I believe<lb/>
that atan early day, these parties having<lb/>
been fully informed on the subject, will be<lb/>
prepared to come hence by tens of thou<lb break="no"/>sands, and ask the Legislature to consummate<lb/>
this scheme of Union. I tremble, sir, when I<lb/>
think of the results that the action of these<lb/>
Provinces may have upon the public mind in<lb/>
England - that the steps which are in progress<lb/>
for the security and defence of British North<lb/>
America may be interfered with and by<lb/>
the fact that in presence of a great danger,<lb/>
these Provinces have permitted that isolation<lb/>
to continue which can only lead to connection<lb/>
with the American Republic, and opposed that<lb/>
consolidation which in co-opperation with the<lb/>
power which England was prepared to put<lb/>
forth, would give us security and avert the <lb/>
peril that is now so imminent.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The scheme devised at Quebec has passed<lb/>
through the most trying of ordeals triumphant<lb break="no"/>ly - after being submitted to the closest exami<lb break="no"/>nation by the press of England, it has come<lb/>
out with enconiums such as no scheme ever<lb/>
devised by any body of public men has ever<lb/>
received before. It has secured the approbation<lb/>
of the most intelligent and influential section<lb/>
of the press of British America. It has been <lb/>
adopted in Canada by both branches of the<lb/>
Legislature with an unanimity such as reflects<lb/>
the highest honor on the patriotism and the<lb/>
intelligence of that country. In New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, P. E. Island, and Nova Scotia, it has en<lb break="no"/>listed the support of almost the entire religious<lb/>
press of the country, as also that of the most<lb/>
intelligent and independent of the secular<lb/>
press. Having obtained the support and co<lb break="no"/>operation of the leading and most influential<lb/>
public men in the different provinces - of the<lb/>
great bulk of the intelligence, wealth, and in<lb break="no"/>
      
            <cb/>
         
fluence of the country, it is placed in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion which gives to this house and country,<lb/>
            and to all British North America the best<lb/>
            guarantee that in a little time, when it has<lb/>
            been fully examined and discussed, all classes<lb/>
            will vie with each other in bringing about the<lb/>

<div type="section">


            <head rendition="simple:centre">UNION OF THE MARITIME PROVINCES.</head>

            <p>I have stated in the outset that a Legislative<lb/>
Union of the Maritime Provinces is desir<lb break="no"/>able in case we are Confederated. and <lb/>
and still more indispensible in case we are not<lb/>
to be at once united with Canada. Under these<lb/>
circumstances have I moved the resolution<lb/>
which I now hold in my hand. I can only say <lb/>
that if gentlemen will examine the remarks I <lb/>
made in this house last winter they will find<lb/>
that I considered the Union of the Maritime<lb/>
Provinces was one of the most important<lb/>
means to secure a union of all British North <lb/>
America, and most desirable in such a con<lb break="no"/>tingency. There are gentlement present both<lb/>
inside and outside of these benches - who were<lb/>
connected with the delegation to Quebec - who<lb/>
will bear m out in the assertion that I always<lb/>
advocated the lesser union in that light. And<lb/>
at the very moment when I prepared to<lb/>
concur with the rest of the delegates from the <lb/>
Maritime Provinces in adjourning the question<lb/>
of the smaller union until the larger question<lb/>
had been considered, I advocated the former<lb/>
as almost as essential and important if we<lb/>
remained out. The whole objection that is<lb/>
raised against the diminished importance and <lb/>
and expensiveness of the local governments <lb/>
and legislatures would under Confederation<lb/>
be swept away by a union of the Maritime<lb/>
provinces. Therefore, instead of bringing for<lb break="no"/>ward this question as a counter-proposition to<lb/>
theConfederation of British North America, I<lb/>
regard it to-night as I did a year ago, as an <lb/>
important and gret step towards securing<lb/>
that greater union - as a means of placing<lb/>
these Maritime provinces in a united and influ<lb break="no"/>ential position under Confederation than we<lb/>
would and P. E. Island, it is not for me to say. I<lb/>
may admit there was no prospect of getting<lb/>
Prince Edward Island into the proposed Leg<lb break="no"/>islative union, even if the Canadian deputation<lb/>
had not attended the conference at Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town. Gratified as I would have been to se<lb/>
P. E. Island form a portion of the great Con<lb break="no"/>federation, I did not regard their action either<lb/>
in respect to the smaller or greater union as a <lb/>
matter of vital concern at all. All that is neces<lb break="no"/>ary is that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick<lb/>
united as they are by every tie of common in<lb break="no"/>terests should be in a position to have that uni<lb break="no"/>on. Even if the larger union were impractica<lb break="no"/>ble and could never take place, still it is desir<lb break="no"/>able that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia<lb/>
should be unite. It would expand on trade<lb/>
advance our influence, and accomplish many<lb/>
of the same results and bring about advant<lb break="no"/>ages that would be received from the <lb/>
larger scheme of union, only in a smaller de<lb break="no"/>gree.</p>
            <p>Having trespassed so long upon the patience <lb/>
of the House I will not occupy the attention of <lb/>
gentlemen longer than to express the hope<lb/>
that this resolution will meet with the concur<lb break="no"/>rence of this Legislature and of the Govern<lb break="no"/>

ment of
New Brunswick, though on this latter<lb/>
point I am not prepared to express any opi<lb break="no"/>nion.</p>
            <p>But suppose
the government of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick is not prepared to concur in Union of the<lb/>
Maritime Provinces, it was desirable that that<lb/>
point should be definitely known, and the<lb/>
public mind be no longer distracted with the<lb/>
consideration of that question.</p>

<p>
By this resolution the government will be <lb/>
authorized to open negotiations, and see what<lb/>
prospect there is of obtaining a legislative<lb/>
union with that province. The opponents of<lb/>
Confederation here have professed to be in fa<lb break="no"/>vour of the Union of the Maritime Provinces,<lb/>
and as far as I have an opportunity of know<lb break="no"/>ing that has been the view of some of the op<lb break="no"/>ponents of Confederation in New Brunswick.<lb/>
Whatever view, therefore, this house may take<lb/>
of the larger question of a Union of British<lb/>
North America, I trust they will sustain the <lb/>
resolution now submitted to their consideration.</p>


<!-- GL, 2017-04-20, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->
            <!--<p>TUESDAY, APRIL 11</p>
            <p>House met at 3 o'clock.</p>
            <p>THE SCHOOL BILL.</p>
            <p>Hon PROV. SEC. moved the third reading of<lb/>
the bill "For the better encouragement of edu<lb break="no"/>cation."</p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. LOCKE opposed the principle of as<lb break="no"/>sessment as most obnoxious to the people, and<lb/>
moved a resolution to this effect: -</p>
            <p>
Whereas, the system of direct taxation for the <lb/>
support of schools has been condemned by and<lb/>
is obnoxious to the wishes of the people of this<lb/>
Province, and instead of promoting had retard<lb break="no"/>ed the progress of education;</p>
            <p>Therefore Resolved, That this bill be
referred <lb/>
back to committee for the purpose of striking<lb/>
out so much thereof as establishes that princi<lb break="no"/>ple, and that there should be substituted there<lb break="no"/>for clauses provinding for subscriptions or con<lb break="no"/>tributions by fees to supplement the propos<lb break="no"/>es grant for the support of schools.</p>
            <p>Hon. PROV. SEC. said that the resolution
ask<lb break="no"/>ed the house to stultify itself and to resort to<lb/>
an old system which had been tried and found<lb/>
inadequate. He hoped a majority would not <lb/>
be found, for party purposes, willing to adopt<lb/>
such a course.</p>
            <p>Mr. LOCKE disavowed all party feeling in<lb/>
the matterm and expressed the opinion that the<lb/>
present law had retarded education and closed<lb/>
one half the schools. He thought the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture had no right to meddle with the pockets<lb/>
of the people as the bill proposed.</p>
            <p>Hon. ATTY. GEN. said he had yet to learn<lb/>
that the people were willing to go back to the <lb/>
old system which had been abandoned last<lb/>
year by a vote of nine-tenths of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. For years past all parties had acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged its inadequacy to meet the requirements<lb/>
of the country, and the necessity of an im<lb break="no"/>proved system of education. Notwithstanding<lb/>
all the difficulties that naturally arose in put<lb break="no"/>ting into operation a bill new to the people, the<lb/>
results on the whole had been satisfactory and <lb/>
encouraging. Under all the circumstances, it<lb/>
was absurd for the hon. gentleman to ask the<lb/>
house to go back to a system which had been<lb/>
condemned by nine-tenths of the members last <lb/>
year.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. ARCHIBALD made a few remarks in sup<lb break="no"/>port of the principle of assessment, which had<lb/>
been advocated by leading minds in the House</p>


            <milestone type="unknown"/>

            <p>and country for many years. He would not<lb/>
support a resolution which went to establish a<lb/>
principle which he felt was unsuited to the<lb/>
public requirements, and was condemned by a <lb/>
large majority last winter. The bill of last<lb/>
year was objectionable in many respects, but<lb/>
the object of the present measure was to re<lb break="no"/>move many of the injurious features of the for<lb break="no"/>mer, and place education on a more satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory basis. - Some details he strongly objected<lb/>
to still, but of its vital principle he approved.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEWART CAMPELL said that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether the rejection of the assess<lb break="no"/>ment principle would destroy the bill, and em<lb break="no"/>barrass the Government, was not the point to<lb/>
be considered at all. What they were called<lb/>
upon to ascertain was whether that principle<lb/>
was in accordance with the feelings and wish<lb break="no"/>es of the country. If it was, then let it be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted; but if not, irrespective of any party<lb/>
considerations whatever. He differed entirely<lb/>
from the hon. Provincial Secretary, when he <lb/>
said that they would stultify themselves<lb/>
by rejecting the assessment clause; on the con-<lb break="maybe"/>
trarty, he thoughthat it would be the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that stultified themselves when they call<lb break="no"/>ed upon the house to pass a measure which for<lb/>
the last twelve months had received universal<lb/>
condemnation throughout the country. The<lb/>
hon. Provincial Secretary stated that the house<lb/>
had already acted upon this principle. That<lb/>
vote was taken in a thin house, when fifteen<lb/>
gentlemen recorded their votes against it, and<lb/>
eighteen for it: and he believed that if they<lb/>
were not influened by pressure since brought<lb/>
to bear, the majority would be the other way.<lb/>
He denied that the bill of last year had been a <lb/>
success in the country. Even admitting that in<lb/>
some populous districts it had met with support,<lb/>
that was no answer to the fact that the large<lb/>
majority of districts lying outside of these were<lb/>
deprived of the meand of education altogether.<lb/>
He disclaimed all idea in opposing this bill, of<lb/>
wishing to embarrass the government. If it<lb/>
had that effect, they had brought it on their<lb/>
own heads. He opposed it because he knew<lb/>
it to be obnoxious to his constituents. If it was <lb/>
a good bill, he called upon the government to<lb/>
appeal to the peopl and allow them to pass<lb/>
their judgment upon it; but he did not think<lb/>
that ever they believed that it was in accor<lb break="no"/>dance with the wishes of the people. He call<lb break="no"/>ed upon gentlemen opposite to record their <lb/>
opinions upon this question, according to their<lb/>
own convictions and what they knew was the<lb/>
feeling of the country. He did not think that<lb/>
it was the duty of any gentlemen, however<lb/>
much they might desire to sustain the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, to perpetuate a system so obnoxious to<lb/>
the people.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The assertion of the hon. Atty. Gen., that
<lb/>
education was in a better position now than<lb/>
under the old law, had been so often refuted<lb/>
that he would not take up time by alluding to<lb/>
it now. The petitions upon the table shewed<lb/>
the contrary; and it would have been better<lb/>
for the government to have paid some regard<lb/>
to them, rather than pass them by unnoticed.</p>
            <p>The hon'ble gentleman concluded by calling
<lb/>
upon gentlemen opposite to act independently<lb/>
and fearlessly upon this question - their duty<lb/>
to their constituents should be their considera<lb break="no"/>tion - that to the Government was only secon<lb break="no"/>dary. He would rather always remain in op<lb break="no"/>position than be a slave to any Government.<lb/>
