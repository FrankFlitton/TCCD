regretted <br />
it exceedingly as he thought his presence there, <br />
and the beneﬁt of his experience would be of <br />
great value to the deliberations of that body. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> would not press the matter
any further, as <br />
the Prov. Sec. had stated that it would be dis- <br />
tasteful to the feelings of his Excellency, and <br />
he would therefore withdraw his motion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. PROV. SEC. trusted that the hon.
gentle- <br />
man would withdraw his motion, and not put <br />
the Government in the unpleasant position of <br />
having to vote against it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. ARCHIBALD expressed his regret to
hear <br />
the statement made by the Prov. Sec., that his <br />
Excellency had expressed his unwillingness to <br />
be connected with the Council of Public In- <br />
struction. He looked upon his presence there <br />
as a matter of greatimportanee, but after what <br />
the Prov. Sec. had stated, the member for <br />
Kings had done right in withhrawing his mo <br />
tion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BLANCHARD moved that the bill be re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committed</span> for the purpose of
striking out cer- <br />
tain clauses relating to the City of Halifax, a re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">solution had</span>
been placed in his
hands which had <br />
been passed by the City Council by a vote of 10 <br />
to 5, and altho he did not agree with it in all its <br />
points, he thought the house ought to pay pro- <br />
per respect to the voice of the City as heard <br />
through its representatives. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. gentleman read the resolution
from <br />
the City Council as follows:— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “Resolved, That that portion of the
school bill <br />
which specially relates to the City of Halifax <br />
is arbitrary in the principle of compulsory <br />
assessment, and is inapplicable to the circum- <br />
stances of the City of Halifax,—and<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
this <br />
Council representing the various wards of the <br />
City protest against its passage through the <br />
Legislature.” <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> When it was considered that the City <br />
Council, elected by the citizens and repre- <br />
senting their interests were refused power <br />
by the house to tax the people for the pur- <br />
chase of what they considered valuable <br />
property, it was no wonder that they com- <br />
plained that the power of taxation for <br />
the erection of school houses, should be <br />
taken away from them, and vested in irres- <br />
ponsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commissioners.</span> He would
ask the <br />
house whether they were prepared to place in <br />
the hands of those men uncontrolled powers <br />
to tax the people for the erection of school <br />
houses in each ward of the city. Not only <br />
was this objectionable feature in the bill, but <br />
the necessary consequence of the passage of <br />
these clauses would be the establishment of <br />
separate schools in the City of Halifax. There <br />
were two denominations prepared to come in <br />
and take advantage of these clauses in the <br />
bill, the Episcopalians and the Roman Catholics <br />
—and there were no other
denominations in a <br />
position to do so. He did not wish to make <br />
any invidious remarks in reference to these <br />
two denominations. It was greatly to their <br />
credit that they had erected handsome school <br />
houses, but that was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no</span> reason <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why </span>they <br />
should come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> and monopolize
the public <br />
moneys to the exclusion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span>
other bodies. <br />
He did not see why the city should be placed <br />
upon a different footing from the rest of the <br />
province, and why <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should be</span> allowed to <br />
elect its own Trustees, with uncontrolled pow- <br />
ers of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation.</span> As <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he before remarke</span>d the <br />
taxation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">city</span> was
increasing to an <br />
alarming extent, and he was surprise at the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> silence of the representatives for the
city, who <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> more immediately interested
in the sub- <br />
ject.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. SHANNON said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the hon. mem- <br />
ber for Inverness seemed anxious that his own <br />
constituents and the people far away should <br />
be taxed, and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself</span>
escape. Now, as re- <br />
gards the position of the city of Halifax, they <br />
had had a law on the statute book for years <br />
which had never been carried out; and his ob- <br />
ject was to get a law that could be carried out. <br />
This bill had been for sometime before the <br />
house <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and the</span> country, and where
were the pe- <br />
titions from the city against it? Not one. It <br />
was true that the City Council were now mov- <br />
ing in the matter, but they did not object to <br />
any particular clause of the bill, their resolu- <br />
tion is against the whole bill. If they had said <br />
they objected to the mode of appointment of <br />
trustees, he could have understood them, but <br />
they went against the whole principle of assess- <br />
ment. He could not understand the force of <br />
the remarks of the member for Inverness <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as
to</span>
<br />
separate schools. The congregation of St. <br />
Luke’s had an admirable school house. If an <br />
arrangement could be made with them—not to <br />
hand over the school monies to the Dean and <br />
Chapter, but to get them to hand over the <br />
school house to the Council of Public Instruc- <br />
tion for a free school, he did not see what ob- <br />
jection there could be; and so with the Roman <br />
Catholics, who were about erecting a handsome <br />
school house, and so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the
National school, <br />
and others in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
wards; if they could <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obtained no</span> great necessity
would exist for <br />
taxation for the erection of school houses. He <br />
was not at all afraid of this bugbear of separ- <br />
ate schools—raised by the member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In-</span>
<br />
verness. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 1537 2377 2676 3503">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BLANCHARD denied that he made any <br />
such statement as that his constituents might <br />
be taxed, while the citizens of Halifax should <br />
go free. He said that taxation was heavy <br />
enough already, in Halifax, and he was not <br />
willing to give uncontrolled powers to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persons</span>
<br />
responsible to nobody. He was not afraid to <br />
give his constituents power to tax <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves,</span>
<br />
but the member for Halifax appeared to be so. <br />
The hon. gentleman says this idea of separate <br />
schools is only a bug-bear; and he talks about <br />
St. Luke’s, and the Roman Catholics handing <br />
their school houses over to the Council of <br />
Public Instruction. Does anybody <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span>
<br />
that the Dean and Chapter of St. Luke’s <br />
would hand over their handsome school <br />
houses, without retaining the power to control <br />
the school? or that the Roman Catholics <br />
would hand over theirs without retaining <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointment</span> of the teachers? He
thought not. <br />
If they were going to have separate schools, <br />
let them say so at once; but don’t let it be <br />
done in such an underhand way. <br />
