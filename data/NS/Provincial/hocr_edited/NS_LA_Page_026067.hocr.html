<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> portions of Sister Colonies, yet in all
the real<br />
elements of wealth and prosperity they<br />
compare with little Nova Scotia, but as<br />
poorhouse giants; but notwithstanding it<br />
is so, the Provincial Secretary takes this
Pro-<br />
vince—rish as the rarest jewel—peopled with<br />
industrious, enterprising and spirited
men, and <br />
goes on a trading voyage to Canada and bar-<br />
gains it off acre for acre and man for man
with<br />
the acres and habitants of Canada. He does<br />
more. He does worse—he comes back boast-<br />
ing what he has done and of his great
states-<br />
manship. Let me, sir, tell the House that
sto-<br />
ry of a conceited coxcomb who, making love<br />
to a lady, in the pauses of a dance,
placed his<br />
hand on his heart, and with considerable
dis-<br />
tortion of features, said—"if this is not
love <span style="font-style: italic;">I<br />
feel</span>,
what is it?" "My dear sir," said the<br />
lady, "it must be something that <span style="font-style: italic;">bites</span> you."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Now our Provincial Secretary in his trading<br />
voyage got badly <span style="font-style: italic;">bitten</span> in
his bargain, and <br />
mistakes the <span style="font-style: italic;">bite</span> of the
Canadians for states-<br />
manship. Let me add that too on many occa-<br />
sions I think the hon. gentleman acts "just <br />
as the maggot bites," and mistakes the <br />
feeling for the impulses and inspirations of<br />
statesmanship.</p>











































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I have spoken of our prosperity—of the in-<br />
come from the various branches of industry—<br />
the extent of our fisheries, and the value
of<br />
our mines; and it may be claimed that one
of <br />
the advantages that will arise from this
Union<br />
will be the development of these
resources, by<br />
giving us extended trade and commerce. We <br />
have heard a great deal of the powers of
par-<br />
liament, of legislative enactments, but
there is<br />
one thing that is almost beyond the
control of<br />
such enactments—that is, the divergence of<br />
trade from its natural channels.  We have<br />
had in fish, coal, and those articles which<br />
are our chief products, free trade with
the <br />
other colonies, and what has been enlarged?<br />
If you turn to the imports of Canada—to<br />
the free goods—you will see the result.
Nova<br />
Scotia, which, from her natual position<br />
and resources, is especially prepared to
sup-<br />
ply upon very advantageous terms, gypsum, <br />
coal, fish, and stone,— to what extent
would <br />
you suppose Nova Scotia supplies Canda<br />
with these? I find the total import of coal<br />
into Canda is estimad at $936,239, and of<br />
this amount Great Britain supplies
$379,703,<br />
and the United States, to which we export<br />
largely, $548,846, leaving the total
amount im-<br />
ported from the Province of Nova Scotia
into<br />
Canada, where it goes as free as air, only<br />
$7,690. Again, take the article of gypsum.<br />
Even six times more of this article is
imported<br />
from the United States than from the
British<br />
American Colonies. Again, of fish, which we<br />
export so largely to the United States,
Canada<br />
only recieved from  the whole British
North <br />
American Colonies to the value of $226,573,<br />
while she gets from the United States,
$281,023.<br />
We export stone, in abundance, to the
United <br />
States, but not a dollar's worth to
Canada. I <br />
have enumerated these articles to show
that,<br />
having in them free trade among these colo-<br />
nies, we send but a small value of them to
the<br />
colonies with which it is proposed to
confede-<br />
rate us.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It had been urged that as this is a
Maritime<br />
Colony, Confederation would open up a valu-</p>  able field of commerce to our shippin. It is</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 360 466 1487 762">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">absurd to suppose that confederation would<br />
give us any advantages we do not now enjoy,<br />
or that our shipping interest can depend for<br />
employment upon a country whose waters are <br />
closed for five months of the year. Nearly<br />
the whole trade of Canada is supplied by the <br />
accidents of commerce; that is, when a vessel<br />
cannot get a charter she would like, and being <br />
perhaps in a coal port, she takes a cargo of coal<br />
to Canada, and returns with lumber to some<br />
other port where she finds more profitable em-<br />
ployment. And it is by accidents arising like<br />
this, in various ports, the whole wants of the<br />
trade of Canada are supplied. It is an entire<br />
fallacy to say that by opening the whole trade<br />
of these colonies, we should receive great ad-<br />
vantages in Nova Scotia. Confederation, in-<br />
stead of extending the commerce and deve-<br />
loping the natual products of this country,<br />
will rather cripple trade. I have already<br />
shown that Confederation must necessarily<br />
impose upon us a very heavy tariff and ex-<br />
ceedingly large burthens. The consequences<br />
of that is, to increase the coast of living and<br />
producing the articles of export, and when<br />
you increase the coast of living and of wages,<br />
you are unable to compete with other countries<br />
in the sale of your coal and fish, and other<br />
articles which Nova Scotia is especially calcu-<br />
lated to produce. It is claimed again that we<br />
shall get the Inetrcolonial Railway by Con-<br />
federation.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Provincial Secretary told us we got it on<br />
terms never dreamed of. I have looked on <br />
these terms and summarized them, just as the<br />
hon. member for South Clochester did the in-<br />
dications of war, and the conslusion I have<br />
come to is, that the Provincial Secretary was<br />
right in his expression. 1st. <span style="font-style: italic;">We surrender the<br />
entire control of the constitution of this country.</span><br />
2nd. We endanger the harmony existing <br />
amoung us as fellow-colonists by<span style="font-style: italic;"> bringing our<br />
diverse interests into conflict. </span>3rd. <span style="font-style: italic;">We reduce <br />
our local expenditures for roads and bridges to a<br />
large amount, or supply that deficiency by direct<br />
taxation.</span> 4th. <span style="font-style: italic;">We subject ourselves to the annoy-<br />
ance and tax of the stamp act. </span>5th. We surren-<br />
der to Canada <span style="font-style: italic;">the power to tax us to any extent<br />
that their extravagance may render necessary</span>;<br />
and which I have shown you will be in the<br />
outset $782,560. 6th. <span style="font-style: italic;">We must pay our propor-<br />
tion of all expenses entered into by the general <br />
government</span>. I have shown you some of the<br />
new expenses which are incident on the first<br />
formation of this government; but it is not to<br />
be supposed that the engagements entered <br />
into by the general government will rest here.<br />
We have been told that one of the conditions<br />
upon which the Canadians agreed to build the<br />
intercolonial railway was that they should<br />
have western extension and enlargement of<br />
their canals. You will understand that the<br />
Canadians find that their canals are not an-<br />
swering their anticipation. The returns of<br />
1864 show that there has been a large decrease<br />
in the earning of the Welland and St. Law-<br />
rence canals. In the Welland there is a de-<br />
crease of 12 3/4 per cent., and in the St. Lawrence<br />
canals 33 per cent. In the report of the Com-<br />
missioner of Public Work he says, to make<br />
them remunerative they must be enlarged to<br />
allow the passage of vessels 800 to 850 tons<br />
burthen; which will require an enormous ex-<br />
penditure, as they have now a depth of water <br />
of only about nine feet deep. Now, the en-<br />
largement of these canals, and the opening up<br />
