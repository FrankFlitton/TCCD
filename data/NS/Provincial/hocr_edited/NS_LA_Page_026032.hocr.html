<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In view of this changed aspect of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span> <br />
then, was it much to be wondered at that <br />
British statesmen should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span>
these colonies <br />
with very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> feelings <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> those which <br />
animated them at the period I referred to. <br />
There is another reason, too, why Great Britain <br />
should regard the British North American <br />
Colonies in a different light than when she <br />
lost the thirteen colonies in 1783. At that time <br />
they formed almost the whole of her colonial <br />
possessions. It was not until 5 years after the <br />
peace of 1783 that the ﬁrst colonist set
his foot <br />
in Australia. Now we ﬁnd in that country no <br />
less than six distinct governments, with the <br />
dimensions of European kingdoms, and with <br />
the revenues of principalities. New Zealand, <br />
was then untrodden by the foot of the white <br />
man. It is now a confederacy of colonies. <br />
The British possessions in South Africa have <br />
swollen from a port and a town to an enor- <br />
mous colony. The 150 millions of British India <br />
(formerly governed by native princes, or a <br />
commercial company,) are now under the direct <br />
rule of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queen of</span> England. At
that time <br />
Canada West was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> wilderness, a
few trap- <br />
pers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> fur traders being her
sole white po- <br />
pulation. Now we ﬁnd scattered over the <br />
globe, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">over</span> thirty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonies</span> of the British <br />
Empire, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all,</span> more or less,
involving the <br />
Parent Country in responsibilities ; all <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">draining,</span> more or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less, the</span> national Exche- <br />
quer. Is it to be wondered at then, that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in view</span> of the altered
circumstances of the <br />
times, Englishmen should begin to think that <br />
the time had arrived when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> was
the duty of <br />
the colonies to assume some responsibility and <br />
to relieve the mother country of, at all events, <br />
some portion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">burden</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> their defence. <br />
This feeling would be found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
pervade every <br />
debate that had taken place on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject
in</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the British</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament.</span> As long ago as 1858, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when Mr.</span> Gladstone was examined
before a <br />
committee of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> of
Commons, on the <br />
subject of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defences, he</span> declared <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> had come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when the</span> colonies, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> privileges of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freemen</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which
were</span> <br />
accorded to them, must be prepared <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
bear a <br />
large share of the burdens and responsibilities <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of freemen.</span> That declaration had
been repeat- <br />
ed over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and over</span> again in his
public speeches <br />
in and out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of parliament,</span> and
not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> by Mr. <br />
Gladstone, but by public men<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> of all
shades <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> </span><br />
politics, and by the press without
distinction. <br />
Not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only
had this</span> opinion been expressed, but <br />
it had to a large extent been acted upon, and <br />
at this moment the entire military expenditure <br />
af lndia has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thrown</span> upon
her own re- <br />
sources, while the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">policy was about</span>
be- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing applied to New</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Zealand. </span>Not only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is this</span> <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case,</span> but for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several</span> years despatch after <br />
despatch has been sent from the colonial ofﬁce <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada, informing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">her</span> that the time had <br />
arrived for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonies </span>to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wake </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up
to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
necessity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relieving</span> the
mother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> <br />
from at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the
burden</span> of their <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defence.</span> That while <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exercising the</span> rights and </span></span><br />
privileges of freeman, they must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also </span>assume <br />
the responsibilities and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duties</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> that <br />
position involved. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>
think, therefore, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <br />
no one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> question the fact
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> arrived <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>
change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> about to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span>  <br />
place in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attitude </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">towards</span> her <br />
colonies; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that, whatever</span> we
may think of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter, her statesmen</span> had
arrived at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
conclusion, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span>
we should </span></span><br />
share,</span>
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> extent, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">military
expendi-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ture</span> which our connexion with her
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entails.</span> <br />

refer, for a moment, to the observa- <br />

tions made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> a recent debate
in the British <br />
parliament by a statesman<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> of
the highest <br />
character, and who occupies a position entire- <br />
ly independent of the government of the day. <br />
Lord Derby, in alluding to the present position <br />
occupied by the colonies, said:<br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> l will ask hon. members to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recall</span> to themselves the <br />
state of North America when we met in this house <br />
four years ago. That portion of the world was then <br />
divided among what we may call three great Powers <br />—ﬁrst, the United States of America; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secondly, Ca-</span>
<br />
nada, and the settlements and dependencies belong- <br />
ing to our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sovereign ;</span> and,
thirdly, Mexico, a <br />
country which certainly did not possess much politi- <br />
cal power, but which in extent, resources, fertility <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
soil, and mineral wealth was almost unequaled in the <br />
world. In every one of these three divisions there <br />
have been immense changes. In the United States a <br />
civil war has raged for four years, and even if that <br />
war should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">termina e,</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />the hon. member for Brad- <br />
ford <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggests,</span> I cannot believe
that we shall see the <br />
same society and form of Government established, or <br />
even, if the form be the same, certainly the spirit will <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be </span>altered, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed before</span> the civil war
commenced. <br />
(Hear.)<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It is</span>
quite clear. then, it is impossible to know what <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> ought to consider <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not to morrow</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span> <br />

general sentiment of England. <br />
The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very fact</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">armies</span> existing upon <br />
our borders, which to all appearances <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span>

nation, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in </span>itself
sufﬁcient grounds to war- <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">For</span> however <br />

therefore, I trust that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
day is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far distant</span> <br />
when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> present friendly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relations</span> between <br />
the two countries is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disturbed,</span>
it is impossible <br />
to ignore the fact that there are strong reasons <br />
