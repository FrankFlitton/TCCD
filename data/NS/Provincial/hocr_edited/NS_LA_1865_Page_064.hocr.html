<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">But we have not received justice in respect<br />
to the quality of the debt. Very nearly the<br />
whole of the debt of Nova Scotia has been
cre-<br />
ated by the construction of the Railway,
and we<br />
have been told time and again by those
dele-<br />
gates, that as soon as we get our railway
sys-<br />
tem completed, our road will be a paying<br />
property, and in reality be no debt at
all. It is<br />
very different with the debt of Canada. In
an-<br />
swer to a question put by the hon. member
for<br />
Halifax, the hon. Prov. Secy. laid on the
table<br />
a financial statement, containing the
debt, in-<br />
come, &amp;c., of Canada, issued by Mr.
Galt. At<br />
the dinner given last autumn to the
Canadian<br />
delegates, the hon. Prov. Secy. told us
Mr. <br />
Galt had the power of making a deficit of
a <br />
million apear a surplus of the amount.<br />
I must confess, looking at the paper
before me,<br />
there is a great deal of truth in that
remark.—<br />
In this balance-sheet we find the whole
liabili-<br />
ties of Canada are put down at
$176,223,066.65.<br />
This, however, is so balanced, even to the
last<br />
five cents, that we are almost led to
believe<br />
that Canada in reality does not owe a
dollar.<br />
But on an examination, I find to make that
ba-<br />
lance they have put down at cost and
accumu-<br />
lated interest all the public buildings,
bridges,<br />
roads, harbors, lighthouses, canals,
railroads,<br />
&amp;c., of the country. Now, if we were
to put a <br />
valuation upon all onr roads and bridges,
our<br />
public buoldings, Chubenacadie and St.
Peter's<br />
Canals, Arisaig Pier, Parsboro Snag, and
simi-<br />
lar property, we should far overbalance
all our<br />
indebtedness, without touching the
railroads.<br />
I have examined the financial returns of
Ca-<br />
nada, to see the actual net income of the
pro-<br />
perty claimed in this balance-sheet, and I
find<br />
the net income from over seventy millions<br />
of it is only $471,461, which represents <br />
a capital of less than eight millions, <br />
leaving about 62,000,000 dollars from which<br />
no available profits are derived. The
princi-<br />
pal sources from which any income is
derived<br />
is from the Canals and Municipalities, We<br />
have the Railways put down for loans and
in-<br />
terests unpaid at something like
$30,000,000. It<br />
will be perhaps in the knowledge of the
House<br />
that in 1857 the Grand Trunk Company came<br />
to the Canadian Parliament and said: We
can-<br />
not proceed further, and we wish you to
give<br />
up your claim on out lines—just as the
Shube-<br />
nacadie Canal people asked us to give up
our<br />
lien on the undertaking. The Legislature,
in-<br />
stead of giving up the claim entirely,
consented<br />
to give up the first lien and allow new
share-<br />
holders to come in,— the province, then,
to hold<br />
the third position. In consequence of this
ar-<br />
rangement, no interest is paid, and the
accu-<br />
mulation is now $9,642,000. Anybody who<br />
knows anything of the management of these<br />
great public companies will perceive, that
<br />
after working expenses and the interest to
the <br />
first two sets of bondholders are paid,
the Go-<br />
vernment will never receive a cent of
interest<br />
upon its loan. Again, there is the
Municipal <br />
Loan Fund debt, amounting in principal and<br />
interest ot $12,890,837—very much of which<br />
has been fruitful of the greatest possible
po-<br />
litical corruption, and will never prove an<br />
available asset. Some of the municipalities<br />
have borrowed nearly $300 per head of the<br />
population or interest. The town of Port
Hope, <br />
with a population of 4,160, borrowed
$740,000,<br />
and had arrears of interest Dec. 31st,
1861, of<br />
$312,303. The town of Niagara, with 2,070
in-<br />
</p>
</div>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_3" title="bbox 355 500 1494 2323">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">habitants, borrowed $280,000, and owed for<br />
interests $148,974. I hold in my hand a list of <br />
seven municipal cities, conatining 40,600 in-<br />
habitants, who have received from this fund<br />
$5,594,400, and owed as arrears of interest<br />
Dec. 31st, 1861, $2,359,406—together nearly<br />
eight million dollars—the amount Nova Scotia<br />
is to be permitted to owe on going into Con-<br />
federation.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It is therefore evident that very little can be<br />
counted upon from the municipalities. It is to<br />
be supposed, however, that there is in this ba-<br />
lance sheet some property that is profitable. <br />
The whole amount of the liabilities are put<br />
down at $76,223,061. They claim funds imme-<br />
diately available to reduce this to $67,500,000,<br />
five millions more than Canada is to enter the<br />
Confederation with. This five millions the lo-<br />
cal government of Canada are to assume,—<br />
but with the debt are to have the property re-<br />
presented by it. Hon. George Brown, speak-<br />
ing of this arrangement, says very disticntly,—<br />
and there is a clause in the report of the dele-<br />
gates authorizing it—that the local govern-<br />
ments of Upper and Lower Canada are to take<br />
this available property—as an offset to the<br />
debts that they are called upon to assume.<br />
Now it is not reasonable to assume that Upper<br />
and Lower Canada, whose public men are so<br />
astute, will take liabilities that have no income.<br />
They will select the best they can.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. ARCHIBALD—They have no power to <br />
make the selection.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCLELAN—I will read, in corroboration<br />
of my statement, the 58th clause of the consti-<br />
tution,—"All assets connected with such por-<br />
tions of the public debt of any Provinces as are<br />
assumed by the local governments, shall also<br />
belong to those governments respectively."<br />
These local governments will not assume any<br />
debt unless there is an asset connected with it.<br />
I will also tell you what hon. George Brown of<br />
Canada says:—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"But Mr. Speaker, I am told that the ar-<br />
rangement as the debt is unfair—that we<br />
have thrown on the Federal exchequer the<br />
whole of the debts of the Maritime Provinces,<br />
and only a portion of the debt of Canada. There<br />
is not a particple of force in this objection. The<br />
whole debt of Canada is $67,500,000, but five<br />
millions of this is due to our own people, to<br />
meet which there are certain local funds. Now<br />
if we had thrown the whole $67,500,000 on the <br />
Federal treasury, we must also have handed<br />
over to it the local revenues which, so far as<br />
these five millions are concerned, would have<br />
been precisely the same thing. But as regards<br />
the public debt with thich the Federal govern-<br />
ment would start, it would not have been the<br />
same thing. By restricting the debt of Canada<br />
to $62,500,000, we restricted the debt of the Ma-<br />
ritime Provinces to the same proportion on $25<br />
per head of their population; but had we thrown<br />
our whole debt of sixty-seven and a half mil-<br />
lions on the Confederation, the proportion must<br />
have been increased, and the whole debt very<br />
greatly augmented."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. delegates cry "Hear, hear," but I<br />
believe every gentleman present hears enough<br />
to convince him that the Canadians are to take<br />
five millions worth of available property with<br />
the debts they are to assume, leaving the ba-<br />
lance, $62,500,000, comparatively worthless.</p>
