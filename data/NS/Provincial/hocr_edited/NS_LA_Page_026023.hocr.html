increase the number of men or the<br />

lieve that Union will rapidly increase our<br />
population. I believe that the moral force that <br />
would be given to the whole of British North<br />
America by a common union if her interests,<br />
would be such as I have stated before - to en-<br />
sure not only the safety, but the peace of the <br />
country.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assuming
that you are to reject a union on <br />
the ground that we are defenceless, what is our <br />
position? You are likely to be overwhelmed<br />
without a struggle, or, in the language of Mr. <br />
Howe, - without an Intercolonial Railway, or<br />
the means of communication with Quebec, the <br />
inhabitants of Nova Scotia would have to beg<br />
permission to haul down their own flag. Hu-<br />
miliating as is such a statement every man<br />
man knows that it is true, and how useless it<br />
would be for Nova Scotia to undertake any re-<br />
sistance. At the present, those who assail<br />
Nova Scotia in its isolated position, would only<br />
attack 350,000. but, with British America<br />
united, whoever put a hostile foot upon our<br />
1000 miles of sea coast would assail nearly four<br />
millions of freemen, sustained by the mightiest<br />
power in the world.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">THE
POSITION OF THE OPPONENTS OF UNION<br />
ON THE DEFVNCE QUESTION.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I will now turn the attention of the house
for<br />
a single moment to the fact that, on this ques-<br />
tion of defence the opponents of Union have<br />
felt that it was so important that questions of <br />
tariff and expenditure sank into insignificance,<br />
and that it was aobsolutely necessary that some<br />
means should be given to a free and intelligent<br />
people, by which their rights and liberties<br />
should be secured. I regret to state that a lea-<br />
ding journal in this country changed its opi-<br />
nions, and for the first time in the history of<br />
the Province, this question of Intercolonial<br />
Union was endeavored to be made one of party,<br />
and that party influences and prejudices were<br />
awakened in order to excite hostility against<br />
the Government, and prevent the people of<br />
this Province accepting the proposed Union. - <br />
They felt, however, that it was necessary, on a <br />
question so important as that of defence, that<br />
we should do somethingm, and accordingly they <br />
propounded to the people of this country their<br />
scheme, by which they would protect British <br />
North America. In the Mouring Chronicle of <br />
Jan. 18, 1865, you read:-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"We would provide for the defence of the
Em-<br />
pire by a general tax equally levied by an Imper-<br />
ial statute all over the Empire. This might be <br />
either a tax on property, on polls, or on im-<br />
ports, to take precedence, of all other taxes, and to<br />
be paid into the Imperial treasury. About £28,<br />
000,000 are annually required for naval and<br />
military expenditure. Taking the population<br />
of the Empire, including the Eastern Provin-<br />
ces and dependencies, at 300,000,000, 2s. per<br />
head sterling would provide the whole sum re-<br />
quired. A property tax, if that were preferred, <br />
would raise the whole amount. But if it was <br />
thought better to collect the £28,000,000 upon<br />
imports, the commerce of the Empire would yield<br />
the whole without any portion of it feeling the <br />
burthen."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">When I am told that our scheme of union<br />
would involve increasing the burthens upon the<br />
people of this country - that a yard of cotton<br />
might cost one cent more than it does now, -<br />
and that it was a reason why we should not</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have union with all its advantages - an Inter-<br />
colonial Railway, expanded commerce, the de-<br />
velopment of manufactures, and intercommu-<br />
nion between 4,000,000 of British North Ameri-<br />
cans. When I am told this I think I have a <br />
right to ask the people of this country to ex-<br />
amine this scheme that is propounded on the <br />
great question of national defence by the oppo-<br />
nents of Confederation and compare it with<br />
that offered for your acceptance by the Quebec<br />
Conference. Then, I think, you will say that<br />
any charge of increased taxation that has been<br />
insinuated - the most extravagant estimate<br />
made of the cost, the scheme of the Quebec <br />
Conference is entirely thrown into the shade.<br />
I need not call attention to the disgraceful pro-<br />
posal that is made to a free people in the arti-<br />
cle I have just read. If I had not the evidence<br />
here it would have almost seemed incredible<br />
that such a proposition could have been made<br />
in this century to a free and intelligent people, <br />
that nay body of loyal men could propound<br />
the repetition of a policy that lost England her<br />
finest Colonies nearly a century ago. I believe I<br />
would be doing a gross injustice to the free spirit<br />
of this country if I were to suppose that even<br />
connection with the crown of England would be<br />
sufficient to induce the people of this country<br />
to allow an Imperial Statute to lay an Imperi-<br />
al tax upon us to go into the Imperial treasury.<br />
Deeply as the people value their institutions - <br />
and greatly attached as they are to the mother<br />
country, - yet the free spirit of this country<br />
would revolt at such a proposition as led to the <br />
independence of the old colonies nearly a <br />
hundred years ago. Let me suppose that the<br />
independent spirit of the people should be so<br />
trampled-down as to induce them to submit to<br />
taxation by an Imperial statute - what then?<br />
This article says:-</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"A property tax, if that were preferred, would<br />
raise the whole amount. But if it was thought<br />
better to collect the </span>£28,000,000 upon imports,<br />
the commerce of the Empire would yield the<br />
whole without any portion of it feeling the burthen.<br />
Is there a Novascotian that would not pay his<br />
portion of this tex cheerfully, and turn out,<br />
with arms in his hands, to defend the Empire<br />
besides? Is there one who will not cherrfully<br />
pay pound for pound with the Canadians, or<br />
with his fellow subjects in any other part of <br />
the Queen's dominions? Here is a scheme of <br />
National Defense, of which a statesman need<br />
not be ashamed, and our public men could not <br />
be much better employed than in pressing it on <br />
the notice of Her Majesty's Government."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Here you have the doctrine laid down that <br />
we should provide twenty-eight million pounds<br />
sterling for the maintenance of the Army and<br />
Navy of Great Britain. To tax a man in Hali-<br />
fax or Cape Breton the same that a man in <br />
London and Manchester is taxed for the sup-<br />
port of an Army and Navy, over whose acts<br />
we have no control, and in the imposition of <br />
which taxation we have no voice.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">But the glaring mistake into which this<br />
Mentor of the people of Nova Scotia has fallen,<br />
as to the population who would hear this<br />
taxation, shows how unfit he is to guide public<br />
opinion. It would be difficult to find a Nova <br />
Scotian that would consent to so humiliating <br />
a proposition as that. The publlic man who<br />
would press it upon the attention of the Impe-<br />
rial Government would soon find himself dri-<br />
ven from public life, and bring upon himself</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">the execration of every free man in this coun-<br />
