<p> triotism of New Brunswick, (as we would<br />
that of Nova Scotia,) if we doubted that at an<br />
decision. I trust we will at an early day see<br />
reaction on the part of the public men of that<br />
province that will place this question in an en-<br />
tirely different aspect. I believe that this hos-<br />
tile action on the part of New Brunswick is <br />
most deeply to be deplored in the interests of <br />
all B. N. A I regret, however, to say that a <br />
large amount of hostility has also been excited<br />
in various sections of Nova Scotia in res-<br />
pect to this question, and the petitions<br />
which are now on the table would render<br />
it exceedingly difficult for any government<br />
to ask an immediate decision, but whilst there<br />
has been a vast amount of energy, exhibited - <br />
whilst thousands of people have been induced<br />
to petition this Legislative on this ques-<br />
tion of Confederation a comparatively small<br />
number of these petitions have pronounc-<br />
ed against Confederation. There are not 3000<br />
persons in the entire Province who say they <br />
are opposed to the proposed Confederation,<br />
notwithstanding the scheme has been misre-<br />
presented, and arguments of the most falla-<br />
cious character used against it - and that party<br />
influences have been thrown largely into the <br />
scale - although the attempt has been made to<br />
induce people to oppose it by petitions largely<br />
circulated, the majority of the petitioners who<br />
are here state that they are not prepared to<br />
say whether it would be good or for evil,<br />
that we should have Confederation and ask<br />
the House to pause before irrevocably commit-<br />
tin itself to what would be, I believe, for <br />
the advantage of the country. I believe<br />
that atan early day, these parties having<br />
been fully informed on the subject, will be<br />
prepared to come hence by tens of thou-<br />
sands, and ask the Legislature to consummate<br />
this scheme of Union. I tremble, sir, when I<br />
think of the results that the action of these<br />
Provinces may have upon the public mind in<br />
England - that the steps which are in progress<br />
for the security and defence of British North<br />
America may be interfered with and by<br />
the fact that in presence of a great danger,<br />
these Provinces have permitted that isolation<br />
to continue which can only lead to connection<br />
with the American Republic, and opposed that<br />
consolidation which in co-opperation with the<br />
power which England was prepared to put<br />
forth, would give us security and avert the <br />
peril that is now so imminent.<br />
</p>
<p>The scheme devised at Quebec has passed<br />
through the most trying of ordeals triumphant-<br />
ly - after being submitted to the closest exami-<br />
nation by the press of England, it has come<br />
out with enconiums such as no scheme ever<br />
devised by any body of public men has ever<br />
received before. It has secured the approbation<br />
of the most intelligent and influential section<br />
of the press of British America. It has been <br />
adopted in Canada by both branches of the<br />
Legislature with an unanimity such as reflects<br />
the highest honor on the patriotism and the<br />
intelligence of that country. In New Bruns-<br />
wick, P. E. Island, and Nova Scotia, it has en-<br />
listed the support of almost the entire religious<br />
press of the country, as also that of the most<br />
intelligent and independent of the secular<br />
press. Having obtained the support and co-<br />
operation of the leading and most influential<br />
public men in the different provinces - of the<br />
great bulk of the intelligence, wealth, and in-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">fluence of the country, it is placed in a posi-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">tion which gives to this house and country,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">and to all British North America the best</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">guarantee that in a little time, when it has</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">been fully examined and discussed, all classes</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">will vie with each other in bringing about the</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">adoption of a constitutional change so neces-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">sary and advantageous to all.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">UNION OF THE MARITIME PROVINCES.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I have stated in the outset that a Legislative<br />
Union of the Maritime Provinces is desir-<br />
able in case we are Confederated. and <br />
and still more indispensible in case we are not<br />
to be at once united with Canada. Under these<br />
circumstances have I moved the resolution<br />
which I now hold in my hand. I can only say <br />
that if gentlemen will examine the remarks I <br />
made in this house last winter they will find<br />
that I considered the Union of the Maritime<br />
Provinces was one of the most important<br />
means to secure a union of all British North <br />
America, and most desirable in such a con-<br />
tingency. There are gentlement present both<br />
inside and outside of these benches - who were<br />
connected with the delegation to Quebec - who<br />
will bear m out in the assertion that I always<br />
advocated the lesser union in that light. And<br />
at the very moment when I prepared to<br />
concur with the rest of the delegates from the <br />
Maritime Provinces in adjourning the question<br />
of the smaller union until the larger question<br />
had been considered, I advocated the former<br />
as almost as essential and important if we<br />
remained out. The whole objection that is<br />
raised against the diminished importance and <br />
and expensiveness of the local governments <br />
and legislatures would under Confederation<br />
be swept away by a union of the Maritime<br />
provinces. Therefore, instead of bringing for-<br />
ward this question as a counter-proposition to<br />
theConfederation of British North America, I<br />
regard it to-night as I did a year ago, as an <br />
important and gret step towards securing<br />
that greater union - as a means of placing<br />
these Maritime provinces in a united and influ-<br />
ential position under Confederation than we<br />
would and P. E. Island, it is not for me to say. I<br />
may admit there was no prospect of getting<br />
Prince Edward Island into the proposed Leg-<br />
islative union, even if the Canadian deputation<br />
had not attended the conference at Charlotte-<br />
town. Gratified as I would have been to se<br />
P. E. Island form a portion of the great Con-<br />
federation, I did not regard their action either<br />
in respect to the smaller or greater union as a <br />
matter of vital concern at all. All that is neces-<br />
ary is that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick<br />
united as they are by every tie of common in-<br />
terests should be in a position to have that uni-<br />
on. Even if the larger union were impractica-<br />
ble and could never take place, still it is desir-<br />
able that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia<br />
should be unite. It would expand on trade<br />
advance our influence, and accomplish many<br />
of the same results and bring about advant-<br />
ages that would be received from the <br />
larger scheme of union, only in a smaller de-<br />
gree.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Having trespassed so long upon the patience <br />
of the House I will not occupy the attention of <br />
gentlemen longer than to express the hope<br />
that this resolution will meet with the concur-<br />
rence of this Legislature and of the Govern-<br />
