<span style="font-weight: bold;">Speech of Mr. Locke.</span></p>








<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LOCKE said :—As this question appears
to<br />
be entirely used up, I do not rise with
the hope of<br />
throwing any new light upon it, either
financi-<br />
ally—politically or otherwise, but having
presen-<br />
ted a number of petitions from my
constituents<br />
upon the subject, I feel that it is due to
them,<br />
as well as to myself, that I should offer
a few ob-<br />
servations, in explanation of the course I
intend <br />
to take.</p>
























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It will be in the recollection of the
House, that<br />
at the last sessions, a resolution was
passed, au-<br />
thorizing a conference to be held between
Dele-<br />
gates from this Province, and New
Brunswick,<br />
and Prince Edward Island, on the subject
of a <br />
Union of the Maritime Provinces. In
accordance<br />
with that resolution, the Delegates
proceeded to<br />
Charlottetown, and after deliberating for
a day—<br />
in an incredibly short space of time, they
came to<br />
the conclusion, that a Union of the Lower
Pro-<br />
vinces was impracticable, and they
admitted into<br />
the conference a number of gentleman from
Cana-<br />
da, who speedily indoctrinated them with
their<br />
views upon the question of the larger
Union of all<br />
the Provinces. The result was that our
Delegates<br />
returned to Halifax, and immediately
proceeded to<br />
Quebec. Now sir before going any further,
I <br />
should like to ask these gentlemen upon
what<br />
principle they received these Canadian
Delegates<br />
at all. They were only authorized to
confer upon<br />
the subject of a Union of the Lower
Provinces,<br />
and yet by some means or other, they
appear to <br />
have lost sight of that altogether, and to
have<br />
been led entirely by the opinions of the
gentlemen<br />
from Canada.</p>























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Now sir, I do not intend to reflect upon
the con-<br />
duct of the Delegates. I have too much
respect for<br />
the honor and integrity of the public men
of this<br />
Country to impute to them interested
motives,<br />
and I have no doubt that in taking the
course<br />
they did, they acted in a way which they
believed<br />
was for the best interests of the
Province; we must<br />
suppose, taking a charitable view of the
case, they<br />
erred in judgment. I do not question their
consti-<br />
tutional right to proceed to Quebec, and
take part in<br />
the Conference which was there held—because
the<br />
members of a Government possess the power<br />
to deal as they think best, with the
interests of<br />
the country they are called upon to
govern, but<br />
when men possess power it is not always
advisa-<br />
ble to exercise it arbitrarily, and
therefore as a <br />
matter of policy, and in view of the
expressed<br />
feeling of this House, I think it would
have been<br />
better for the Government to have obtained
the<br />
sanction of the House, before they entered
upon the<br />
consideration of the larger question of
the Confede-<br />
ration of these North American Provinces.
They<br />
did not however think proper to do so, and
we<br />
must therefore deal with the question as
we find it.<br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 372 499 1501 895">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The very first article of the Report of
the Que-<br />
bec Conference, recites as the groundwork, upon<br />
which a Union should take place, that it is advi-<br />
sable "provided it can be effected on principles<br />
just to the several provinces. Those concluding<br />
words contain the gist of the whole matter. I<br />
contend that the terms as arranged at the Con-<br />
ference are not "just to the several provinces"—<br />
more especially as regards Nova Scotia. I hold<br />
that in adopting the principle of representation<br />
by population, they have ignored other important<br />
interests of this Province, which are entitled to<br />
consideration. There are other matters to be<br />
considered besides mere blood and bones. There<br />
is the mining interest which contributes so largely<br />
to our provincial prosperity, there is the shipping<br />
interest, which as has been stated in this debate,<br />
is equal to one eighteenth of that possessed by<br />
the British Empire, and represents a capital of<br />
eight millions of dollars. Is that not an interest<br />
worth protecting and worthy of representation?<br />
Canada has nothing to compare with that. It is<br />
true that she has a large inland trade by means <br />
of her canals, but we cannot participate in the <br />
advantages to be derived from them. Then again<br />
there is a most important branch of industry, the<br />
fisheries, and in connection with that there is one<br />
part of the report which I cannot understand, and <br />
which I should like the hon. Prov. Sec. to ex-<br />
plain. I perceive that by a clause of the consti-<br />
tution, the general government are to have con-<br />
trol over the sea coast and inland fisheries, while<br />
by another clause the same power is given to the <br />
local government. The same thing occurs in re-<br />
ference to Agriculture and Emigration. Both<br />
Governments according to the terms agreed upon<br />
by the Delegates, are to have control over these<br />
subjects, and yet that can scarcely be possible. I <br />
can only  say that if the control of these impor-<br />
tant matters has been surrendered to the general<br />
Government, that our Delegates have shown but<br />
little regard for the best interests of the country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">By this principle of representation by
popu-<br />
lation, a very unfair advantage is given to Cana-<br />
da. Everybody knows that Emigration to that<br />
country is increasing every year, and as the re-<br />
presentation is by this scheme to be adjusted every<br />
ten years upon the basis of population, it follows<br />
that she will possess an unfair advantage over<br />
the Maritime Provinces, which do not offer the<br />
same inducements to Emigrants that she does. I<br />
believe that at the close of the first period of ten<br />
years, Upper Canada will have increased her<br />
population ten per cent, while our increase will<br />
not amount to more than five. It will be seen<br />
therefore that in this respect, the terms agreed <br />
upon are not just or equitable to the several Pro-<br />
vinces, and it appears as if the Delegates from <br />
this Province had entirely lost sight of what is <br />
manifestly an undue advantage conceded to <br />
Canada.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Then again on turning to the Report of the<br />
Delegates, I find that the general Government, is<br />
to have the control of trade and commerce, the<br />
imposition of excise and custom duties, and the<br />
control of railroads and canals. This latter clause<br />
is of the utmost importance to us. It is well<br />
known that the Canadians are anxious to extend<br />
