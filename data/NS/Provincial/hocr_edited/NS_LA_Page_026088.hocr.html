<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> railway. Can anybody hope, in the uncer-
<br />
tainties of the future, that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can
sell at par <br />
what we require this year? <br />
</span></p><p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>But not only are our sales affected by
the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uncertainties</span>
of the future; they must be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large-</span><br />
ly affected by the certainties of the liabilities <br />
we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heaping</span> on ourselves. We
have be— <br />
fore us a Bill to construct the St. Peter’s Ca- <br />
nal. This is variously estimated. Mr. Perley, <br />
who is the best Engineer out of the half-a-do- <br />
zen who have reported on it, put the cost at <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$170,000.</span> We have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appropriated,</span> this year, <br />
bonds at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$30,000,</span> which will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leave</span> a sum of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$140,000</span> to be provided <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-assuming</span> you <br />
could place any reliance on the estimate for a <br />
Canal. But as a rule, nothing can be more <br />
fallacious than such an estimate. A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span>
<br />
may be estimated. Any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span> on
the surface <br />
of the ground may be computed, but there is <br />
something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the nature of canal
operations <br />
which renders such computations unreliable. <br />
The Shubenacadie Canal was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimated</span>
at <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$250,000.</span> It cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$500,000,</span> and was then scarce- <br />
ly begun. It was subsequently made a pre- <br />
sent of to gentlemen who were deluded with <br />
the idea that it could be finished for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$40,000—by</span>
<br />
the amount of estimate by a competent Engi- <br />
neer. They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> accepted the fatal gift,
and spent <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000</span> to ﬁnd the work still
incomplete, and <br />
with all this money spent on it, it would be <br />
difficult to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> any other body
of gentlemen <br />
who would be willing to accept the thing as a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gift</span>. </span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The
Welland Canal was begun by a sub—<br />
scription of stock to the extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000.</span>
<br />
Before it ended the enormous sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$6,629,000</span>
<br />
was s<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pent</span> in its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction.</span>  I do not contend <br />
that the cases are paralel ; there were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circum-</span>
<br />
stances in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each</span> case to render
the works much <br />
more formidable that anything that is com- <br />
pleted at St. Peter’s ; but I refer to these in- <br />
stances, to shew the whole unreliability of <br />
canal estimates ; and I undertake to tell the <br />
house that nobody need expect to come out of <br />
this scheme under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000.</span> But
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern—</span> <br />
ment are determined to commit the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house
</span>to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it ; and</span> if so, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> may as well look the expense <br />
steadily in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the face,</span> and
prepare for it.  Let <br />
us then assume we have to raise the amount, <br />
how can it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done?  </span>By debentures alone ; <br />
and this will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throw into</span> the
market well on to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000</span> more of debentures. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Next we ﬁnd an additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liability</span> to be as- <br />
sumed for Mabou or Port Hood wharf.  What <br />
this may be we, on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side of</span>
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house, </span><br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for </span>the sudden revelation which

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed his</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fear</span> that the promise privately <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ignorant,</span> that any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such </span>expenditure<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> was in— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> proposition as this house, if it passes
this <br />
resolution assents to it, is that either party is <br />
to have the option of capi<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">talizing</span>
this annuity ; <br />
and that, too, taking both propositions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together,</span>
<br />
not on the terms of paying in debentures what <br />
the annuity is worth, but paying a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principal</span>
<br />
sum which shall yield an interest equal to the <br />
amount of the annuity ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leaving it</span>
to the com- <br />
pany to be formed, to pay off the principal sum <br />
out of a sinking fund to be instituted by them <br />
for that purpose.  It is quite true that the go- <br />
vernment declared they do not intend to allow <br />
the capitalization to be made on that footing ; <br />
it is quite true that they have said they will <br />
not even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> the contractors
the option of ca- <br />
pitalizing at all ; and further, that they will <br />
not capitalize under par value ; but when they <br />
make these statements, they are not accepting <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition ;</span> and yet,
while they do not ac- <br />
cept it and declare they will not accept it, they ask <br />
us to pass a resolution to empower them to do <br />
that which they say they have no intention to do. <br />
But whether they capitalize, or not, they are <br />
to take stock to the extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000,</span> 
for <br />
which they must issue debentures, and these <br />
debentures must be put in the market.  If <br />
they are sold, of course they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will </span>affect the <br />
saleable value of the debentures for the Pic- <br />
tou road ; and whether they are sold or not, <br />
the very fact that this amount of debentures <br />
is to be thrown into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">market—or</span>
is liable to <br />
be thrown into it-will reduce the value of the <br />
other bonds.  If this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition</span>
stood alone, <br />
it would be difﬁcult to bear the burden of it ; <br />
but when it is accompanied by another propo- <br />
sition, equally burdensome, it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impossible</span>
to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contemplate</span> the position without
fear and ap- <br />
prehension.  Indeed, it would seem that
the<br />
twin scheme is looked upon with even
more <br />
favor than the New Brunswick proposition. <br />
On the 23rd November, Mr. Levesey’s propo- <br />
sition was before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> 
It had been <br />
before them for weeks ; yet the government do <br />
nothing.  Connexion with New Brunswick and <br />
the United States may be secured by accepting <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer ;</span> but it is not a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ccepted,-and</span> from <br />
that day to this no sign is made, no council is <br />
held, no minute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed either
accepting or <br />
rejecting the proposition.  It is quite other-<br />
wise<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> with the Annapolis scheme. 
A constitu- <br />
ency is vacant—a member has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secured-</span> <br />
and forthwith a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">council is convened,</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and a</span><br />
minute passed, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pledged-</span> <br />
and the house <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">controlled</span>, so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far as</span> that pledge <br />
controls <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them-to</span> build the
Annapolis road. </span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
New let <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us </span>see what this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">involves-4</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per</span> <br />

$76,800 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> year, and there is the same option as <br />
to capitalization.  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> as in
