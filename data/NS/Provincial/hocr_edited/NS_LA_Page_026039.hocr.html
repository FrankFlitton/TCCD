<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> tary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to
use the</span> language he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did in
respect to</span> a <br />
country with which we are peace<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>
and with <br />
which we should ever remain so. What does <br />
Mr. Cardwell say in reference to the relations <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">between</span> the U States and the
mother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country?</span> <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “The hon. member for Bradford in the
course of his <br />
eloquent speech wished me to answer two questions— <br />
viz. Whether we can truly state that our relations <br />
with the United States continue to be, as they have <br />
hitherto been, perfectly friendly. I can without re- <br />
serve give him such an assurance (hear, hear.) The <br />
hon. member also asks whether in that correspon- <br />
dence which has not been given to the house there <br />
are not some documents <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bearing</span>
on the question of <br />
theAlabama. With equal confidence and with equal <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pleasure I</span> can assure the house
that I can give the <br />
hon. member the answer he desires. There are no <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">papers</span> in that correspondence
such as he describes as <br />
bearing on the question as it stands
between the two <br />
countries.” <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now with an assurance of that kind from
so <br />
distinguished an authority as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonial</span> Sec- <br />
retarywhy should we be startled with their alarm <br />
cries that we are to be overrun by the hordes of <br />
the States. But what does Lord Palmerston <br />
say?  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“ I am persuaded that the tone of
moderation which <br />
has prevailed in this debate will be useful in Canada <br />
and the United States. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span>
I can only conﬁrm the <br />
statement of my right hon. friend that the relations <br />
of the two government at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span>
moment are per- <br />
fectty friendly and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactory</span>
(hear, hear). We <br />
have no complaint to make against the government <br />
of the United States. They have acted in a fair and <br />
honorable manner towards us in all matters which <br />
have arisen between us.” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> With these opinions expressed by the
leader <br />
of the government in the house of Commons, <br />
why should our attention be directed to the Lon- <br />
don Times which is given here as an authority <br />
upon a matter of public opinion in England. I <br />
hold, sir, that the house of commons is the place <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">look for</span> illustrations of
public opinion in Eng- <br />
land, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accurate information</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respecting</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
relations between Great Britain and the United <br />
States. We all know the character of the Lon- <br />
don Times. On the 7th March, a ﬁre eating ar- <br />
ticle was issued in the columns of that paper re- <br />
dolent with abuse of the British North America <br />
Colonies, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> few days before this
debate from <br />
which I have quoted took place. On the 17th <br />
the debate on the Defences came <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off,</span>
and on <br />
the following day the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Times</span>
changed its tone, <br />
and was perfectly lamb-like. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> My hon. friend from Colchester referred
to- <br />
the question of defence. He said, “See the <br />
advantage that we will in that respect derive <br />
from Union. You will have a concentration of <br />

will give you no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more money,</span> no

and as to concentration you have now just as <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much as</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> would have then. We are told in <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not move</span> a single regiment of
militia across the  <br />
frontier. But does it require
Confederation to <br />
do that? Cannot you, by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simple</span>
act o<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">f the</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature, give</span> the Governor the
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
march <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out as many</span> militiamen as
you choose? <br />
So, really isolated as we are said to be, the Com- <br />
mander-in-chief, at any moment, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by agreement</span>
<br />
made between the several Provinces, can have <br />
the militia marched to the assistance of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fel-</span> <br />
low countrymen, and they in turn can be <br />
brought to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the time of peril.</span> Then we are <br />
told that British statesmen look forward to Con- <br />
federation as a means of defence. Had they <br />
been told, as we were three months ago, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that this</span>
<br />
Confederation was only going to give a million <br />
of dollars, what would the people of England <br />
have said ? What did they say in the debate <br />
to which I have referred ? The report of Col. <br />
Jervois was read, and it was suggested that Ca- <br />
nada would contribute, not for defence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alone,</span>
<br />
but for fortiﬁcations, the enormous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sum of</span>
<br />
$6,000,000. A million has been granted by <br />
Canada during <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> late session
towards fortiﬁca- <br />
tions, not to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be </span>expended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">until the</span> delegation <br />
learn whether they can obtain from England <br />
the guarantee for the war loan they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wish.</span>
Du- <br />
ring the late session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> million
and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">half—the</span> <br />
half million for frontier defences<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>was given by <br />
Canada alone—or half a million more than we <br />
were told the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entire</span>
Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would give.</span> <br />
The gentleman who went to Canada, among <br />
other startling things, agreed to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—to</span>
bind, <br />
as far as they could, these several provinces to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contribute</span> their share towards
any sum of mo <br />
ney that Canada might raise or borrow towards <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the defences</span> of the country.
That was denied <br />
by the delegates at one of the public meetings, <br />
but I hold in my hand an extract from a speech <br />
delivered since that time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span>
Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">J</span> . A. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Macdo-</span> <br />
