<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. KILLAM supposed that the object of
the <br />
demonstration was to produce the same im-<br />
pression upon the minds of the British
people<br />
as had been produced upon Mr. Cardwell,viz:<br />
that the feeling of this country was in
favor of<br />
Confederation. As that was at variance
with <br />
the facts, it was right that the matter
should be<br />
brought before the house, so that any
erroneous<br />
impression might be removed.</p>












<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. LEVESCONTE said that when some years<br />
ago a volunteer company took part in a
demon-<br />
stration in honor of the election of Lord
Pal-<br />
merston, attention was called to the fact
in the<br />
House of Commons. The only excuse that<br />
was given on that occasion was that the
affair<br />
had occurred through animadertance. He<br />
contended that the volunteers, which were<br />
supported by the people's money, had no
right<br />
to take part in any political demonstration<br />
whatever. Partcularly careful should they
be<br />
to give their countenance to a scheme to
which<br />
seven-eighths of the people were
unfavorable.</p>





<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. TOBIN called attention to the
programme,<br />
and justified the action of the citizens.
He<br />
thought if the hon. member was going to
load<br />
his gun with patriotic powder he should try<br />
and aim at something more tangible than
the <br />
present matter.</p>
















































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. PRO. SEC. said that he rose for the
pur-<br />
pose of movin that the house pass to the
or-<br />
der of the day. He would not feel disposed
to<br />
interfere with any desire of the hon.
member<br />
for Richmond (Mr. Miller) to favor the
house<br />
with those rhetorical outbursts of
indignation<br />
with reference to the very contemptible
cha-<br />
racter and position that Halifax occupied
in the<br />
Province of Nova Scotia. That hon. member<br />
had rendered himself famous for such
exhibi-<br />
tions, and it would be a pit to interfere
in the <br />
slightest degree with any anxiety that he
might<br />
have to place the city in antagonism to
the <br />
country. It was not the most laudable ambi-<br />
tion in the world for any one to endeavor
on<br />
every possible occasion to excite
unpleasant<br />
feelings between different sections of the
coun-<br />
try. The hon. member's talents and
exertions<br />
might be directed to a far worthier
object. It<br />
might not be worth while, perhaps,
noticing the<br />
hon. member's attempts to show the people<br />
that he had take them under his patriotic
care,<br />
and in fact to relieve their apprehensions
of<br />
being trampled down by Halifax influence;<br />
but when a resolution was moved which, if<br />
passed would place the house in a false
posi-<br />
tion, it was that he (Dr. T.) should
briefly<br />
call attention to the real circumstances
of the<br />
case. He would state, at the commencement,<br />
that the first time he had seen the
programme<br />
was at eleven or twelve o'clock when he
hap-<br />
pened to take up one of the morning
papers. I<br />
was well known that there existed in this
city<br />
an organization called the Union League. It<br />
was not of a secret character; its meetings<br />
were called by public notice in the
newspapers,<br />
and every man favorable to the cause of
union<br />
was invited to attend them. Most of the
lead-<br />
ing and influential and respectable
citizens of <br />
Halifax were engaged in that organization
for<br />
the purpose, as they believed, of
promoting the<br />
best interests of the Province of British
North<br />
America and of Nova Scotia especially. No<br />
one could deny that even if the sentiments<br />
they held were favorablt entertained by
only<br />
one-tenth of the people, yet they had a
perfect<br />
right to use all legitimate means of
inculcating<br />
their opinions without hindrance on the
part<br />
of any one.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He would confess that he had read with<br />
some little surprises the fact that the Volunteer<br />
Companies were to take part in this demon-<br />
stration. The question at issue, it was true,<br />
was one that perhaps more than any other,<br />
would warrant the Volunteers giving it their<br />
countenance. It was known that a delegation<br />
was on its way from Canada to England for<br />
the purpose of discussing with the Imperial<br />
Government the question of defence, the Reci-<br />
procity Treaty, and Confederation. Gentle-<br />
men who had the Union cause at heart, felt<br />
that they would be wanting in their duty if<br />
they did not show this delegation, on its ar-<br />
rival that night, that there was in the City of<br />
Halifax a large and influential body of citizens<br />
who were favorable to the Confederation of<br />
British North America. If it was possible<br />
that there could be an occasion when the<br />
Volunteer organisation would be entitled to<br />
turn out, it was when gentlemen were touching<br />
our shores on their way to the Imperial Go-<br />
vernment to provide for the defence and secu-<br />
rity of British North America. Divided, how-<br />
ever, as public sentiment was in this country <br />
on this great question, he did not think it ad-<br />
visable that the Militia, or Volunteer, or Artil-<br />
lery organization, should turn out in their uni-<br />
forms. Since this debate had commenced,<br />
without any communication on his own part,<br />
he had received an intimation from Captain<br />
Chearnley, who commanded the organization,<br />
that any members of that organization might<br />
attend the demonstration as citizens, but non<br />
as Volunteers.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It might be attempted to array the country<br />
against Halifax, but no one could prevent the <br />
fact being made known that in the political<br />
and commercial metropolis of the Province<br />
there was a deeply rooted public sentiment<br />
prevading the minds of the most leading and<br />
influential men of all classes, that the future<br />
prosperity of Nova Scotia, as well as of all the<br />
Provinces of British North America, depended<br />
on the success of the scheme of Confederation.<br />
When you read the programme for that even-<br />
ing's celebration, you saw that not only the<br />
most highly educated and intelligent members<br />
of the mercantile community, but the bone and <br />
sinew of the city, the artizans and the working<br />
men, proposed to lend their aid in paying due<br />
honor to those who were laboring to promote<br />
the best interests of British North America at<br />
this critical period of the world's history. He<br />
could not understand why the feeling of some<br />
gentlemen were so excited on this subject.-<br />
Was there a man who would deny that an<br />
overwhelming body of the citizens of Halifax<br />
was in favor of Union. When the meetings in<br />
respect to that question were held in the city,<br />
Temperance Hall was densely packed, night<br />
after night. So strong was the current of pub-<br />
lic sympathy in favor of Union, that, at times,<br />
it was almost impossible for the friends of Con-<br />
federation to proceed, so enthusiastic were the<br />
plaudits that met them. When it was also at-<br />
tempted to make the House believe that nine-<br />
tenths of the people of this country were against<br />
Union, a liberty was taken with the true facts<br />
that was unworthy of any public man. Al-<br />
though great exertions had been made, and <br />
large amounts of money expended all over the<br />
face of the country, only fifteen or sixteen thou-<br />
sand persons had been persuaded to sign the <br />
same, or get some one else to sign them - for <br />
very many are signed by a cross - to petitions<br />
