prevent us </span>from exercising any influence<br />
upon the Government there, other than is given us<br />
by our representation. The influences of the in-<br />
terests of a country like ours (almost an island)<br />
are necessarily confined within her lines, and<br />
when the legislation for our interests is placed<br />
in a parliament beyond our borders we should<br />
have an increase of numbers in representation to<br />
compensate for the entire want of local influences.</p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 371 474 1499 975">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">But the Provincial Secretary tells us that
we <br />
have a large representation in the Legislative<br />
Council which fully compensates us for the want<br />
of representation in the Assembly. My. George<br />
Brown, arguing that question, said that the com-<br />
plaint had been made that they had given us too<br />
large a representation in the Upper House ; but<br />
he says "in the Lower House, Canada shall<br />
hold the purse strings." You will further remem-<br />
ber that all the Lowor Provinces combined have<br />
only 24 members in the Legislative Council, <br />
whilst united Canada has 48. But whatever dif-<br />
ferences of opinion may have hitherto existed<br />
between Upper and Lower Canada, there is no<br />
doubt you will find them as one when their in-<br />
terests come in collision with those of the Lower <br />
Provinces. When a man and wife quarrel,<br />
and a third party steps in, they both unite against<br />
him. Upper and Lower Canada may have dis-<br />
putes at times toom but whenever the Lower Pro-<br />
vinces come in, they will unite as one Province<br />
against us. The Provincial Secretary tells us<br />
that if our Representatives band together, they <br />
can exercise an influence which will make them<br />
sufficiently felt in the Canadian Parliament, and <br />
referred in illustration of his argument to the <br />
influence that the members of Cape Breton exer-<br />
cise here ; but he did not tell us that these form<br />
a much larger proportion to the whole number<br />
in this House than would the Representatives<br />
from Nova Scotia exhibit in a Parliement of 194<br />
at Ottawa. But suppose they did band together<br />
to make their influence felt in that Parliament.<br />
Now, I ask the hon. Prov. Sec'y. to consider the <br />
position in which he places this Province and her <br />
Representatives. I cannot conceive a more de-<br />
graded, a more humiliating position that the Re-<br />
presentatives of a spirited people compelled to forego<br />
their political opinions—their conscientious convic-<br />
tions on all public questions, in order to obtain for<br />
their people a considereatio nin the distribution of<br />
the funds. But even supposing our 19 Represen-<br />
tatives could so far forget themselves as to turn<br />
political hucksters, and offer to sell themselves,<br />
body and sould, they will never obtain more than<br />
a few pickings from the public chest, which we<br />
shall do more than our share in filling. Under<br />
any circumstances, however, humiliating, we shall<br />
be powerless to enforce a just consideration of<br />
interests. There is a beautiful work of art, re-<br />
presenting two hounds chained together by the<br />
neck—one is large and powerful, looking down<br />
with contempt and indifference upon his lesser<br />
companion, who is as beautiful i nthe formation<br />
of limb, apparently as swift to follow the game, <br />
and as keen of scent as the other, yet crouches,<br />
overawed and helpless. Often as I have looked<br />
upon that work, I have felt an impulse rising<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within me
to strike the chain from the little fel-<br />
lows neck, and let him free. And ever since this<br />
Confederation scheme has been published</span>—every<br />
time I have looked upon a miniature copy
of that<br />
work, I have thought of Confederation. I
have<br />
seen in it Nova Scotia, bound and chained
by the<br />
neck to Canada, and thinkingof my country<br />
thus helpless, powerless, and prostrate at
Ottawa,<br />
with a Representation of only nineteen in
a Par-<br />
liament of 194, the exclamation rises from
my<br />
heart—"God help the little felllow." Around<br />
me sit the men to whom the constituencies
of<br />
Nova Scotia entrusted her Constitutional
rights<br />
—her interests and wlefare—to whom she, for<br />
four years, bared her neck—is there—can
there be<br />
one among us who will help to fasten upon
that<br />
neck, this chain, prepared by the
delegates? No, <br />
let us rather keep sacred that trust—let
us rather<br />
go back to the people, and learn of them
at the <br />
polls their wished on this great question,
lest in<br />
after years, they have just reason to
execrate our<br />
memories—lest they pray Heaven to strike
palsied<br />
every hand that touched to fasten a rivet
of that <br />
chain. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I come now to the finanical terms of this scheme<br />
of Union. The delegates have adopted at Quebec<br />
a scale, and arranged the debt of the Provinces<br />
pretty much as they did representation, upon a <br />
plan of population irrespective of the incomes<br />
which the Provinces possessed. It seems to me <br />
at the very outset, the hon. delegates laid down<br />
the wrong principle, instead of arranging the<br />
debt according to population ; they should have<br />
looked at the incomes—at the revenues, and<br />
funds, what each had in the treasury. If any<br />
gentleman should propose to form a partnership<br />
with another on Granville street, what is the first<br />
question that is asked? The amount of his in-<br />
come—not how many persons are to enter the<br />
partnership. Taking it upon this ground, little<br />
Nova Soctia, as represented by these gentlemen,<br />
has not received justice. Canada is allowed to<br />
come into the Confederation with a debt of $62,-<br />
500,000, Nova Scotia with one of $8,000,000.<br />
Now, in the year in which this arrangement was<br />
made, the income of Canada was $5,884,594—<br />
whilst that of Nova Scotia was $861,989—in both<br />
cases derived from Customes and Excise. According-<br />
ing to that income of Canada, as compared with<br />
that of Nova Scotia, she should have only been<br />
entitled to come in with a debt of $54,000,000.<br />
But the hon. gentlemen should not have taken<br />
the present income only into consideration. They<br />
should have considered that under Confederation<br />
we shall be placed on the same tariff, and there-<br />
fore they should have looked to the effect of this<br />
increase of tariff. It has been ascertained by close<br />
calculation, that under the Canadian tariff, Nova<br />
Scotia's revenue would have been $1,330,514.<br />
Taking it upon this basis, if we were allowed only<br />
8 millions, Canada should have only $35,452,507,<br />
or reversing it, if Canada is allowed $62,500,000,<br />
NovaScotia should have been alowed $14,107,330.<br />
By adopting the principle of income, instead of<br />
population, it would have given us over six mil-<br />
lions more than we are actually to receive under<br />
this agreement.</p>
