trates, although <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was disposed to</span> take a <br />
more charitable view than he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself</span>
He <br />
was close at hand when the difﬁculty under <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> arose at Guysboro,
and it was a <br />
very signiﬁcant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact</span> that a
distinct party ma— <br />
jority at the sessions expressed their determi- <br />
nation not to act out the policy of the law. <br />
The gentleman who represented the political <br />
opinions of himself and colleague voted to <br />
carry out the law. It was moved by one of <br />
the minority “that the court proceed to set <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> <br />
the revising sections as the law requires in or- <br />
der that the revisors may be nominated.” Then <br />
the amendment was moved by a gentleman, a <br />
friend of the Provincial Secretary, “that the <br />
business of setting off the revising sections <br />
and the appointment of revisors be deferred <br />
until the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">court of</span> general
sessions in the Janu— <br />
ary term <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 1865 shall have an
opportunity of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petitioning </span>the General Assembly
in order to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> the act repealed.” The
sessions met in <br />
January, but these gentlemen did not attempt <br />
to carry out the purpose of their amendment. <br />
They had obtained their object of defeating the <br />
law, and therefore they did not consider it ne- <br />
cessary to do anything more. He also men- <br />
tioned that in the county of Guysboro they <br />
were required to perform the duty of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carrying</span>
<br />
out the law at the supreme court last fall. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. ATTY. GEN. asked if the law required
<br />
that.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. STEWART <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CAMPBELL</span> replied that he <br />
was surprised that the Attorney General of <br />
this Province should be so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ignorant</span>
of the law <br />
as not to know that at the last session of the <br />
house the act in question was passed. The <br />
special sessions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> held at the
fall term, and <br />
the matter was then to he attended to or not <br />
at all. It was a more pretext to say that when <br />
the general sessions came around they would <br />
make an attempt to have the law repealed. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Although</span> an amendment of this law
was pro- <br />
posed to enable that county to have the fran- <br />
chise extended to them, he did not think it <br />
would have the effect intended. He hoped the <br />
Provincial Secretary would take steps to show <br />
these refractory gentlemen that they would <br />
not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allowed</span> to violate the
law with im- <br />
punity.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. C. J. CAMPBELL thought it would he
very <br />
hard if the magistrates were treated as harsh— <br />
ly as some thought they should be. He con- <br />
sidered the franchise law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as,</span>most
obnoxious <br />
to the people, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> expressed his
belief that the <br />
country was under theimpression that the part <br />
now in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> who opposed it when
in opposi- <br />
tion would take measures for its repeal. The <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole tendency</span> of the law was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> corrupt the <br />
constituencies of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">p</span>rovinee, and therefore <br />
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hoped it would</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not b</span>e kept much longer a <br />
blot upon our statute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">book.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. ROSS</span>
said that now perhaps the house <br />
could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">form an</span> idea why the law

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. PROV. SEC. said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> some misappre- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> They asked for time for the consideration
of the <br />
question. Any gentleman who took the liberty <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of putting on</span> the back of these
petitions that <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were against</span> confederation
took an un- <br />
warrantable liberty with them.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCLELAN</span>
said that the petitions spoke <br />
against Confederation being dealt with by the <br />
present House, and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of
the question <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> ﬁrst submitted to the
people. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petition being</span>
read, Mr. LOCKE<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> said that <br />
he conceived the tenor of the petition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">op-</span> <br />
posed to Confederation, for it stated at the ve- <br />
ry commencement that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span>
were to be <br />
forced to be represented at Ottawa by only 19 <br />
members. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTY.</span>
GEN. replied that any one could <br />
see that the petitioners’ desire was to get more <br />
information on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span>
subject before <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making</span> their minds up. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCLEAN</span>
said that the petitioners ear- <br />
nestly prayed that before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passing</span>
upon the <br />
matter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people would have an
opportunity <br />
of expressing their wishes at the polls. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL asked if the peo- <br />
ple were not led to believe that Confederation <br />
was to he passed instanter. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Petitioners,</span>
belie— <br />
ving this, asked for delay. The petitions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> <br />
therefore against Confederation in the sense in <br />
which the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincial</span> Secretary
and his friends <br />
had presented the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> to
the public.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LOCKE</span>

at <br />
the very outset that they were going to surren- <br />

sitting at Ot— <br />

</p>
