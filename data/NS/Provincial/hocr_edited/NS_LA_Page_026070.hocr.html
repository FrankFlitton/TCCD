<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> in her Legislature at its ratification.
But I ask<br />
where will Nova Scotia be, when the whole
power is<br />
placed in the hands of Canadians, to
barter away<br />
her interests whenever it may suit them.
One of<br />
the conditions most prized by the American
peo-<br />
ple in effecting that treaty, is the right
to our <br />
fisheries. Now with Canada's anxiety for
the con-<br />
tinuance of that treaty, what regard will
she have<br />
for the particular interests of Nova
Scotia when,<br />
as I have already shown you, we shall be
power-<br />
less at Ottawa, so far as our
representation is con-<br />
cerned, Again he asks where was New Bruns-<br />
wick, when a slice was cut off her, and
given to<br />
Maine?  I reply she was just in the
position that <br />
Nova Scotia was, when a piece was taken
from<br />
her territory and handed over to New
Brunswick—<br />
in the hands of those who did not regard
her in-<br />
terests. There is, however, this difference—the<br />
"slice" we lost went to a sister colony,
which is<br />
some satisfcation, but not equal to what I
have, <br />
no doubt the Pro. Secy. felt, in getting
rid of a <br />
number of voters of the wrong political
stripe.<br />
</p>






















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. gentleman who wants to know who
is not<br />
humilated, when he finds that Canada is only men-<br />
tioned in the debates concerning these Provinces,<br />
in the British Parliament. I rather take it as a <br />
compliment, that Canada has alone been men-<br />
tioned. The Government of England have had<br />
no cause of complaint against Nova Scotia, on the<br />
ground of nnwillingness to make
preparation for<br />
her defence, but she had a reason for
dissatisfac-<br />
tion with Canada. We have also heard of the<br />
Grand Trunk Railway, and of the
transactions<br />
connected with it, which have given Canada
a<br />
reputation, I am glad to say, Nova Scotia
does<br />
not possess. Notoriety is not necessarily
fame.<br />
There may be a celebrity that does not
carry with<br />
it any weight of resepctability. The
Siamese<br />
Twins became celebrated—but it was for
their<br />
unnatural connexion ; and shall have a
chance<br />
of becoming celebrated, as being in our
geographi-<br />
cal position, a string of Siamese Twins.
When<br />
the Union with New Brunswick was discussed<br />
here last session, I made a calculation of
the pro-<br />
portionate size of the strips of land
connecting us<br />
with New Brunswick to the Provinces, as
com-<br />
pared with the proportion of the ligature
connec-<br />
ting Chang and Eng. to their whole size,
and<br />
found that our ligature is very mush
proportion-<br />
ately less. In their case you have two
men, per-<br />
fect in all their formation, that their
powers of free action<br />
and usefulness are destroyed. In this case
each<br />
province is a perfect geographical
formation of <br />
itself, having its own centre of interest,
its own<br />
heart within itself. If it were possible
to take the<br />
Siamese Twins, and reform them, and make
of <br />
the two one powerful man, the one heart
then,<br />
unfettered and freem he would be effective
to dis-<br />
charge the duties of life. And just so if
you<br />
could remould these Colonies by a
Confederation<br />
and bring them into compact shape, so that
there<br />
should be one common centre of interest—one<br />
heart from which the life blood sustaining
the<br />
whole should flow to the extremeties and
return, <br />
then would the Union commend itself to my
mind ;<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and I should wish it "God speed." This is
an<br />
impossibility, and therefore we should be
content<br />
as are brothers who are not "Siamese Twins"<br />
each having and exercisign his

all united by the bonds of family
affection. Let<br />
us then be content to go on prospering as
we have,<br />
and at the same time cultivating the ties
of bro-<br />

above all,<br />
let us not take a step that will tend to
sever our<br />
connection with England. My strong desire
is<br />
to see this connection continued, that
through out<br />
lives we may glory in the grandeur and
greatness<br />
of the British Empire, and leave behind us
those<br />
who shall inherit the same feelings of
loyal at-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Speech of Mr. Shannon.</p>















































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. SHANNON said—I do not intend to<br />
make any lengthened speech, but will merely<br />
avail myself of the portion of time left,
before<br />
the adjournment of the house to give
expres-<br />
sion to a few practical ideas in reference
to <br />
this great question, which have been
passing<br />
through my mind. In the first place, I may<br />
remark that ever since the commencement of<br />
the American Union, or rather ever since
the<br />
adoption of the present consitution, the
lead-<br />
ing minds connected with the Colonies have<br />
turned their attention to the subject of a
Colo-<br />
nial Union. It was not to be wondered at
that<br />
when they saw the great prosperity<br />
resulting from that Union under the
American<br />
constitution, they should deem similar
benefits<br />
might flow from the adoption of a similar<br />
course in British North America. Among the<br />
earliest who approached this subject was
Chief<br />
Justice Sewell, who was one of the
prominent<br />
men of Canada, and who wrote upon the ques-<br />
tion. Again and again the subject was
brought<br />
forward, but it was left to Lord Durham to<br />
give it greater prominence in his
celebrated<br />
report. That nobleman come to this
continent<br />
clothed with the highest powers, and on a
mis-<br />
sion of the greatest importance,—that of
quiet-<br />
ing, if possible, the disturbances of
Canada.<br />
He saw the isolated condition of these
Colonies,<br />
and contrasted them with the strength and
pow-<br />
er of the U. States, and he felt and
expressed<br />
the necessity of a Union. I have often
regret-<br />
ted that advantage had not been taken of
that<br />
opportunity to have consolidated the whole
of<br />
British America, not merely to unite Upper<br />
and Lower Canada. At that time the Colonies<br />
were in a different position from what they<br />
are now. Then we were subject to the fiat
of <br />
the Colonial Secretary, and an act of
Parlia-<br />
ment could easily have been obtained at the<br />
time Lord Durham returned to England, and<br />
would have been received as law by all. His<br />
Lordship, however, was too much imbued with<br />
Republican ideas, and I am not sure that he<br />
would have arranged his plan upon the <br />
monarchial principles, which, I am happy to<br />
say, pervades the scheme which was adopted<br />
at Quebec.</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">From the time of Lord Durham down to the<br />
present, we have had in every colony, from<br />
time to time, statesmen who have brought
