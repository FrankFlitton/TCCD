He said <br />
that the object of the. bill was simply to give <br />
the company power to manage the wharf. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> On motion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> Mr. Shannon, the house <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> To incorporate the Cape Breton Coal
Mining <br />
Company. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BOURINOT objected to the name, as he <br />
was afraid it would lead to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confusion—there</span>
<br />
being so many Cape Breton Coal Mining Com— <br />
panies. He would suggest that it be called the <br />
Inverness Coal Mining Co., which would be <br />
much more suitable, as the works were situ- <br />
ate in that county. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SHANNON</span>
said that the parties <br />
were very anxious to retain the name, as it <br />
was established in connection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">another</span> <br />
company of the same name in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Massachusetts</span>
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr MILLER agreed with Mr. Bourinot, that <br />
the name ought to be changed. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> After a few further remarks, Mr. Bourinot
<br />
moved that it be called the Cape Breton Coal<br />
Mining Company in Inverness, which motion<br />
was lost, 19 to 10.<br />
