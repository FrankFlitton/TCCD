<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">let me
say a few words to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my</span> honorable <br />
friend, the learned member for C<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">olchester—</span>
<br />
generally termed the leader of the opposition. <br />
Certainly not the leader of the opposition on <br />
this question. And sometimes we put the <br />
query to ourselves, whether he should be re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cognized</span> as the leader of the
opposition at all? <br />
I do not say this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offensively,</span>
but I feel that <br />
that hon. gentleman, on a question of such <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large importance as this, has ill
discharged his <br />
duty to the gentlemen with whom he has long <br />
been associated, when he ignored the functions <br />
of the party that introduced responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov-</span>
<br />
ernment into this country, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ventured</span>
to <br />
agree in Canada to adopt a scheme without <br />
reference to the people—contrary, as I believe, <br />
to the principles under which our government <br />
is formed. That hon. gentleman stated no <br />
opinion had been expressed against Union. <br />
But it must not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supposed</span> in
this case that <br />
silence gives consent. If the question of im- <br />
mediate union with Canada had been submitted <br />
to the house last winter, I believe it would not <br />
have been entertained at all. The sentiment <br />
of this country has not come up to union with <br />
Canada. It is true we have had delegates from <br />
time to time, and eminent leadin men have <br />
proceeded to Canada and England authorized <br />
to discuss the question in connexion with other <br />
matters, but you never had any measure sub- <br />
mitted. You never had the question of federal <br />
union. Union in any form never was brought <br />
up in a practical shape. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But,</span>
says the learned <br />
gentleman, the public opinion of England, <br />
previous to 1857, was opposed to a union of <br />
these colonies. So it was. There was a party <br />
in England at that time who thought if these <br />
colonies were united they would become pow- <br />
erful and antagonistic to the mother country. <br />
I admit a different feeling has come over the <br />
British people in that respect. But let us look <br />
at the motive. England is governed largely by <br />
the mercantile interests<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span> and
the men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the <br />
Manchester school, looking at the enormous <br />
taxes imposed by Canada upon British manu- <br />
factures and that in 1862 a proposition to grant <br />
a considerable sum of money towards the <br />
maintenance of the militia was thrown out, <br />
naturally look favorably upon a confederation <br />
or any scheme which, in their opinion, would <br />
not only have the effect of reducing the duties <br />
upon manufactures, but of throwing the bur-  </span><br />
then</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the defence of the provinces
upon <br />
themselves. Such is the belief of the British <br />
people. Will they believe it now when the <br />
views of all parties are better known? When <br />
the perceive that the duties cannot be reduced <br />
und<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">er confederation?</span> When they
hear that <br />
the conference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> proposed to
give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000</span> <br />
for defences? Will they believe it when they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">learn</span> that, even in Canada, there
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> large <br />
party—including, it is said, even some of the <br />
members of the government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves—who</span>
<br />
are not much disposed to keep up the connec- <br />
tion with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> imperial
government unless they <br />
guarantee a war loan. We have been told <br />
about allegiance and loyalty, but what do we <br />
ﬁnd in the Toronto Globe, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organ</span>
of the hon. <br />
George Brown, a personal friend of my own. <br />
In his correspondence from Quebec, we are <br />
told that there is a large party in Canada in <br />
favor of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annexation—a</span> sentiment
which has <br />
been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repeated</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the editorial</span> columns of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same journal.</span> And the
apprehension was wide <br />
spread, that unless the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imp</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">erial government</span> <br />
bleed freely, they will look for more intimate <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> We have been referred to opinions
expressed <br />
in England. Lord Derby, we are told, expres- <br />
sed a strong opinion on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Reciprocity</span>
Treaty, <br />
and alarm in consequence of the notice that <br />
was given of its repeal; but when we have a <br />
government in England, we do not look to the <br />
opposition for the sentiments of the people of <br />
that country. We look to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span>
as <br />
the gentlemen representing public opinion.— <br />
Lord Derby’s observations, I may say, how- <br />
ever, with regard to these colonies, were of the <br />
most friendly character—he was ready to de- <br />
fend these provinces at all hazards, and he <br />
blamed the government for their want of fore- <br />
sight; but I do not take his opinions as those <br />
of the people of England. Let me refer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you to</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> authority equally as eminent as
Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Foster,</span> <br />
Right Hon. Mr. Fitzgerald, a distinguished <br />
member of the House of Commons who said : <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ I differ widely from the hon. member
for Radnor- <br />
shire (Sir J. Walsh), who seemed to consider that the <br />
course lately taken by the American goverment in or- <br />
der to effect the termination of the convention relat- <br />
ing to the limitation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">naval force</span>
of the two coun- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tries</span> on the lakes was conceived,
by the American go- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vernment</span> in a spirit of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hostility</span> to England, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">th</span>at <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">termination</span> of the
reciprocity treaty marked a clear <br />
spirit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of hostility</span> to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> l have never held <br />
such language, nor do I think it is justiﬁed. As to <br />
the limitation of the naval force on the lakes, the Am- <br />
erican government are perfectly justified in proposing <br />
it. What are the circumstances under which notice <br />
to terminate the convention is good? By a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party</span>
of <br />
sympathiers making a descent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
Canada, an Am- <br />
erican vessel was seized on one of the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lakes, it</span> <br />
was only by accident that a second vessel was not sei- <br />
zed ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> the object might have
been carried out for <br />
the liberation of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> number
of Confederate pris- <br />
oners on Johnson’s island. Under such circumstan- <br />
ces, seeing that there was nearly 2000 prisoners there <br />
—that an attack had been made on American proper- <br />
ty in American waters, I think the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American govern-</span>
<br />
were justiﬁed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span> recourse
to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure.”</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> There is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justification,</span> and I consider it <br />
ample. Suppose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the position</span> of
affairs were re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">versed,</span> and that we were American
citizens, <br />
and vessels were to be ﬁtted out from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ports</span> <br />
of our enemy—would we not resent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it, and it</span>
<br />
there was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treaty in</span> existence
which prevent- <br />
ed us arming boats on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lakes, would</span>
we not <br />
give notice immediately of our intention <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <br />
bring it to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">termination.</span> I
shall now produce <br />
a much higher authority—no one else than Mr. <br />
Cardwell himself, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
Secretary of State <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the <br />
Colonies. The Provincial Secretary, on a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre-</span>
<br />
vious evening, spoke in the tone <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
the alarm- <br />
ist, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span> also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afternoon,</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my hon.</span> friend <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> Colchester—held out the bug bear of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
notices <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> for the
termination of the Reci- <br />
procity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaty—for the</span> abrogation
of the treaty <br />
in reference to gunboats on the lakes, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
for <br />
bringing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>labours of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fishery Commis-</span> <br />
sioner to an end. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All these</span>
facts were<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> mentioned <br />
with the usual great emphasis of that hon. gentle- <br />
man as illustrations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span>
spirit of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hostility that</span> <br />
inﬂuences the United States in respect to these <br />
provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now I</span> do not think that
gentleman, <br />
as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a Minister of</span>
the Crown in this country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <br />
warranted in<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> indulging in
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strain.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />My <br />
hon. friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colchester</span> who
does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> bear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
the responsibilities of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span>
might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> <br />
this, but it did not become the Provincial Secre- <br />
