tion with the great country lying in that direc-<br />

of the means placed under their control from this<br />
and the other provinces confederated with them.<br />
For it must be remembered that even if our Re-<br />
venue doubles under Confederation, it will be of<br />
no use to us, it will be all swallowed up by<br />
Canada, whose superior voice in the Parliament<br />
will always control the action of the Lower Pro-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. Prov. Sec. the other night in
urging<br />
his views in favour of this scheme stated, that it<br />
had received the sanction of the Bishops, and the<br />
Clergy of the different denomination. Even so, I<br />
hold that is no argument to control the members<br />
of this House. They can entertain any opinions<br />
they please upon this or any other subject, and how-<br />
ever much I may respect them in matters peculi-<br />
arly within their province, I do not admit that <br />
in matters of finance and political economy, they<br />
should exercise much influence over the delibera-<br />
tions of the people's representatives. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Again he advanced as an additional
argument, <br />
that all the leading men of the Province had been<br />
in favor of Union. Now it is true that at dif-<br />
ferent times various prominent politicians have in<br />
their places in Parliament and elsewhere made<br />
grand speeched in favor of Union, but it was<br />
well understood at the time, that nothing was to<br />
come of it, they just wished to make a grand show, <br />
and had no idea of its being followed by any prac-<br />
tical results, so that even if grand speeched have<br />
been made upon the advantages of Union in the<br />
abstract, that has nothing to do with the merits<br />
of the scheme promulgated by the Quebec Dele-<br />
gates.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon. Prov. Sec. also stated that the
most re-<br />
spectable portion of the Press are in favor of the<br />
measure. Now sir, I have made a list of those<br />
pro and con—not including the Religious press—<br />
and here they are. In the city we have:<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">For—<span style="font-style: italic;">Unionist,

Nova Scotian, Acadian <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. PROV. SECY—No. You must strike off<br />
the last. It has recanted.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. LOCKE—We'll even so. Then in the coun-<br />
try we have:<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Pictou Standard</span> which may be
in favor. It has<br />
been said that there is no intention on the part of the<br />
Canadian delegates, now going home to use<br />
their influence with the British Cabinet to force<br />
this measure upon the Province. I will read to<br />
the House what Mr. Cartier said in the subject,<br />
when addressing the audience at the Temperance<br />
Hall:—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"They knew that in Nova Scotia there was a
<br />
strong feeling in favor of the scheme of Confeder-<br />
ation. * * * * * He rejoiced to know<br />
that the heart of Nova Scotia as well the heart of <br />
the Canadas was warm for Confederation. The<br />
friends of the cause had no reason for desponden-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> cy, it would take but little time to
warm  the heart <br />
of New Brunswick, after the people of that
pro-<br />
vince had  understood and weighed the
important<br />
bearings of the question. The Canadian
delegates<br />
were the first to present at the
Conference at <br />
Charlottetown, to the Maritime Provinces,
the<br />
larger view of the greater Confederation ;
and he<br />
did not hesitate to declare that the basis
of union<br />
agreed upon at Quebec was the most just and<br />
equitable Union that under the
circumstances<br />
could be devised—ensuring alike the safety
and<br />
prosperity of all the Confederate
provinces ; and<br />
such success had attended the
deliberations of the<br />
Quebec convention as was unprecedented  In
all<br />
human affairs, we must expect checks and
dis-<br />
appointments—it could not always be smooth<br />
water—there must be shortcomings, and New<br />
Brunswick had merely delayed its
consummation—<br />
it must ultimately be carried out. On
hearing<br />
the fate of the measure in New Brunswick,
they<br />
in Canada deemed it advisable to bring to
a con-<br />
clusion the business of the Legislature,
and send a<br />
delegation to England to press
confederation upon <br />
the Imperial parliament, the defence
question and<br />
in connection therewith the Intercolonial
Railway.<br />
It had become a question of Imperial
policy and<br />
his co-delegates and himself were going to
Eng-<br />
land to urge the question of defence not
for<br />
Canada alone, but to all the British North<br />
American Provinces. On this question of de-<br />
fence all the Provinces must be united,
and in <br />
order to defend ourselves properly we must
be<br />
united under one government. The treasure
and<br />
resources of the Provinces separately
cannot be<br />
usefully and properly applied for defence,<br />
except united under one government, and
then<br />
all the strength of the Confederates
Provinces can<br />
be brought to bear upon the point when the
attack<br />
takes place. It is beyond doubt that the
Imperial<br />
Government consider the Federation of all
the<br />
Provinces absolutely necessary. The
resources<br />
of one Province alone would be too small
to resist<br />
attack, but when all are united very great
asssis-<br />
tance can be given, and when that has
taken <br />
place there can be no difficulty. The
delegates<br />
are going to England to urge the
construction of<br />
the great Intercolonial Railway, as the
construc-<br />
tion of that work was absolutely necessary
for the <br />
defence of British North America. * * * * *<br />
This public demonstration was an authentic
and<br />
unmistakeable exhibition of strong
confederate<br />
feeling in the commercial city of the
province of<br />
Nova Scotia, and the people of England
would <br />
come to the conclusion that the citizens
of Hali-<br />
fax are favorable to the cause of
confederation."</p>











<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Galt also used this language:—"He could<br />
not refrain from expressing his emotions
on the oc-<br />
casion of so magnificent a reception—not
from<br />
personal considerations alone, but because
it was<br />
the unanimous expression of approval of a
policy<br />
that has an echo in the breast of the
people of <br />
Nova Scotia as well as that of Canada.
Fully<br />
sensible of the check which it has
received in New<br />
Brunswick, he did not believe that it was
perma-<br />
nent,—the great body of the people had not
time<br />
to weigh well the question ; and he could
not<br />
bring his mind to the belief that the New
Bruns-<br />
