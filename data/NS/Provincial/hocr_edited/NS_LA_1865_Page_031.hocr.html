inter- <br />
est in their welfare, it would be better for <br />
them, and he could assure them, that they <br />
would ﬁnd no indisposition on the part of the <br />
government to meet their views. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. S. CAMPBELL had no doubt that the <br />
Prov. Sec. was not pleased with his style of <br />
opposition—he would probably prefer having <br />
more loose ﬁsh about the house. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. ARCHIBALD would suggest to the Chair-
<br />
man of the Fishery Committee that instead of <br />
taking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000</span> to cut a hole at
this end of the <br />
Bras d’Or Lake, he should take the money, <br />
and stop up the other end and thus make it a <br />
valuable reservoir for the preservation of ﬁsh. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. TOBIN said perhaps the trouble with <br />
the member for Guysborough was that he was <br />
not sufﬁciently supplied with bait, and he had <br />
been ﬁshing with bare hooks. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LOCKE</span>
said the subject had been so <br />
often discussed that it was not worth while to <br />
take up any more time. At the same time, it <br />
was not right to treat it in a scaly way. He <br />
always felt that, while the subject of agricul- <br />
ture received a great deal of attention from <br />
the house, the ﬁsheries, which were of as much <br />
importance, scarcely received any attention at <br />
all. As regards the trawl ﬁsheries, the evil <br />
complained of existed more in reference to the <br />
deep sea than the shore ﬁsheries, and it had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established</span> that we had no control
over <br />
them. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PRYOR</span>
thought that if the government <br />
would give a grant for the improvement of the <br />
ﬁsheries, no money could be better expended. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTY.</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">GEN.</span> asked whether the ques- <br />
tion of payment of supervisors of river ﬁsher- <br />
ies had been considered by the committee. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. PROV. SEC. said that a bill had been
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed to</span> carry out that idea,
and supervisors <br />
had been appointed, but he believed their du- <br />
ties commenced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> ended with
drawing their <br />
salaries.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. PRYOR said the sessions of Halifax <br />
county had taken the matter up very warmly, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> had voted £50 to pay the
river <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wardens.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">After
some further remarks, the report was <br />
received and adopted. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ARCHIBALD,</span>
in rising to second the re- <br />
solutions upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">table of</span> the
house, said:— <br />
I feel that after the great length at which <br />
the hon. Pro. Sec’y has adverted to the scheme <br />
of Union propounded at the Quebec Confer- <br />
ence, it will be out of place <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely into</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">detail,</span> and I shall therefore content <br />
myself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> calling the
attention of the house to <br />
some matters to which he did not refer at great <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">length.</span> That hon. gentleman, in
order to con- <br />
vince the house that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> and
those who acted <br />
with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him in</span> the advocacy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this question of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union</span> of the Colonies, had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ample</span> authority <br />
for the course they pursued, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span>
referred <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> public meetings held from
time to time, in <br />
this city, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to the recorded

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> dressed an audience in favor of Union,
had <br />
there ever been found a dissenting voice against <br />
it. If then this could be taken as any evidence <br />
of the state of the public mind, I think that the <br />
advocates of this measure had a right to as- <br />
sume that the feeling of the country was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely</span> in favor of Union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But while the hon. Provincial Secretary
has <br />
alluded to the public opinion of this country, <br />
I will remind th<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e</span> house that
there is another <br />
public opinion on this subject, which cannot <br />
be ignored. A public opinion which must, and <br />
has a right to exercise a powerful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span>
upon <br />
the decision of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>
allude to the <br />
public opinion of the statemen and people
of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span>. This opinion, too, hus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undergone</span>
a <br />
great change. It must not be forgotten that <br />
till the occurrence of recent events the circum- <br />
stances of the past have not been such as to in- <br />
duce British statesmen to look with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span>
<br />
favor upon any large or general Union of her <br />
colonies. The last union that took place, and <br />
to which the attention of British statesmen <br />
has naturally turned had the effect of wresting <br />
from her power thirteen of her most valuable <br />
colonies, which formed the brightest gem in <br />
the diadem of the British crown. 
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> We can easily understand then how they <br />
would be inclined at ﬁrst to regard with doubt <br />
and disfavor any projected combination of all <br />
the British North American Colonies. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span>
was <br />
not to be wondered at then, that when this sub- <br />
ject has from time to time been brought to the <br />
notice of the Imperial authorities by colonial <br />
statesmen it received little encouragement. So <br />
late indeed as 1857 when delegates for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span> <br />
vince pressed the subject upon the attention <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
Mr. Labouchere, the then colonial minister, it <br />
was quite clear that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
smaller union of the <br />
Maritime Colonies would have been preferred <br />
by the Imperial authorities to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a union</span>
of the <br />
whole. And it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> probable
that had the po- <br />
sition of affairs on this continent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remained</span>
the <br />
same as then, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> feeling of
antagonism on the <br />
part of the mother country to a general union <br />
of the British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span>
Colonies, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> <br />
have been continued to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present time.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />But <br />
let me contrast for a moment the changed <br />
aspect of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span> and it will
be readily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seen</span> <br />
why it is that such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a revulsion</span>
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> has <br />
taken place in the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mind—across</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the wa-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ter—u</span>pon this question. Four year
ago, when <br />
British statesmen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">looked</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America,</span> they saw <br />
thirty millions of people engaged in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the arts of</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peace—the</span> cultivation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the soil,</span> the construc- <br />
tion of railroads <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
canals—the building of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cities—the</span> creation of
manufactories, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de-</span> <br />
velopment of every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">branch of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">art</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indus-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try.</span> In fact the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reign</span> of materialism appear- <br />
ed to be ﬁrmly established, and the rule of the&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
" almighty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dollar"</span> supreme. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">states-</span> <br />
men then, in view of these circumstances, had <br />
a right to assume that in the absence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> <br />
great and<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> unexpected
convulsion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">among these</span> <br />
people, they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no reason</span> to
anticipate difﬁ- <br />
culties or complications with them. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now</span>
<br />
how changed was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the scene</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
great nation <br />
once <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">devoted to the arts of</span> peace,
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sudden-</span> <br />
ly been turned from a nation of farmers, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arti-</span> <br />
sans, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and merchants into</span> a nation
of soldiers. <br />
That nation now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁeld</span> the largest&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
armies the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever</span> saw, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and had</span> increased <br />
their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">naval strength</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> rapidly than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> <br />
other nation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world.</span> And instead <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span> <br />
spirit of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peace</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the war spirit</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pervaded the</span><br />
whole country. <br />
