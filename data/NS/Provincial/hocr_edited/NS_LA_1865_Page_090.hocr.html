appears that the sum of $40,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
issued in <br />
Treasury notes, and an amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$42,000</span>
was <br />
borrowed from the Savings' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bank. </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Trea- <br />
sury notes were issued on the authority of the <br />
House, in connection with the new Provincial<br />
Building, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$42,000</span> was
borrowed towards <br />
the construction of the Pictou Railway. The <br />
sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$148,000,</span> which I show is
the balance in <br />
the general treasury for my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposal, is</span>
totally<br />
independent of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$32,000</span> in
question. I<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n</span> the <br />
Receiver General’s account there is paid for <br />
the Pictou Railway $21,000, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the
balance</span> is <br />
brought up as outstanding liability against the <br />
Province, as a glance at schedule B of the esti- <br />
mates will show. Then there is the sum of <br />
$40,000 of treasury notes. By an Act passed in <br />
1863, the Government were authorised to issue <br />
Province notes not to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$40,000,</span> and to <br />
take from the Savings’ Bank a sum not to <br />
exceed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$60,000</span> for the purchase
of the lot <br />
known as Hare’s lot, and the erection there— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on of the</span> public building now in
course of <br />
canstruction.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In accordance with this authority, the
lot <br />

proceeded to question the soundness of the esi<br />

the receipts of the past two quarters with those <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">actual custom’s</span> receipts were

might be a serious reduction in the revenue re— <br />

our
<br />
population in the extension of our lines of<br />
railway. Again, the Province is going on with <br />
the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pictou</span>

to the hon. member we are this year to ex-<br />
pend a million and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">half</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of dollars</span> among<br />
our people in connection with this work. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> facts show that there will
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a </span> large <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount</span> of money in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circulation,</span> and as the <br />
people will buy in proportion to their ability <br />
to pay, the consumption of dutiable articles<br />
must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely increase</span> with the
increased circu- <br />
lation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of money.</span> Therefore,
apart from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ge-</span><br />
neral <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favorable condition</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of </span>the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,
I</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> under all the

events the ordinary receipts from our ordinary<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sources</span> of <span class="unclear" title="Should be 'revenue'.">reven?ne</span> are to be largely reduced. <br />
I am not, however, obliged to deal in mere ge-<br />
neralities on this point.  I have, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on a
previous</span>
<br />
occasion, shown that in the ﬁrst quarter of this <br />
year we had received <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">over $100,000</span>
in excess<br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>same quarter last
year; now we have <br />
another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quarter</span> gone by, the one
ending in <br />
March.  The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> that quarter is <br />
$129,000, or an increase of over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20,000</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on the </span><br />
same quarter of last year.&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I can also
state to </span><br />
the house that I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> the
assurance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-</span> <br />
men who can best <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to the prospects</span><br />
of our revenue for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present
quarter, that <br />
they are most favorable, and that, in fact, <br />
<span class="unclear" title="Should be 'there'">thore</span> will be an increase in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receipts over</span>
<br />
the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quarter of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1864.&nbsp; </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />Under these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circum-</span> <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justified</span> in drawing the alarming pictures he<br />
