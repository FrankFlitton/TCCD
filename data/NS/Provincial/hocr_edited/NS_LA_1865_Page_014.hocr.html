could not avoid coming to the conclusion that we<br />
were very small in deed. Why the entire of the in-<br />
habitants of this Province would not be more than<br />
sufficient to fill a first class city. We have got the<br />
elements of greatness and self-government, but on a<br />
very small scale. The same many be said of New<br />
Brunswick. The latter Province is a noble country;<br />
and Canada we know is replete with inexhaustible<br />
stores of wealth and greatness. And looking far<br />
back we ask what shall comprise her bounds, broad and <br />
unlimited in their expanse? It is, then, our duty not <br />
only to the present, but also the succeeding genera-<br />
ations, to effect a union of the whole, Canada, New<br />
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, having <br />
one interest and one cause. It has been said by some <br />
that we can do little in moulding our future condi-<br />
tion; but I can say that we can do much, and it is our <br />
duty to look into the future and provide for it. We<br />
may also waken up to the necessaity of giving the ques-<br />

somewhat too late."<br />
