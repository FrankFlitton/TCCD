<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> CORRECTION. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TOBIN</span>
corrected an error which he no- <br />
ticed in a report of some few remarks he had <br />
made in reference to the militia on a previous <br />
day. He was made to say that the expenses <br />
of the North since the war commenced amount- <br />
ed to one hundred million of dollars. What <br />
he did say was, that the army estimates for the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> year were over one
hundred million <br />
dollars. When the war broke out the United <br />
States had only 41 ships of war, whilst now <br />
they were increased to 671 ships, 54 of which <br />
were monitors and iron clads. He thought it <br />
advisable to correct the mistake of the repor- <br />
ter, inasmuch as the papers containing the <br />
debates went abroad, and it might not be <br />
known where it originated. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BLANCHARD pointed out an error of the
<br />
printer in placing his name to some remarks <br />
which were made by Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Blackwood,</span>
and vice <br />
versa, in the same debate. He was made to <br />
say that in his county they could ﬁre across <br />
the beach out to sea whereas it was Mr. Black— <br />
wood who said so. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATT.</span>
GEN. called attention to the un- <br />
fairness of some of the papers that did not <br />
publish the oﬂieiai reports. <br />

<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LOCKE</span>
presented four petitions from the <br />
township of Shelburne against the Union of <br />
the provinces. He also stateed that he noticed <br />
in one of the papers a telegram that Canada <br />
was going to take certain action on the ques- <br />
tion of Confederation, and therefore he wished <br />
to know whether the government had had any <br />
correspondence on the subject. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span>
PRO. SEC. replied that the government <br />
had received no ofﬁcial communication from <br />
the government of Canada upon the bject, <br />
but at the same time he made that statement <br />
he thought it right to add that the substance <br />
of the telegram, as it exactly appeared, was <br />
communicated to him by a member of the <br />
Canadian government. He did not regard<br />
that as an official communication in the real <br />
scene of the term. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. S. MCDONNELL said he noticed that the
<br />
petitions presented on the subject under con- <br />
sideration were styled "with regard to Confe- <br />
deration.” He considered that these petitions <br />
were, to all intents and purposes, against the <br />
scheme. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LOCKE said the good sense of the
coun- <br />
try would tell at once that they were against <br />
Confederation. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. P. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SMYTH</span>
presented a petition from <br />
Ship Harbor, in Inverness, against Confedera- <br />
tion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. ROBERTSON expressed his opiniont hat <br />
all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petitions</span> were not
really against the pro—_ <br />
posed Union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATT.</span> GEN. replied that the people <br />
wished time for the consideration of the ques- <br />

upon it this session, but they did not express <br />
any opinion adverse to the scheme. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. S. MCDONNELL said that the Attorney <br />
General could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not, by</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any amount</span> of ingenuity, <br />
construe these petitions in any other way than <br />
that they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposed</span> to
Confederation. They <br />
were opposed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the consummation of
the <br />
measure at the present time, and there was <br />
not a single word in them in its favor. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
Mr. MILLER was surprised that gentleman <br />

decide <br />
in reference to it. They gave a signiﬁcant <br />
hint what they would do with it if they got <br />
hold of it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTY.</span>
GEN. supported his position by <br />
reference to the state of things that occurred <br />
in connection with the measure touching the <br />
Incorporation of the Counties that was before <br />
the house some years ago. The fact that the <br />
people said they wanted time for consideration <br />
proved that they had not yet made up their <br />
minds either to oppose or reject it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL said that the pe-
<br />
titioners not only expressed their anxiety lest <br />
this measure should be passed during the pre- <br />
sent session, but they wished to obtain from the <br />
government a pledge that it would not be carried <br />
through until it had been ﬁrst passed upon by <br />
the people at the polls. The house had now <br />
been in session for a month, and a large num- <br />
ber of petitions, containing very many signa— <br />
tures, had been presented, and he thought it <br />
was about time that the government of this <br />
country should relieve the people from the <br />
anxiety they now felt lest this measure should <br />
be passed through during the present ses- <br />

they could be, the law only referring to bag <br />

the largest size were only taken whilst the <br />
