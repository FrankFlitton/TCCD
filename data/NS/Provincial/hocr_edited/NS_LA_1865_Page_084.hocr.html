making the alteration in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law,</span>
alluded to by <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon</span> Pro. Sec. It was held
out as an induce- <br />
ment to settlers to take up Crown Lands, that <br />
they would be able to pay for them by their ear- <br />
nings from the expenditure of the public monies, <br />
in the opening up of new roads ; but when the <br />
three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> speciﬁed as to the

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> As regards the amount of justice that
Cape <br />
Breton had received in the distribution

that the Government had dealt as liberally with <br />
her as with the rest of the Provinces, he could <br />
not admit that she was under very great obliga- <br />
tions. According to population she had just re— <br />
ceived what she was entitled to, one-ﬁfth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of </span>the <br />
whole grant. This however was a distinct ques— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion,</span> and depended altogether
upon the rights <br />
which the law gave them, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> he

HON. FIN'L. SEC. said that this was not a <br />
question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justice</span> to Cape

Prov. Sec had done perfectly right, in rebuking <br />
the hon member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Inverness,</span>&nbsp;

placing it upon that ground.<br />

Cape Breton had <br />
been treated, either in the distribution of the road <br />
grant, or in any other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">branch</span> of
the public ser- <br />
vices. While some counties had their road grants <br />
decreased, almost every county in that Island<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>
had <br />
theirs increased. <br />

Inverness, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supplemented</span> his new road grant,
as he wanted <br />
them to do, they would have acted contrary to <br />

with the assurance that had been given, that the <br />

the law, as soon as they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span>

that <br />
section of the Province. He pointed out the pro- <br />
visions of the act of 1859, and contended that it <br />
had not been carried out as originally intended. <br />
He alluded to the Crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lands'</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce,</span> and con- <br />
sidered that more energy should be infused into <br />
the working of that department. He pointed out <br />

tion for Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Extension,</span>
which he had <br />
laid on the table some days <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">previously.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In</span> <br />
doing so, he stated that he did not intend oc- <br />
cupying the attention of the house with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span>
<br />
lengthy remarks, for the simple reason that the <br />
policy that this resolution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propounded,</span>
and the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure </span>it involved, had been fully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discus-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sed,</span> and had received the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sanc</span>tion of a large <br />
majority of the Legistlature. He would not <br />
open the useless discussion whether the pre— <br />
sent mode of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction</span>
railroads was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><br />
best. Sufﬁce it to say, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span>
had <br />
decided, after a great deal of discussion, to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construet</span> Provincial Railways
by Provincial <br />
funds. When that policy was propounded by <br />
the house, it was in connection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with a </span>certain <br />
scheme of railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extension</span> — that certain <br />
lines of communication should be carried out <br />
under that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">policy,</span> and the act
originally placed <br />
on the statute book, and under which the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span>

mile of railway was put under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contract</span>,

the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">borders</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Brunswick, to the Gulf of <br />St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lawrence,</span> to the
Granville Beach <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span><br />
the Bay of Fundy. The house would see that<br />
the object was obviously to give to all the peo- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ple</span> in the different sections of the Province, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> <br />
fully as was possible, the advantages of rail-<br />
way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">communication.</span>&nbsp; The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cost</span> of railway con- <br />
struction, however, in this Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proved</span>
to<br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worth</span> so much more than was
anticipated<br />
at the time the act was placed on the statute- <br />
book, that it was found impossible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to go</span> on <br />
