the attention of the House, and from which some <br />
valuable hints may be had from the same source. <br />
Many persons have been frightened into ihe idea <br />

terests of the Province. They will perceive that <br />
the same style of argument was used against the <br />
adoption of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clauses</span> in the
Constitution of the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I read <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
the same author : <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ This feature of the Constitution gave
rise to <br />
most animated discussion, in which reason was <br />
employed to demonstrate the mischiefs of the sys- <br />
tem, and imagination to pourtray, them in all the <br />
the exaggerations which fear and prophecy could <br />
invent. Looking back, indeed, to that period <br />
with the calmness with which we naturally review <br />
events and occurrences, which are now felt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span>
<br />
matters of history,one is surprised at the puerility <br />
of some of the objections, the absurdity of others, <br />
and the overwrought coloring of almost all which <br />
were urged on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head</span> against
the Constitution. <br />
That some of them had a just foundation need not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
be denied or concealed, for the system was  <br />
human, and the result of compromise and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span>
<br />
ciliation in which something of the correctness of <br />
theory was yielded to the interests or prejudices <br />
of particular States, and something of inequality  <br />
of beneﬁt borne for the common good.” <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I would ask if that is not the same
ordeal that <br />
we are passing through now, and precisely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />

change in its constitution must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experience.</span>

exaggerated,<br />

been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to  <br />
have done so, in more graphic terms than that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
used by the writer he had just quoted. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Now sir, I have said that British statesmen<br />
look upon Union, as the best mode of
providing<br />
for the defence of these Colonies, in time
of<br />
danger, and from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> remarks of Lord Derby, it <br />
would be seen that he never contemplated
the <br />
possibility <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> its being rejected by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Colonies, <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">but rather looked upon it as a thing already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pas-</span> <br />

sed. But what says the press of England, that <br />
exponent of public opinion, what says the London <br />
Times,which every Englishman reads, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
<br />
howver much it may be sneered at by some, <br />
largely moulds the opinions, not only of the  <br />
British nation, but of the civilized world. What <br />
do we ﬁnd in its columns on the subject?  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “But for war, and the forays,
raids, and other <br />
outrages that lead to it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span>
is no reason why <br />
every province should not be politically <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indepen-</span>
<br />
dent of its neighbor. We unite for security, and <br />
the greater the danger, or the more powerful the <br />
possible aggressor, the larger the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union</span>
necessary <br />
for self-defence. To England it is a matter of <br />
very little importance whether she sends one <br />
Governor or half-a-dozen to her American Colo- <br />
nies and the relations of those communities, one <br />
with another are only a matter of local conveni- <br />
ence. But we are approaching a very different<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />  <br />
state of things. The Government at Washington <br />
sees, as it believes the beginning of the end, and <br />
now announces, with more conﬁdence than ever, <br />
that this is the last campaign and that this very <br />
summer will see Federal unity not only restored <br />
but ready for Federal action. They make no <br />
secret of their intentions to present an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enormous</span> <br />
list of demands, which they are quite aware we, <br />
shall not acknowledge, and which, indeed, they <br />
do not wish us to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledge."</span> <br />

military <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">command.</span> Do what we
will, no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unity</span> <br />
of administration that we can establish will be <br />
equal to that of the invader. If this disadvantage <br />
be urged as an argument against the very at- <br />
tempt, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is our duty to reply
that the Provinces <br />
farthest outlaying from the colonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">centre,</span>
and <br />
most obnoxious to the ottack of
the foe, are just  <br />
those which would most depend upon our aid.  <br />
That gives us a special voice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />in
their case. If<br />
the Maritime Provinces seriously intend to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adhere</span> <br />
to the British Crown, it is impossible to say  <br />
what ﬂeets, what garrisons, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span>
ironclads, what <br />
ordnance we shali have to pour into Halifax and  <br />
the other ports, all at our cost. Having, then,  <br />
an additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> to speak in

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assist</span> in their own defence, and
to prove <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span>  <br /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">patriotism</span>
