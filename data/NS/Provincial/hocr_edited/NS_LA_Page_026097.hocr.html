<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> he said of them that they saved that
much. The <br />
Hon Finl. Sec. undertook to prove that the <br />
member for Colchester was wrong in his state- <br />
ment that a larger expenditure would be re- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> uired for the future, for the maintenance
of <br />
the railroads, than had been necessary.<span class="unclear" title="“extra" period="" that="" is="" not="" needed”="">?</span> in
the <br />
past. Upon referring to the returns he found <br />
that the cost of maintenance had been steadily <br />
increasing year by year. He would be the <br />
last person to alarm people as to the state of <br />
the railroads, but every body knew that every <br />
year the roads necessarily became more worn <br />
out, and required repair. In 1861, the cost of <br />
maintenance amounted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$34,000;</span>
in 1862, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$37,000.</span> In ’63, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$47,000,</span> and in the nine months <br />
of 1864 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000.</span> He did not
wish to detain the <br />
House much longer, but he would give them a <br />
few ﬁgures shewing what Cape Breton would <br />
have to pay towards the railway system <br />
of Nova Scotia. She would be required to <br />
pay one-ﬁfth of the whole debt—or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$128,000.</span>
<br />
The hon. member for Halifax talked about <br />
mud roads as if they were of no consequence <br />
at all. If he represented a country constitu- <br />
ency he would ﬁnd it a matter of a little more <br />
importance then he seemed to think it now. <br />
He is only willing to give us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$100,000</span>
for what <br />
he calls mud roads, but is perfectly ready to <br />
vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$556,000</span> a year for iron
roads. Now he <br />
(Mr. B.) would yield to no man, in his opinion <br />
as to the importance of railroads to a country, <br />
but if they were only to be obtained by sacriﬁ- <br />
cing the common roads which were of so much <br />
importance to the great mass of the people he <br />
would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inclined</span> to pause,
before incurring <br />
any greater liability. At all events he could <br />
not see how any one could doubt the propriety <br />
of adopting the course proposed by the mem- <br />
ber for Colchester, to wait for a twelve month,<br />
and see how affairs looked then, we would <br />
then be able to ascertain how much the Pictou <br />
road was actually going to cost. At present that <br />
was uncertain. He had had a conversation <br />
with contractors who had been employed on <br />
the Truro road and they laughed at the idea of <br />
its being built for two millions of dollars. Un- <br />
der these circumstances as a member of the <br />
house, and a representative from Cape Breton <br />
he was not prepared to authorize the enormous <br />
expenditure contemplated by the resolution <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bef</span>ore the house and he should
vote against <br />
them. <br />

GEN. said—I do not intend to <br />
address the house at any very great length <br />
upon this question, but I cannot allow the ob- <br />

to pass unanswered. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is a</span>
subject with <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> every gentleman in

acquainted, that I think it is hardly necessary <br />
to direct attention back for the last eleven<br />
years in order to ascertain the policy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of'
the</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house</span> on the subject of
railways. The idea of <br />
building a railroad to Annapolis dates as far <br />
back as 1854, when the country was led to be- <br />
lieve that for a million of money they were <br />
going to have railway communication from <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Halifax</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the Gulf <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of' St.Lawrence on the</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> named, the points referred to could be
reached.<br />
The experience of a few years, however, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soon</span><br />
dissipated that idea; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although the</span>
policy<br />
has partially failed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for want</span> of
means, yet the<br />
house remained pledged to carry on these im-<br />
portant works so soon as the ﬁnances of the <br />
country would admit.  It was, therefore, no <br />
new policy that the government introduced <br />
last year, but one that was initiated and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
proved of years ago.  Such. then, being the <br />
case, it is not for us now to consider the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cor-</span> <br />
rectness or incorrectness of the idea.  The <br />
country at that time was divided upon the <br />
question of building railways.  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Some
thought</span>
<br />
it inadvisable to embark in the enterprise at <br />
all; some were in favor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
their being built by <br />
government; whilst others—and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they
formed a</span>
<br />
large section of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> house and
of the country <br />
—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> in favor of their
construction by private <br />
companies under legislative subventions. <br />
Those who were opposed altogether to rail- <br />
roads formed but a small class in the country, <br />
and I am happy to ﬁnd that one of the repre- <br />
sentatives of that section has at length given <br />
in his adhesion to the system, and approves of <br />
their construction under the policy ﬁrst inau-<br />
gurated.  As to whether that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
the best sys- <br />
tem or not it is unnecessary to advert in the <br />
present discussion; that question was settled <br />
last year, and nothing has since occurred to <br />
alter the position of affairs.  The only point, <br />
then, that now arises for consideration is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
question as to whether the ﬁnances of the pro- <br />
vince are in a condition to warrant the con- <br />
struction of these works in the modiﬁed form <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> by the resolution now
before the <br />
house. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">There are many considerations to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be thought</span>
<br />
of in connection with this subject, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but
</span>the pa- <br />
ramount one is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to </span>keep up the
credit of the <br />
country and to maintain mviolate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the
good</span>
<br />
faith of the province.  If we can do this, then <br />
I think we are warranted in going on with <br />
these works.  In the consideration of this ques- <br />
tion I intend principally to refer to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposi-</span> <br />
tion given to it by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span>
member for South <br />
Colchester (Mr. Archibald) and to the course <br />
he has thought proper to pursue; and I cannot <br />
avoid saying that the position taken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by
that</span>
<br />
hon. gentleman, in regard to one or two other <br />
important subjects to which he had been pre- <br />
viously committed, has rather astonished me. <br />
In regard to the School Bill, for instance, no <br />
one was more thoroughly committed to that <br />
measure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">action
last</span>
session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> the <br />
hon. gentleman; in fact, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span>
went even further <br />
than the views of the government on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uject; while</span> this year he has
adopted a policy <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">totally inconsistent</span> with the
course he then <br />
pursued.  I think that hon. gentleman ought <br />
to have more regard for the position he occu- <br />
ies as leader of the opposition than to come <br />
here, as he did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yesterday, and, </span>in
relation to <br />
this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> admit that he
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> such <br />
gross <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mistakes in </span>his
calculations; and my <br />
hon. friend the Financial Secretary was quite <br />
justiﬁed in the remark that it was highly cul<span class="unclear" title="“confused" with="" word”="">?</span>- <br />
pable in one occupying his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to found</span> <br />
arguments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon a</span> subject <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to which </span>he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confess-</span> <br />
ed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he had</span> not given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
its importance demanded.  He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has given</span> evi- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
dence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occasions, of</span>
his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span><br />
sift <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">analyze</span> ﬁnancial statements; and<br />
there is no doubt that, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span>
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had </span>the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incli-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nation,</span> he was quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">competent to</span> ascertain,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
