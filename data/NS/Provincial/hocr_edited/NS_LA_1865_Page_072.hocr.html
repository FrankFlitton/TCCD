<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> we  should prepare for war, and I belive
that<br />
one of the best preparations is that of uniting<br />
ourselves to meet any contingency. <br />
But it has been said, will union give us one<br />
soldier more? It may not; but it will place<br />
out military resources under one head, and<br />
the force of the whole union could be concen-<br />
trated and moved with a celerity and in bodies<br />
which could not take place if we remain isola-<br />
ted. It has been said that our men, in case of<br />
war, will be required in Canada to defend its<br />
exposed frontier. It seems to me, however, <br />
that the reverse would be the case, and I agree<br />
with the member for South Colchester, that in<br />
the contingency of war, the maritime colonies<br />
would most probably be the first point of<br />
attack. This was the case in the time of the<br />
old French war; it was not until Louisburg<br />
had fallen that the campaign against Canada<br />
had commenced, and this would most probably<br />
be the case again. I may refer, in connection<br />
with this subject, to the unanimous resolution<br />
of this house to place the entire militia of the <br />
province at the disposal of the province of<br />
New Brunswick at the period when the fron-<br />
tier of the latter was threatened by the State<br />
of Maine. Had there been an union of the <br />
colonies it would not have been necessary to <br />
await the action of the legislature, the central<br />
power would at once have detailed to the <br />
threatened point whatever number of men<br />
was required for defence.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Again, Union in my mind means a closer<br />
connection with England. We see this from<br />
the tone of the publice journals, from the<br />
speeches in Parliament, and more particularly<br />
from the important despatch of Mr. Cardwell<br />
which has been so widely circulated. We<br />
could not please the British Government or<br />
people between, we could not more readily incduce<br />
them to assist us, as they promise to do, by the<br />
whole resources of the mother country, than<br />
by adopting the scheme of the union. But it<br />
has been asserted that we need not trouble<br />
ourselves about Canada for the power of Eng-<br />
land will always protect us in Nova Scotia.<br />
Well, suppose we admit this, would we be so<br />
pusillanimous as to act upon it? I hardly<br />
think any honorable gentleman or his consti-<br />
tuents would recommend the adoption of such<br />
a course. It appears to me that for the weal or for<br />
woe these colonies are and must be bound to-<br />
gether. Again, Union will bring with it large <br />
commercial advantages, by breaking down<br />
hostile tariffs and introducing free trade and<br />
manufactures, Hitherto we have been crippl-<br />
ed by a want of knowledge and commu-<br />
nication. If there is one object more than<br />
another which Nova Scotians have been long<br />
desirous of obtaining it has been this great<br />
object. The last scheme in reference to it was<br />
one which compelled this Province to pay<br />
more than many of us thought it ought to bear,<br />
but, nevertheless, the house adopted it, so great<br />
were the advantages expected to be realized<br />
by it. Now we are offered this railway on <br />
terms more advantageous than we had any<br />
reason to anticipate, and yet those who have <br />
heretofore been so anxious to accomplish so<br />
great an object now refuse to accept it, and <br />
cast away a boon of priceless value,—a con-<br />
duct which seems to me to border on infatua-<br />
tion. Anither result of union will be to afford<br />
a field for the energy and industry of our</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">young men. We have long wanted such open-<br />
ings for enterprize, and the absence of them<br />
has driven away a large portion of the youth<br />
of the country. The member for North Col-<br />
chester spoke most glowingly of the resources<br />
and advantages of this Province. Why, I<br />
should ask him, have they not been able to in-<br />
duce the flower of our population to remain<br />
within our limits? I have heard it stated that <br />
there are no less than 30,000 Nova Scotians<br />
within or in the vicinity of the city of Boston.<br />
Upon what principles can we account for this?<br />
It is because we offer no adequate inducements<br />
for our young men to remain. The expa-<br />
triate themselves in order to enjoy the larger<br />
field and better chances of success offered in<br />
the United States than here. I often look <br />
around in my own city and ask myself how<br />
many of those who were educated with me<br />
are still to be found within its limits. Many<br />
are beneath the green sod; but many are<br />
still living, but not here,—they are far away,<br />
in the neighboring States and elsewherem push-<br />
ing their fortunes, and forever lost to us. I ask<br />
any person familiar with Halifax to look at the<br />
signs over the stores in any of the streets—in<br />
Granville street, for instance, and count how<br />
many of their occupants are natives of the <br />
City. The great majority of our business men<br />
are either from abroad or from the country. A<br />
short time since I was asked to look at the<br />
will of one of our staunch yeomen in the rural<br />
districts of this country. In it he had named<br />
his several children, and I was surprised to <br />
observe—and it is an excellent commentary<br />
upon the point—how few there were in Nova <br />
Scotia. One son was in California, one in Ne-<br />
vada, another in Kansas, and a fourth in<br />
Massachusetts. All the enterprising and ener-<br />
getic had carried their talents and industry to<br />
places where they could be better remunerated.<br />
We have devoted a portion of our public funds<br />
to the introduction of immigrants. I would<br />
rather, Mr. Speaker, bring back our Nova<br />
Scotia exiles than gather all the immigrants<br />
we could obtain from abroad, if we only had<br />
the inducements to offer them to remain.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Again, if we had union, we should possess<br />
more of a national position than we do at pre-<br />
sent. Let any Nova Scotian cross the Atlantic<br />
and he will soon learn the estimation in which<br />
he is held as a Provincial. I recollect an in-<br />
stance which occurred to myself when travel-<br />
ling the Continent, and how keenly I felt<br />
the different position a Colonist held from that<br />
of an American citizen. Notwithstanding the<br />
remarks of the hon. member for North Col-<br />
chester, I am persuaded that our leading men,<br />
under the Union, will have their minds en-<br />
larged and take a higher position as statesmen<br />
than they can possibly do in the small and de-<br />
grading discussion which occupy too much of<br />
the time of each Provincial Legislature. Be-<br />
fore the American Revolution, there was not a<br />
single man in the old Colonies who at that<br />
time had acquired an European reputation but<br />
Franklin. Washington was only known as a <br />
Colonel of Militai, Adams was but a village<br />
attorney, and the same may be said of jeffer-<br />
son, Madison, and other eminent men of the <br />
day. They occupied positions such as colonists<br />
occupy to-day. When, however, the war was<br />
over, and the United States assumed a national<br />
character, these men rose to their position, and<br />
took high rank in the estimation of the world.<br />
Though we do not wish independence, but con-<br />
