he could say that it was the result of a great <br />

few days last session, professed a great desire <br />
to assist in the revision, but he soon got tired <br />
of the work. The hon. gentleman would not <br />
deny that in his own profession of medicine <br />
new works were continually coming out, and <br />
new modes of treatment suggested. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PROV.</span>

to a committee as suggested by the hon. mem- <br />

making another revision. He hoped if that <br />
were done, they would turn their attention to <br />
an act which was at present giving the govern- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> RAILWAY TO SYDNEY.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. SHANNON reported up from Committee <br />
on Private bills, the bill to incorporate Sydney <br />
&amp; Louisburg Railway Company, with amend- <br />
ments. One obliges the Company to pay<br />
up 25 per cent of the stock, and another re-<br />
quires them to hold their meetings of Directors<br />
in this province.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. PRO. SEC. said, in reference to the
last <br />
amendment, that the committee appeared to <br />
have introduced narrower restrictions than <br />
the bills of incorporation passes last ses-<br />
session.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. BOURINOT said that the other compa-<br />
nies in Cape Breton had the right to meet in<br />
United States as well as in this province, and<br />
he did not see why the present company<br />
should be restricted in the way proposed.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. ARCHIBALD thought it would be invi-<br />
dious to place such a restriction upon the pre-<br />
sent comapny.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. SHANNON said that the committee <br />
were unanimous on that point, understanding<br />
that difficulties had occurred under the pre-<br />
vious bills. The gentlemen interested in the <br />
bill, however, had not been consulted in refer-<br />
ence to the matter.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. PRO. SEC. thought it would be advisa-<br />
able for the Committee to ascertain from these<br />
gentlement their views on the subject, and <br />
suggested than the hon. Mr. Shannon do not<br />
report the bill up until the Committee en-<br />
quired in reference to this point.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TOBIN</span>
was inclined to favour the  <br />
amendment, and expressed his opinion that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
the 25 per cent. the stock should be paid in <br />
Nova Scotia currency, not in greenbacks. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. MCFARLANE pointed out certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
provisions in the bill which might be consider- <br />
ed to protect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁciently</span>
individual interests <br />
in this province, and stated he did not think <br />
the amendment proposed at all necessary. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. ATTY. GENL. was opposed to obliging <br />
these gentlemen to hold their meetings in this <br />
Province. The Mining Association, it would<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
be remembered, held their annual meetings in <br />
London.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BLANCHARD stated that the 25 per cent

would of course be payable in our currency, <br />
