with his usual ability had so clear- <br />
ly justiﬁed the attitude of opposition he had <br />
assumed to this resolution, and shown it to be <br />
the duty of every man who regarded the cre- <br />
dit and welfare of the country to oppose it, that <br />
it was unnecessary to go over the same ground. <br />
He could not, however, refrain from alluding <br />
to the impropriety of the course pursued by <br />
the government, in delaying the consideration <br />
of this important question—the most impor- <br />
tant, ﬁnancially, that had engaged the atten- <br />
tion of the house—until this late period of the <br />
session, when some of the members had re- <br />
turned to their homes, and there was no pro- <br />
bability of its receiving that attention its im- <br />
portance demanded. Too much of the busi- <br />
ness of the house was done in that way. On <br />
the subject of railway extension, he would say <br />
that if the province was justiﬁed at all in <br />
entering upon any further expenditure, the <br />
line to the borders of New Brunswick, to con- <br />
nect with the railway system of the United <br />
States, should be the ﬁrst to receive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conside-</span><br />
ration, and he was not prepared to say if that <br />
had been proposed by itself, whether it would <br />
have received his opposition, provided he <br />
could be convinced the country could bear <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">burthen</span> of its construction
with- <br />
out injury to other important services. <br />
But there certainly could be no doubt that the <br />
ﬁnances of this province would not admit of <br />
the construction of both lines at the same time <br />
even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> they were admitted to be
necessary to <br />
the public convenience. With regard to the <br />
Annapolis line he could only look up it as an <br />
accomodation to one or two counties at the ex- <br />
pense of the whole province. Party necessity <br />
or political expediency might secure its con- <br />
struction, but those who helped to place this <br />
liability on their constituents would yet have <br />
to meet a day of reckoning. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Finl.</span>
Sec. <br />
endeavoured to shew in supporting the Rail- <br />
way policy of the government that certain ser- <br />
vices could be cut down, some of them of the <br />
most vital consequence to the country. Thus <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admitting</span> that we must hereafter
either lose <br />
our pubic grants or be more heavily taxed. <br />
He thought that if there was no other reason <br />
for opposition if the Finl. Secy. was obliged to <br />
admit that he could not expect to meet this <br />
expenditure, without depriving them of some <br />
of the most essential services the province re- <br />
quired, that of itself ought to be sufﬁicient <br />
reason to deter gentlemen from voting for this <br />
resolution and he begged them to be warned <br />
in time. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> had promised not to
make any <br />
lengthy observations and he should not do so. <br />
He had risen principally to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make </span>these
expla- <br />
nations in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequence </span>of the
position he <br />
had taken last year, and because the re- <br />
marks he then made had not been reported. <br />
He would ask gentlemen from all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parts of</span>
the <br />
province, and particularly these representing <br />
the more remote sections, whether they were <br />
prepared to assume the enormous liability <br />
this resolution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed—a</span>
liability which <br />
would cramp our resources, and weigh upon <br />
the industry and energies of our people for <br />
the next twenty years. He for one was not pre- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pared</span> to do so; and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voting </span>against the reso- <br />
lution he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered<span class="unclear" title="“there is an extra dot here which is not needed">?.</span> he was</span>
acting with a due <br />
regard to the interests of the whole province, <br />
and those especially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who</span> had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elected</span> him as<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their representative. The adoption of
this<br />
policy, it was</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admitted,</span> would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lead </span>either to <br />
the increase of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> or
the reduction of <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> those grants which have been always consi-<br />
dered essential to the interests of the country. <br />
Their constituents might not complain until <br />
they experienced that result; but when rail-<br />
way interest had absorbed all the revenue, <br />
and nothing was left for roads, schools, navi- <br />
gation securities, or other services, gentlemen <br />
around these benches would then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear
their</span>
<br />
reproaches. Instead of diminishing the grants <br />
to these sources as intimated by the Financial <br />
Secretary, he contended they should be in- <br />
creased from year to year with the increasing <br />
wants of the country. In that view of the case, <br />
then, he did not think it was wise or prudent, <br />
but on the contrary the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most reckless</span>
folly, to <br />
incur this heavy expenditure. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He would
be</span> <br />
ashamed to show himself among the people of <br />
Cape Breton, who are already so largely taxed <br />
for railways in Nova Scotia proper, from which <br />
they derive little beneﬁt, if he voted for this <br />
resolution. He could be guilty of no greater <br />
injustice towards them than to add so largely <br />
to the railway burdens <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> now
so unjustly <br />
bear. In comparison with this question every <br />
other of a ﬁnancial nature before them this <br />
winter was simply insigniﬁcant, and no small <br />
considerations should inﬂuence the course of <br />
gentlemen in regard to it. The hon. member <br />
concluded by referring to the haste with which <br />
this measure was pressed through the house. <br />
It took years before the Pictou railway bill <br />
was placed on the statute book; and here they <br />
were asked with scarcely any discussion on <br />
consideration, to pass a measure involving an <br />
annual liability of something like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$230,000,</span>
in <br />
addition to $360,000 which they would at least <br />
have to pay on the completion of the Pictou <br />
road. He trusted that gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would
pause</span>
<br />
before they committed themselves to this mea- <br />
sure, and would, at all events, wait until the <br />
Pictou road was completed before they incurred <br />
fresh liabilities—which he was convinced the <br />
province was not at present in a position to <br />
assume. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BLANCHARD</span>
said that he did not agree <br />
with the member for Richmond in his idea, <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> in
introducing this mea- <br />
sure were inﬂuenced by a desire to assist the <br />
confederation scheme. In his judgment, the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">government, by taking this step, had put
con- <br />
ederation out of the question for at least 20<br />
years to come. When these proposed lines of <br />
railway are completed, the debt of Nova Scotia <br />
will amount to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$11,085,000</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">; and</span> if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he under-</span> <br />
stood anything about the terms agreed upon <br />
at the Quebec Conference, .<span class="unclear" title="“there is an extra dot here which does not seem needed”=">?</span>the
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span>
was <br />
to be admitted into the Union with a debt of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$8,000,000—anything</span> beyond that was to be <br />
borne by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">individually—and</span> <br />
would have to be raised by direct taxation. <br />
Therefore he could not see that the govern-<br />
ment were serving the best interests of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confe-</span>
<br />
deration by the introduction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of this</span>
measure. <br />
At this late period of the session, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span>
most <br />
of the members had returned to theirhomes, <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those"</span> who remained were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not in the</span> <br />
humor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to listen</span> to long
speeches, he did not <br />
intend to address the house at any very great <br />
length, but he would refer, shortly, to some of <br />
the remarks <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made </span>by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />honourable <br />
Financial Secretary. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> That
honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />gen- <br />
tleman stated that he based his calculations <br />
upon the assumption that the revenue for this <br />year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same, </span>if not larger, than the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span>ast.  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />On <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a former</span> occasion he (Mr. B.) had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the assertion that</span> at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no time</span> did our <br />
