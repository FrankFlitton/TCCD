<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> as I have stated, was. an invitation from
St. <br />
John .to the government and the united Legisla <br />
tures of that country to come down and receive <br />
an ovation at their hands. Nor was the city of<br />
Halifax slow in following the example, for at a <br />
meeting convened by the Mayor upon a public <br />
requisition in this city, an invitation was extend- <br />
ed by the citizens of Halifax to the Legislature <br />
of Canada to come here and receive an ovation <br />
also at their hands—indicating, asf ar as it was <br />
possible, that the events which had taken place <br />
in Canada entitled the Government and Legis- <br />
lature of that country to courtesies such as had <br />
never been extended to them before. Although <br />
the Legislature of Canada was not able for- <br />
mally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> accept that invitation,
a number of <br />
gentlemen connected with various public posi- <br />
tions in the country came down to St John <br />
and Halitax. I need hardly tell this House <br />
how they were received. So far from<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
having <br />
been met with any spirit of hostility, they were <br />
received with open arms, and the hospitalities <br />
of these two citi s in the two provinces extend- <br />
ed to them in a manner that was worthy of <br />
both. As late as a year ago in August 1864, <br />
at the public entertainment which was given <br />
in this city, and before the Conference had met <br />
at Charlottetown—when these gentlemen were <br />
received <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here,—a</span> member of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> go- <br />
vernment, standing at the table, advocated in <br />
the most eloquent terms a Union of all British <br />
North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America. </span>That advocacy
was received, <br />
as had always been the case in the city of <br />
Halifax, by every demonstration of enthusiasm <br />
and approval that it was in the power of an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> <br />
telligent people to give; but more than that, on <br />
that occasion, I took the opportunity of observ- <br />
ing that when I had moved a resolution <br />
tor a Union of the Maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span>
I did it <br />
with the conviction that an immediate <br />
consolidation of all British North America <br />
was impracticable—and that I hailed with <br />
the utmost satisfaction the evidence that <br />
had been since given that the smaller <br />
Union which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contemplated</span> was
likely to be <br />
merged into a far greater and more comprehen— <br />
sive scheme. On that occasion, I need not state <br />
to gentlemen w o are resident in this city. Mr. <br />
Howe again responded in the terms which <br />
he had always been accustomed to use on <br />
this question. He said, although the hour <br />
was late it was oi little consequence, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span>
his <br />
voice had been heard in every chief city not <br />
only Nova of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia, and</span> New
Brunswick, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
Canada advocating the consolidation of all Bri- <br />
tish North America; and there he committed <br />
himself, in the most unqualiﬁed manner in fa— <br />
vour of such a union—declaring that it was the <br />
dream of his life, and that he would look for- <br />
ward to its realization with the highest satisfac- <br />
ﬁon  I do not refer to this as attaching any <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">importance</span> to what may fall from Mr. <br />
However myself, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I call</span>
attention to these <br />
facts to show that when public men on various <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occasions</span> gave in their hearty
adhesion to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posal</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to unite</span> Canada with the Maritime Pro-
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vinces, so</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far</span> from the sentiments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> pro- <br />
ounded</span>
sinking them in public estimation - so <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far from</span> the press and people of
this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country ex-</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> pressing their dissent from the course
that was <br />
pursued—that in the light of the fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that a</span>
<br />
Conference was to be held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at Charlottetown,</span>
and <br />
that a deputation of the Canadian Governmen <br />
were to attend this Conference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
a view of <br />
endeavouring to accomplish the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger Union</span>
of <br />
British North America, as far as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the public</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men of</span> this or the other
Provinces are con- <br />
cerned, there was every reason to believe that <br />
what was proposed met with the entire approval <br />
and the concurrence of the people. As I have <br />
already stated the Canadian deputation received <br />
—and after much consultation and deliberation, <br />
the most prominent public men in all these Pro- <br />
vinces came to the conclusion that there was a <br />
fair and legitimate prospect to believe that <br />
at another conference they would be able to de- <br />
vise such measures for a Union as would se- <br />
cure the conﬁdence, co operation, and assent of <br />
all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> Provinces. Under these
circumstan-&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
ces the Canadian delegates returned home, and <br />
the Governor General, acting upon their ad- <br />
vice and under the sanction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Crown,</span>
<br />
given in the most emphatic terms, invited the <br />
appointment of delegates frdm the maritime <br />
provinces for the purpose of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taking</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into consi-</span> <br />
deration the question of the wider Union. That <br />
action has been challenged as an unconstitu- <br />
tional proceeding. I will not, in an assembly <br />
like this, attempt any vindication of the strict <br />
constitutionality of such a course. Sufﬁce <br />
it to say, there stood upon the journals of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature not</span> only the approval
of such a <br />
course as that, but the declaration of the Colo- <br />
nial Secretary that the British government <br />
would be ready to pay the utmost deference to <br />
any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposal— that</span> might
emanate from any <br />
scheme that might be agreed upon by the gov- <br />
ernments of the different provinces, and author- <br />
izing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> conference to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">held. </span>The resolution <br />
which passed the house at its last session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span> <br />
vided that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatever</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agreement was</span> come to <br />
should receive the sanction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
<br />
legislatures&nbsp; No action, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> proposed <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be taken by</span>
the conference at Quebec which <br />
did not involve the same legitimate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">course to</span> <br />
be taken. All that the legislature had demand- <br />
ed—all that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
imperial government as well had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demanded -</span>
<br />
as- he necessary constitutional course prelimi- <br />
nary to change the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution, </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> observed <br />
by the Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conference, and</span>

union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for these</span> <br />

the imperial government, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the different</span> <br />
legislatures <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> previous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> an <br />
application being made to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imperial</span>
authori- <br />
ties to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect to</span> the
scheme by an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">act passed</span> <br />
bythe British p<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arliament. I</span>
need not tell the <br />
house <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that a</span> body of public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span>

Quebec—similar to no other body that ever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">met</span>
