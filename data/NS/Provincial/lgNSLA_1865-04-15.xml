  <!--<p>and power
he possessed to carry out his ob<lb break="no"/>ject in definance of the people. Holding
the senti<lb break="no"/>ments he did, there was great room to
fear, that<lb/>
our rights and liberties were endangered ;
and <lb/>
under such circumstances it was time
gentlemen<lb/>
sitting around these benches, should put
thel<lb/>
house in order. It should be recollected
that the<lb/>
leader of the government had great powers
in his <lb/>
hands—he could control the public patronage—<lb/>
he had command of the public funds. He
might<lb/>
be induced to use all influences to
promote a <lb/>
scheme of which he was so enthusiastic an
advo<lb break="no"/>cate.  It would be well for gentlemen to
consider<lb/>
these things before it was too late. He
did not in<lb break="no"/>tend to follow the hon. Provincial
Secretary after<lb/>
the lengthy reply of the hon. member for
Guys-<lb break="yes"/>
bro, and because a  more suitable
opportunity<lb/>
would offer to answer him. But he must den<lb break="no"/>ounce the assertion made for a purpose,
that any<lb/>
large number of the people favored the
scheme of<lb/>
the Quebec Conference. Such an assertion
from<lb/>
any reliable source might do much harm. He<lb/>
did not, however, think any statements of the<lb/>
hon. member were entitled to much credit.  There<lb/>
were few public men in the country who stood in<lb/>
a more unenviable position as respects thier unre-<lb break="maybe"/>
liabilit than the hon. Provincial Secretary.<lb/>
            </p>


















            <p>He thought he was done with the hon. member<lb/>
for Halifax, but he found it was not the
case; that<lb/>
hon. gentleman with his usual
appropriateness of<lb/>
illustration, had referred to the
demonstration<lb/>
given in honour of Shakespeare last
spring, which<lb/>
was as far from the present case, as the
hon.<lb/>
memeber himself was from the moon. It was
true<lb/>
the House did adjourn, but it was more in
com<lb break="no"/>pliment to the occasion, than to any
living indi<lb break="no"/>vidual.  What analogy was there between the<lb/>
two cases—between Shakespeare and the Dele<lb break="no"/>gates?  But he (Mr. M.) might be wrong—per-<lb break="maybe"/>
haps he was unable to appreciate the great
acute<lb break="no"/>ness of the hon. member. There might be
some<lb/>
point in the comparison. That the
delegates dealt<lb/>
largely in fiction will not be denied, and
if they<lb/>
put their claim to a demonstration on this
ground<lb/>
he could understand them. When the records<lb/>
were examinined it would be found that the
works<lb/>
of fiction of some of these gentlemen were
numer<lb break="no"/>ous indeed.  If this would entitle them to such<lb/>
an ovation as had been accorded to the great<lb/>
dramatist, he would prefer it would be postponed till <lb/>
they were 300 years dead.</p>


            <p>Mr. Miller concluded by saying that as the<lb/>
hon. Provincial Secretary had stated that the<lb/>
Volunteers were not to take any part in the<lb/>
demonstration of that evening his object was<lb/>
gained and it was unnecessary to move any reso<lb break="no"/>lution on the subject.</p>
            <p>Hon. ATTY. GENERAL said if he had ever wit<lb break="no"/>nessed a tempest in a teapot, it was
during that <lb/>
afternoon.  He could, however, easily
understant<lb/>
how the gentlemen opposite would wich to
make<lb/>
a demonstration which might have some effec<lb/>
across the water. They had stated that
nine-<lb break="yes"/>
tenths of the people were opposed to
Confederad<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>tion, and ought now to be satisfied. He doubted,<lb/>
however, the worth of the mere assertions they<lb/>
had made, and the value that would be put upon<lb/>
them in the mother country. It was obvious that<lb/>
if gentlemen had not some covert object in view,<lb/>
the whole subject would have been settled in five <lb/>
minutes.  If anyone had, at the outset, asked the <lb/>
question, whether the volunteers were to take<lb/>
part in the intended demonstration, he would <lb/>
have got an answer immediately. It was useless<lb/>
for gentlemen to try and persuade the House that<lb/>
actually nine-tenths of the people were opposed<lb/>
to Confederation. Only 3000 persons came before <lb/>
the House, stating that they were opposed to<lb/>
Confederation. He knew that a large number of<lb/>
the petitioners were induced to sign the petitions,<lb/>
through false representations that were made to<lb/>
them. Here Mr. Henry went on to refer to the<lb/>
fact that when the delegates were in Canada, the <lb/>
volunteers, on several occasions, took part in the<lb/>
celebration.  He thought that some parties in<lb/>
this country had attempted to mix the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Union with party considerations ever since<lb/>
the celebrated speech at Truro. It was party in<lb break="no"/>fluences that originated the petitions that were got<lb/>
up on this question.  What he desired, was that the<lb/>
people should have every opportunity of discus<lb break="no"/>sing the question in all its bearings.</p>
            <p>The matter then dropped, and the House ad<lb break="no"/>journed over Good Friday until Saturday, at<lb/>
11 o'clock.<lb/>
            </p>

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN. <lb/>
            </head>

            <p>The House of Assembly met this morning at<lb/>
11 o'clock, and the Provincial Secretary imme<lb break="no"/>diately moved a resolution to adjourn until<lb/>
Monday next. He said:—I need not say that<lb/>
this House has been deeply shocked by the<lb/>
intelligence which has just been received of<lb/>
the death of President Lincoln.   Both branch<lb break="no"/>es of the Legislature having been on Thursday<lb/>
last informed that His Excellency would come<lb/>
down at 3 o'clock for the purpose of assenting<lb/>
to several Bills which have passed, I felt it my<lb/>
duty, proposing as we do, to adjourn this <lb/>
House, to put myself in communication with<lb/>
His Excellency who entirely concurs in the<lb/>
appropriateness of this House marking its sym<lb break="no"/>pathy with the people of the United States,<lb/>
who have thus lost their Chief Magistrate, and<lb/>
their deep abhorrence of the crime by which<lb/>
he had been removed. The House is aware<lb/>
that when exactly four years ago this day the <lb/>
first intelligence reached this country of the<lb/>
commencement of hostilities in the American<lb/>
Republic, this House placed on record its sen<lb break="no"/>timents by the following resolution:—</p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Resolved unanimously that the House of Assembly<lb/>
of Nova Scotia have heard with deep regret of the <lb/>
outbreak of civil war in the United States, that this <lb/>
House, without expressing any opinion upon the <lb/>
points in controversy between the contending parties<lb/>
sincerely lament that tjose who speak their language, <lb/>
and share their civilization should be shedding each<lb/>
other's blood, and offer up their prayers to the Father <lb/>
of the Universe for the speedy restoration of peace."</p></quote>


            <p>This resolution sufficiently marked the feel<lb break="no"/>ings with which this House viewed the begin<lb break="no"/>ing of hostilities which have so long and so <lb/>
terribly distracted the neighboring republic. <lb/>
It is not to be denied that as that struggle ad<lb break="no"/>

vanced, when the people of British North <lb/>
America. witnessed the heroic resistance
that <lb/>
a comparatively small number of
men in the <lb/>
Southern States made against overwhelm<lb break="no"/>ing odds, a large amount of sym<lb break="no"/>pathy was excited in the minds of <lb/>
many—that sympathy which is always excit<lb break="no"/>ed when a small body is seen contending <lb/>
with great bravery against superior numbers— <lb/>
in favour of the South. But although that <lb/>
feeling has existed to some extent—although <lb/>
there have been persons in this country who <lb/>
believe that the material
interests of British <lb/>
America would be promoted by a separation <lb/>
between the Northern and
Southern States, <lb/>
and that great Republic being thus divided <lb/>
into two governments; yet I am
confident <lb/>
that there is not a British subject in British <lb/>
America who will learn the untimely death <lb/>
of President Lincoln and the circum<lb break="no"/>stances under which it has occurred <lb/>
without the feeling of the most unfeign<lb break="no"/>ed sorrow and the most profound regret. <lb/>
It is well known that President Lincoln was <lb/>
elected the President of the United States of <lb/>
America by the intelligent and
freely express<lb break="no"/>ed voice of the people of that great country; <lb/>
and no man who has observed the course that <lb/>
he has pursued can entertain a doubt that he <lb/>
has regarded it as a conscientious duty—a
duty <lb/>
from which,under no circumstances,he was able <lb/>
in the slightest degree, to shrink—to maintain <lb/>
the sovereignty of his government over the <lb/>
entire country. That he has persistently pur<lb break="no"/>sued that policy with an inflexibility of deter<lb break="no"/>mination and strength of purpose which must <lb/>
for ever mark him as a man of command<lb break="no"/>ing talents,no one can deny, and I am satisfied <lb/>
that the sentiment of the people, and of those <lb/>
who are placed over the people, throughout <lb/>
British North America,will agree in the
opinion <lb/>
that he has been actuated by a conscientious <lb/>
discharge of what we believed to be a patriotic <lb/>
duty in that crisis of his country's history. <lb/>
Under these circumstances I feel that it is <lb/>
right that the neighboring governments in B. N. <lb/>
America should, as far as their means would <lb/>
permit, exhibit on the present occasion their <lb/>
deep sympathy with the people of the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring states who have lost their Chief,
<lb/>
Ruler, and, at the same time, mark their deep <lb/>
abhorrence of the atrocious crime by which <lb/>
he has been removed. I have, therefore, to of<lb break="no"/>fer to the House the following resolution: <lb/>
            </p>
  
            <p> <hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved unanimously</hi>:
that this House have <lb/>
heard with the most profound regret that the <lb/>
President of the United States of America has <lb/>
fallen by the hand of an
assassin, and that, as <lb/>
a. mark of sympathy with the people who <lb/>
have thus been deprived of their Chief Ruler, <lb/>
and of their abhorrence of the atrocious crime <lb/>
that has been committed, this House do ad<lb break="no"/>journ until Monday next. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CAMP1">Mr. Stewart Campbell</persName>, who seconded the <lb/> resolution,
                  said:—On any ordinary occasion I <lb/> should regret the absence of the learned
                     mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Colchester, who occupies a position in <lb/> this
                  House which would peculiarly call upon <lb/> him to second any resolution
                  demanding the <lb/> united action of all parties in this House. But <lb/> this
                  resolution is of no party, and requires not <lb/> that any particular individual
                  should second <lb/> it. It is indeed one that need not be form<lb break="no"/>ally
                  ascended by the lips, for it is sustained by <lb/> the feelings of every gentleman
                  around these <cb/> benches. The hon. Provincial Secretary has <lb/> referred to
                  the awful tragedy of which we have <lb/> just received the painful intelligence,
                  in terms <lb/> so feeling, and so appropriate and just, that <lb/> although
                  according to parliamentary usage, I <lb/> have undertaking my present duty, but
                  little <lb/> observation is requisite on my part to confirm <lb/> or endorse those
                  sentiments. We all feel, Sir, <lb/> that an occurrence has taken place which at
                  <lb/> the present age of the world is not only an <lb/> outrage upon an individual
                  and a nationality, <lb/> but is an ourage upon mankind and the civili<lb break="no"/>zation of the world at large; and although we <lb/> belong to
                  another Empire than that in which <lb/> this dreadful scene has been enacted, we
                  are <lb/> deeply moved by the awful fact that there has <lb/> been a gross outrage
                  committed against those <lb/> feelings which are and ever will be, respected <lb/>
                  in every country that prides itself in the pos<lb break="no"/>session of the
                  privileges of civilization and the <lb/> blessings of christianity. I think the
                  course <lb/> taken by the government in adjourning this <lb/> House as a mark and
                  testimony of its feelings <lb/> on the present melancholy occasion is extreme<lb break="no"/>ly appropriate, and will be sure to meet with <lb/> the cordial
                  approval of every member in this <lb/> House and of every man in this country.
                  <lb/>
               </p>
            <p> The resolution passed unanimously, and
the <lb/>
house adjourned. <lb/>

<!-- GL, 2017-04-21, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->
           <!-- <p> MONDAY, 17th April, 1865. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The House met at 11 o'clock. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. ATTY. GEN. introduced a bill to
post<lb break="no"/>pone the ensuing sittings of the supreme court <lb/>
at Halifax for a week, which was read a second <lb/>
time. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. STEWART CAMPBELL introduced a bill<lb/>
to provide for improving a road between Guys- <lb break="maybe"/>
boro and Cape Canso, which was
read a second <lb/>
time. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. BOURINOT introduced a bill to amend <lb/>
the act to incorporate the Block House mining <lb/>
company; a bill to amend the act to incorpo<lb break="no"/>rate the International coal and railway com<lb break="no"/>pany; and a. bill to incorporate the Boston coal <lb/>
mining company. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The house then went into committee, and <lb/>
passed the foregoing bills;
also, a bill in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the settlement of titles in the county of <lb/>
Cape Breton. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The committee having adjourned, <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. C. J. CAMPBELL presented a petition <lb/>
from Malagawatch, Inverness, praying
that <lb/>
the act passed in 1862, depriving them of
their <lb/>
church properties, should be repealed. He <lb/>
stated that there were several petitions on the <lb/>
same subject on the table, and the petitioners <lb/>
had undoubtedly much reason for complaint, <lb/>
but owing to the lateness of the session he was <lb/>
afraid the house could not take the matter up, <lb/>
and give it that consideration which its impor<lb break="no"/>tance demanded. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. HATFIELD resented a petition, and a <lb/>
bill in accordance therewith, giving the propri<lb break="no"/>etors of the old meeting house at Tusket per<lb break="no"/>mission to sell the same. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The house then went into committee, and <lb/>
passed the militia bill with a few verbal alter- <lb break="maybe"/>
