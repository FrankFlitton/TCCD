               the intelligence of the House that he felt it 
               <br />
               hardly right to ask members to listen to any 
               <br />
               arguments. The language used in reference 
               <br />
               to the Inspector of schools was strong but it 
               <br />

               and the conduct of this Inspector afforded a 
               <br />
               complete indication of the remark. The man

               no breach of the peace had been committed. 
               <br />
               In the Act relating to the Union, a clause had

               Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL, said that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> was in the habit of dealing fairly 
               <br />
               with the rights of every religious body. If the 
               <br />
               question was considered in the proper spirit, 
               <br />
               there need be no fear as to any injustice being 
               <br />
               done to any set of men. He re retted that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Colchester ha not provided 
               <br />

               <br />
               rights. He could tell that hon. gentleman from 
               <br />

               he was met by deputations of religious bodies 
               <br />
               asking what could be done to protect their 
               <br />
               property. By the time they got the requisite 
               <br />
               advice, they were unable to give the 30 days 
               <br />
               notice required by the act. The act operated 
               <br />
               before the people knew what todo. It was not
