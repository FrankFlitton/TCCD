               <br />

               had very little connection with the resolution 
               <br />
               under discussion. ' Scarcely a word has fallen 
               <br />
               from their lips upon the question of a union of 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces. As regards that 
               <br />
               union I may say that I am not opposed to it, 
               <br />
               provided that it can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effected</span> upon terms fa—

               edly opposed to it as a means of accomplishing 
               <br />
               the larger union. We have been told that the

               <br />

               N ova Scotia’s most gifted sons should be found 
               <br />
               to have entered into this unholy compact to de- 
               <br />
               stroy our political existence; but, sir, humble 
               <br />
               as I am, I should consider myself recreant to 
               <br />
               my principles, and unworthy of the conﬁdence 
               <br />
               of those who sent me here, if I failed to de- 
               <br />
               nounce, feebly it may be, but to the best of my 
               <br />
               ability, this scheme, which I consider so detri-

               Nova Scotia. Sir, we all remember the old 
               <br />
               story ofEsau selling his birthright for a mess 
               <br />
               of pottage, and how heafterwartls regretted it 
               <br />
               with an exceeding bitter cry-but there was 
               <br />
               this to be said in excuse for his conduct, that he 
               <br />
               soldit when he was hungry, and at all events 
               <br />
               he received some return,——whereas the Pro-

               <br />
               der of her rights would be a mess of bitter 
               <br />
               herbs, to be eaten in sorrow and digested in
