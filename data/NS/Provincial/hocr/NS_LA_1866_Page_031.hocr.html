               A cause which requires an advocacy like that 
               <br />
               must indeed be in want of arguments on which

               pudiaied, conﬁdence betrayed, and barefaced treach-

               ery exhibited. [ sat in the gallery, and witnessed 
               <br />
               the perpetration of this act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> turpimde, and 
               <br />
               heard the whisper circulated from ear to ear—" l‘ho 
               <br />
               traitor has been bought." l‘he scene reminded me of 
               <br />
               what transpired in the Parliament House in Dublin, 
               <br />
               at the commencement of the present century, when 
               <br />
               the seductive inﬂuence of British gold corrupted I 
               <br />
               Parliament, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">professed</span> patriotism was bought and 
               <br />
               sold like bank stock, or any other marketable commo- 
               <br />
               dity. I asked myself whether the temptations of 
               <br />
               either proffered oiiicial aggrandiseinent and emolu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               bership ofasoeial club, was a sulﬁcient pretext for 
               <br />
               party treachery, tor the glaring tergiversation of oft 
               <br />
               repeated and publicly avowed opinions,—and what is 
               <br />
               more, for the betrayal of acountry’s dearest interests, 
               <br />
               and the diabolical destruction of its constitution."
