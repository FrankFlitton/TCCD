               do so as the means to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> end : annex uion to

               the United States, but I ﬁrml y believe hat will

               blessings which ﬂow to us from the constitu-

               tion under which we live, and if I were so 
               <br />
               craven hearted as not to be ready to meet any 
               <br />
               danger arising to us because of our connection 
               <br />
               with England, I, too, would become a Con- 
               <br />
               federaie, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seek</span> to enter that current which 
               <br />
               will sweep us all into republicanism.

               I acknowledge England expects us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">todo</span>

               more far our own defence than we have hith-

               Brigham Young’s children adrift in the harem, 
               <br />
               we shall feel we have too many mothers. We

               have here a good many men claiming descent
