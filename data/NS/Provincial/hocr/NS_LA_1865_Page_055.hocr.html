               with great bravery against superior numbers-

               feeling has existed to some extent—although 
               <br />
               there have been persons in this country who

               <br />
               into two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments;</span> yet I am conﬁdent 
               <br />
               that there is not a British subject in British 
               <br />
               America who will learn the untimely death 
               <br />
               of President Lincoln and the circum- 
               <br />
               stances under which it has occurred 
               <br />
               without the feeling of the most unfeign- 
               <br />
               ed sorrow and the most profound regret. 
               <br />
               It is well known that President Lincoln was 
               <br />
               elected the President of the United States of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> by the intelligent and freely express- 
               <br />
               ed voice of the people of that great country; 
               <br />
               and no man who has observed the course that 
               <br />
               he has pursued can entertain a doubt that he 
               <br />
               has regarded it as a conscientious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty—a</span> duty 
               <br />
               from which,under no circumstances,he was able 
               <br />
               in the slightest degree, to shrink—to maintain 
               <br />
               the sovereignty of his government over the 
               <br />
               entire country. That he has persistently pur- 
               <br />
               sued that policy with an inﬂexibility of deter- 
               <br />
               mination and strength of purpose which must 
               <br />
               for ever mark him as a man of command- 
               <br />
               ing talents,no one can deny, and I am satisﬁed 
               <br />
               that the sentiment of the people, and of those 
               <br />
               who are placed over the people, throughout 
               <br />
               British North America,will agree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inzthe</span> opinion 
               <br />
               that he has been actuated by a conscientious 
               <br />
               discharge of what we believed to be a patriotic 
               <br />
               duty in that crisis of his country’s history. 
               <br />
               Under these circumstances I feel that it is 
               <br />
               right that the neighboring governments in B. N. 
               <br />
