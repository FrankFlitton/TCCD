               stood here last year as the defender of the

               <br />
               hear him tell us that its terms were inferior to

               I will be told that the ﬁnancial terms are bet- 
               <br />
               ter—that much larger grants for local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpo-t</span> 
               <br />
               ses have been secured under the new arrange- 
               <br />
               ment thau the old one. The delegates will 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment, over and a eve the 80 cents a head you 
               <br />
               were to receive under the Quebec scheme;— 
               <br />
               and have we not also made an arrangement 
               <br />
               by which you will continue to receive your 80 
               <br />
               cents a head until your population is 400,000?” 
               <br />
               This is quite true, but the concession will be 
               <br />
               estimated at its true worth when I inform the

               house of the lar e increase of revenue which 
               <br />
