               “Hon. Mr. Howe was received with most hearty

               of his boyhood realized —the Union of these Provin-

               Now what next? The overnment invited Mr.

               <br />
               that ii there was any great work in which his ser—

               <br />
               the Canadian policy of extending the Union to all 
               <br />

               I deplore that Mr. Howe was unable to attend on 
               <br />
               that occasion, for I believe that the diﬂiculties and 
               <br />

               great question arose in a large measure rom the fact
