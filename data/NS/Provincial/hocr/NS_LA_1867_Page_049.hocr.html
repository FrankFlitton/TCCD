               reading was taken. This reminds me that the 
               <br />
               member for Colchestcr has turned my attention 
               <br />
               to the subject of the Intercolonial Railway. It 
               <br />
               is well known that a guarantee was obtained for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> work in 1862 through the exertions of 
               <br />
               Messrs. Howe and Tilloy, and but for the bad 
               <br />
               faith of the Canadians the railroad might have 
               <br />
               been ﬁnished to-day and working, as to whether 
               <br />
               working profitably or not, I will not undertake to 
               <br />
               say. Hcsoys I complained of the delegates et- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ting</span> only three millions instead of four, and ur- 
               <br />
               ther, that four millions were not asked for. If 
               <br />
               so then we were deceived by the press, by th 
               <br />
               Canadian News among others, for It was plainly 
               <br />
               stated that that was the sum and the impression 
               <br />
               was conﬁrmed by the fact that Mr. Fleming had 
               <br />
               cS'imated that amount as necessary, and our own 
               <br />
               experience of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimates</span> and cost of railways 
               <br />
               gave us no reason to think it could not be built 
               <br />
               for less. Wo are blamed for remonstrating 
               <br />
               against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> guarantee,-——we were willing to re- 
               <br />
               monstratc against anything and everything to 
               <br />
               save the intcres's which were entrusted to us. 
               <br />
               Would I scll the liberties of my country .for a 
               <br />
               tow miles of railroad, even if half the trade of the 
               <br />
               world were to come over it! Would I say to my 
               <br />
               constituents “ you have elected me, I respect you 
               <br />
               for your intelligence, but you are not competent 
               <br />
               to express ou opinion on a matter that will sweep 
               <br />
               away your revenues and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place</span> unlimited powers 
               <br />
               of taxation in abody whic youcannotcontrol'?” I 
               <br />
               was going to say that for all the ronds in the 
               <br />
               world I would not consent to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> and we there-

               <br />
               that ere long she would have had to come to us and 
               <br />
               asked us to build our share. There was another 
               <br />
               reason, for our suggesting that a guarantee for
