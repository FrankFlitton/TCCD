               <br />
               that Confederation will increase our market? 
               <br />
               W'illanyone say that we will buy a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">barrel</span> of

               <br />
               any more fish or coal under Confederation? 
               <br />
               Can it be said that our productions will be al-

               <br />
               I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> the Canadians credit for so much 
               <br />
               love for us. We may have free trade between

               <br />

               the reverse in the face of the evidence upon our

               <br />
               to whether free trade in manufactures is at 
               <br />
               present desirable. There are manufactures 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">growing</span> up here which are now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> Weak as to 
               <br />
               require <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> aid; and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bring</span> them into 
               <br />
               competition with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worse</span> lvanced manufac- 
               <br />
               tures of Canada would be to ruin those who 
               <br />
               have embarked their capital in such enter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               sirable I won d throw no obstacle in the way. 
               <br />
               Then, is it necessary to have the Union to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;…</span> 
               <br />

               made; and until it fails, I will not admit 
               <br />
               the argument drawn in favorof a political

               'i'hen comes the question of postage. Cur pos-

               <br />
               which impedes circulation. The question of

               have Confederation we need not discuss the 
               <br />
               subject,——iu Canada the rate of interest is much 
               <br />
               higher than with us, in some instances as high 
               <br />
               as from eight to nine per cent. Then there is 
               <br />
               the question of the tariti'; there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may.</span> be nogrcat

               from strikingoﬂ‘ her twenty per cent duties.— 
               <br />
               In that case there could be no difficulty in as-

               we require for defence? lt is said that as we 
               <br />
               are now situated we cannot march a militia- 
               <br />
               man from one Province to another. Then all 
               <br />
               that is required in case of an attack is an 
               <br />
               authority by which we can ai l eachother. Do 
               <br />
               we not now see all British America armed to 
               <br />
               the teeth and prepared for the Conﬂict without 
               <br />
               Confederation? Then there is this dimculty in 
               <br />
               the way. When we are confederated the Gom— 
               <br />
               mander-in-Chiei’ would have his head-quarters 
               <br />
               at Ottawa; and we will ﬁnd that if Canada ia 
               <br />
               attacked and these Provinces threatened, the 
               <br />
               Execulive Government at Ottawa will natu— 
               <br />
               rally prefer the protection of their own home— 
               <br />
               steads to our security, and will withdraw our 
               <br />
               men for their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defence.</span> What did We hearsome 
               <br />
               of the Canadian statesmen say some time ago? 
               <br />
               One of them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said,</span> “.Look down at the Man'- 
               <br />
               time Provinces; they have 30,000 sailors to man 
               <br />
               our gunbosts." Another repeated the remark; . 
               <br />
               but it never occurred to them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we might 
               <br />
               also be threatened with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attack,</span> and that it 
               <br />
               might become necessar to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">send</span> do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nu</span> some of 
               <br />
               the yeomanry of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wyest</span> in exchan e for our 
               <br />
               sear-ion. Th iridea <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seernedselﬂsh</span> an narrow

               and limited only to the defence of their own 
               <br />
               country at our expense. It is said that Con. 
               <br />
               federation will make us much more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">powerful</span>
