               <br />
               be remembered that the original Act said 
               <br />
               nothing about the bridge excepting for the rail- 
               <br />

               sum that the Province should pay for that 
               <br />

               bridge, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affording</span> the desired accommodation, 
               <br />
               could not be built for double the money, and it 
               <br />
               had to be left with the Company to build as 
               <br />
               good a wooden bridge as they could, if not of 
               <br />

               it substantial as the cost of its maintenance 
               <br />
               would rest on them. Nothing was said in the 
               <br />
               act of last year about the bridge, and it was 
               <br />
               only in London, in 1865, that the ﬁrst mention 
               <br />
               was made of it, and the company asked the 
               <br />
               insertion of a. clause to authorize them to build 
               <br />

               T 6 Government then had acted in this matter 
               <br />
               according to their instructions, and would have 
               <br />
               been blamed for going beyond their commis- 
               <br />
               sion if the negociations had failed in conse-

               quence offurther accommodation being insist- 
               <br />
               ed upon. As to the route, a survey had been 
               <br />
               made, and the company insisted on having the 
               <br />
               selection of lines; but one great inducement to 
               <br />
               the enterprise was that the road might be made 
               <br />
               the through route to the United States, con—- 
               <br />
               necting Halifax with some place from which a 
               <br />
               ready passage could be made to New Bruns- 
               <br />

               <br />
               al or Boston as soon as by steamer. In order 
               <br />
               to do so the company had resolved to build 
               <br />
               such a road that the journey to Annapolis could 
               <br />
               he made in four hours, and they would require 
               <br />
               bridges of a very substantial kind. The true 
               <br />
               interests of the country had' been well cared 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the subvention. Be strong was the opinion 
               <br />
               in the minds ofsome that no company could be 
               <br />
               got to do the work for the sum offered, that a 
               <br />
               member of the Upper house had voted last 
               <br />
               year against the bill on that ground. The Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment had, however, been enabled to com- 
               <br />
               plete the contract for the amount offered, and 
               <br />
               the effect of the capitalisation would be highly 
               <br />
               favorable in a ﬁnancial point of view.

               <br />
               he would not be in a position to speak to the

               resolution for the extension to Digby when his 
               <br />

               would seem that the hon. member for Yar—

               Mr. LONGLEY regretted that the members

               terest in the extension, and the latter was in

               Pictou extension from a sense of duty, and had

               thereby established a strong claim to the sup-
