               the Union of the Colonies. The House is aware 
               <br />
               that both branches of the Legislature at the 
               <br />
               last Session passed a resolution in favor of re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               time rov uces. When that resolution was 
               <br />
               under discussion Istated that we had not only 
               <br />
               no reason to suppose that Prince Edward 
               <br />

               <br />
               the other Colonies in this matter but we had

               every reason to anticipate that she would de- 
               <br />
               cline to re-open negociations. At the same 
               <br />
               time it was thought desirable that an effort 
               <br />
               should be made to ascertain whether Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick could not he 
               <br />
               brought under the government by a legislative

               union._ _The government and the legislature
