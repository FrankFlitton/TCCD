               Mr. Tonm enquired what the house had to do 
               <br />
               with the Canadian 'I‘ariii‘.z Ifany gentleman was 
               <br />
               desirous of addressing the House or the public on 
               <br />
               the subject of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> and thought he was

               in a position to draw an ument from that 
               <br />

               <br />
               contrast the public documents and the revenue

               <br />

               <br />
               thought it a question which no Government 
               <br />
               should be bound to answer. This he considered 
               <br />
               the introduction of the question of a Union of 
               <br />

               if it were so undevstood and a discussion were to

               not long remain in their present position. This 
               <br />
               was seen and felt in the House, where things had
