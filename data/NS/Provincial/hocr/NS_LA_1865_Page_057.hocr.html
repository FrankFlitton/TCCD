               cial view of the subject, there are other con-

               siderations whi :h should have some effect upon 
               <br />
               our action in this matter. It is well known 
               <br />
               that our public works are progressing, and 
               <br />
               that our revenue is increasing year by year; 
               <br />
               but it must be remembered that under this 
               <br />
               scheme, no matter how prosperous we might 
               <br />
               become, no matter how largely our resources 
               <br />
               might increase, it would not be for the beneﬁt 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia, but the General Government 
               <br />
               at Ottawa. It is true that we might become a 
               <br />
               large manufacturing country, and the great 
               <br />

               <br />
               beneﬁt we would derive from the general 
               <br />
               prosperity would be the 80 cents per head

               the conviction that they will accomplish their

               object at the expense of the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces—that they will impose a duty upon 
               <br />
               llour, which we now import from the United 
               <br />
               States—a duty of at least a dollar a barrel,— 
               <br />
               and that we will have no other option than to 
               <br />
               submit. That will be the time when the effects 
               <br />
               of this Union will be brought home to us in a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pl‘let-l‘lll</span> shape, and when it is too late, the

               people of this Province will begin to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">realizae</span> 
               <br />
               the force of the objections we now raise 
               <br />
               against it.

               I maintain if we go into this union with Ca-

               nada, we will be treated, as all small provinces

               of the beneﬁt of union, and have been told 
               <br />
               that under it she has received more than her 
               <br />
               rights. Sir, I deny it; and I have only to refer 
               <br />
               to the universal feeling of execration, which 
               <br />
               even now, after a lapse of twenty years, exists 
               <br />

               feeling, I believe, beiore many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> will be

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Sir, I feel deeply on this subject, and, as 1 
               <br />
               said before, I regret that Nova Scotia’s most 
               <br />
               gifted sons <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span> not have found a better subject 
               <br />
               to coalesce upon than in this attempt to barter 
               <br />
               away our rights and liberties. But, sir, it has 
               <br />
               been said that we are too insigniﬁcant in our 
               <br />
               present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position—that</span> we ought to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become</span> a 
               <br />
               great country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.VVell,</span> sir, I for one am content 
               <br />
               to remain under that great and glorious ﬂag 
               <br />
               that waves over us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day-and</span> poor and in- 
               <br />
               signiﬁcant as we Nova Scotlans may be, we 
               <br />
               have the consolation of knowing that we have 
               <br />
               always been loyal and true to that ﬂag, which 
               <br />
               is more than can be said of that great country 
               <br />
               to which some gentlemen are so anxious to be 
               <br />
               united. It has also been urged that the United 
               <br />
               States is prepared to gobble us up, if we remain 
               <br />
               dis-united from Canada. Now, sir, I cannot see 
               <br />
               in what better position for defence we will be 
               <br />
               in by the Union. Will we be able to number a. 
               <br />
               man more, or to shoulder an additional mus- 
               <br />
               ket? I think not. But now, under the aegis 
               <br />
               ofOld England,we are secure. She has pro— 
               <br />
               mised to defend us, so long as we manifest a 
               <br />
               disposition to defend ourselves. When we
