               war, will be required in Canada to defend its 
               <br />
               exposed frontier. It seems to me, however, 
               <br />
               that the reverse would be the case, and I agree 
               <br />
               with the member for South Colchcster, that in 
               <br />
               the contingency of war, the maritime colonies 
               <br />
               would most probably be the ﬁrst point of 
               <br />
               attack. This was the case in the time of the 
               <br />
               old French war; it was not until Louisburg 
               <br />
               had fallen that the campaign against Canada 
               <br />
               had commenced, and this would most probably 
               <br />
               be the case again. I may refer, in connection

               of the country. The member for North Col-

               Chester spoke most glowingly of the resources

               duce the ﬂower of our population to remain

               there are no less than 30,000 Nova Scotlans

               within or in the vicinity of the city of Boston. 
               <br />
               Uponiwhat principles'can we account for this? 
               <br />
               It is because we od‘er no adequate inducements

               any person familiar with Halifax to look at the

               many of their occupants are natives of the
