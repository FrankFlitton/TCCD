               would be relieved, he thought this would be 
               <br />
               regarded as a necessary measure, leaving, 
               <br />
               as it would, a fair and efﬁcient representa- 
               <br />
               tion for every county, and at the same time 
               <br />
               striking off a very considerable portion of 
               <br />
               the expenditure. The bill proposed that in 
               <br />
               the Local Legislature every county should 
               <br />
               be represented by two members, excepting 
               <br />
               Halifax and Pictou, which should have 
               <br />
               three each. This would be in addition to 
               <br />
               the members to be sent to the General Par- 
               <br />
               liament. It had been asked, “would it not 
               <br />
               be better to allow the Legislature now short- 
               <br />
               ly to be elected to arrange the local consti— 
               <br />
               tution,” but he believed that the common 
               <br />
               sense of every member, as well as past ex- 
               <br />
               perience, would convince every one that no 
               <br />
               time could be so appropriate and convenient 
               <br />
               for dealing with the question as the present. 
               <br />
               The duty of legislation devolved as much 
               <br />
               upon the House up to the last day as at the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst hour of its existence, and there should 
               <br />
               be no disposition to shrink from this respon- 
               <br />
               sibility.

               The reduction could now be made without
