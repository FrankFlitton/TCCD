               two points, for the whole subject has been al- 
               <br />
               ready most fully and ably discussed. Some 15 
               <br />
               years ago the hon. member for East Halifax in- 
               <br />
               troduced a. bill to provide for representation by 
               <br />
               population; but I think nothing was done with 
               <br />
               it. Afew years afterwards it was introduced 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«rain.</span> We had a very unequal representation: 
               <br />
               Queens with her population 019,000 had as 
               <br />
               large a representation as Pictou with her 29, 
               <br />
               000 people. Hunts had ﬁve, Annapolis three, 
               <br />
               and Kings four members, with nearly an equal 
               <br />
               population. This discrepancy could not be 
               <br />
               accounted for on any just principle This state 
               <br />
               of thingslhas been the result of the progress of 
               <br />
               time Whenever a dead-lock occurred between 
               <br />
               parties, and government necessities demanded 
               <br />
               it, the representation of some particular county 
               <br />
               was increased. It will be remembered what a 
               <br />
               hue and cry was raised when a hill was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intro—</span> 
               <br />
               ‘duced by the present Judge in Equity to a ter 
               <br />
               and equalize the representation et the country. 
               <br />
               My own opinion is that there is no other true 
               <br />
               principle than representation by population It 
               <br />
               has been said that wealth should be the basis. 
               <br />
               When discussing this question with a gentleman 
               <br />
               who has since passed away, I asked him: as 
               <br />
               Halifax has an amount of wealth equal to Lu- 
               <br />
               nenhurg. Queens, Shelburne, Yarmouth and 
               <br />
               Digby combined would you give her the same 
               <br />
               representation that all these counties have? 
               <br />
               Certainly you would not Take production 
               <br />
               again. I might bring statistics to show that 
               <br />
               there is more production in Antigonishe than 
               <br />
               in any other county in the province, according 
               <br />
               to her population. Guysboro is another county 
               <br />
               which produces very heavily in ﬁsh, etc. 
               <br />
               Therefore I cannot see that it is possible to 
               <br />
               base representation upon any other principle 
               <br />
               than Wpulntion. My attention has been turned 
               <br />
               to this subject ever since the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Halifax introduced the bill I spoke of, 
               <br />
               and I have come to this conclusion. If you 
               <br />
               form <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:</span> union with the other provinces, on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who;</span> 
               <br />
               other principle can you base it? You coulp 
               <br />
               not base il: on wealth, or production, or territory. 
               <br />
               Population is the only true and safe principle. 
               <br />
               Therefore, so far as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> principle in the Quebec 
               <br />
               scheme is concerned, it has my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hearty</span> co.

               <br />

               the same with Nova Scotia or any other of the

               very much the same thing. Canada is obliged 
               <br />
               to collect a large amount of revenue on certain 
               <br />

               ture in this question. Let me sup ose that there

               <br />
               the disease alone. and calls in assistance. The 
               <br />
               physicians then holl a consultation, but they may 
               <br />
               disagree. How are they to settle the difﬁculty ? 
               <br />
               They will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consult</span> the best authorities on the ques- 
               <br />
               tion and the men who have written and given the 
               <br />
               results of their experience, and the issue is that 
               <br />
               the weight of authority carries the day. The

               same thing may be said in respect to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;.</span> Court of

               draw any invidious comparisons between indivi- 
               <br />

               iederation in Nova Scotia. We ﬁnd on the list 
               <br />
               the late tt. J. Uniacke, the present Juige in Equi- 
               <br />
               ty, Mr. Hows. the Chief Justice, the Provincial

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tecretary,</span> Mr Archibald, Hon. Mr. H nry, Hon.

               Mr. McCu'ly, Hon. Mr. Ritchie, and others I 
               <br />
               need not now name. Here is an array of men 
               <br />
               who have occupied a very prominent position in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia ; every one of these gentlemen have 
               <br />
               expressed themselves in favor of Union, and no 
               <br />
               better authorities can be cited than they. Mr. 
               <br />
               Howe said, years ago, it was'the dream of his 
               <br />
               boyhood and the purpose of his political life but I 
               <br />
               am told that it was only a theory with him- 
               <br />
               theory generally precedes practice. Now is the 
               <br />
               time to put that theory into practice—never was 
               <br />
               there a more auspicuous period to do so than now. 
               <br />
               When I say that the most eminent men in this 
               <br />
               Province have supported, and are supporting 
               <br />
               Confederation, I need hardly add that the same 
               <br />
               thing may be fairly stated of the other Provinces. 
               <br />
               Whom have we in opposition to this scheme ? 
               <br />
               We have the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> for Guysboro, who 
               <br />
               may be presumed to be the leader of the Opposi- 
               <br />
               tion since he introduced the amendment to the 
               <br />
               original resolution. We have Mr. Jones, Mr 
               <br />
               Andrew Uniacke, and two or three other gentle- 
               <br />
               men in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Halifax.</span> I do not wish to make any in- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vlidious</span> comparisons between these gentlemen. 
               <br />
               lf you can produce an array of talent against 
               <br />
               Confederation like what I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> given as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">support,—</span>

               say that from the year 1834 up to the present 
               <br />
               time I have been a reader of the “ Nova Scotian”
