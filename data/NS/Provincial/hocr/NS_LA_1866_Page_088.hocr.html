               <br />
               by the opponents of the scheme which requires 
               <br />
               consideration. I admit that, it" it be true, it is 
               <br />
               a fundamental argument, for it lies at the very 
               <br />
               basis of the question we are discussing. It is

               one which should therefore be fully and satis-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> constitutionally to pass on the measure 
               <br />

               <br />
               lative capacity, is not competent to decide upon 
               <br />
               this important measure, affecting as we all ad-
