               same churches that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ounsd</span> and occupied 
               <br />
               before the disruption took place. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'As</span> to tho 
               <br />
               Union, there was one, striking lesson in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with it that perhaps would not be forgotten 
               <br />
               by Mr. Archibald, and should be followed by 
               <br />
               the Provincial Secretary as an illustrious exam— 
               <br />
               ple. This Union was for years before the peo- 
               <br />
               ple, and explained to them by their respective 
               <br />
               clergymen. It had been approved of by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               people, and they authorized their ministers to 
               <br />
               ratify the Union. 'l‘here‘ was no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secrecy,</span> no 
               <br />
               coercion—it was by the free will of the Free 
               <br />
               Church people that they became united. What 
               <br />
               was the result? The two bodies united, and 
               <br />
               Free Churchmen in Cape Breton retained their 
               <br />
               ministers, and in every sense but in name re— 
               <br />
               mained Free Churchmen. In Victoria alone, 
               <br />
               he found by the census, that out ofa population 
               <br />
               of 9700 there were 5726 who put themselves 
               <br />
               down as belonging to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Presbyterian</span> church of 
               <br />
               the Lewer Provinces. There were ten places of 
               <br />
               worship in that county, and the heuse was ask- 
               <br />
