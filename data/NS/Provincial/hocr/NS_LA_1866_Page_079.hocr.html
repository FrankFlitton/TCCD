               was astonished when I was told yesterday that

               <br />
               were in favor of it should be a reason for the 
               <br />
               adoption of the scheme without any appeal to

               loss to see the connection between that subject

               how on that branch of the subject any argument

               and that fealty paid, a corresponding duty rests
