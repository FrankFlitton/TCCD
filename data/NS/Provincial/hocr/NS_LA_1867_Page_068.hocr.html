               <br />
               crnment, and we urged by every argument we 
               <br />
               could devise the adoption of our own policy. In 
               <br />
               the meantime the House will perceive that 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada had yielded the 
               <br />
               point, and had agreed, as far as they were con. 
               <br />
               cerned, to adopt the system for a year. We 
               <br />
               were placed in a very diﬂicult position, but, 
               <br />
               nevertheless, we persevered in it until the 
               <br />
               very last extremity. We stood out until 
               <br />
               we received a despatch from her Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government expressing the strongest dissa- 
               <br />
               tisfaction with the refusal on our part, on 
               <br />
               a question of Imperial import, to be guided 
               <br />
               by their wishes, and even going further, 
               <br />
               and intimating in pretty strong language that 
               <br />
               it we continued to disregard their wishes we 
               <br />
               would not be in a position to claim their assist- 
               <br />
               ance in the event of our ﬁshing grounds being 
               <br />
               encroached upon. The Colonial Minister sta- 
               <br />
               ted in a despatch which is among these papers, 
               <br />
               that they urged the adoption of this system for 
               <br />
               a single year, under the belief that suc‘i a con- 
               <br />
               cession on our part would lead to the renewal 
               <br />
               of reciprocal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trad:</span> between the United States 
               <br />
               and the British American Provinces. If we 
               <br />
               had continued to resist the wishes of the Im- 
               <br />
               perial Government. we would therefore not 
               <br />
               only have given the deepest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offence,</span> but have 
               <br />
               laid ourselves open to a charge of having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre‘</span> 
               <br />
               vented the re-establishment of satisfactory com- 
               <br />
               mercial relations with the United States. 
               <br />
               It is to me a matter of intense pride that I am 
               <br />
               able to stand here and vindicate the course 
               <br />
               which the Government have pursued, and prove 
               <br />
               to the Legislature that everything that was pos— 
               <br />
               sible was done to carry out the scheme of this 
               <br />
               House, and the views of gentlemen on both 
               <br />
               sides. It will be seen that that Government 
               <br />
               only yielded to the wishes of the Imperial Gov— 
               <br />
               ernment when expressed with a vigor and terse- 
               <br />
               ners that are not usual in the despatches of the 
               <br />
               Imperial authorities, and when it was urged that 
               <br />
               the policy which we had adopted as the true one 
               <br />
               would be detrimental to the best interests of 
               <br />
               this country. It may be said that the Govern - 
               <br />
               ment of Canada yielded a much more ready 
               <br />
               deference to the Imperial authorities than did 
               <br />
               the Government of this Province. That may 
               <br />
               be offered as one reason why it is not advisable 
               <br />
               that Nova Scotia should unite her interests more 
               <br />
               closelo with those of Canada. I receive, how-

               <br />
               history of this question. In this instance the 
               <br />
               Canadian authorities have given weight and 
               <br />

               of the intelligent people of this country .to the 
               <br />
               fact that the government of Nova Scotia is here 
               <br />
               proved to have been unable to Oppose a policy 
               <br />
               which was concurred in by Canada. That pro— 
               <br />

               This tax was simply imposed for a single year 
               <br />
               for the purpose of establishing in the most un- 
               <br />
               equivocal manner the right of British Ameri—

               asked what shall be the course during the pre-

               sent year. I must frankly state to you that the 
               <br />
               same policy must probably be pursued, simply 
               <br />
               for the reason that the delay which has taken 
               <br />
               place in accomplishing the union of the colonies, 
               <br />
               would prevent the question receiving the only 
               <br />
               decisive consideration that it would have been 
               <br />
               possible to give it. As far as I have been able 
               <br />
               to learn by communication with the members of 
               <br />
               the Governments of Canada and New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, the policy of the present year will be to 
               <br />
               double the charge upon every ton of shipping 
               <br />
               which is allowed to ﬁsh in our waters—thus 
               <br />
               again re establishing the entire right of British 
               <br />
               America to exclude <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreigners</span> from its ﬁshing 
               <br />
               grounds, and to admit them on whatever terms 
               <br />
               it may deem <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper.</span> The object of Canada, let 
               <br />
               me say in conclusion, was to defer to the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government until we were united and able to 
               <br />
               devise such a policy as the United Parliament 
               <br />
               may think proper to pursue. If the United 
               <br />
               States will not agree to liberal commercial ar- 
               <br />
               rangements, then I entertain no doubt that the 
               <br />
               policy of the Government of British America 
               <br />
               will be immediately to exclude the ﬁshermen of 
               <br />
               that country from any anticipation in our ﬁsh- 
               <br />
               ing grounds. When I had an opportunity of 
               <br />
               conferring with the Canadian Government at 
               <br />
               Ottawa on this subject, it was decided that the 
               <br />
               Canadians should only receive such portion of 
               <br />
               the duty collected as was required to meet the 
               <br />
