               <br />
               was the deplorable state of the city, that such 
               <br />

               <br />
               of representatives. He denied that the intereSts of

               <br />

               The interests of city and county were one, or they 
               <br />
               were diverse; if they were one, then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> could be
