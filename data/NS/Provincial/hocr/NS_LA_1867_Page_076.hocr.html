               striving to equalize the representation ac-

               <br />
               Take, for instance, the County of Kings, 
               <br />
               which had more than double the po ulation 
               <br />

               representation is to remain untouched,wlule 
               <br />
               that of Kings is to be reduced one-half, to 
               <br />
               two members instead of four. Nothing
