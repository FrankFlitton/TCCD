               manner in which the bill was brought for- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the position of an autocrat. lt was true that 
               <br />
               the matter would be open to future legisla-

               position of being obliged to reverse the 
               <br />
               action previously taken. He attacked the 
               <br />
               bill on the ground that it was an interfer-

               <br />
               believed that this would be the opinion of 
               <br />
               the country. It should be remembered that 
               <br />
               the Local Legislature might require to pro-

               that case a House of thirty-eight would

               have comparatively small weight. At any

               Hon. ATTY. GENERAL said he had felt 
               <br />
               that if the present Parliament ceased its 
               <br />
               functions without arranging the local consti- 
               <br />
               tution it would fail in an important part of 
               <br />
               its duty. He had pressed this view on his 
               <br />
               colleagues for several reasons, one of which 
               <br />
               was that the whole scheme of union would 
               <br />
               be frustrated and left imperfect if such a 
               <br />
               change were not made. In order to give

               statement that this, the most appropriate 
               <br />

               <br />
               and a future period selected. He could 
               <br />
               easily imagine the storm of objection that 
               <br />
               would have been raised had the govern- 
               <br />
               ment failed to bring this measure forward 
               <br />
               before the elections were held. It would be

               Mr. KILLAM approved of the principle, 
               <br />
               laid down by the Provincial Secretary, that 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               agreed with the last speaker as to this 
               <br />
               being the proper time to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass.</span> such a 
               <br />
               measure; nor did he believe that it would 
               <br />
               interfere with the arrangements of Con- 
               <br />
               federation to leave the House with its 
               <br />
               present complement. He didnot see on 
               <br />
               what principle the distribution of 
               <br />
               seats was founded. The bill would make 
               <br />
               a most important change in obliging candi- 
               <br />
               dates to run their election over the whole 
               <br />
               county, instead of being elected for ridings, 
               <br />
               as at present. The difﬁculty of this lan 
               <br />
               would appear when such a county as ali- 
               <br />
               fax was taken into consideration. This was 
               <br />
               contrary to the Canadian principle, which 
               <br />
               gave to every district its representative; and 
               <br />
               he read from an English authority to show 
               <br />
               that district representation was the only 
               <br />
               mode of securing the representation of 
               <br />
               minorities. The same objection, he thought, 
               <br />
               did not apply to the election of members 
               <br />
               for the General Parliament, because the re- 
               <br />
               presentatives would go there as Nova Sco- 
               <br />
               tians and without any sectional feeling. 
               <br />
               The bill, he thought, would in fact disfran— 
               <br />
               chise some of the districts, because a politi— 
               <br />
               cal feeling which might prevail in one sec- 
               <br />
               tion would be controlled by the feeling in 
               <br />
               another section. In New Brunswick the 
               <br />
               policy had been to retain the whole Legis- 
               <br />
               lature and he thought Nova Scotia would 
               <br />
               require all the talent of which she could 
               <br />
               avail herself to remodel her constitution. 
               <br />
               The local Parliament would have important 
               <br />
               matters to deal with; it was not improbable 
               <br />
               that our most able men would leave the 
               <br />
               House, and there would be abetter-selection 
               <br />
               to be made out of 55 members than out of 
               <br />
               38. It was well knowu that a great deal of 
               <br />
               inﬂuence was brought to bear by depart- 
               <br />
               mental ofﬁcers who had seats in Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment; that was a reason why the number of 
               <br />
               members should be large. The object of 
               <br />
               the measure, he believed, was to crush 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia down and repress her inﬂuence. 
               <br />
               Another view of the matter was that the ge- 
               <br />
               neral Parliament might at some period re- 
               <br />
