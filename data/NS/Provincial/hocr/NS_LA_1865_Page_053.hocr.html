               <br />
               to attack him. Ile had been often amused at the 
               <br />
               manner in which the hon. member was in the 
               <br />
               habit of approaching the discussion of questions 
               <br />
               in the House. He (Mr. M.) had now been in the 
               <br />
               Legislature for two years, and previously had 
               <br />
               been frequently in the galleries, and he had yet 
               <br />
               to learn, from. personal devotion or otherwise, 
               <br />

               public business. Yet you saw this gentleman, 
               <br />
               when a question came up in which his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings</span> 
               <br />
               were enlisted, getting up and addressing the 
               <br />
               House with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">patronizing</span> air,and in that peculiar 
               <br />
               dilettanti style in which he delighted. He could 
               <br />
               tell that hon. gentleman it would have been more 
               <br />
               to his credit, and those with whom he apparently 
               <br />
               sympathized in the remarks he led just made, if

               <br />
               occasion. When that hon. gentleman stated that

               he had been hissed in Temperance Hall, he men- 
               <br />

               thing else in his public life. lle had never stood, 
               <br />
               and he never expected hereafter to stand in a

               pronder—a position more in sympathy with the 
               <br />
               feelings of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people—than</span> when in response to

               upon themselves, and that the little band with

               which he was associated would teach the contemp—

               <br />
               that meeting that they were not the people of

               Nova Scotia. Well they had taught these wor—

               ed in the valleys, and along the hill sides, and 
               <br />
               found its echo in the Legislature of this country. 
               <br />
               That pledge at least had been “ nobly redeemed.” 
               <br />
               Who were those that hissed him for the utterance 
               <br />
               of these sentiments on that occasion? Not the 
               <br />
               respectable citizens of Halifax? No, he scouted 
               <br />
               the idea—he knew from personal communication 
               <br />
               with a large number of the citizens of Halifax 
               <br />
               that they condemned such conduct. Those who 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hi</span> sed him were a few government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hirelings—a</span> 
               <br />
               few claquers gathered from the street corners

               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bar—rooms—whose</span> hostility he had the good

               fortune to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gained-men</span> who would bring

               cxertion,‘ to satisfy a laudable ambition in this 
               <br />

               <br />
               position of that crowd. But it was not for the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Halifax to taunt him in connex— 
               <br />

               was in some obscure corner under the galleries

               He was not at all superized at the style in which 
               <br />
               the Provincial Sceetary had referred to him. It 
               <br />
               was what he expected from the hon. gentleman.

               ly than others. He had got more knocks than

               intended as they were for an unworthy purpose.

               <br />
               of which‘he need never be ashamed. He had

               never, since he had the honour of a seat in the 
               <br />
               House, Opened his mouth unfairly hostile towards 
               <br />
               the city of Halifax. On the contrary, he could 
               <br />
               appeal to gentlemen all around if he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> not, on 
               <br />
               every occasion, when the interests of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Halifax</span> were 
               <br />
               not at conﬂict with the legitimate interests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> 
               <br />
               these he represented, endeavoured to retain 
               <br />
               their rights, and promote their wishes. ~ He had 
               <br />
               been a member. of the Committee on City Bills, 
               <br />
               for two years, and need hardly say he did his best 
               <br />
               to advance the business before it, and guard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> 
               <br />
               interests of the city. He knew that his exertions 
               <br />
               were fully appreciated. There was another por-

               <br />
               astonished at the powers of the face with which 
               <br />
