               that there may yet be manly spirit enough to

               <br />
               declarations that we had no grievance at all, 
               <br />
               that the subject had been before the people at 
               <br />
               the last general election, that the opposition

               was factions and did not represent popular Opin- 
               <br />
               ion. One very signiﬁcant fact has already trans- 
               <br />
               pired; last year it was said that the Queen desir-

               <br />
               Colonies, the Parliament, press, and people of 
               <br />
               England all desired it, but now, when the respon- 
               <br />
               sibility is thrown on the British Cabinet, what 
               <br />
               do they say’.l Her Majesty says thatthe bill has 
               <br />
               been prepared in conformity with the wishes of 
               <br />
               the delegates from the various provinces. 
               <br />
               And what does the act itself say? lt says it 
               <br />
               is introduced because the delegates desire the 
               <br />
               measure. Her Majesty’s Ministers, fearing 
               <br />
               that trouble may come—that the new nationality 
               <br />
               may come to grief—shake themselves clear ot 
               <br />
               the responsibility. andcan hereafter point to the 
               <br />
               bill and say—“ This is no measure of ours ; we 
               <br />
               merely gave the force of law to the enactment, 
               <br />
               which you desired.” I was amused to hear the 
               <br />
               Provincial Secretary say that the friends of union 
               <br />
               were sustained by the friends of British connec- 
               <br />
               tion in England. I have had opportunities un- 
               <br />
               surpassed by any Colonist of ascertaining the 
               <br />
               feelings of gentlemen connected with the press 
               <br />
               of England, and I here declare that 
               <br />
               the leading opinion of the governing 
               <br />
               classes of England is, that these colonies 
               <br />
               should be made into an independent nation, 
               <br />
               and they would gladly have separated Cana- 
               <br />
               da from the Maritime Provinces, but they 
               <br />
               felt that a maritime frontage was essential for 
               <br />
               'her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existence,</span> The opinion, I repeat, of the 
               <br />
               friends of Confederation is that we should be 
               <br />
               united, and put in such a position that by a

               <br />

               will drift into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> United States. Look haw

               easily the thing can be done—justas easily as the 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme was accomplished.— 
               <br />
               Several gentlemen were appointed, at the in- 
               <br />
               stance of this house, to attend a conference 
               <br />
               in Prince Edward Island to mature a scheme 
               <br />
               for the union of the Maritime Provinces. 
               <br />
               The Canadians came down and spirited them 
               <br />
               to Quebec where, for reasons best <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">known</span> to 
               <br />
               themselves, they all agreed to go in for the 
               <br />
               larger union. They afterwards by some 
               <br />
               means succeeded in securing the assent. of 
               <br />
               New Brunswick and of this house, though 
               <br />
               not of the people, and they are now about to 
               <br />
               consummate it. Can it be supposed that the

               <br />
