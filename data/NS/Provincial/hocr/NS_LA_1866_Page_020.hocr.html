               <br />

               <br />
               ro <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guard</span> myself from misinterpretation, that any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> of union, after being thus considered, 
               <br />
               must come back to the Parliaments and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               people for ratiﬁcation. I care not how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfect</span> or 
               <br />
               how advantageous the scheme may be. unless the 
               <br />
               Parliaments and the people are consulted, it must 
               <br />
               fail <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfy</span> the country. Another mode would 
               <br />
               be to assemble Delegates, composed ot the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Same</span> 
               <br />
               elements, at the Colonial Ofﬁce, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where,</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span>

               <br />
               could be discussed ; but even in that case it must

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,come</span> back to be settled by our people. ! ut there 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> a third mode that recommends itselt to me : there 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> diversity between the interests of Canada

               and those of the Maritime Provinces while the 
               <br />
               latter have many interests in common, I would 
               <br />
               therefore convene delegates from the four Mari-

               commending itself to the people, must be ma— 
               <br />
               tured as I think by the representatives of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces. Then would come up this 
               <br />
               question: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">v-rhould</span> not these four Provinces go in 
               <br />
               as one asking for equal representation with either 
               <br />
               of the Canadas and claiming it as their right and —

               <br />
               that their revenues should be properly secured—— 
               <br />
               If the Maritime Provinces could thus be brought 
               <br />
               to agree upon a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">platfirm</span> then let the debate be
