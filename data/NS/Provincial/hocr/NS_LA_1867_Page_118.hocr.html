               tary, On a former day, made a special allusion 
               <br />
               to myself in respect to an attempt I was mak- 
               <br />
               ing to ﬁnd a seat in the New Dominion. I may 
               <br />
               say to the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> that so far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned I have not authorized any one to 
               <br />
               make such an offer, as it has been stated, has 
               <br />
               been made. I may say further that overturns 
               <br />
               have been made to me from several counties, 
               <br />
               but to all I have given invariably a denial,— 
               <br />
               only under very peculiar circumstances would 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> for a seat in either parliament. I am 
               <br />
               very much like the soldier at Inkerman, I am 
               <br />
               going into a soldier’s battle, and I am willing 
               <br />
               to assist anybody but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself.</span> I therefore 
               <br />
               may say explicitly that the statement in res- 
               <br />
               pect to the County of Queens was altogether 
               <br />
               unauthorized.

               Hon. PROV. SECY.—I’erhaps I should not 
               <br />
               have made the remark I did. I had, however, 
               <br />
               letters shewn me by the members who repre- 
               <br />
               sent Queens stating the fact that I mentioned, 
               <br />
               that overtures had been made to certain elec- 
               <br />
               tors in the interest of the hou. gentleman. I 
               <br />
               must say that I envy somewhat the position 
               <br />
               which the hon. member proposes to occupy. 
               <br />
               Those who engage in political life do so at a 
               <br />
               great personal sacriﬁce. So far aa politicians 
               <br />
               are concerned, wc who are laymen have not 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gael</span> ahead of them that members of the 
               <br />
               Bar have. When they enter into these poli- 
               <br />
               tical struggles, they have before them a pros- 
               <br />
               pect of a time when they can leave public 
               <br />
               life and serve their country in an influential 
               <br />
               position. There is, however, no position more 
               <br />
               honorable or more important than that of a 
               <br />
               public servant. The public business must be 
               <br />
               done by some one ready to give up a consi- 
               <br />
               derable portion of his time for the sake of 
               <br />
               his country. In doing so, however, he must 
               <br />
               expect to sacriﬁce his personal comfort and 
               <br />
               private interest to no inconsiderable degree. 
               <br />
               There are many gentlemen in this Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture who could have acquired any reasonable 
               <br />
               amount of wealth—who could have enjoyed 
               <br />
               the greatest personal luxury and comfort, 
               <br />
               but they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forgone</span> all that in order to 
               <br />
               give their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">services</span> to their country. As this 
               <br />
               is the last occ:~sron on which I shall be able to 
               <br />
               make any rnnarks on the ﬂoor of this Legisla- 
               <br />
               tnre, I must _say I feel a great deal is due not 
               <br />
               only to the kindness and courtesy of gentlemen 
               <br />
               on this side <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[who</span> have sustained me through- 
               <br />
               out my public career, but also to the courtesy 
               <br />
               and kindness of those who discharge the im- 
               <br />
               portantduties of an Opposition in the House 
               <br />
               since I haVe had the honor of a. seat on the 
               <br />
               Government benches. I can say further that 
               <br />
               there is nothing that I regret more at the close 
               <br />
               of my career in this Legislature, than at anv 
               <br />
               time, in the heat of debate on Public matters, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'I</span> 
               <br />
               should have forgotten what was due to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per-</span> 
               <br />
               sonal feelings of gentlemen to whom I was op- 
               <br />
               posed, and should have used expressions 
               <br />
               Which, in my calm and reﬂecting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moments</span> it 
               <br />
               would have pained mo excessively to have ut- 
               <br />
               tered. I trust that the good feeling which has 
               <br />
               characterized this Legislature—and I have 
               <br />
