               that when this subject was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> discussion 
               <br />
               during the last session of the legislature I was 
               <br />
               so indisposed that on the last night when the

               division was taken I was scarcely able to ut- 
               <br />
               ter a word. While that subject was under 
               <br />
               discussion. neither the leader of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment nor any supporter of the government 
               <br />
               knew which way I was gomg to vote. I have 
               <br />
               advocated, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">however-{this</span> Union since I ﬁrst 
               <br />

               <br />
               it even before I had the honour of a _seat in 
               <br />
               this House. I believe that I was mainly in- 
               <br />
               strumental to the bringing forward of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re—</span> 
               <br />
               solution which was moved by Mr. Howe m. 
               <br />
               1861. At public meetings in this city, in Wind- 
               <br />
               sor, in Kentville, in Truro I have addressed 
               <br />
               largo audiences, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reorived</span> from them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tim</span>

               <br />
               ple of this country in favour of Union. On 
               <br />
               every occasion when I came before the elec—

               am personally concerned I assume all the re- 
               <br />
               sponsibility of my position, and I advocate this 
               <br />
               Union because I believe it is for the best in- 
               <br />
               terests of British America. I believe that the 
               <br />
               time has come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> we must enter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> a new 
               <br />
               state of political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relations</span> with each other. 
               <br />
               Look at this House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tro-day</span> are we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> not actu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               into the lobby. Therefore, I say, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we-havg</span> out-

               <br />
               We must do like the Massachusetts man: when

               <br />
               the West. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> look to the great West; 
               <br />
               which opens <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bete—voile</span> and cultivate trade and 
               <br />
