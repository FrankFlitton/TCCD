               ted to this Legislature. That scheme has been 
               <br />
               rejected as far as my observation goes by the 
               <br />
               whole Anti-Union press up to the present hour. 
               <br />
               Ihave heard of no opponent of Union who has 
               <br />
               had the hardihood to advocate the scheme for the 
               <br />
               organization of the Empire until the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber did so to-night. He has had the boldness to 
               <br />
               declare that this scheme is the one Which he and 
               <br />
               his party favor. He says he does not deny that 
               <br />
               some political change in our condition is neces- 
               <br />
               sary, and has expressed his readiness to adopt the 
               <br />
               scheme propounded by Mr. Howe for the or- 
               <br />
               ganization of the Empire. By that scheme we 
               <br />
               are to pay for the wars of the whole Empire. 
               <br />
               He says he will make us pay pound for pound 
               <br />
               with the other portions of the Empire. 
               <br />
               That same idea was enunciated some years 
               <br />
               ago by Mr. Howe, but I never heard of any 
               <br />
               who was prepared. to consider it seriously 
               <br />
               until the hon. member to-night declared 
               <br />
               that he would make Nova Scotia as Kent 
               <br />
               or Surrey or any other county of England. 
               <br />
               The objection to the Quebec scheme was 
               <br />
               that our representation in the General 
               <br />
               Legislature was too insigniﬁcant, and that 
               <br />
               we would have to pay tor the defence of 
               <br />
               Canada, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> our burthens would be much 
               <br />
               heavier than they are now. Yet under the 
               <br />
               plan prepounded by Mr. Howe our peeple 
               <br />

               and for those who have Opinions to express 
               <br />
               the time is short. The Provincial Secretary 
               <br />
               says this haste is imperative, in order that the 
               <br />
               public business of the country may not be in- 
               <br />
               terfered with. The exigencies of the country 
               <br />
               may now require this, but I ask who produced 
               <br />
               the circumstances requiring such hasty delibe- 
               <br />

               <br />
               question in so short a period? We in the coun- 
               <br />
               try were prepared months ago to come here 
               <br />
               and discuss this subject and to attend to the 
               <br />
               ordinary business of the Legislature. but to 
               <br />
               suit the convenience of certain hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men, the meeting of the House has been post- 
               <br />
               poned to such a late period as to require that 
               <br />
               the most momentous question ever submitted 
               <br />
               to Parliament should be passed over almost in 
               <br />
               silence. For that reason we are told that we 
               <br />
               must limit our remarks to this single point :— 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> of the people to be heard upon the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> and to decide on it for themselves. 
               <br />
               The Provincial Secretary told us yesterday 
               <br />
               that he felt proud of the position which he 
               <br />
               occupied on this question—that he felt proud 
               <br />
               of the improvements in the bill which is soon 
               <br />
               to come before us, as compared with the re- 
               <br />
               solutions passed at Quebec. I do not see in 
               <br />
               the position which he occupies anything to 
               <br />
               warrant such utterances. He told us last ses- 
               <br />
               sion. as he has told us on every occasion, that 
               <br />
               the Quebec scheme was just and sound in its 
               <br />
               principles—that it gave to this Province all it 
               <br />
               had a right to demand; and the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s colleagues in the delegation reiterated 
               <br />
               the assertion, and they stated that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«were</span> 
               <br />
               prepared to push that scheme through. and to 
               <br />
               make it the basis of a Union of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Colonies.

               If the bill gives us more than that scheme, 
               <br />
               then whatever it gives in addition is due to us '

               these statements be true, he must have done a 
               <br />
