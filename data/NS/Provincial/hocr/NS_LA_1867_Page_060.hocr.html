               and which it is desirable that the country 
               <br />
               should fully understand. The House knows

               that the opponents of union have argued 
               <br />
               that the revenues of this country arc to be 
               <br />
               dissipated by Canada—that the hardly

               earned revenues of the peeple are to go to 
               <br />

               to tell the hon. member, and I challenge

               <br />
               adduce to the House, that so far from the

               revenues of this country going to enrich the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the figures from the same source, and 
               <br />
               will undertake to show that instead of the

               revenues of Nova Scotia going to pay the 
               <br />

               <br />

               by men residing and spending their income 
               <br />
               in this country. We shall receive, then, 
               <br />
               ﬁrst the contribution fixed by the act of un- 
               <br />

               <br />
               in aid of our local expenditure, amounting- 
               <br />
               to $324,000 in the ﬁrst instance, and shall

               then, how the matter will stand, and I may
