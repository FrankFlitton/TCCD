               Now, what was the character of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">act?</span> 
               <br />
               A Parliament had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> elected in 1715, under 
               <br />
               a law which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> it a duration of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three</span> years. 
               <br />
               Under that law it- would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> expired m_ 1718; 
               <br />
               yet in the year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> its expiration a bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> in and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">became</span> law which extended it 
               <br />
               to 1722, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giving</span> it a duration more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">double</span> 
               <br />
               that for which it had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elected.</span> Surely, if 
               <br />
               ever there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> an act which illustrates the

               powerof Parliament. this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> one. They were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elected.</span> for a term, and before that term was 
               <br />
               completed, without any appeal to the people,
