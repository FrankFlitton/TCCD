               inﬂuence in the Local Legislature. It could

               be shown, by reference to the existing House

               determined opposition to the Government. 
               <br />
               For instance, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notwithstanding</span> the manner in 
               <br />
               which an important public department had 
               <br />
               been ﬁlled, the hon. member for South Kings 
               <br />
               (Dr. Brown) had opposed the Administration 
               <br />

               saying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> from his knowledge of the char-

               sent them, he was positive that the Govern-

               ment hereafter in the Local Legislature, would 
               <br />
               have no more power or inﬂuence than was ab- 
               <br />
               solutely necessary to carry on the public busi- 
               <br />
               ness of the country. The hon member had 
               <br />
               stated that he Would be willing to follow the 
               <br />
               exam le of Upper Canada, and abolish the 
               <br />
               Logis ative Council altogether. It was cer- 
               <br />
               tainly satisfactory to ﬁnd that hon member 
               <br />
               was at last able to point to the legislation of 
               <br />
               Canada—that much abused countr —-as wor- 
               <br />
               thy of our imitation. But it should e remem- 
               <br />
               bered that Upper Canada was very diﬂerent- 
               <br />
               ly situated to Nova Scotia. That Province 
               <br />
               had no Local Legislature as we had; but, in 
               <br />
               addition to this, it should be remembered that 
               <br />
               it had a very perfect municipal system, under 
               <br />
               whicha large amount of local business was 
               <br />
               now transacted. It was not desirable in this 
               <br />
               Provinceto give a sudden and unnecessary 
               <br />
               check to existing institutions. We had had 
               <br />
               for many years a. Legislative Council, which 
               <br />
               had been largely composed of men of inﬂuence 
               <br />
               and position in the country, and it would be 
               <br />
               unwise to abolish it at one stroke. It was ab- 
               <br />
               surd to say that the Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hougg</span> would have 
               <br />
               nothing to do, when whatever usiness was 
               <br />
               transacted in the Lower House would have to 
               <br />
               pass through that branch, in accordance with 
               <br />
               the principle of our present constitution. But 
               <br />
               did not the hon member see that there was an 
               <br />
               inconsistency in his argument? He had de- 
               <br />
               clared that the house ought not to be reduced 
               <br />
               —-and in that case was it advisable to do away 
               <br />
               with the Legislative Council? The same rea- 
               <br />
               son that would exist for keeping the house as 
               <br />
               it was, would be found in the case of the Legis-

               continue the Legislative Council, though with

               its number reduced.

               The hon. member for East Halifax had at 
               <br />
               last taken his stand upon principle ; but he 
               <br />
               ought to be able to state on what principle he 
               <br />
               advocated representation by population for

               <br />
               taken great exception to that principle, and 
               <br />
               had urged With all the eloquence in his ower, 
               <br />
               that scarcely in any part of the wor d was

               ponents of union pressed on all occasions. 
               <br />
               Now the gravamen of the hon. member’s 
               <br />
               speech against the Government was that they 
               <br />
               had not observed the principle of population 
               <br />
               in the present bill. If be (Dr. T.) remembered 
               <br />
               aright, the hon. gentleman had been a mem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               such circumstances the hon. member would 
               <br />
               hardly be compromised in supporting the pre- 
               <br />
               sent measure, It was impossible, under ex- 
               <br />
               isting circumstances, to carry out the principle 
               <br />
               of representation by population in all its en- 
               <br />
               tirety. It was impossible to cut down the re-

               presentation of any county to merely a single 
               <br />
               member. All that could be done was to give 
               <br />
               such a representation as would be fair to the 
               <br />
               interests of all sections. The hon. member for

               East <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lialitax</span> has also protested against the 
               <br />
               right of the present Legislature touching the 
               <br />
               question at all. Gentlemen must begin to feel 
               <br />
               a great deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">curiosity</span> to know what the 
               <br />
               hon. member believed was the duty of the pre-

               would deny that they had any right or power 
               <br />
               to do anything at all. The hon. member need 
               <br />

               Mr. LOCKE said that the people had sent

               <br />

               <br />
               Legislature had large powers, but he believed 
               <br />
               that it exceeded those powers when it changed 
               <br />
               the constitution under which it was elected 
               <br />
               without the consent of the people. The peo- 
               <br />
               ple had never elected them for such a pur-

               <br />
               abolish the Legislative Council. The business
