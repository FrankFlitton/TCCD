               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> 'he position which I have occupied on t a 
               <br />
               subject, I could not sit silent on the introduc- 
               <br />
               tion of such a resolution as that before the 
               <br />
               House. I regret greatly that in the discussion 
               <br />
               of this subject, it has been thought necessary 
               <br />
               by the Provincial Secretary to address the 
               <br />
               H-ouseiu the impassioned tone and style of 
               <br />
               the speech to which we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> listened. I 
               <br />
               do not affect to be surprised at the course he 
               <br />
               has taken. Perhaps I could hardly have ex- 
               <br />
               pocted him, under the circumstances, to take a 
               <br />
               different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">course;</span> still i feel that if there ever 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> a question in which passion should be si- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lent,</span> which should be considered with calm- 
               <br />
               ness and deliberation, it is this. The question 
               <br />
               before us is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatest.</span> that could he submit- 
               <br />
               ted to this country or this legislature, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">requires</span> that we should look at it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sabot-ly</span> and
