               Mr. MCDONALD then said :—The present 
               <br />
               question is one of the most important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjects</span> 
               <br />
               that can engage the attention of a free people, 
               <br />
               involving as it does their political rights and 
               <br />
               condition for all time. It is not therefore to be 
               <br />
               wondered at, that each member of this house, 
               <br />
               in the discharge oi his duty to his constituents, 
               <br />
               should be desirous of placing on record the sen— 
               <br />
               timents by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wsich</span> he is inﬂuenced in coming to 
               <br />
               the conclusion at which he may arrive. This is 
               <br />
               the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voute</span> I shall oﬁ‘er in detaining the 
               <br />
               house with a few remarks on the resolution un- 
               <br />
               der consideration. The arguments for and 
               <br />
               against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> have been widely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis—</span> 
               <br />
               seminated throughout t e country—the subJect 
               <br />
               in the form of the Quebec scheme has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis—</span> 
               <br />
               cussed in this house by the Delegates who origi- 
               <br />
               nated it, on the public platform, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">col.</span> 
               <br />
               umnsoi the press. The people therefore, _we may 
               <br />
               assume, are more or less familiar with the 
               <br />
               grounds and reasons on which the framers and 
               <br />
               supporter of the measure ask public support. 
               <br />
               It will not be necessary for me, under these 
               <br />
               circumstances, to go at any length into the argu— 
               <br />
               ments which have inﬂuenced my own mind. 
               <br />
               Since this debate arose nothing has been evolv- 
               <br />
               ed that has not already appeared in the press of 
               <br />
               the opponents of the scheme. The advocates 
               <br />
               of Union to-night have not to meet a single ar.
