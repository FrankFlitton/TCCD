               Mr. CAMPBELL: The hon. gentleman had re-

               ﬂected upon the course taken by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Richmond in bringing this matter 
               <br />
               to the notice of the house. Now it‘ there was 
               <br />
               any one in the house who was better justiﬁed 
               <br />
               than another in bringing it up, it was that 
               <br />
               same hon. member. Any one w _ was ac-

               <br />
               sion at Temperance Hall, that gentleman was 
               <br />
               treated with an indignity which he did not de— 
               <br />
               serve. It was felt to be an insult not to him 
               <br />
               alone, but to the people thrbugh the length and 
               <br />
               breadth of N ova Scotia. He (Mr. C.) was also 
               <br />
               one of those who felt that the City of Halifax 
               <br />
               was not the Province of Nova Scotia. It had 
               <br />
               been said that there were certain individuals 
               <br />
               about the sti-eets who were underrating the 
               <br />
               position of members of the House who came 
               <br />
               from the rural districts. These individuals 
               <br />
               might have stock in the bank—real estate in 
               <br />
               this city and country,——-but they had never ap- 
               <br />
               pealed to any constituency in this Province 
               <br />
               and obtained the conﬁdence of the people. 
               <br />
               Therefore they had no right to talk in 
               <br />
               such disparaging terms of gentlemen who 
               <br />
               for years had represented the rural dis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the demonstration—not because it was 
               <br />
               intended, as the Provincial Secretary would 
               <br />
               make the House believe, as a reception 
               <br />
               to gentlemen from a sister colony. He objected 
               <br />
               to it because he could see through the motive 
               <br />
               and design with which the demonstration was 
               <br />
               got up. The people of the parent country had 
               <br />
               all been misled upon the question, and the 
               <br />

               times past, has been his valuable and active 
               <br />
               supporters. He had instituted a comparison 
               <br />
               between the members of the League and those 
               <br />
