               I now come, sir, to the gist of the amend- 
               <br />
               ment—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> question, as it has 
               <br />
               been called; and let me ask if this is a subject 
               <br />
               in the consideration of which we are to be met 
               <br />
               with an objection, whatI cannot but call a 
               <br />
               constitutional quibble? We have been repea- 
               <br />
               tedly and vauntingly told that we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shown</span> 
               <br />
               no precedent that would justify the House in 
               <br />
               adopting the amendment I have had the honor 
               <br />
               to propose. To this quibble, sir, I oﬁ'er in re- 
               <br />
               ply the s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> stantial precedent of common sense.

               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> law furnish me with a state 
               <br />
               of things similar to that existing in relation 
               <br />
               to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question-it</span> will, I, say be time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> 
               <br />
               to produce the now impossible precedent. Sir, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">q‘uestion</span> of Confederation is upon us—it is

               wide y regarded as a new and unprecedented

               malady, endangering the entire body politic,— 
               <br />
               and how is it to be met? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span> It must be dealt with

               ment seems to me more prudent or consonant
