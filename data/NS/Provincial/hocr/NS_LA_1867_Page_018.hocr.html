               A great mistake was made in seeking to

               no one having a clear and deﬁnite view of the 
               <br />
               subject. Mr. Howe, who I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heartilg</span> wish was

               here to defend himself, has been c arged with 
               <br />
               being the originator of Confederation. I deny 
               <br />
               the truth of that assertion, and challenge an in-

               vestigation of that gentleman’s speeches and 
               <br />

               vocated such a scheme as that now pressed 
               <br />
               upon our acceptance. My friend has written 
               <br />
               and said much on the subject of Union; he has 
               <br />
               discussed the subject in its various phases, 
               <br />
               but he raised objections to them all—to a Le- 
               <br />
               gislative Union, to a Federal Union, to union 
               <br />
               with the United States—and only gave in his 
               <br />
               adhesion to the larger and more comprehen-

               sive scheme known as tl e “Organization of the 
               <br />
               Empire." Mr. Howe never favored any scheme 
               <br />
               of Union that would have destroyed the auto- 
               <br />
               nomy of this Province, and certainly never 
               <br />
               would have been a party to any measure that 
               <br />
               would have handed over the revenues and re-

               <br />
               for imitating, he was in favor of Union of some

               sort, without any very clear or deﬁnite views 
               <br />
               upon the subject. But suppose Mr. Howe 
               <br />
               had written all his life long in favour of Union,

               resolution of 1861 introduced by Mr. Howe 
               <br />
               committed the late Government and every 
               <br />
               member of the house to the support of Union. 
               <br />
               That resolution merely declared that the sub- 
               <br />
               ject of union had been frequently discussed, 
               <br />
               and that the time had come when it should 
               <br />
               be set at rest. That resolution speaks for 
               <br />
               itself—it bound no gentleman to support 
               <br />
               any particular form of union, or union at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span> 
               <br />

               afterwards at Quebec containing provisions

               which no one could have dreamed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> in 1861. 
               <br />
               That resolution led to a conference in 1862 at 
               <br />
               at which were present delegates from Nova. 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick, and the whole 
               <br />
               Executive Council of Canada. Iwas one of 
               <br />
               the delegates, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">andwas</span> present when the ques- 
               <br />
               tion ot colonial union was discussed. And what 
               <br />
               was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decision?</span> This House had asked that 
               <br />
               the question should be “ set at rest.” and the 
               <br />
               answer they received was that it was premature 
               <br />
               even to discuss the question. The delegates 
               <br />
               considered it premature to consider the subject 
               <br />
               until the Intercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> had been built, 
               <br />
               and free trade between the Provmces established. 
               <br />
               That then is the answer to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theargument</span> drawn 
               <br />
               from the resolution of 1861 which, It should be 
               <br />
               remembered, was not even debated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in,</span> this 
               <br />
               House. The Prov. Sec. _speut nearly an hour 
               <br />
               in enlarging upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> and powers of 
               <br />
               Parliament. No one disputes the power of 
               <br />
               Parliament—what we were discussing is not 
               <br />
               the power, but the sound and wise exercise oi
