               <br />

               _ Mr. KILLAM thought that this was not the 
               <br />
               time for such a measure. It was essential to 
               <br />
               ascertain the ﬁnancial state of the country, so 
               <br />
               as to see how the coustruction was to be pro-

               <br />
               tension, provided the Province had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sumcient</span> 
               <br />
               means, and it should be remembered that the 
               <br />
               revenues would be very small after Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. It would be seen also that the bill was 
               <br />
               not the same as last Session, and the House 
               <br />
               should be cautious in making the change which 
               <br />
               would leave too much power in the hands of

               the contractors. The bill gave them the ri ht
