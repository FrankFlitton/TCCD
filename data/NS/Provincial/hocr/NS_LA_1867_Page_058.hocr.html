               Mr. BLACKWOODz— As I intend to support 
               <br />
               the amendment, I feel that I should like to say 
               <br />
               a few words before the vote is taken. I sup- 
               <br />
               port it on the principle that however ﬁnely 
               <br />
               argued the case may be in reference to conexi- 
               <br />
               tutional authority, there is a sense of right and 
               <br />
               wrong which tells us that this privilege be- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">longs</span> to the people, and if there be no prece-

               dent in favour of the course, we urge it is time 
               <br />
               we made one when the constitution is to be 
               <br />
               changed, and when the eyes of the world are 
               <br />
               on us. If ever there was a time when the 
               <br />
               feelings of the people should be consulted it is 
               <br />
               the present. The time of the house will short-

               measure could be completed shortly after- 
               <br />
               wards I do not consider that within this

               consider his views as the subject of discussion 
               <br />

               With reference to annexation, I may say

               was about this great question of Confederation, 
               <br />
               I have replied that it was not. one of so small

               the subject, nor they me, but I have viewed 
               <br />
               the matter in its broadest aspect. and 
               <br />
               nothing has occurred to shake the opinion

               <br />
               years have rolled round. Therefore when my 
               <br />
               opinion has been asked I have felt disinclined

               <br />

               <br />
               I was unavoidably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">detained—my</span> mind was 
               <br />

               <br />

               what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> did last winter when it ﬁxed the dos- 
               <br />
               tiny of the Province and clothed those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-</span> 
               <br />
               men with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authority,</span> of delegates The pe- 
               <br />
               titions sent across the water could not be ex— 
               <br />
               pected to have had any effect—on any public 
               <br />
               question of interest a cartload of them could 
               <br />
               be obtained Without any result. One beneﬁt 
               <br />
               that will accrue from Confederation is that the 
               <br />
               General Government wiucontrol the currency. 
               <br />
               I look upon the mode in which our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincial</span> 
               <br />
               currency has been managed as imprudent and 
               <br />
               selﬁsh; a number of bankers, by combining, 
               <br />
               have controlled the currency completely. In- 
               <br />
               stead of £140,000 in Province notes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,we</span> should 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">havehad</span> half a million years ago afloat, and the 
               <br />
               condition of our ﬁnances would have been far 
               <br />
               better. Another advantage is the construction 
               <br />
               of the Intercolonial Railroad, and the extension 
               <br />
               of our other roads, which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I.</span> believe , we could 
               <br />
               not have without the union. In view of these 
               <br />
               questions I have felt that if my last hour had
