<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come to
look at our militia estimates for this</span><br />
year, I think it will be found that we
have done <br />
more for our defence than Canada, in pro-<br />
portion to our resources and population,
and <br />
therefore when I say that we are more loyal<br />
I prove it by the law on the statute book,
and<br />
by the liberal provision contained in the
esti<br />
mates. The Pro. Sec. told us that this
union<br />
will give us a character and nationality we<br />
do not now possess—that we have now no
locus<br />
standi and have no weight amongsth the
nations<br />
of the world. I ask how is it going to
improve<br />
our position in that respect to annex us
to Ca-<br />
nada? Is it going to add to our importance
of<br />
position to deprive us of our Lieutenant
Go-<br />
vernor, and our character as a province,
and <br />
reduce us to the condition of a mere
depend-<br />
ency of a larger province? If it does, I
certain-<br />
ly am at a loss to understand it. It is
not a <br />
very difficult matter to account for the
anxiety<br />
of Canada for this union. Everybody knows<br />
the troubled state of affairs that have
existed in <br />
that country for years, and it is natural
that<br />
they should turn to us, not from any
regard to<br />
our interests, but as a panacea for their
own<br />
ills. They saw a country with a low tariff,<br />
able to uphold all her institutions and
her pub-<br />
lic works—able to devote $80,000 for her
de-<br />
fence, and have a surplus besides—and, like<br />
Napoleon's giant and the dwarf, they are
pre-<br />
pared to squeeze us, affectionately it may
be,<br />
but it is the giant's nature to squeeze
hard.<br />
The hon. Pro. Sec. told us as an
irresistible ar-<br />
gument in favour of his views—that that
great<br />
organ, the Times, had declared in favour
of the <br />
shceme, and therefore we must submit. In<br />
fact, as Nebuchadneezer told the
Babylonians<br />
of old—we must bown down and worship the <br />
graven image he has sat up. Now I will,
with<br />
the permission of the house, read a few ex-<br />
tracts from the letter of the
correspondent of <br />
that paper, who came here during the visit
of <br />
H. R. H. the Prince of Wales—and who was <br />
so well up in the geography of the country,<br />
that on his way to Halifax he found
himself at<br />
Toronto. Hear what he says abour Windsor:</p>







<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"So on I got to Windsor, a village of shan-<br />
ties and some 1,200 people, where a well
mean-<br />
ing, but mistaken, individual has built an<br />
hotel large enought to accommodate all the
in-<br />
habitants. The latter, however, as might
have <br />
been anticipated, prefer living in their
huts; so <br />
this hotel has never been opened to this <br />
day. * * *</p>




<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">This sir, is the way in which the
accredited <br />
correspondent of this great paper maligns
the<br />
people of this Province, on an occasion
when, I<br />
am proud to say, they did themselves honor
in <br />
the reception they give their Prince.</p>














<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Then again, in speaking of the daughters
of <br />
Acadia, who are renowned the world over for<br />
their beautym their intelligence, and
their vir-<br />
tue—this is the way he dares to speak of
them:<br />
"Halifax, at first, does not impress one
fa-<br />
vorably; for the entrance from the station
in-<br />
cludes, as usual, all the worst
thoroughfares<br />
and meanest houses, where the sun burnt na-<br />
tives loll out of their windows all day,
and<br />
where brightly dressed Indian squaws, with<br />
their great splaw feet, covered with thick<br />
mocassins, tramp along with little papooses<br />
tied hand and foot to a flat piece of
board, and<br />
looking like some curious preparation of an<br />
infant being dried in the sun."</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">And yet this is the paper that the
Provincial<br />
Secretary thinks should influence the judg-<br />

I<br />
shall not detain this house with any

this<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Speaker,—We have been charged with <br />
making this a party question. But surely
the<br />
position which members on both sides occupy<br />
in reference to it is sufficient to show
we are<br />
not amenable to such a charge. For myself
I <br />
am about to address the house in
opposition to<br />
the views propounded by my political party<br />
leader; and let me say that no act of my
little<br />
political life has given me half the pain
I feel<br />
in being compelled to take a position in
oppo-<br />
sition to that hon. gentleman,.There are
other<br />
considerations which might well cause me to<br />
hesitate: not only is the question the most<br />
momentous ever discussed here, but there
is <br />
the further consideration that it has been
ma-<br />
tured by thirty-three gentlemen who claim,<br />
and perhaps not undeservedly, to be among<br />
the ablest in British America. But if I
might<br />
be disposed to hesitate from these
considerat-<br />
tions, I remember that I am here to act
upon<br />
my own conscientious convictions of wht is
<br />
right and wrong—of what may be or may not<br />
be for the good of my country—and not upon<br />
other men's capabilities of forming a
correct<br />
judgement. For apart from considerations
of a <br />
political nature which may and do too often<br />
influence men, there are occasions when the<br />
most enlarged and comprehensive minds<br />
overlook the useful and the practical in
the<br />
contemplation of the ideal. So had it been,<br />
I believe on the present occasion. Men<br />
have given up to an idea, or a sentiment
that <br />
which they should never have yielded,
except<br />
to sound argument and strong conclusive
fact.<br />
I believe that the idea or sentiment of
union<br />
has had very much to do with influencing<br />
men's minds upon this subject. When the<br />
Provincial Secretary, in addressing the
house<br />
on the history of this question, referred
to the <br />
most unanimous applause with which the sub-<br />
ject of union had been greeted when
mention-<br />
ed on platform or festive occasions, I
thought<br />
at the time that very much of that applause<br />
was given to the sentiment or idea of union<br />
which has always a charm for men's minds<br />
and not so much to the practical workings
of a <br />
union of these provinces. There are perhaps<br />
few words in the English language that
have <br />
such an influence over men's minds as that
lit-<br />
tle word "Union." We have seen in the
neigh-<br />
boring republic how powerful an influence
this <br />
"union sentiment" exercises over the
people.<br />
Many years ago when the question of the ad-<br />
mission of Texas into the Union was under<br />
consideration, Daniel Webster, than whom<br />
America has not known a mightier intellect,<br />
warned the Senate against the extension of
<br />
territory Southward. That warning voice was<br />
unheeded. The union sentiment prevailed,<br />
