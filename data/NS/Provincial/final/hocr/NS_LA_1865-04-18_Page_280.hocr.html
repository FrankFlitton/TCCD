<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> So that for these liabilities, when
completed, <br />
we shall have to provide a Revenue of nearly <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000</span> a year.  But this is not
all.  We bor- <br />
row money, which we ought not to have bor- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rowed, </span>to erect a building in
Halifax which <br />
is to cost us £30,000.  We borrow, to be sure, <br />
from the Savings’ Bank, and to pay only 4 <br />
per cent, but this will entail some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,000</span>
addi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tional for</span> interest.  So that if
this added to the <br />
other sums, we may fairly put our whole bur- <br />
then at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000</span> a year, and
this to be paid all <br />
by new taxation.  True, the Prov. Sec’y says <br />
that we may count an additional revenue from <br />
the Railroads as reducing the charge.  But we <br />
are already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">counting $50,000.</span> 
The Finl. Sec’y <br />
has taken credit for that amount this year. <br />
In 1863, the whole yield was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$22,000</span>
or there- <br />
abouts.  In 1864, very little more, and it is be- <br />
yond reasonable probability that will yield <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000 in 1865.</span>  But if, when
the roads <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> <br />
completed, there is a larger yield, it will arise <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> a larger traffic, and just
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proportion</span>
to <br />
the trafﬁc will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be the</span> wear and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tear,</span> and the <br />
time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is at</span> hand when necessarily
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>perma- <br />
nent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way will</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">require</span> to be renewed, and all <br />
that we can obtain, and more, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span>
be required <br />
for that service when it has to be done. </span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now, </span>Mr.

</span>It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not very </span>wise to <br />

temporary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deﬁciency, </span>the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span> of which <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be about</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$8,000</span> a year.  And yet<br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen </span>who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raised </span>that cry, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and who</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made the</span> people believe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it, are not</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only enor-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mously increasing the ordinary

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but adding a debt which must be provided

</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked the Govern-</span><br />

pro-</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bability nothing could be done for one
year, </span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even if they passed the resolution.  New

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick was hardly in a condition to
incur</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">additional liability, and if it were, he
had rea-</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">son to believe that the favorite project
there </span><br />
would be western extension.  The people<br />
of that Province were deeply interested <br />
