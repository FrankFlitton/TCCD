               great value. For my own part, however, I do<br />
not underrate its influence; but it should be<br />
remembered that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> got its inspiration<br />
from the same source as Mr. Cardwell—from<br />
the gentlemen who formed the Convention.—<br />
If the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times'</span> writers had been living amongst<br />
us, or had means of knowing the tendency of<br />
public opinion in these provinces, its articles<br />
would have been very different. The views of <br />
Mr. Howe, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Young have<br />
been referred to in connection with this ques-<br />
tion. Mr. Howe held certain opinions respect-<br />
ing representation in the Imperial Parliament,<br />
and has expressed various views at various<br />
times on the Union of the Provinces. But may<br />
not circumstances have very much changed<br />
since such views were expressed? I have my-<br />
self expressed opinions favorable to a Union.<br />
I have wished that the time would come when<br />
we might form a great nation. If a humber<br />
individual like myself saw reason to change<br />
his views, might not Mr. Howe and others do<br />
the same? Are gentlemen bound to entertain<br />
the same views always irrespective of circum-<br />
stances that may arise requiring a modification<br />
of change of these views. A great stress has<br />
been laid upon the nationality that these Pro-<br />
vinces would acquire ; instead of being insigni-<br />
ficant dependencies, they would form a nation<br />
that would be respected abroad. I believe that<br />
the formation of such a nation would lead to<br />
independence of England. Isolated as we are<br />
now, we could not form an independent state.<br />
Perhaps, however, some gentlement have long-<br />
ings to see such a result obtained.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I have no desire to dwell further upon this<br />
subject, expect to say that I am quite unwilling<br />
to support the resolution on the table unless<br />
there is a guarantee given that no change will<br />
be effected without consulting the wishes of<br />
the people. The matter has now assumed a <br />
very different aspect to what it did when the<br />
resolution was introduced last session. We au-<br />
thorized these gentlemen to perform certain<br />
duties and they went beyond their authority,<br />
and their course has caused a great deal of dis-<br />
satisfaction. Under such circumstances I can-<br />
not authorize any set of men to suggest any<br />
change that will touch our constitution without<br />
an appeal to the people. With the people of<br />
this country must rest the decision as to a<br />
union of the Maritime Provinces. I believe, in <br />
all sincerity, that we are prospering sufficient-<br />
ly, and I cannot see how any change in our<br />
constitution is going to improve our present<br />
condition. I had intended referring to some<br />
other points which have been brought up in<br />
this debate, especially to the remarks of the<br />
Provincial Secretary as to the influence that <br />
the Cape Breton members exercise in this<br />
house; but as I shall perhaps have an oppor-<br />
tunity of doing so, I shall not enter upon this <br />
subject at length at present. Let me say, how-<br />
ever, that such an influence does not exist, and <br />
the Provincial Secretary knows it well. No<br />
section of this Province exercises less influences<br />
than Cape Breton in provincial matters. If<br />
there is a public office to be filled up, Cape<br />
Breton is entirely ignored, and many of its<br />
adopted sons' claims, some of them very strong<br />
indeed, have been disregarded, whilst a few<br />
counties are especially favored. I have already<br />
referred to Cumberland in connection with the<br />
delegation. Perhaps the hon. Provincial Se-<br />
cretary can explain the especial claims of that<br />
county to consideration. Is all the ability and<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               talent of the country in that county? Look<br />
again at the county of Annapolis; that county<br />
has given a judge to the bench—a gentleman<br />
who is an ornament to the position, all will ad-<br />
mit. We have also taken a deputy secretary<br />
from that county, a Sol. General, a commission-<br />
er of railways, and I believe, sire, that you, the <br />
chief Commoner of Nova Scotia, are also a na-<br />
tive of Annapolis,—besides the promise of a<br />
railway, and Bear River bridge grant. And<br />
yet despite all these favors heaped upon them,<br />
how ungrateful were the people last election.<br />
I think I can promise any government that<br />
would give us all these good things more sup-<br />
port from the island of Cape breton than this<br />
ungrateful county of Annapolis has given, for<br />
the Cape Bretonians are always grateful.<br />
However, I shall not dwell upon this question<br />
at present, for it is, perhaps, somewhat fo-<br />
reign to the real matter at issue. In conclusion,<br />
let me say that I regret having occupied so<br />
much time in adressing the house, and I must<br />
apologize for not having acquitted myself as<br />
well as was due to the house; but I feel strong-<br />
ly upon this question, and must repeat what I <br />
have already said—that no question involving<br />
a change in our constitution should be dealt<br />
with by this house, without the wishes of the<br />
people being first consulted.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speech of Mr. McFarlane.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. MCFARLANE said:—At this late<br />
period of the session I feel that it is absurd to<br />
attempt to engage the attention of the house<br />
with any langthy speech. Indeed, I do not think<br />
the subject we are now discussing is one which<br />
should have occupied so much time as it has<br />
already. It appears to me that on the present<br />
occasion we are attempting to jump before we<br />
get to the style. Gentlemen have spent some<br />
three or four days in delivering speeched which<br />
would be quite appropriate if we had the ques-<br />
tion of union before us for our final decision.<br />
This resolution says on the face of it that a<br />
union with Canada is at present impractica-<br />
ble, and simply proposes a delegation to confer<br />
with others from the other Provinces on a sub-<br />
ject of a union of the Maritime Colonies. yet<br />
gentlemen have gone at great length into the<br />
subject of the union of all the provinces. Had<br />
that question come legitimately before the le-<br />
gislature, then it would have been our duty to<br />
have solemnly investigated the matter and<br />
given it our most mature consideration. But<br />
the untoward event that lately took place in<br />
New Brunswick prevented us dealing with the<br />
question of the larger union. All efforts to<br />
press forward any measure under such cir-<br />
cumstancces would have been spent in vain. I<br />
have no hesitation in saying that all my feel-<br />
ings are strongly in favor of union. I am not<br />
afraid to say that the general welfare of these<br />
provinces in the future is closely connected<br />
with their confederation. I do not believe that <br />
any connection with Canada would be other-<br />
wise than beneficial to us. Western Canada<br />
would feel that her interests were bound up<br />
with ours,—whatever benefitted us would be<br />
of advantage to her—and we would feel the<br />
same way. We would form all a part of one<br />
whole, and whatever affected one portion<br />
would affect the other. How is it with our-<br />
selves? Nova Scotia is divided into a number<br />
of counties. I know little of Yarmouth, but <br />
when the hon. member for the county comes<br />
