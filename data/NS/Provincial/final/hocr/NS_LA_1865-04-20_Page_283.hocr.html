<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> all apparent that the construction of
these rail- <br />
ways was to impose burthens we could not <br />
bear, I would hesitate before adopting the reso- <br />
lution.  No man in this country, however, can <br />
deny that, if we are able to obtain the connec- <br />
tion with St. John, and with the railway sys- <br />
tem of the continent, we shall gain vast com- <br />
mercial advantages.  The increase in trade will <br />
soon counterbalance any additional burthens <br />
that we may impose upon ourselves.  Rail- <br />
ways make trade wherever they pass, and no <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> can doubt that a road to the
fertile coun- <br />
ties of King’s and Annapolis would be not <br />
only a great boon to the people of the west, <br />
but create an ultimately remunerative traﬂic. <br />
In due time a trade would accumulate that <br />
would repay handsomely the Province for the <br />
expenditure it might incur. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. </span>TOBIN
said that for the last few years so <br />
much had been said upon the question of Rail- <br />
roads, it was impossible to bring forward <br />
anything new on the subject.  There were <br />
a great many things in the speech of the hon. <br />
leader of the opposition, to which he would have <br />
liked to refer ; but as he perceived that he was <br />
not in his place, he should refrain from doing so. <br />
If the present position of this country were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> <br />
trasted with the condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span>
a few years <br />
ago, it would be found that from some cause or <br />
other, whether from the construction of railroads <br />
or the spirit of commercial enterprize, or the <br />
gradual expansion of trade, the Revenue had <br />
swelled to an extent beyond the expectation of the <br />
most sanguine.  He had taken the trouble a year <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago,</span> when it was proposed to
extend the railroad <br />
to Pictou, to look into the question, and to con- <br />
trast the state of our Revenue then with what it <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the railway system
was inaugurated, <br />
and what did he ﬁnd ? <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 427 2638 1499 2733">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> (The hon. gentleman here said that he had<br />
mislaid the memorandum of ﬁgures he had prepared ; <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> speaking from memory) the
Revenue, which <br />
in 1851 amounted to £102, 632, had swelled in <br />
10 years (1861) to over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£281,000,</span>
and this year <br />
the Financial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Secretary</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimates</span> it at over <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,300,000.</span>  So it will be seen
that since the <br />
construction of railroads has been commenced, <br />
that the trade of the country has increased—labor <br />
has been multiplied,—and the expenditure of the <br />
Province has been kept within its income.  He<br />
had prepared a few calculations as to the amount<br />
of liability annually imposed upon this country <br />
by the construction of these public works, and <br />
ﬁrst as to the two links already completed to <br />
Truro and Windsor.  Some hon gentlemen wish- <br />
ed to leave these where they were ; but that he <br />
never could assent to.  He believed that they <br />
never could be made properly remunerative until <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> tapped the waters of the St.
Lawrence on the <br />
one hand, and the Bay of Fundy on the other. </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In approaching this subject, he wished to
do <br />
so in a spirit of fairness and candor.  He did not<br />
wish to state the liability we would be called upon<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> assume <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> a dollar less than it really would
be. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">For </span>many years we have spent
large sums of the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public monies in constructing mud <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roads.</span>  This <br />
session, over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$250.</span>000 has been
voted for that <br />

that <br />
altho’ the Province can afford to do that, she <br />
cannot undertake the construction of the e public <br />

material prosperity of the country. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_17" title="bbox 1536 745 2670 2169">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> To return, however, to the subject of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liability—-</span> <br />
he found that the Province had issued debentures <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the extent</span> of a million of
pounds for the con- <br />
struction of the lines to Windsor and Truro—this <br />
involved an annual liability of £60,000 for in- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terest.</span>&nbsp; No difficulty had ever
been experienced <br />
in paying that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
Province had always <br />
been prepared when called upon to meet all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de-</span> <br />
mands, and certainly she was in a better condi-<br />
tion now, than when railway construction was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commenced.</span>&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />Then again, we have, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> some <br />
delay, undertaken the construction of the line to <br />
Pictou—the propriety of that extension has al- <br />
ways been admitted, and it was only a question <br />
of time as to when the ﬁnances of the country <br />
would admit of its being undertaken.&nbsp; The esti- <br />
mated cost of that work is £500,000, which will <br />
impose an annual liability of £30, 000.&nbsp; That <br />
liability, however, will not fall upon us imme- <br />
diately ; but will be extended over three years, as <br />
the work goes on—and as the business of the <br />
country would also go on increasing, there is no <br />
doubt, that there would be no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trouble</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meeting</span> <br />
these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obligations.</span>&nbsp; The
Government now propose <br />
to subsidize any company to construct the line to <br />
the borders of New Brunswick—which is esti-<br />
mated to cost £400,000, when
capitalized, involv-<br />
ing an annual charge on the Revenues of the <br />
Province of £24,000 a year. It is also proposed <br />
to extend the line to Annapolis.&nbsp; Last year, a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
resolution was passed by the House, offering any <br />
company that would undertake to construct the <br />
line, a subvention of 4 per cent. on £6,000 per <br />
mile.&nbsp; It appears, after a lapse of‘a year, that no <br />
company is willing to undertake the work, unless <br />
the Government will build the bridge over the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Avon—that</span> bridge is estimated to
cost £40,000. <br />
The cost of the Annapolis road, at £6,000 per <br />
mile, will amount to £50,000—if that is<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> capital-</span> <br />
ized at the same rate of four per cent—it will give <br />
£20,400 annual interest to be paid by the Pro-<br />
vince. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Then again, take the cost of bridging the
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Avon—</span> <br />
the hon. leader of the Opposition undertook to ques- <br />

the only <br />means of judging, was from the report of the En- <br />
gineer, and he did not think that the Government <br />
had any motive or desire to conceal from the coun- <br />
