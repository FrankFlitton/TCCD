<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try. It
would be soliciting the British Go-<br />
vernment to place us in a position which we<br />
should never be placed in ; it would be asking<br />
the Parliament of England to consent to that<br />
which would be only worthy of a century that<br />
is past. The person who has ventured to tram-<br />
ple down the scheme of the Quebec Confer-<br />
ence, and bring forward the plan of the Anti-<br />
Unionists, should have better informed him-<br />
self of the facts as they exist. Did he not <br />
know that 180 millions of people in British <br />
India could not have a farthing of that tax<br />
levied upon them, as they provide now for the <br />
defence of the British Empire in the East at an<br />
enormous annual cost.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">This £36,000,000 currency would, therefore,<br />
under this plan require to be levied upon about <br />
36,000,000 millions instead of 300,000,000. I will<br />
not presume that it was an attempt to mislead,<br />
but it is charitable to suppose that the parties<br />
who have attempted to instruct the people of<br />
this country in opposition to the great scheme<br />
of Union, did not know that this £8,000,000<br />
sterling for the Army and Navy was altogether<br />
irrespective of the Army and Navy of British <br />
India.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Yet is by documents such as these that the<br />
people of these Maritime Provinces have been<br />
excited to hostility against a scheme which<br />
would have made the British American Pro-<br />
vinces a great nationality, of which their people<br />
might be justly proud ; which would have ex-<br />
tended our commerce and promoted our welth<br />
and prosperity to an extent that is incalculable,<br />
and at the ame time connect us more closely <br />
with the Parent State, drawing around us that<br />
aid and co-operation which would have secured <br />
to us and our children after us, to the most <br />
remote posterity, that guarantee of peace and<br />
safety which every man amongst us feels it<br />
ought to be his privilege to enjoy.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">COMMERCE AND SHIPPING.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I need not allude to the commerce and ship-<br />
ping that British America would enjoy under<br />
Union. These statistics were known to all.<br />
But when I am asked the question, as to whe-<br />
ther British America is in a position to enter<br />
into the Union? I reply: Let us compare the<br />
position that these provinces now occupy with<br />
that which the American colonies had at the<br />
time of their independence. We find we have<br />
a larger population, and occupy a position in<br />
many respects superior to that which they <br />
then did. Look at their trade, and you find<br />
that they had only one third of what we have<br />
now. Their population and revenue were<br />
much smaller. In respect, therefore, to trade<br />
population and revenue, upon which the great-<br />
ness of a country rests, you find the position of<br />
British America is one of evident influence.<br />
The American colonies, by sweeping away<br />
hostile tariffs, and emerging from that position<br />
of isolation which they occupied, have attained<br />
their present wealth and prosperity. Look at<br />
our shipping, and see at this moment the ton-<br />
nage of British America, amounting to over<br />
900,00 tons occupying a place next to France<br />
- the fourth commercial marine in the world.<br />
But I need not go into any labored arguments<br />
to show that the time has come when we should<br />
assume a position of nationality under the ægies<br />
of old England. </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE POSITION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It has been said that whilst the General
Go-<br />
vernment would possess large powers, with an</p>

<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 380 489 1515 1620">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">influential legislature, the local governments<br />
and legislatures would sink into contempt.<br />
Those who make such a statement must ignore<br />
our past history. I would ask gentleman to <br />
look at the history of the past, and see whether<br />
there is evidence to sustain the proposition <br />
that the governments of these provinces would<br />
occupy so contemptible a position that no man<br />
of character and influence would be inclined <br />
to have anything to do with them. In the first<br />
place, the subsidy that this province would<br />
receive in connection with the revenue from<br />
the mines and minerals would be double the<br />
revenue that it had at the time when the men<br />
who have made the legislature famous occu-<br />
pied seats within those walls. Not only would<br />
we have double the amount of revenue, but<br />
we would have larger powers, and possess<br />
more commanding influence in relation to the <br />
public affairs of the province than the govern-<br />
ment and parliament of this province had at<br />
the time when Chief Justice Haliburton, the<br />
Lord Bishop of Nova Scotia, Judge Bliss, the <br />
Masters of the Rolls (Archibald and Stewart)<br />
occupied seats in this house. Can we say<br />
then, when we shall have double the revenue,<br />
and a far more influential position, that we<br />
will not have men of ability and intellect to<br />
enter our legislative halls.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE PRESENT ASPECT OF THE QUESTION <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">OF UNION.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">We do not come to the discussion of this<br />
question in the position and attitude that I <br />
expected and hoped we should at the time this<br />
legislature assembled. We did not come to<br />
the discussion with a view to an immediate<br />
practical decision upon the question of Con-<br />
federation, but I would do injustice to what I <br />
believe to be the intelligence and patriotism of<br />
Nova Scotia if I did not say in my place in<br />
parliament that I am confident that the <br />
scheme of intercolonial union which had been <br />
devised at Quebec has taken, and will take<br />
such a hold on the public mind of all these<br />
provinces as to ensure its adoption at an early<br />
day in all its entirety. I would be doing in-<br />
justice to the question and the evidence that ex-<br />
ists on every side if I entertained a doubt that<br />
when the facts came to be examined and sifted<br />
by the intelligence of this province, they will<br />
with great unanimity unite in promoting and <br />
consumating a scheme which is fraught withs<br />
such incalculable advantages to the best in-<br />
terests of British North America.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Owing to circumstances over which we have<br />
no control, the government of Nova Scotia is <br />
placed in a position which renders it useless to<br />
bring this scheme down for the decision of the<br />
Legislature Every person who knows the<br />
geographical position of the country, with<br />
New Brunswick lying between us and Cana-<br />
da, must see that any Union of British Ame-<br />
rica is impracticable unless the latter province<br />
s a party to it. I regret to say that pubilc<br />
men in that province have been unpatriotic<br />
enough to forget their duty to their country,<br />
and to enter into combinations which I regret<br />
to say were too successful with those hos-<br />
tile to British North American Union,<br />
for the purpose of overthrowing the govern-<br />
ment, and under these circumstances the <br />
question of union of British North America<br />
has received a heavy blow and great discour-<br />
agement; but we would be underating the pa-<br />
early day that province would reverse its de-<br />
