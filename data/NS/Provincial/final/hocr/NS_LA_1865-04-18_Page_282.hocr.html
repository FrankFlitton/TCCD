<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> $800,000, and that there will not be any
serious <br />
dificulty in obtaining the money required.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. gentleman next stated that the <br />
adoption of the resolutions on the table would <br />
impose upon the country an additional bur- <br />
den of $400,000 per annum for Railway in- <br />
terest; and on giving us his assumption that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$800,000</span> will hereafter be the
highest amount <br />
on which we can calculate as revenue re- <br />
ceipts, he concludes that we shall not be in a <br />
position to meet the increased demands upon <br />
our revenues.  Now, sir, I assume that our <br />
revenue for at least a few years to come, will <br />
not be materially less than at present; and I <br />
found the estimate upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increasing</span>
trade <br />
of the country, which I have before endeavor- <br />
ed to show the house, must inevitably be the <br />
result of the large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditures</span>
now being and <br />
likely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hereafter</span> to be made on
our public works <br />
and in the development of the mineral wealth <br />
of the country.  The hon. gentleman has alto- <br />
gether ignored this view of the question, and <br />
also the not only probable but inevitable in— <br />
crease in our casual and territorial revenue. <br />
We must also consider the very large increase <br />
which must take place in the earnings of ourpre-<br />
sent railways on the completion of the contem- <br />
plated extensions, east, north and west.  Now it <br />
must be evident to the house that every coal <br />
mine opened not only represents the capital <br />
invested in its development, but gives annu- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ally an</span> additional revenue in
proportion to the <br />
extent of its shipments—just as every addi- <br />
tional mile of railway built in connection with <br />
existing lines will throw a large additional <br />
traﬂic on the government work.  The receipts <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on our</span> roads are even now largely
increasing, <br />
as every month’s return <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shows—and</span>
I shall be <br />
much mistaken if the receipts this year will <br />
not amount to $200,000 as against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$168,000</span>
last <br />
year I assume, therefore, that I may safely <br />
ask the country to base the revenue for a few <br />
years to come on the estimated revenue for the <br />
present year—and on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
assumption it will <br />
not be difﬁcult to show that even without re— <br />
sorting to the expedient of raising <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span>
present <br />
tariff the additional burdens could be met, and <br />
all the substantial interests of the country <br />
subserved.  Indeed, was I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inclined</span>
to rely <br />
upon such authority alone, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I need</span>
only quote <br />
the speech of his friend the hon. member for <br />
East <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Halifax,</span> who, in a speech
delivered in <br />
Temperance Hall, when his object was not to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depreciate</span> the resources of his
country, proved <br />
to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demonstration</span>—if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his figures be accepted  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as of</span> any value—that the country
could safely <br />
undertake <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contemplated by</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this reso-</span> <br />
lution without seriously entrenching upon the <br />
other essential services of the country.   The <br />
hon. gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has even</span> stated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> liability <br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the adoption</span> of these
resolutions will <br />
entail—the amount being $312,000 with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> <br />
terest on the cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
construction of the Avon <br />
bridge.  Thi<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">s</span> estimate will give

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Leaving a balance of only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$96,528</span> to be made <br />
up from the increased receipts upon our rail- <br />
ways and on the revenue derived from our <br />
coal and gold mines—or if necessary by a <br />
small addition to our tariff, which would not <br />
be felt by the people, and which they would <br />
willingly grant on advantages to be derived. <br />
It was never contemplated by any one party in <br />
this house that our public works could be large- <br />
ly extended without somewhat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increasing
our</span> <br />
tariff, at present the lowest in America; but it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> not necessary that I should
now enter on <br />
that subject.  One word now, sir, as to the <br />
propriety of a gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupying</span>
the posi- <br />
tion admittedly occupied by the hon. and learn- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
ed gentleman from Colchester, as a ﬁnancier, <br />
for any purpose attempting against the facts <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> case to depreciate the
financial position <br />
and character of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the country</span> at
a time when <br />
it is the duty of every man to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further
and</span> sus- <br />
tain its credit.  That hon. gentleman's position <br />
and talents give even false and erroneous views <br />
and assertions when propounded by him, a <br />
weight and consideration which would not <br />
otherwise attach to them, and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> held <br />
responsible by the country for allowing his <br />
eagerness to embarrass the government to be- <br />
tray him into the hasty and inconsiderate state- <br />
ment of facts either <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utterly </span>baseless
or found- <br />
ed on mere <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speculation, but which<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> may, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not,-</span>
<br />
withstanding, coming from such authority have <br />
a tendency to injure the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public credit.&nbsp; His</span>
<br />
calculations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day, sir,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">somewhat </span>on a <br />
par with those by which in<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
1859 he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prov-</span> <br />
ed so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusively</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the </span>Pictou Rail-<br />
way could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> built at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cost to the Pro-</span>
<br />
vince of&nbsp; £6000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a </span>year, and, I am sorry to<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say, are not a bit more reliable than that<br />
celebrated financial statement.&nbsp; I have thus <br />
shown that the hon. gentleman's attempt</span><br />
to impugn the correctness of&nbsp; the estimates on<br />
the table have utterly failed.&nbsp; I have attempt-<br />
ed, and I think with success, to show that the<br />
large expenditure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this Government for the</span>
<br />
present year is founded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon </span>well-considered <br />
and safe calculations of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our resources,</span>
and that <br />
Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Archibald’s</span> attempt to
play the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alarmist</span> is <br />
due rather to his desire to embarrass <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or </span>injure <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government </span>than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />to any fear of finan- <br />
cial embarrassment on the part of the men who <br />
did not hesitate to embrace the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> <br />
