<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It was a king of bears—an Ursa Major<br />
    The fattest bear beneath the sun.<br />
The skin the chaps would wager,<br />
    Was cheap at double cost;<br />
'Twould make one laugh at first—<br />
    And make two robes as well as one.<br />
(In their accounts 'twas theirs<br />
    But in his own the bears.)<br />
By bargain struck upon the skin<br />
    Three months at most must bring it in,<br />
Forth went the five. More easy found than got,<br />
    The bear came growing at them on the trot,<br />
Behold our dealers all confounded,<br />
    As if by thunderbolt astounded !<br />
Their bargain vanished suddenly in air ;<br />
    For who could plead his interest with a bear?<br />
Four of the friends sprung up a tree:<br />
    The other, cold as ice could be,<br />
Fell on his face, feigned death,<br />
    And closely held his breath,—<br />
He having somewhere—heard it said<br />
    The bear ne'er preys upon the dead.<br />
Sir Bear, sad blockhead, was deceived—<br />
    The prostrate man a corpes believed ;<br />
But, half suspecting some deceit,<br />
    He feels and snuffs from head to feet,<br />
And in the nostrils blows.<br />
    The body's surely dead. he thinks<br />
I'll leave it for it stinks ;<br />
    And off into the woods he goes.<br />
The other dealers from their tree<br />
    Descending cantiously, to see<br />
Their comrade lying in the dirt<br />
    Consoling, says it is a wonder<br />
That, by the monster forced assunder,<br />
    Were—after all—more scared than hurt,<br />
But, addeth they, what of the creatures skin?<br />
    He held his muzzle very near ;<br />
What did he whisper in your ear ?<br />
    He gave this caution,—"Never dare<br />
Again to sell the skin of bear<br />
    Its owner had not ceased to wear.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Now our dealers not finding Sir Bear
disposed<br />
to quietly part with his skin have determined to<br />
get him into a trap. They seek by this resolu-<br />
tion on the table for another convention to en-<br />
trap Nova Scotia into the scheme as arranged at<br />
Quebec. My hon. friend from Richmond is cor-<br />
rect in stating that they have not other object in <br />
view, and I shall ask the House to follow me<br />
while I consider the constitution prepared for us<br />
at that Quebec conference.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">We are told by the Provincial Secretary of
the <br />
government they proposed to constitute a Defer-<br />
ation of British North America. And it appears<br />
to me that in the very outset, in the second reso-<br />
lution of this report, they have given the evidence<br />
which shows that this Federal Union cannot be<br />
stable under the circumstances. They allude there<br />
to the "diversity of the interests of the several<br />
Provinces."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The fact that the interests of the
Provinces are<br />
so diversified that each has its own interest, and<br />
its centre of interest within itself—precluded the<br />
possibility of a Federal Union being formed to<br />
work harmoniously. Under present regulations<br />
our seperate interests are not brought into<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">antagonism—why then should we bring about<br />
a change which will make the interests of the <br />
several Provinces clash and destroy that harmony<br />
of feeling that is existing among these Colonies?<br />
The hon. member for South Colchester, read to<br />
you from Judge Story, that when Provinces<br />
unite they make mutual sacrifices and concessions<br />
in order to obtain some great purpose. One pur-<br />
pose for which they would make that sacrifice <br />
would be, that they might obtain mutual<br />
aid. In this case there would not be that<br />
influence at work in order to induce us to<br />
consent to a sacrifice of our interests—an attack<br />
upon one is under present regulation an attack upon<br />
all—besides we have now the protection of Eng-<br />
land—we have the command of her armies. She<br />
has told us that her honour demands that she<br />
should protect her Colonies. Therefore, while<br />
they are loyal, no necessity exists why we should<br />
make such sacrifices as is prposed. And if the<br />
necessity be not apparent the people will not sub-<br />
mit to them.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I come now to another branch of the subject—<br />
the nature of the representation. We have to have <br />
local governments, and a General Government<br />
over all. In that General Government, Nova<br />
Scotia is to have a representation of 19 out of 194.<br />
Now the Provincial Secretary tells us that this is<br />
as much as we have any right to expect accord-<br />
ing to our population, and he stated that if these<br />
terms were not just, we had only the delegates to<br />
blame. I contend, in view of the geographical<br />
position of Nova Scotia—800 miles may form the<br />
capital, and almost an island—that the principle<br />
of representation by population was not at all<br />
sufficient to do her justice. You don't ive to the <br />
city of Halifax a representation proportioned to<br />
the population because you feel that by the<br />
Parliament meeting here, influences can be<br />
brought to bear upon it that compensates for a less<br />
representation. As you recede from the place of<br />
the meeting of Parliament, representation should<br />
increase in order to give a balance of influence.—<br />
The city of London, with a population of nearly<br />
3,000,000—one-tenth of the Empire—has only<br />
16 representatives. If you adopted the principle<br />
in question, she ought to have one-tenth of the <br />
whole number in Parliament. The reason why it<br />
is not carried out, is the Parliament meets there,<br />
and that the influence given the city thereby, is<br />
sufficient for her. On examination of a table pre-<br />
pared in 1859, I find that as you recede from the <br />
place of meeting of Parliament—the proportion of<br />
representatives of counties to the population in-<br />
creases. The Counties of Middlesex, Surrey and<br />
Kent (exclusive of London) with a population of<br />
3,185,424 have 43 members ; one to every 74,074<br />
of the population ; in the extreme North, Cumber-<br />
land, Northumberland, and Durham, with a <br />
population of 890.059 have 29 members ; one to <br />
30,691 of population. On the extreme South, <br />
Cromwell, Devon and Dorset, having a population<br />
of 1,106,863 returns 50 members ; one to 22,137<br />
of population ; on the extreme west, Anglesea,<br />
Cameron and Denbigh have 237,780 population<br />
and 7 members. And so should there be an in-<br />
crease here, because the great distance from Otta-<br />
