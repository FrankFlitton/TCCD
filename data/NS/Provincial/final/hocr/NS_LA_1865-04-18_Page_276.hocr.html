and fer- <br />
tile counties of the west as originally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contem-</span>
<br />
plated when the railway system was inaugu- <br />
rated.&nbsp; He need hardly say that the house had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> always ready to adopt any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means</span> by <br />
which the Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> have a
railway com- <br />
munication with the neighboring Provinces <br />
and States.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Government <br />
last session brought forward a proposition <br />
which they thought would accomplish, without <br />
burthening our means, the two-fold object of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extending</span> our road to the borders
of New <br />
Brunswick and to the county of Annapolis in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> west.&nbsp; The resolution
authorized the Go- <br />
vernment to enter into contracts with compa- <br />
nies prepared to connect us with the railway <br />
system of New Brunswick, at a cost not to ex- <br />
ceed 4 per cent. for twenty years, on a capital <br />
of £10,000 a mile.&nbsp; At the same time they <br />
offered 4 per cent. on a capital of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£6,000</span>
a <br />
mile for the extension to Annapolis.&nbsp; The <br />
surveys that had been made of these lines <br />
had proved, they believed, that the reso- <br />
lution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> most ample
compensation to <br />
any companies that might undertake the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work.</span>&nbsp; Under the authority of
that resolu- <br />
tion, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Government placed
themselves in <br />
communication with parties who they had <br />
reason to believe would be disposed to carry <br />
out their policy, and the result of this corres— <br />
pondence has been to show that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provision</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> was not quite sufﬁcient.&nbsp;
The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> <br />
in the terms, however, was so slight, as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war-</span><br />
rant the house to carry out the policy which <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span> their sanction at the
last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">session.-</span><br />
</span>
</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">He went on to explain that the terms on <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> the offer of the
International Contract <br />
company was founded, involved but a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slight</span>
<br />
addition to the terms sanctioned last year, be- <br />
ing the cost of dredging the river Avon, which <br />
was estimated at £40,000, and the provision of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£100,000</span> of subscription for the
line to New <br />
Brunswick.&nbsp; He believed that the affirmation <br />
of the resolution would entirely do away with <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> objections of the city of
Halifax to taking <br />
the stock to this extent, but assuming that this <br />
sum had to be borrowed, it would only be an <br />
increase of two per cent., the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span>
of last year <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being to</span> the extent of four per
cent.&nbsp; As to the <br />
route of the railway nothing could be now de- <br />
ﬁnitely said, and that matter would have to be <br />
decided by the government upon a careful ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amination. </span> He said that the
debt of Nova <br />
Scotia was fixed by the delegates who repre- <br />
sented the government at the Quebec Confer- <br />
ence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at eight millions</span> in
consideration of the <br />
resolution of last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year in</span>
connection with rail- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ways.</span>  That increase to eight
millions would <br />
have given the means to complete the Pictou <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and </span>Western line, leaving the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intercolonial</span> <br />
road te be dealt with by the government, but <br />
assuming that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> colonies were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to </span>remain as <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> present the burthen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entailed</span> for the exten- <br />
sion would not be more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span>
£28,000 for the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trunk line, and £23,000 for
the western <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">line, in-</span> <br />
cluding the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cost of bridging </span>the
Avon, or about <br />
£50,000 per annum.&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He thought
there could <br />
be no doubt that the proposed extension <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span><br />
give us such an increase of trade and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue</span><br />
as would compensate for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure
in-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">volved.</span>&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> expressed surprise at the opinion
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enunciated on</span> a former day to the
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect </span>that <br />
railway construction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should be
undertaken</span>
by <br />
the government, by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Killam,
who had long <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been laboriously</span> maintaining <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the doctrine that</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such
construction</span>
should be left to foreign capi— <br />

<br />
that that gentleman’s conﬁdence in the govern- <br />
ment was so extended.&nbsp; He thought, however, <br />
under existing circumstances, it was not advis- <br />
able to prevent these capitalists who were de- <br />
sirous of constructing our railways coming <br />
in and expending their capital.<br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">KILLAM </span>said that it had always been <br />
his desire whenever the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span>
of railway <br />
extension was before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span>
to ex— <br />
press such opinions as he thought favorable to <br />
the prosperity of the Province.&nbsp; When the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span><br />
struction was commenced he thought it wise <br />
that the matter should be left to companies, but <br />
the other policy having been adopted he <br />
thought it would be well for the government to <br />
continue it in respect to the main Trunk line. <br />
It was estimated that the existing line would <br />
pay one per cent. above its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">working </span>expenses, <br />
and there was every reason for supposing that <br />
the extended line would be still more proﬁta- <br />
ble, while difﬁculties would be caused by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hav-</span><br />
ing the railway under two distinct manage- <br />
ments.&nbsp; If the lines were expected to pay four <br />
per cent. which the Province had offered would <br />
it not be well for the government to undertake <br />
their construction and realize whatever profit <br />
was to be made?&nbsp; He feared that by accepting <br />
the proposal the province would at the same <br />
time lose all the advantages that would arise <br />
from the increased prosperity of the country. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. ATTORNEY GEN. explained that the
go:- <br />
vernmcnt were to have the power at any time <br />
to take possession of the railway by arbitra- <br />
tion in the usual form. If we were to hand <br />
over the lines without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giving</span>
any control to <br />
the government or legislature, then there might <br />
be something in the argument of the hon. <br />
member for Yarmouth.&nbsp; He believed that the <br />
time had arrived when we should deal with <br />
this question.&nbsp; New Brunswick was prepared <br />
to build to our borders, and there was this gap <br />
between Truro and Moncton which should be <br />
built at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">once.</span>&nbsp; Connection with
the railway <br />
system of this continent was, as all would ad- <br />
mit, most desirable, as it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promote the</span>
<br />
best interests of this province.&nbsp; If the govern— <br />
ment could build the line directly out of the <br />
provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">funds,</span> it would be a
matter deserv- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> of serious consideration,
but under existing <br />
circumstances he was of opinion that it was <br />
the wisest policy for us to accept the best terms <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that were</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> us by companies who were <br />
ready to invest their capital in the country.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. ARCHIBALD</span>
alluded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im-</span><br />
portance of the subject under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration,</span>
<br />
and then went on to say that when the matter <br />
was before the house last year, he had the mis- <br />
fortune to be absent, and therefore had had no <br />
opportunity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> offering any
remarks upon it.—— <br />
Under these circumstances, he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">listened to</span>
<br />
the observations of the Pro. Sec. that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day</span>
<br />
with no little anxiety, for he was desirous of <br />
knowing upon what grounds he asked the house <br />
to consent to the very grave proposition which <br />
was contained in the resolution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> it. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That hon.</span> gentleman should have
shown how <br />
the railways were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to be constructed</span>
without <br />
crippling the resources of the country.&nbsp;  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He felt</span> <br />
exceedingly disappointed that the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-</span><br />
man had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not </span>adopted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the course which he</span> <br />
should have taken as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a Colonial</span>
minister, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> the house <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to </span>incur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such heavy liabilities.—</span> <br />
Now there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was no</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one in</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house who</span> had <br />
been a greater advocate of railways than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him-</span>
<br />
self—or was more committed to their extension <br />
