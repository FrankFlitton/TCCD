<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE RECIPROCITY TREATY.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Under the treaty, whilst the trade of
British<br />
North America has been increased and impro-<br />
ved, it has been infinitely much more benefi-<br />
cial to the commerce of the United States.-<br />
Under the fostering influence of that treaty, the<br />
trade between British America and the States<br />
suddenly sprung in four years from fifteen to<br />
sixty million dollars. Whilst it has been in <br />
the highest degree useful and advantageous to<br />
the commerce and advancement of these Bri-<br />
tish North American Provinces, yet the ba-<br />
lance of trade has been largely in favour of the<br />
States. And who is there that does not know<br />
the great importance that keen and sadacious<br />
people attach to anything that will extend<br />
their commerce and improve their trade? But<br />
despite all that - although the Boards of Trade <br />
at New York, Detroit, and elsewhere, have <br />
made the most energetic appeals against the<br />
abolition of the treaty, the Board of Trade at <br />
Detroit actually demonstrating to their govern-<br />
ment that since the commencement of the <br />
treaty the balance of trade has been $162,000,000<br />
in their favour - notwithstanding all that, under<br />
the influence of that spirit which I deeply re-<br />
gret to see exhibitd, notice for the abolition of<br />
the treaty has been given. Not only so be it<br />
is conclusively shown that it is not the inten-<br />
tion of the American Government to enter into<br />
any negociations for the continuance of the <br />
treaty. A few days ago I laid on the table of <br />
this house a remarkable document. The treaty<br />
provides that there shall be a joint commis-<br />
sion under it - yet while the treaty must remain<br />
in forde for another year, Mr. Stewart has de-<br />
manded that the commission be immediately<br />
closed. It is impossible, in the view of<br />
such facts, to shut our eyes to the reality that<br />
while that great Republic has assumed such<br />
gigantic proportione and at the same time has<br />
taken such an attitude in reference to these<br />
Provinces, we have a right to come to the con-<br />
clusion that their determination is to close all<br />
communication, instead of fostering those<br />
peaceful and commercial relations with us, <br />
which in the past have been so remarkably be-<br />
neficial.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE DUTY THAT LIES BEFORE US.</p>













<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It has been said that it is impossible for
us<br />
to put ourselves in an attitude that will
im-<br />
prove oour position in this respect. I am
not<br />
wrong in assuming that the desire of every<br />
British American is to remain in connection<br />
with the people of Great Britain. If there
is any<br />
sentiment that was ever strong in the
breast of<br />
our people, it is a disinclination to be<br />
separated in any way whatever from the Bri-<br />
tish empire, or to be connected in any
manner<br />
with the United States of America. But what<br />
is out present position? Isolated and
separat-<br />
ed as we are now, I ask the house whether
all<br />
the protection we have is not that which

ficance is such as to prevent the foot being<br />
placed upon it? Does it comport with the po-<br />
sition and dignity of freemen, that we should<br />
have our only guarantee of security and pro<br />
-tection in our insignificance? I feel in our<br />
present isolated position, standing in the pre-<br />
sence of a power so gigantic and unfriendsly<br />
that we must take speedy and prompt mean-<br />
sures for security. I may be told that four mil-<br />
lions of people would still stand in the presence<br />
of thirty millions, and that we would be un-<br />
able to make any resistance that would ensure<br />
our safety; but I would ask the house to <br />
consider the fact that we have every reason to<br />
know - for no one can doubt the declaration of<br />
the ministry of England - that the resolve on<br />
the part of Great Britain is to stand in all her<br />
integrity by British America. provided these<br />
provinces assume such asn attitude as would<br />
make the power of the parent state to be put <br />
forth with a reasonable prospect of success. <br />
Although our numbers may be comparatively<br />
small still while we have the good fortune to<br />
be a part of the British empire, and know that <br />
all that is necessary is for us. bu union <br />
and consolidation, to take such a position <br />
as would give England the guarantee that<br />
we are prepared to do our duty, and her <br />
power would not be put forth in vain,<br />
we need not fear the future. Every man who<br />
wishes to keep the liberties and rights he now<br />
possesses as subject to the Crown of England<br />
- who values the institutions he now enjoys,<br />
must see the necessity of our taking such a <br />
course as would guarantee us security in the<br />
case of conflict with any power in the world,<br />
and what would be even better, the avoidance<br />
of conflict which out attitude would accom-<br />
plish.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">SHALL OUR BURDENS BE GREATER?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I may be told, that great as are the advan-<br />
tages of Union, they will be purchased at too<br />
great a cost - that there will be an increase in<br />
the tariff - that the burdens that will be thrown<br />
upon the people will be greater that otherwise<br />
they would have been. I do not intend to <br />
weary the house with any elaborate state-<br />
ments on this point, except to say that I believe<br />
we have every reason to suppose, from the po-<br />
sition we occupy in connection with the parent<br />
state - from the expansion that would accede<br />
to the trade and commerce of the country-<br />
from the development that would be given to<br />
manufactures, and the extension of our public<br />
works - that our burdens would not be<br />
greater than if we remain in our present posi-<br />
tion. Are we not desirous at the present mo-<br />
ment to extend our public works and may we<br />
not fairly assume that if we were to remain<br />
out of Union that the burdens we have to<br />
bear would be increased. The time has passed<br />
when these Provinces would not have to con-<br />
tribute largely to the defences of the country.<br />
Either the fishing grounds, so valbuable to us, <br />
must be given up without a struggle to the <br />
parties who have been accustomed in the <br />
neighboring States to use them for years, or the<br />
cost of defending them must be largely thrown<br />
these Provinces.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Therefore I would ask whether in relation to<br />
the protection of our fisheries which will di-<br />
rectly have to engage our attention, it is not<br />
desirable to have these Provinces united and <br />
consolidated. I may be asked whether Union<br />
