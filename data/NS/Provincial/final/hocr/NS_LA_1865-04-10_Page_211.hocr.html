<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lieutenant
Governor,</span> although in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposition</span>
<br />
at that time, to go in conjunction with Mr. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Young to attend the meeting of the
delegates, for<br />
the purpose of considering the question. He<br />
found, however, that he was required to give</span><br />
his assent to what had been done already. - <br />
Therefore, in the arrangement of a treaty so<br />
intimately affecting our interests, the views of <br />
not a single public man in Nova Scotia were<br />
considered worthy of attention, and I presume<br />
it was the same with New Brunswick.<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Where was New Brunswick when a large<br />
slice was cut off from her territory - when the <br />
whole of British North America was disfigured<br />
by the Ashburton Treaty? The opinion of a <br />
single statesman in New Brunswick was not <br />
asked.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The fact is, if we are known at all across
the<br />
Atlantic, notwithstanding the immense resour-<br />
ces of these Maritime Provinces, it is because<br />
we happen to be contiguous to Canada. Every-<br />
thing connected with out interests tell us of<br />
the insignificance of our position. Therefore it<br />
is not a matter of surprise, in view of <br />
these facts, and of the position we occupy,<br />
that the intelligent men of these Provinces<br />
have long since come to the conclusin that, if<br />
these comparatively small countries are to<br />
have any future whatever in connection with<br />
the crown of England, it must be found in a <br />
consolidation of all British North America. I <br />
regret that this harmony doea not exist down <br />
to the present moment, but I am dealing with<br />
the position the question occupied at the time<br />
these negotiations were going on.<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">OUR TRADE
WILL BE INCREASED BY UNION.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Who does not know that if these Provinces <br />
are ever to occupy a position that will increase<br />
the wealth of the country, it must be through<br />
the expansion of our trade?<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">What trade, worthy of the name, can a coun-<br />
try, so limited in extent and sparsely settled,<br />
as our own ever have? When we look across<br />
the border and see the great imperus that was<br />
given to the trade of the United States when<br />
they ceased to become separate provinces and <br />
swept away the hostile tariffs that previously<br />
confined them, who can doubt that if we adopt-<br />
ed a simialr policy (but retaining at the same <br />
time our connection with the parent state) and<br />
became one country, the same great results<br />
would accrue. Then, indeed, might we expect<br />
to advance the material prosperity and posi-<br />
tion of all British North America! The only<br />
means by which we can expect an expansion<br />
of trade is by striking down these hostile ta-<br />
riffs, and having a common commerce for these<br />
provinces. Again you have the difficulties of<br />
trade increased in consequence of each pro-<br />
vince having a currency of its own. If there <br />
is anything that would increase the commerce<br />
and improve the credit of all British North<br />
America, it would be such a union as would<br />
bring about such a consolidation of the inte-<br />
rests of the country as would lead the world to<br />
suppose that our institutions were based upon a <br />
stable and firm foundation.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">OUR CREDIT WILL BE IMPROVED,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">There is nothing that lowers the credit of
a <br />
country more than the insecurity that attends<br />
such isolation as these provinces exhibit at the <br />
present moment. Who is there that will invest<br />
money in a country where he believes, owing<br />
to its weakness and isolation, its political con-<br />
dition may become changed in an hour, and</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that all the security that he would have for in-<br />
vestment might at any moment become an-<br />
tirely worthless. This is not a mere question<br />
of theory - we have evidence to guide us. There<br />
is the established fact that the moment it was <br />
made known on the other side of the Atlantic<br />
that the interests of British North America<br />
were to be consolidated, and a firm nationality <br />
created, the credit of the country immediately<br />
improved. We have now all the dis-advan-<br />
tages of connection with Canada. Who does<br />
not know that you cannot have a vote<br />
against a Militia measure, or a raid across<br />
the border of that country, but it acts upon<br />
Nova Scotia, and our funds are affected<br />
at once in the market of the world. Yet we<br />
may not exercise the slightest influence over<br />
that vote, or any other matter which acts so<br />
immediately against out own interests. Is it<br />
not desirable, then, that these Maritime Pro-<br />
vinces should be in a position to exercise some<br />
control over acts which so largely affect us,<br />
and in reference to which we are not power-<br />
less?<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">OUR GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION.<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Who is there that looks at the geographical <br />
position of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick <br />
that does not feel that for us especially Inter-<br />
colonial Union is a question of the most vital<br />
importance! Who is there that looks at this <br />
Province, extending into the broad Atantic <br />
some 500 miles nearer to the parent state than<br />
any other part of British North America, but <br />
must see that it is quite impossible we can<br />
ever obtain that position Nature intended we<br />
should occupy, except though a Union of <br />
British North America, that will make Nova<br />
Scotia the great highway between two Conti-<br />
nents. Who is there that looks at the magnifi-<br />
cent harbors with which the Provinces is honey-<br />
combed, but must feel that they were not in-<br />
tended for a commerce we can now supply, but <br />
for the trade of a mighty nationality, of which<br />
Nova Scotia should be to a large extent the <br />
entrepot. Therefore, it is not strange that the<br />
public men of B. N. A., in view of facts bear-<br />
ing upon the trade of the country - of the effect<br />
that would be produced upon us in virtue of<br />
our geographical position - should have com-<br />
bined to bring about a union which must de-<br />
velope the common interests of the country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">OUR GEOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Look again at the geological position of this <br />
xrovince, and you find that if Nature has in-<br />
tended anything in the construction of this<br />
country, it has been that we chould become a<br />
great manufacturing people. You find here<br />
every mineral and resource in the bowels of<br />
this earth that is necessary to place us in that<br />
position. You see us, therefore, occupying the <br />
same situation that Great Britain occupies on<br />
the Continent of Europe. Therefore, looking<br />
at our geological position, no public man would<br />
fail to see that under proper arrangements this<br />
Province might become a great hive of indus-<br />
try - the great manufactory for all British<br />
North America, if not for a much larger coun-<br />
try. It is facts like these that brought the<br />
public men of Nova Scotia to the conclusion<br />
that they would be wanting in the duty to <br />
their country if they did not advance by every<br />
means in their power so desirable a project.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Then there is the question of the Intercolo-<br />
nial Railway. If this legislature has ever<br />
shown a great desire to accomplish any public<br />
