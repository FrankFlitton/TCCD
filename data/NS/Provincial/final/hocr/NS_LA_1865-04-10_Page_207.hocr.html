be united, and I believe that I will be able to <br />
show this House that whilst a Legislative Union <br />
was really not practically before us—for there <br />
were difﬁculties lying in its path such as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ren-</span> <br />
der its adoption impossible—yet the Union <br />
which was devised by the Quebec Conference, <br />
possessed all the advantages of both without <br />
the disadvantages that attended each separately. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> No person, who to acquainted with the
character <br />
of Legislative Union, but knows, when it is <br />
proposed for a country with the area and extent <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory</span> that British
America possesses, its<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">realization</span> is attended with
great dlﬁiculties if <br />
not with insuperable obstacles. No person, who <br />
is acquainted with what has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span>
place in the <br />
Imperial Parliament, but knows that great as <br />
that country has become under a Legislative <br />
Union, yet the difﬁculties connected with the <br />
Union are such as at this moment to be occupy- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ing the attention of the foremost
statesmen of <br />
Great Britam. The difﬁculties in the way of <br />
a Legislative Union are that the Legislature <br />
has not only to be occupied with the discussi n <br />
of the great and leading questions which touch <br />
the vital interests of every section ol the coun. <br />
try, but to give its attention largely to matters <br />
of merely local concern. At present, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Par-</span>
<br />
liament is obliged to take up and consider <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> <br />
ﬁve to six <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hundred local</span> bills.
When we consider <br />
that this body of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">600</span> men, — the
most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂu—</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ential</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span> assemblage of statesmen <br />
in the world, are called upon to give their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at-</span> <br />
tention upon some ﬁve hundred bil s, which <br />
are not of general but of purely local concern, <br />
you can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine</span> the diﬂiculty of
carrying on <br />
the legislation of such a country. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strange</span> that under such
circumstances the Par- <br />
liament is obliged to sit eight out of twelve <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">months</span> in order to accomplish the
legislation re- <br />
quired at their hands. If a Legislative Union<br />
were devised for British North America the<br />
people occupying the different sections would<br />
not have the guarantee that they have under the <br />
scheme devised, that matters of a local character<br />
would occupy the attention of the local legisla-<br />
</p><hr />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> tures, whilst those of a general nature
would be&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">entrusted to the General Legislature. There-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">fore the scheme that was devised gave the cen-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">tralization and consolidation and unity that it <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">was absolutely indispensable should be given.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">On the other hand, instead of having copied the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">defects of the federal constitution - instead of</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> having the inherent weakness that must always</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">attend a system where the local legislatures</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">only impart certain powers to the government</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">of the country - quite a different course was <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">pursued, and it was decided to define the ques-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">tions that should be reserved for the local legis-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">latures, and those great subjects that should be</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">entrusted to the general parliament. Therefore, <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">whilst the unity and consolidation connected</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">with Legislative Union was obtained on the one</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">hand, due care and attention to the local matters</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">interesting to each Province were provided for</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">by the preservation of local parliaments, and <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">these powers were so arranged as to prevent any</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">conflict or struggle which might lead to any dif-</p>

than ever before existed. I need not tell the<br />
house that these results have been submitted to<br />
the attention of the Imperial Government, and <br />
the statesmen of England have looked upon<br />
them not as likely to separate these dependen-<br />
cies, but as the best means of uniting them more<br />
indisolubly to the crown. I need not state that<br />
the same bond which exists between Cana-<br />
da and England - between Nova Scotia, New<br />
Brunswick and England, was conceived, and <br />
that when the scheme contemplated that the<br />
Queen should place a Viceroy or Governor-<br />
General over these dependencies thus united,<br />
the surest guarantee w s given that the great<br />
object was to preserve the bonds that connect <br />
us with the parent state. And that view has <br />
been accepted not only by the government but<br />
by the people and press of England, and by<br />
statesmen in every quarter of the globe.<br />
