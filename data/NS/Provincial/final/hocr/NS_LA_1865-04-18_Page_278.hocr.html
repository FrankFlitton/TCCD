               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$692,818.</span>&nbsp; So that the increase in the past nine

               <br />
               we should have had an addition to the

               contributed one third of our entire revenue

               in the last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quarter</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.—This</span> is

               pretty much the fact every year, and there-

               fore assuming that the trade of the whole

               <br />
               should have less by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$109,000</span> than if our prospe-

               This is a very serious statement of matters, 
               <br />
               and well claims our attention.&nbsp; I have asked

               the revenue could be maintained; and if it fell, 
               <br />
               in what condition would we be found?&nbsp; Sup—

               pose we were to enter on this year as we did

               the year which followed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854,</span> would we be far 
               <br />
               astray?&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854</span> was a year of plethoric revenue; 
               <br />
               but it was followed by several successive 
               <br />
               years of declining trade and falling income. 
               <br />
               It would not be unreasonable to expect that 
               <br />
               the receipts from customs and excise in 1865 
               <br />
               would not much exceed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$800,000.</span>&nbsp; The revenue 
               <br />
               after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854</span> did not for many years reach the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures of that year.&nbsp; Whether we collected 
               <br />
               more than that in the ensuing year or not, he 
               <br />
               was quite sure that we would not be justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in making our calculations on a larger scale 
               <br />
               for several years to come; and if that was 
               <br />
               true, we should be unable to meet the appro— 
               <br />

               they were, made no provisions for our new lia- 
               <br />
               bilities.&nbsp; Now, let us see what these are: First, 
               <br />
               there is the Pictou railway.&nbsp; This was estimated 
               <br />
               at ﬁrst to cost us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,600,000.</span>&nbsp; It was supposed 
               <br />
               to be forty miles, at £10,000.&nbsp; The government 
               <br />
               pass the bill before the road is created.&nbsp; It is 
               <br />
               then measured; and forthwith ten miles or one- 
               <br />
               fourth of the whole is added to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">length</span> and 
               <br />
               cost.&nbsp; Then Mr. Fleming surveys the ground 
               <br />
               more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accurately,</span> and ﬁnds it will cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2 1/2</span> mil- 
               <br />
               lion of dollars to build it, and somewhat more 
               <br />
               to build and equip it.&nbsp; He is told, however, 
               <br />
               that he must reduce his ﬁgures, and he does so, 
               <br />
               and now tells us we may have a road for two 
               <br />
               millions.&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anybody,</span> however, who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knew how</span> 
               <br />
               immensely expenditures exceed estimates, 
               <br />
               must be satisﬁed that if we get off for two and 
               <br />
               a half <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million</span> of dollars we should be fortunate 
               <br />
               indeed.&nbsp; Now, as the contracts are to be com- 
               <br />
               pleted in 1866, we are fully assured that one<br />
half the work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> be done, and one half the 
               <br />
               cost incurred in 1865.&nbsp; If so, we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">need to</span> 
               <br />
               sell debentures to supply what means we 
               <br />
               require. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Already</span> we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have had</span> them in the 
               <br />
               market for several months, and we have sold 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£21,800 stg.</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$109,000.</span>&nbsp; Suppose we have to 
               <br />
               make up the amount we shall require for the 
               <br />
               year 1865, we shall need still to sell over 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000</span> in debentures <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> 
               <br />
               year.&nbsp; How is this to be done? Our debentures 
               <br />
               are now selling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 92 to 95 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>&nbsp; At par 
               <br />
               they are worth, with the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> interest to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">date,</span> £101 
               <br />
               10s.&nbsp; So that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on every</span> debenture we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sell, we</span> 
               <br />
               lose from £9 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10s,</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£6 10s.</span>&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Take</span> the medium 
               <br />
               and there is a loss of 8 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent., which, on</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000</span> alone, would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a loss</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80,000,</span> 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> add <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> sum <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cost of</span> the
