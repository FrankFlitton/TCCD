<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> solidation, in British America, I am
convinced<br />
that the effects produced will not be less
ele-<br />
vating in our case than in that of the
neigh-<br />
boring Republic.</p>



















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I will now refer shortly to some remarks
up-<br />
on the disadvantages which we are told will<br />
result from the project. First—it is said
that<br />
our union means separation from England. I<br />
think I have already disposed of this, for
I<br />
need only repeat that te whole public mind<br />
in the mother country is in favor of the
plan,<br />
for the very reason that it will draw
parent<br />
and children closer together, to be united
by<br />
one common tie. The main objection,
however,<br />
which has been brought forward, is one of
a <br />
financial character. It is said we have
made a <br />
bad bargain—in the language of the hon.
mem-<br />
ber for Richmond (Mr. LeVesconte) the Pro-<br />
vincial Secretary has sold his country to
Ca-<br />
nada! Well, my answer is, the sale is not
yet<br />
perfected for it has still to be ratified.
But is<br />
it so bad a bargain? The objections are
two-<br />
fold—political and financial.<br />
</p>




























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">They say we have not a fair represenation<br />
in the United Parliament. I ask, what has<br />
been conceded to us in the Legislative
Coun-<br />
cil? We shall have in that body, which I am<br />
happy to see is to be purely of a
monarchical<br />
character, and whose function will be high<br />
and important, greater weight than we were<br />
really entitled to. But it is said that
the real<br />
power of the Parliament will be in the
House<br />
of Assembly, and that there we will not be
ade-<br />
quately represented. We shall be
represented<br />
upon the true principle, that is,
according to <br />
our population, and I cannot see how such
an<br />
arrangement can be objected to, or what
could<br />
be considered more equitable. But the hon.<br />
member for North Colchestor would introduce<br />
a curious idea in connection with this. He<br />
would increade the representation in
propor-<br />
tion to the distance from the capital. I
think<br />
my hon. friend from the county of Cape
Breton<br />
would gladly accede to this, as it would
largely<br />
increase the influence of his favourite
island.—<br />
This idea was illustrated by a reference
to the<br />
distribution of the members of Parliament
in<br />
England, but the hon. member should have<br />
gone further; he should have told us what
re-<br />
presentation Scotland actually has, and
what <br />
she would be entitled to on his principle.
He<br />
would find his argument utterly fail him.<br />
</p>















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">As regards the financial aspect of the bar-<br />
gain, the matter has been so fully discussed<br />
that I do not intend to enter into it further<br />
than to say that we have had nu-<br />
merous statements and calculations dur-<br />
ing the last few weeks, scarcely one of<br />
which agrees with another. The truth is,<br />
statements of figures are too often very delu-<br />
sive, and unless the premises are
scrutinized<br />
and found correct the conclusions are
worth-<br />
less. All that may be said is that though
we<br />
shall be required to give up the larger
part of<br />
our general revenues we receive a yearly
sub-<br />
vention sufficient with out local revenue
to<br />
provide for our local wants. As regards
the <br />
question of increase of tariff we have had
the<br />
same wide difference in computation. The<br />
hon. member for South Colchester puts it at<br />
such an insignificant figure as to make it
a<br />
subject of astonishment that any person
should<br />
dread its imposition. But even if we were
to<br />
take the increase at the largest sum
mentioned,<br />
that of a dollar per head, would not the
great<br />
benefits to be derived warrant us in
increasing</p>

<hr />


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">our
burdens even to that extent? But I am<br />
not afraid that there will be so great an in-<br />
crease, and am quite confident that increased<br />
prosperity will enable us to meet without diffi-<br />
culty whatever additional taxation may be<br />
required. To the city of Halifax union will be<br />
of inestimable advantage. Let any of our ci-<br />
tizens visit the busy wharves of Boston, or sail<br />
into the port of New York by the East River<br />
and see the long lines of shipping extending<br />
for miles on either hand as he approaches
the<br />
Hudson, and then return to Halifax, and how<br />
great is the contrast! Now, if we have union<br />
and the intercolonial railway my expectation<br />
is that so great a contrast will soon be lessened.<br />
We need not expect to attain to the eminence<br />
of their commercial emporium, but we may<br />
hope that the traveller visting us hereafter<br />
will find a harbor filled with shipping and busy<br />
with trade, and a city whose streets will be<br />
thronged with an active and prosperous popu-<br />
lation.</p>



<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I am afraid I have been trespassing upon
the <br />
patience of the house longer than I had in-<br />
tended, but I cannot conclude without making<br />
a few remarks upon the offensive display made<br />
by the hon. member for Richmond (Mr. Miller)<br />
the other evening in reference to myself. Now<br />
among the great advantages of the contem-<br />
plated Union, I consider not the least to be, <br />
that the tone of public men and public senti-<br />
ment will be far higher in consequence, and <br />
that the debates of the General Parliament<br />
will not be disgraced by such a wretched
exhi-<br />
bition of personalities as we were treated with<br />
on the occasion I refer to. That hon. gentle-<br />
man took occasion to pass upon my pub-<br />
lic conduct in reference to the Union, and to<br />
assert that I had acted the mean part of con-<br />
cealing my sentiments until I had ascertained<br />
the feeling of the majority of my constituents.<br />
Now, in answer to this unfounded statement, I<br />
have merely to appeal to the hon. member for<br />
East Halifax (Mr. Annand), who is present,<br />
and who knows that hardly had the Delegates <br />
returned before I had publicly exhibited my<br />
feelings on the subject, and that he good-na<br />
turedly challenged me with doing so in the<br />
public streets. My sentiments were never con-<br />
cealed from my constituents. As to the very<br />
gentlemanly charge of skulking beneath the<br />
galleries when I ought to have been on the <br />
platform, my answer is, that it is simply with-<br />
out foundation. I was present on the platform<br />
at the first meeting in Temperance Hall, but<br />
from all the others I was absent owing to the<br />
inclemency of the weather and the delicate<br />
state of my health. I hardly know that it was<br />
even necessary to refer to these things, but I <br />
have done so because I felt it due to this house<br />
to give this public contradiction to the state-<br />
ments made. I know that my constituents do <br />
not require it.<br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
As regards the other personalities which have<br />
fallen from the hon. gentleman, I can treat them<br />
as idle wind, and do not feel it necessary to<br />
take any notice of them. The position of every<br />
gentleman who enters this House is soon as-<br />
signed him by his brother members, who guage<br />
and test his qualifications before he has been<br />
with them many weeks. With whatever posi-<br />
tion they may assign me I am quite content, <br />
and sure I am I shall never eny that of one<br />
whose recent display has neither added credit<br />
nor dignity to this assembly. </p>
