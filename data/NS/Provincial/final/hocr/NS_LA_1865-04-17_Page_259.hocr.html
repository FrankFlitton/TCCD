<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">of the north-west, were the conditions in
con-<br />
nection with the construction of the
intercolo-<br />
nial railway. Mr. Brown in his speech gives<br />
the Canadians the strongest possible
assurance<br />
of this, he says:</p>










<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"But this question of immigration
naturally brings<br />
me to the subject of the great
Northwestern terri-<br />
tories. [Hear, hear.] The resolutions
before us recog-<br />
nize the immediate necessity of those vast
territories<br />
being brought within the Confederation and
opened<br />
up for settlement. But I am told that
while the Inter-<br />
colonial Railroad has been made an
absolute condi-<br />
tion of the compact, the opening up of the
Great West<br />
and enlargement of our canals have been
left in doubt.<br />
Now, sir, nothing can be more unjust than
this. Let<br />
me read the resolutions:—</p>



<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"The General Government shall secure,
without de-<br />
lay, the completion of the Intercolonial
Railway from<br />
Riviere du Loup, through New Brunswick, to
Truro<br />
in Nova Scotia.</p>






<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"The Communications with the North-western
Ter-<br />
ritory, and the improvements required for
the deve-<br />
lopment of the reade of the Great West
with the sea-<br />
board, are regarded by this Conference as
subjects of<br />
the highest importance to the Federal
Provinces, and<br />
shall be prosecuted at the earliest
possible period that<br />
the state of the finances will permit."</p>





































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Confederation is, therefore, clearly
committed<br />
to the carrying out of both these
enterprises. . . . .<br />
But honourable gentlemen lay stress upon
the point<br />
that, while the one enterprise is to be
undertaken at<br />
once, the other is not to be commenced
until the state<br />
of the finance will permit. No doubt this
is correct,<br />
and the reason for it is simply this—the
money has<br />
already been found for the Intercolonial
Railway.<br />
They must be well aware that the late
Government<br />
(the Macdonald-Sitcotte Administration)
agreed to <br />
build the Intercolonial Railway, and
obtained from<br />
the Imperial Government a guarantee of the
deben-<br />
tures for building it—so that money is
ready at a very<br />
low rate of interest, whenever required.
We know<br />
where to find money for one enterprise at
a rate we<br />
are able to bear, and can thus go on with
a work which <br />
must be gone on with if this union is to
be consummated.<br />
but we don't know this of the other great
work—and <br />
we all felt that it would be exceedinly
indiscreet—I, <br />
myself, as the special advocate of opening
up the <br />
Great West and of the enlargement of our
canals, felt<br />
that I could not put my name to a document
which<br />
declared that all hazards, while our five
per cent.de-<br />
bentures were quoted at 75 or 80 per cent.
in the money<br />
markets—we would commence at once, without
an <br />
hour's delay, any great public work
whatever. [Hear, <br />
hear.] Honourable gentlemen opposite must
not ima-<br />
gine that they have to do with a set of
tricksters in<br />
the thirty-three gentlemen who composed
that Con-<br />
ference. What we have said in our
resolutions was<br />
deliberately adopted, in the honest sense
of the words<br />
employed, and not for purposes of
deception. Both<br />
works are to go on at the earliest
possible moment our<br />
finances will permit, and honourable
gentlemen will<br />
find the members of the Cabinet from Lower
Canada,<br />
as well as from Upper Canada, actuated by
the same<br />
hearty desire to have this whole scheme
carried out<br />
in its fair meaning.</p>






<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Stress may be laid on the term, "as <br />
soon as the finances will permit"; but we<br />
know the great anxiety on the part of
Canada<br />
to have this expensive work accomplished,<br />
and that as soon as they have the power in<br />
their hands to carry out their wishes they
will <br />
go on with the work.</p>











<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It has been claimed, also, on behalf of
this<br />
shceme, that it would add to the defence of<br />
these colonies. Perhaps there is no one
asser-<br />
tion which the advocates of confederation
have<br />
made that has gained them more supporters<br />
than this. There is something in it that
cap-<br />
tivates every man's mine and carried him<br />
almost away despite himself. It finds a
res-<br />
ponse in every heart that feels the
attachements<br />
of home. And it was wrong, it was cruel, on<br />
the part of the advocates to thus make an
ap-<br />
peal to one of the noblest sentiments that
find<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> a home in the breast of man—that sentiment<br />
which bids us rise to defend the country in<br />
which God has placed us—to protect the<br />
homes we have secured by His blessing, and<br />
guard the altars we have erected to His wor-<br />
ship,—without having such facts as would <br />
sustain the hops excited by the assertions.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">What is the Provincial Secretary's argument?<br />
That Confederation will give us more men and <br />
money to affect this great object. That we shall<br />
have 4000,000, instead of 350,000 people to de-<br />
fend us. He does not, however, say that with an<br />
increase of men comes an increase of duty that<br />
they would have to perform. If it gavve us the<br />
four millions entirely for the defence of this<br />
province then his asserion would be sus-<br />
tained, but when every man that goes into Confeder-<br />
ation brings with him the particular spot which<br />
he feels most anxious to defend, in case of in-<br />
vasion, then Confederation does not give us more<br />
men or money. Besides it places the control of<br />
our defences under a poer that is situated 800<br />
miles away from us. We are told by the hon/<br />
member from South Colohester that the tempta-<br />
tion to invade this Province is greater than to in-<br />
vade any other—its value is consequence of its<br />
position and resources being greater. Admitting<br />
this to be the case, is it not unwise to give the con-<br />
trol of the natural defenses of this country—the<br />
men who are to defend their homes—to a power<br />
situated 800 miles away, and who will feel it more<br />
to their individual interest to call them away to<br />
protect Canada. It has been said that the fate of <br />
Canada is our own. That may be, but I regard the<br />
safety of Nova Scotia as more essential to the<br />
maintenance of our connection with the British<br />
Empire than is that of any other of the British <br />
Colonies. I answer, Nova Scotia is the keystone <br />
to the whole—when she falls, the whole follow.—<br />
Great changes have taken place of late years in<br />
the character of the navies of the world. Steam<br />
has taken the place of wind as the potive power<br />
rendering the ships more effective but more de-<br />
pendent upon their base of supply. We have<br />
here the power—the coal—which must be re-<br />
gularly supplied to the British fleet from our<br />
mines, in case of hostilities on this side ht eAt-<br />
lantic. And if this base of supply should fall into <br />
the hands of an enemy, then the whole nave of<br />
England would be powerless for the protection of<br />
these Colonies, and must leave them to their fate.<br />
How essential, then, is it that local influences in<br />
Canada shall not have the power to call away our<br />
natural protectors to defend less important terri-<br />
tory.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Prov. Sec. says we are as unprotected and<br />
helpless as the crawling worm.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I was amazed beyond measure, to hear such an<br />
expression fall from an hon. gentleman occupying<br />
a position which gives to his declarations an of-<br />
ficial character. Had I occupied his position,<br />
rather than have stood at the table of this House,<br />
declaring that <span style="font-style: italic;">a portion of the British Em-<br />
pire</span> "are as unprotected as the crawling worm"<br />
I'd have crawled down under the table.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">A crawling worm are we? Well, what does he<br />
make of us under Confederation? I waited in<br />
anxiety expecting to see the "worm" swell and<br />
