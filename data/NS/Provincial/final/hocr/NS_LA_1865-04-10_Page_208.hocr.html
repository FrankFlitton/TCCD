Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cardwell sitting in </span>the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonial</span> office. I would <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether </span>under this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme,</span> when it has<br />
been plainly stated by the British government<br />
that it would become necessary that they should<br />
supply from the ablest British statement a Go-<br />
vernor or Viceroy, whether the Crown and the <br />
people would not have the same guarantee for<br />
that influence and control over the appointment<br />
of local governors that is exercised now. The<br />
difference would be this: Instead of a Colonial<br />
Secretary appointing the Lieutenant Governor<br />
the Queen's representative sitting at the head<br />
of the government of United British America,<br />
himself asresponsible as a minister of the Crown,<br />
would be called upon to discharge that duty,<br />
and, at the same time, harmony would be   b<br />
tained between the local and general govern-<br />
ment, and the influence of the crown would be<br />
as effective as it exists at the present moment.<br />
The people of British North America would be<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in a position to exercise an amount of
influence <br />
in the selection of the local governors which<br />
the , of course, cannot do under existing cir-<br />
cumstances.<br />

It was proposed, as I stated before, that all<br />
the questions of loading general importance<br />
should be entrusted to the general government.<br />
There are some thirty-seven in number, but I<br />
will only at present draw the attention of the <br />
house to some of the more important points:</span></span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span>
is another question that has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupied</span> <br />
a great deal of attention, and that is the subsdy.<br />
It has been stated that the subsidy was insuffi-<br />
cient, and that a great mistake was made by the<br />
delegates who placed the amount at 80 cents<br />
a head, and based it on the census of 1861, in-<br />
stead of making it a larger sum in the first <br />
instance, and allowing it to increase according<br />
as the population increased&nbsp; If the delegates<br />
from the m ritime provinces did not secure suffi-<br />
ciently good terms, I may say frankly, if we <br />
came back not having obtained that fair consi-<br />
deration and justice to the provinces which we<br />
had a right to demand at the hands of the <br />
conference, the fault was our own. The <br />
business of that conference was carried on<br />
by vote by provinces and the maritime<br />
colonies, instead of standing in a position<br />
to allow Canada to dictate her own terms, <br />
and being compelled to accept them, they<br />
help a position which gave them a great advan-<br />
tage. The vote upon every question, as I have<br />
said, was taken by provinces. Every member<br />
of that Conference had it in his power to advo-<br />
cate him individual opinions to the best of his<br />
ability; but when it came to a vote, the majo-<br />
rity of the delegates from each province decided<br />
what its vote should be; and therefore, when it<br />
is seen that Canada had only two votes, and <br />
that the Maritime Provinces had four, it is evi-<br />
dent that if the latter - whose interests were<br />
identical - did not receive a fair amount of con-<br />
sideration it was not because they did not <br />
stand in a position to obtain it. I have no hesi-<br />
tation, however, in going further and saying, if<br />
there is any fault to be found with the subsidy<br />
to carry on the local governments - the amount<br />
necessary to supplement the local funds that<br />
