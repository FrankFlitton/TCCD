<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Was this a time, he would ask, to force
an <br />
obnoxious measure upon the people of this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country—a</span> time, if we could
believe the opin- <br />
ions of gentlemen opposite—when danger is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">threatened—and</span> it was therefore
of more than <br />
ordinary importance that the affection and con- <br />
ﬁdence of the people should be reposed in the <br />
Government of the day. Let us then encour- <br />
age these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings—let</span> us have
willing hearts <br />
as well as hands to defend us, and although <br />
our numbers may be few—and the danger <br />

sufﬁcient <br />
courage, energy and spirit in the people of this <br />
country to sustain them in the hour of need. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BLANCHARD did not intend to have ad- <br />
dressed the House, but the question having <br />
assumed such proportions, he felt it his duty to <br />
offer a few observations. This question of as- <br />
sessment for the support of schools was by no <br />
means a new one. Upon looking back to the <br />
Journals of 1856, he found that the subject was <br />
debated in the House and the following resolu- <br />
tions were then moved :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ Whereas the principle of assessment is
the <br />
only permanent foundation for the common <br />
school education of the country, and as this <br />
principle is the leading feature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
the measure <br />
now under consideration and the details may <br />
be modiﬁed and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improved,—</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ Resolved, therefore, that the bill
entitled <br />
an act for the better encouragement of educa— <br />
tion be referred to a select committee with in- <br />
structions to consider the same, and report <br />
thereon at a future day. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ For the motion thirty-seven against it
nine.” <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The men whose names he found recorded in <br />
favor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> that resolution he had
been accus- <br />
tomed from his boyhood to look up to with re- <br />
spect and esteem; and when that resolution <br />
was carried it met with his hearty approval. <br />
From his earliest recollections, he had been <br />
educated in the belief that the principle of as- <br />
sessment was the only correct one; and in sup- <br />
porting it now he certainly could not be sus- <br />
pected of being a slave to the Government.<br />
He was sorry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> he was
compelled to differ <br />
from those for whose opinions he had always <br />
entertained the highest respect; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he
felt</span> <br />
that he would be recreant to the duty he owed <br />
to the country, and to the opinions he always <br />
entertained, if he voted for the resolution of <br />
the hon. member for Shelburne. He was not <br />
disposed now to enter into an argument to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prove</span> that assessment was the
true principle. <br />
This had been proved so often that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
un- <br />
necessary. When this principle was intro- <br />
duced into the bill of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last year,</span>
he told the hon. <br />
Prov. Sec. that if it was founded upon the pro- <br />
per basis, he would give his assistance in car- <br />
rying it out. He thought that the time had <br />
come when the principle should be fairly tried, <br />
and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now</span> felt that if he voted
for the reso- <br />
lution before the house, he would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be
taking</span> a <br />
step in a backward direction. At the same <br />
time, he must not be understood as giving his <br />
entire approval to the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bill,—there</span>
were <br />
many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objectionable</span> features in
it, which he <br />
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done his best</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> remove. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">For</span> instance, <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction—of</span> the Council <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of Public In-</span> <br />
struction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> particularly
obnoxious to him ; <br />
but this feature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he could</span> not
object <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He did</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not support it</span> with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> view of assisting the Go- <br />
vernment, but because he felt it was the only <br />
sound basis upon which the common school <br />
system of the country should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rest.</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. BLACKWOOD</span>
said that there were many&nbsp;</p>


<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">clauses of this bill exceedingly
objectionable to <br />
him, and none more so than the mode in which <br />
the Council of Public Instruction was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitu—</span>
<br />
ted. He should have been very glad if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that
had</span> <br />
been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-considered,</span> or at all
events remodelled, <br />
so as to remove some of its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objectionable
fea-</span> <br />
tures. But, as regards the feature of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
bill <br />
now under consideration, he felt called upon to <br />
sustain it, for he was convinced that, when pro- <br />
perly carried out, it was the only proper basis <br />
upon which the common school system of the <br />
country should rest. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He was sorry that
he <br />
was obliged to differ with his friend the mem— <br />
ber for Shelburne; but he could not consistent- <br />
ly vote for his motion without acting contrary <br />
to the opinions he had always entertained.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
He <br />
did not support <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> measure with
the view of <br />
assisting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for he</span>
would scorn <br />
to bolster up any Government by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supporting</span>
<br />
them in carrying out what he did not believe <br />
was for the interests of the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span>
He <br />
wished, then, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giving</span> his vote
for the measure, <br />
to put himself right before the house and his <br />
constituents—and to let them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand
that,</span> <br />
in the course he was taking, he was not sus- <br />
taining a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span>
a principle, which <br />
he believed was calculated to benetit the cause <br />
of education. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. JOST had already stated that he was
op- <br />
posed to the principle of compulsory taxation. <br />
He wished the matter to be left in the hands of <br />
the people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BILL said that the house was aware
that <br />
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> presented petitions
signed by many <br />
hundreds of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persons against</span>
assessment for the <br />
support of schools. It was a system <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
look- <br />
ed very well upon paper, but it was not so easy <br />
to carry it out. When he made up his mind to <br />
vote for assessment, he was at the same time <br />
determined to vote for separate schools, for he <br />
did not think it just to have the one without the <br />
other. He regretted very much that he felt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> <br />
his duty to support the resolution. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. KILLAM said that it was evident that
the <br />
system of county assessment proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by
the</span> <br />
bill would not give the amount required for the <br />
support of the schools<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would have</span> to <br />
raise the balance by subscriptions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
the <br />
people. He objected in committee to the prin- <br />
ciple upon which the bill distributes the public <br />
money, and he should vote for the resolution <br />
before the house. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> A call of the house was had.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. C. J. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CAMPBELL</span>
said that it was clearly <br />
understood when this bill was sent to commit- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tee that</span> no one was committed to
the principle. <br />
He was glad it was not<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>
made a <br />
party question, as it left it open to the support- <br />
ers of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> to take an
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">independent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
course. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">H</span>e agreed with the
member for Kings, <br />
that, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">direct taxation,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> must <br />
have seperate schools. He though, if they were <br />
going to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">free</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Schools,</span> the better plan <br />
would be to appropriate<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> the surplus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenne</span> in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Provincial chest for their
support, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and, if</span> <br />
that was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough,</span> he did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think the</span> peo- <br />
ple would object to an increase <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advalo-</span> <br />
rem duties. <br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Ross, in reference to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a </span>statement made <br />
on a previous evening by the Provincial Secre- <br />
tary, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there were</span> 62 schools
