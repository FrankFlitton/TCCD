<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LOCKE called the attention of the Go—
<br />
vernment to a petition which he held in his <br />
hand from the inhabitants of the county of <br />
Shelburne,for a road connection with the Coun- <br />
ty of Annapolis. As the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>
intend- <br />
ed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span> a railroad to
Annapolis, the inha- <br />
bitants of Shelburne naturally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wished</span>
to have <br />
better means of communication with the fine <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> county of Annapolis
than they <br />
now possessed. He believed, if the Union of <br />
the Colonies was consummated, that Shelhurne <br />
might become one of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span>
outlets of trade. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughte</span>r.) All the people asked
was an ex— <br />
penditure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20,000 or $30,000.</span>
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BOURINOT<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggest</span> that the peti- <br />
tion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lay</span> on the table until such
time as the An- <br />
napolis Railway<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> was completed. <br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PROV.</span>
SEC. said that the petition was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deserving</span> of consideration; but
it should he <br />
sent, in accordance with the rules of the House, <br />
to the Financial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Secretary.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. KILLAM though it would be as well to <br />
understand whether a petition rom the people <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> askhw for aid towards some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span> <br />
should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be discussed</span> by the
House, or go first <br />
to the Government. As it was now, if the Go- <br />
vernment did not choose to accede to the <br />
prayer of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petition </span>there was
an end of it.—<br />
nothing was heard about it. He thought it best <br />
that every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petition</span> should come
first before the <br />
House, who might send it to a Committee or to <br />
the Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. PROV. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SEC</span>.
said that he did not see the <br />
use <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of interfering</span> now with an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established</span> rule <br />
of the House. If any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> had not
treated any peti- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion presented</span> to them as it
deserved, it was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always </span>in his power to move for
its production, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> test the opinion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> on the sub- <br />
ject. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LOCKE said he would place the pe— <br />
tition in the hands of the Government, with the<br />
hope that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they would </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> it that favorable <br />
consideration which it deserved. <br />
</p>
<p><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. FIN. SECRETARY</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated that</span> it was his <br />
intention to publish the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petitions</span>
