<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> were in favor of it, and that therefore we<br />
should adopt it—that, if we did not, England<br />
would withdraw her protection from us by de-<br />
grees. But it must be remembered that Mr. <br />
Cardwell's impression was derived from the<br />
same source that prepared this grand scheme<br />
at Quebec. I have no doubt that these<br />
gentlemen impressed upon the Colonial Secre-<br />
tary's mind the moment the local legislatures<br />
met they would adopt the scheme. No doubt<br />
the opinion in England was, that the gentle-<br />
men who acted as delegates at the convention<br />
represented the public opinion of these Mari-<br />
time Provinces; but I repel that idea. They<br />
did not represent public sentiment on this<br />
question at all; the result, not only in New<br />
Brunswick, But in Nova Scotia and the other<br />
Provinces, has proved it. Now I wish to make<br />
a reference to some remarks that fell from the<br />
hon. member for Colchester (Mr. Archibald) at a<br />
meeting in Temperance Hall on his return<br />
from Quebec. Now if there is a gentleman<br />
whom I hold in personal esteem—whom I res-<br />
pect for his great abilities as a legislatir, it is<br />
that hon. member; but I always understood<br />
that these delegates met in good faith—that<br />
they had assembled with the determination to<br />
disclose everything affecting these Provinces<br />
—everything concerning their great resources<br />
and prospects, but they did not do so, and I <br />
shall prove it. The hon. member for Colches-<br />
ter said in his speech:</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Look again at the great mineral
advantages we<br />
possess. With a country filled with coal, our posi-<br />
tion on the continent is such that we must necessari-<br />
ly become the suppliers of the whole Atlantic coast.<br />
If in the period from 1859 to 1864 we have doubled out<br />
coal trade, and the revenue has risen from $20,000 to<br />
$40,000, will it not double itself again in a few years,<br />
and enable us to provide from that fund alone, all<br />
that we require for education, and for the manage-<br />
ment of our roads and bridges, and our other local<br />
concerns? This does not include the revenue from <br />
our gold fields, and that has yielded this year $15,000<br />
above the coast of its collection. See if these advan-<br />
tages do not place us in a position superior to that of<br />
our neighbors. <span style="font-style: italic;">This statement of our
mineral re-<br />
sources is one that I would not like to have made in<br />
Canada ; it is too much like 'letting the cat out of the <br />
bag,'</span> for although we thus obtain no unfair advan-<br />
tage, yet the superiority is one that might have been <br />
looked on with suspicion. Not only does this open<br />
up a view of increasing enterprise and prosperity, but<br />
it shews us one way to the position we so much desire<br />
to fill of becoming the carriers of the world."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">What now do you think of a delegate, that<br />
went to meet other delegates in good faith, and<br />
yet tell you that he <span style="font-style: italic;">suppressed
facts that they <br />
ought to have known?</span> How becoming a posi-<br />
tion was that for a statesman to occupy? I<br />
must now refer to another speech on a recent<br />
occasion. Let me say at the outset that those<br />
who have read the debates of the Houses of<br />
Parliament are aware that there is a strong<br />
feeling in England in reference to these colo-<br />
nies. We have perhaps flattered ourselves<br />
with the idea that when the name of Nova <br />
Scotia was aspersed we had at least one man<br />
in the Commons to stand up for his native<br />
country; and how had that gentleman dischar-<br />
ged his duty? We know that an attempt has<br />
been made in the press to explain away the re-<br />
marks to which I am about to allude; but that<br />
explanation amounts to nothing. Judge Hali-<br />
burton delivered his speech at least more than<br />
a week before the last steamer left, and we<br />
know that whenever a gentleman has been<br />
misrepresented or misunderstood in the Impe-<br />
rial Parliament, it is usual for him to make ex-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> planations which will appear in due
course in<br />
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>
or other public journals. But he did<br />
nothing of the kind. These remarks, asper-<br />
sing the loyalty of Nova Scotia, have gone<br />
abroad without any contradiction from his<br />
own hand. Hear what he says:</p>









<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"The people of Canada were, moreover, per-<br />
fectly loyal. and very much attached to
this<br />
country; indeed, he did not think that in
Ca-<br />
nada a disloyal man of any sect, or creed,
or<br />
color was to be found. New Brunswick and<br />
Nova Scotia, he was sorry to say, did not
de-<br />
serve the same praise in that respect, and
he<br />
hoped the Secretary for the Colonies would<br />
show that he was aware that such was the <br />
case."</p>
























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">These are, indeed, worthy sentiments to
fall<br />
from a former member of this Legislature—<span style="font-style: italic;">from<br />
one who
is a pensioner of this Province. </span>In ano-<br />
ther part of his speech he actually says
that he<br />
had lived for 60 years in Canada—so ashamed<br />
was he of Nova Scotia—and other parts of
the<br />
speech referred to are not more
complimentary.<br />
The Provincial Secretary told you in his<br />
lengthy speech on Confederation, that he
felt<br />
humiliated because Nova Scotia was not men-<br />
tioned at all in the great debate in
connection<br />
with these Provinces. Now, if you read the<br />
debate carefully, you will see that in the
spee-<br />
ches of Mr. Disraeli and other eminent
English<br />
statesmen, the British American Provinces<br />
are frequently mentioned, and the same
kind-<br />
ly feeling is expressed for all. We are
told<br />
that is we refuse to accept Confederation,
En-<br />
gland would withdraw her protection from
us,<br />
but read the debates of the House of
Commones,<br />
and you will see that this assertion is
baseless.<br />
The honor of England, we are told, is
concern-<br />
ed in the defence of these colonies. The
Pre-<br />
mier, Lord Palmerston, tells you:<br />
</p>



<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"This is not a Canadian question, it is
not a<br />
local question : it is an Imperial
question. It is<br />
a question which affects that position and
cha-<br />
racter, the honor, the interests, and the
duties<br />
of this great country."</p>






























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">With or without Confederation we shall ne-<br />
ver be left unprotected by the mother
country,<br />
should the enemy at any time touch our
shores.<br />
A great deal has been said about the
feelings<br />
that exist in the neighboring Republic. I
deny<br />
the truth of the statement that the
Americans<br />
are desirous of pouncing upon these
Provinces,<br />
and are only waiting a favorable
opportunity<br />
of doing so. Their object is simply to
cultivate<br />
a good understanding with these colonies.
Al-<br />
ready Americans are largely identified with<br />
us, and are interested, (more especially in<br />
my county, where they shall always receive
a<br />
cordial welcome,) in preserving peaceful
and<br />
commercial relations with us. Some refer-<br />
ence has also been made in the course of
this<br />
debate to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>. Now I am not one of<br />
those who underrate the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>—it is the great<br />
exponent of public opinion in England—it
is a <br />
journal of immense talent and influence—se-<br />
cond to none in that respect in the world;
but<br />
it will be remembered, that there was
present<br />
at the banquet given to the delegates in
Que-<br />
bec, a Mr. Sala, a gentleman of ability—well<br />
known to the literary world—a friend of a
per-<br />
son who would like to be closely identified<br />
with our railway schemes. Mr. Sala, on that<br />
occasion, did not compliment the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>—he<br />
stated his reasons why that journal had
acquir-<br />
ed such an influence over the people, and
said<br />
that after all its opinions were not of
such<br />
