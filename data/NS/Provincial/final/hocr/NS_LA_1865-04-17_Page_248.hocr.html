principally I think from the member for<br />
Halifax basing his calculations upon<br />

balance in the Receiver General's hands at the<br />
end of the year. Now, Sir, I assume the civil<br />

for the Judges. I should like to ask the Prov.<br />
Secretary whether, by the Constitution, that is<br />
to be borne by the General or Local Govern-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Now, Sir, here are the figures; and I defy
the<br />
hon. Fin Sec. to take the papers and show any</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">thing more favorable to the Province. But,
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">separate and apart altogether from this
finan-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">cial view of the subject, there are other
con-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">siderations which should have some effect
upon</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">our action in this matter. It is well known</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">that our public works are progressing, and
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">the our revenue is increasing year by year;</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">but it must be remembered that under this</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">scheme, no matter how prosperous we might</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">become, no matter how largely our resources</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">might increase, it would not be for the
benefit</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">of Nova Scotia, but the General Government

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">at Ottawa. It is true that we might become
a <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">large manufacturing country, and the great</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">seaport of all the Colonies; yet, still
all the</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">which the Constitution gives us. When I look<br />
at the position of affairs as between Canada<br />
and the United States—when I consider that <br />
the Reciprocity Treaty is about to expire, and <br />
that the Canadians, feeling themselves agriev-<br />
ed, will seek to retaliate upon the United<br />
States, while at the same time they will put<br />
money in their own pockets, I am driven to <br />
the conviction that they will accomplish their<br />
objects at the expense of the Maritime Pro-<br />
vinces—that they will impose a duty upon<br />
flour, which we now import from the United <br />
States—a duty of at least a dollar a barrel,—<br />
and that we will have no other option than to<br />
submit. That will be the time when the effects<br />
of this Union will be brought home to us in a <br />
practical shape, and when it is too late, the <br />
people of this Province will begin to realize<br />
the force of the objections we now raise<br />
against it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I maintain if we go into this union with Ca-<br />
nada, we will be treated, as all small provinces<br />
ever have been treated—whch have been an-<br />
nexed to large countries. Our interests will<br />
be respected just so far as it is to the advantage<br />
of the larger province to do so. I need not as-<br />
sure the house, Mr. Speaker, that I have no in<br />
terest to serve in this matter. I have no other<br />
object than to advance the welfare of the Pro-<br />
vince of Nova Scotia; but I must candidly<br />
say that if this union is effected I believe&nbsp; that <br />
the people of Canada will use the people<br />
of these lower provinces for the purpose of pass-<br />
ing off on them their surplus agricultural pro-<br />
ducts, which we will be compelled to receive<br />
at a higher rate than we can now im-<br />
port them from the United State. We have <br />
been pointed, sir, to Cape Breton as an instance<br />
of the benefit of union, and have been told<br />
that under it she has received more than her<br />
rights. Sire, I deny it; and I have only to refer<br />
to the universal feeling of execration, which&nbsp; <br />
even now, after a lapseof twenty years, exists<br />
over the whole Island for the act which de-<br />
prived them of their rights and privilieges to <br />
prove the truth of my statement. That same<br />
feeling, I believe, before many years will be<br />
widespread throughout Nova Scotia, for the<br />
men who have endeavored to wrench from <br />
them their dearest rights without giving them<br />
a single iota in return.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Sir, I feel deepy on this subect, and, as I <br />
said before, I regret that Nova Scotia's most <br />
gifted sons could not have found a better subject<br />
to coalesce upon then in this attempt to barter<br />
away our rights and liberties. But, sir, it has<br />
been siad that we are too insignificant in our<br />
present position—that we ought to become a <br />
great country. Well, sir, I for one am content<br />
to remain under that great and glorious flag<br />
that waves over us to-day—and poor and in-<br />
significant as we Nova Scotians may be, we<br />
have the consolation of knowing that we have<br />
always been loyal and true to that flag, which <br />
is more than can be said of that great country<br />
to which some gentlemen are so anxious to be<br />
united. It has also been urged that the United <br />
States is prepared to gobble us up, if we remain<br />
dis-united from Canada. Now, sir, I cannot see<br />
in what better position for defence we will be<br />
in by the Union. Will we be able to number a<br />
man more, or to shoulder an additional mus-<br />
ket? I think not. But now, under the ægis<br />
of Old England, we are secure. She has pro-<br />
mised to defend us, so long as we manifest a <br />
disposition to defend ourselves. When we<br />
