<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and that union took place. With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the greatness</span> <br />
and prosperity of the country there grew up an <br />
interest in the South, which ﬁnding its own <br />
centre within itself, and growing antagonistic <br />
to the North, at length culminated in a demand <br />
for a separation. We are all familiar with the <br />
history of events from that time to this—that <br />
the difﬁculty resulted in a war which has been <br />
unparalled in its magnitude and in its severity <br />
—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> war which has furrowed with
the graves of <br />
the slain the face of that country as thickly as <br />
the furrows in a farmer’s ﬁeld. Looking at the in- <br />
ﬂuence which this sentiment has exercised over <br />
men’s minds at all times, I must conclude that <br />
it has also operated largely in the provinces, <br />
and that men have been carried away by that <br />
sentiment, and have sought a union irre- <br />
spective of provincial rights and the conse— <br />
quences that may ﬂow from it. They have for- <br />
gotten the union that already exists between <br />
these provinces—that we are united by the <br />
same loyal sentiments—that we are, as the hon. <br />
member for Richmond says, citizens of the <br />
same Empire—subjects of the same Queen.<br />
The same flag that floats over Buckingham <br />
Palace floats over our Citadel, and
protects the<br />
inhabitants of these provinces as well as
those<br />
of London. Under that protection we enjoy<br />
every blessing and privilege that is known
in <br />
civilized and enlightened society; and I
asked<br />
myself when the Provincial Secretary, the<br />
other night, was speaking of the progress<br />
and prosperoty of this province, and
telling<br />
us how much we had to be grateful for, why<br />
we could not withal cultivate the virtue of<br />
contentment. But they tell us that there
are<br />
circumstances outside of our own borders
that<br />
prevent the continuance of these things.
In <br />
the first place, we have been told that
there is<br />
a disposition on the part of England to
cast us<br />
adrift. It is hardly necessary to spend
much<br />
time on part of the subject, because opi-<br />
nions lately propounded in the British
parlia-<br />
ment show that there is a determination on<br />
the part of Great Britain to preserve her
colo-<br />
nies so long as they remain loyal to the
crown<br />
of England. We naturally expected this de-<br />
claration. We have seen that the expansion<br />
and maintenance of colonies has been the<br />
policy which England has pursued from time<br />
immemorial, and it is that which has given<br />
her her proudest title—"mistress and sover-<br />
eign of the sea." In the many long years of<br />
struggle with other powers to obtain that
title,<br />
it was not so much the staunchness of her<br />
ships, or the bravery of her crews, as
from the<br />
training to the seas which they had
acquired<br />
in the wide commerce afforded by colonies.<br />
Before passing away from this part of the<br />
subject, I may add it is still more
unlikely<br />
that England should have adopted this
policy<br />
of abandoning her colonies at a time when
her<br />
great rival France has adopted it, and in
every<br />
part of the habitable globe, where she can
ob-<br />
tain a foothold, is planting colonies that
she<br />
too may have a widely extended commerce—<br />
that she may train from their youth a
large <br />
number of her people to "go down upon the<br />
seas in ships, to do business upon the
mighty<br />
waters," and thus prepare them for that
mag-<br />
nificnet navy she is buidling. Again,
England<br />
requires, in large quantities, the
products of <br />
the American continent, and it would be im-<br />
politic to allow a foreign power to
control all<br />
those products. When Louis Napoleon took<br />
possession of Mexico, and made of her a

dependency of France, he said, "We have<br />
an interest
indeed in the republic of the United<br />
States
being prosperous and powerful; but not<br />
that she
should take possession of the whole<br />
gulf of
Mexico, thence to command the Antilles<br />
as well as
South Smerica, and to be the only<br />
dispenser
of the products of the New World.<br />
If this be
the policy of Napoleon</span>—if he felt an<br />
anxiety that no foreign power should
control<br />
the products of a continent, how much more
is<br />
it the interest of England that a foreign
power<br />
shall not have the entire command of
products<br />
essential to her existence. England has
justly<br />
been called the "workshop of the world,"
but<br />
in materials for manufacture, she procures<br />
from other countries the value of over one
hun-<br />
dred millions of pounds sterling, while one<br />
third of her people receive the food upon
which<br />
they live from abroad. Hence it s vastly<br />
more important to England than to iFrance<br />
whose necessities in those particulars is
not so<br />
great that no one power should control the<br />
grain and material for manufacture produced<br />
by the continent of America. Therefore I
feel<br />
that circumstances do not warrant any man
in<br />
saying that it is the intention of England
to<br />
cast these colonies off. Earl Russell said
a few<br />
years ago: "I firmly believe it is our
duty, to<br />
maintain our great and valuable Colonial
em-<br />
pire," while Early Grey added: "I belive
that<br />
much of the power and influence of this
coun-<br />
try depends upon having large Colonial pos-<br />
sessions in different parts of the world;"
and<br />
but a few days ago we saw the same expres-<br />
sion of opinion as delivered by Lord
Palmer-<br />
ston. So I feel it was unwarranted for any
<br />
gentleman to say that it was the intention
or<br />
policy of England to cast their colonies
adrift.<br />
But we are told that we are in dnager of
being<br />
wrested from Great Britain, that there are
a <br />
number of circumstances existing in the
United<br />
States which endanger the connection with
the<br />
parent state. I cannot help admiring the
zeal<br />
with which the hon. gentlemen who are advo-<br />
cating this Confederation have been blowing<br />
the War Trumpet. They tell us that the King<br />
of Terrors who has been holding high
carnival<br />
in the valleys of the Shenandoah will soon<br />
come to a grand banquet in the valleys of
Nova<br />
Scotia. When the Pro. Secy. drew a picture
of<br />
this in addressing the house, I thought I
saw<br />
his cheek pale, but at th time it occurred
to <br />
me that possibly the direction in which
the <br />
hon gentleman was looking had something to<br />
do with this. He was looking at Mr. Tilley<br />
from New Brunswick, who was sitting outside<br />
the benches, and perhaps there ran through
his<br />
mind all that had grown out of the
resolution<br />
moved by him last year. That through his
ac-<br />
tion, and instrumentality the able Premier
of<br />
New Brunswick had been hurled from his po-<br />
sition, and that when the Pro. Secy's cheek<br />
blanched it was because he felt that Ban-<br />
quo's ghost was sitting at the feast.
Subse-<br />
quently when the hon. delegate from South<br />
Colchester, in "blowing the war trumpet,"
ex-<br />
hibited a tremor of voice unusual to him,
I had<br />
to acknowledge that both these hon.
gentlemen<br />
were really alarmed at the terrors they
pictur-<br />
ed. That the "great Wizards" who went<br />
"North" were terrified at the apparition
they<br />
had conjured up to frighten honester folks.<br />
We read in fabled story of sculptor who<br />
wrought from a block of marble a statue<br />
of Jupiter armed; and when he had finished<br />
and looked upon the workmanship of his own <br />
