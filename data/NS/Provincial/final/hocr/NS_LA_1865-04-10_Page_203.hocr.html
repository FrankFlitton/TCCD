is no member in this House who would be dis-<br />

called upon to engage in the consideration <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of a</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> so great as a change in
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitu-</span> <br />
tion of our country, that no intelligent man <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> be found within or without
those walls who <br />
would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> that a Conference of these <br />
Maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have </span>been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wanting</span> <br />
in their duty to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> if

for a single moment on such an occasion to avail <br />
themselves of every source of information in <br />
their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> touching the
question of Colonial <br />
Union in British America. When I had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><br />honor of moving the resolution which received <br />
the unanimous concurrence of this House at its <br />
last session, I d d not disguise f<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span>
a single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mo-</span> <br />
ment that whilst I looked upon a Union of the <br />
Maritime Provinces as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirable,</span>
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go-</span> <br />
vernment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced</span> that scheme
to the Legis- <br />
lature in the absence of any grounds of hope <br />
that the larger and more important Union of <br />
British North America <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> at
that time prac- <br />
ticable or could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effected</span>. I
did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conceal</span> <br />
from the house for a single instant the opinions <br />
which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conscientiously</span> entertained, that the in-  <br />
terests of British America would be largely pro<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
moted by a union of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with </span>the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Maritime</span>  <br />
Provinces; but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drew</span> the
attention of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle—</span> <br />
men on that occasion to the grounds I had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> <br />
believing that at that time such a union was im-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practicable</span>. I drew the attention of the house <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span>
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed</span> as I believed, on<br />
the part of both Upper and Lower Canada in re-<br />
lation to a union with the Maritime Provinces <br />
in relation to a union with Canada, and propo ed<br />
the resolution already referred to. Whilst ad-<br />
vocating, as zealously as I was able, the advan-<br />
tages that would accrue from the larger union I<br />
proposed that of the Maritime Provin-<br />
ces as the only step that was available<br />
to us at that time and a step which, so far from<br />
conflicting in the slightest degree with a Union<br />
of all British North America, was actually one<br />
in that very direction. It will be also recollect-<br />
ed that gentlemen on both sides of this house,<br />
whilst giving their concurrence and support to<br />
the resolution, did not hesitate to express the <br />
preference which they had for a union of all<br />
British North America, and even went at length<br />
into arguments to show that the advantages<br />
which were likely to come from a union of the <br />
Maritime provinces were comparatively insigni-<br />
ficant with those which would result from the<br />
larger scheme. In these sentiments I entirely <br />
and heartily concurred, as will be in the recoll-<br />
ection of gentlemen who refer to the Speech<br />
which I made on that occasion.</p>
