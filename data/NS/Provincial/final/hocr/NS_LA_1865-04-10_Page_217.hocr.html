New Brunswick, though on this latter<br />
point I am not prepared to express any opi-<br />
nion.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But suppose
the government of New Bruns-<br />

Maritime Provinces, it was desirable that that<br />
point should be definitely known, and the<br />
public mind be no longer distracted with the<br />
consideration of that question.<br />
By this resolution the government will be <br />
authorized to open negotiations, and see what<br />
prospect there is of obtaining a legislative<br />
union with that province. The opponents of<br />
Confederation here have professed to be in fa-<br />
vour of the Union of the Maritime Provinces,<br />
and as far as I have an opportunity of know-<br />
ing that has been the view of some of the op-<br />
ponents of Confederation in New Brunswick.<br />
Whatever view, therefore, this house may take<br />
of the larger question of a Union of British<br />
North America, I trust they will sustain the <br />
resolution now submitted to their consideration.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">TUESDAY, APRIL 11</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">House met at 3 o'clock.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE SCHOOL BILL.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon PROV. SEC. moved the third reading of<br />
the bill "For the better encouragement of edu-<br />
cation."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. LOCKE opposed the principle of as-<br />
sessment as most obnoxious to the people, and<br />
moved a resolution to this effect: -</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
Whereas, the system of direct taxation for the <br />
support of schools has been condemned by and<br />
is obnoxious to the wishes of the people of this<br />
Province, and instead of promoting had retard-<br />
ed the progress of education;</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Therefore Resolved, That this bill be
referred <br />
back to committee for the purpose of striking<br />
out so much thereof as establishes that princi-<br />
ple, and that there should be substituted there-<br />
for clauses provinding for subscriptions or con-<br />
tributions by fees to supplement the propos-<br />
es grant for the support of schools.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. PROV. SEC. said that the resolution
ask-<br />
ed the house to stultify itself and to resort to<br />
an old system which had been tried and found<br />
inadequate. He hoped a majority would not <br />
be found, for party purposes, willing to adopt<br />
such a course.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. LOCKE disavowed all party feeling in<br />
the matterm and expressed the opinion that the<br />
present law had retarded education and closed<br />
one half the schools. He thought the Legisla-<br />
ture had no right to meddle with the pockets<br />
of the people as the bill proposed.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. ATTY. GEN. said he had yet to learn<br />
that the people were willing to go back to the <br />
old system which had been abandoned last<br />
year by a vote of nine-tenths of the Legisla-<br />
ture. For years past all parties had acknow-<br />
ledged its inadequacy to meet the requirements<br />
of the country, and the necessity of an im-<br />
proved system of education. Notwithstanding<br />
all the difficulties that naturally arose in put-<br />
ting into operation a bill new to the people, the<br />
results on the whole had been satisfactory and <br />
encouraging. Under all the circumstances, it<br />
was absurd for the hon. gentleman to ask the<br />
house to go back to a system which had been<br />
condemned by nine-tenths of the members last <br />
year.<br />

</p><p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. ARCHIBALD made a few remarks in sup-<br />

port of the principle of assessment, which had<br />
been advocated by leading minds in the House</p>


<hr />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">and country for many years. He would not<br />
support a resolution which went to establish a<br />
principle which he felt was unsuited to the<br />
public requirements, and was condemned by a <br />
large majority last winter. The bill of last<br />
year was objectionable in many respects, but<br />
the object of the present measure was to re-<br />
move many of the injurious features of the for-<br />
mer, and place education on a more satisfac-<br />
tory basis. - Some details he strongly objected<br />
to still, but of its vital principle he approved.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. STEWART CAMPELL said that the ques-<br />
tion as to whether the rejection of the assess-<br />
ment principle would destroy the bill, and em-<br />
barrass the Government, was not the point to<br />
be considered at all. What they were called<br />
upon to ascertain was whether that principle<br />
was in accordance with the feelings and wish-<br />
es of the country. If it was, then let it be ac-<br />
cepted; but if not, irrespective of any party<br />
considerations whatever. He differed entirely<br />
from the hon. Provincial Secretary, when he <br />
said that they would stultify themselves<br />
by rejecting the assessment clause; on the con-<br />
trarty, he thoughthat it would be the Govern-<br />
ment that stultified themselves when they call-<br />
ed upon the house to pass a measure which for<br />
the last twelve months had received universal<br />
condemnation throughout the country. The<br />
hon. Provincial Secretary stated that the house<br />
had already acted upon this principle. That<br />
vote was taken in a thin house, when fifteen<br />
gentlemen recorded their votes against it, and<br />
eighteen for it: and he believed that if they<br />
were not influened by pressure since brought<br />
to bear, the majority would be the other way.<br />
He denied that the bill of last year had been a <br />
success in the country. Even admitting that in<br />
some populous districts it had met with support,<br />
that was no answer to the fact that the large<br />
majority of districts lying outside of these were<br />
deprived of the meand of education altogether.<br />
He disclaimed all idea in opposing this bill, of<br />
wishing to embarrass the government. If it<br />
had that effect, they had brought it on their<br />
own heads. He opposed it because he knew<br />
it to be obnoxious to his constituents. If it was <br />
a good bill, he called upon the government to<br />
appeal to the peopl and allow them to pass<br />
their judgment upon it; but he did not think<br />
that ever they believed that it was in accor-<br />
dance with the wishes of the people. He call-<br />
ed upon gentlemen opposite to record their <br />
opinions upon this question, according to their<br />
own convictions and what they knew was the<br />
feeling of the country. He did not think that<br />
it was the duty of any gentlemen, however<br />
much they might desire to sustain the govern-<br />
ment, to perpetuate a system so obnoxious to<br />
the people.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The assertion of the hon. Atty. Gen., that
<br />
education was in a better position now than<br />
under the old law, had been so often refuted<br />
that he would not take up time by alluding to<br />
it now. The petitions upon the table shewed<br />
the contrary; and it would have been better<br />
for the government to have paid some regard<br />
to them, rather than pass them by unnoticed.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The hon'ble gentleman concluded by calling
<br />
upon gentlemen opposite to act independently<br />
and fearlessly upon this question - their duty<br />
to their constituents should be their considera-<br />
tion - that to the Government was only secon-<br />
dary. He would rather always remain in op-<br />
position than be a slave to any Government.<br />
