<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cedented</span> increase of your

fortunate, occurring, as it does, at the

invited to consider one of the gravest questions— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">probably</span> the gravest and most
momentous question- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever</span> submitted to the Legislature

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">You</span> are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thus enabled</span> to bring to its

the opening of last Session, the Ofﬁcer then <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administering</span> the Government
alluded to the identity <br />
of the interests of the British North American Mari- <br />
time Provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and laid</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> you a proposal for <br />
devising means of effecting their Union under one <br />
Government. The consideration which you then gave <br />
to the question led to a resolution requesting the <br />
Officer administering the Government to appoint <br />
Delegates, not exceeding ﬁve in number to confer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> <br />
that subject with Delegates from New Brunswick and <br />
Prince Edward Island. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 5. It became my duty, on receiving
permission from <br />
Her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Majesty's</span> Government, to
give effe<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ct</span> tothe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Reso-</span> <br />
lution. Therefore, with a view to a full and fair dis- <br />
cussion, I endeavored <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to bestow</span>
a national character <br />
on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Delegation</span> by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">requesting</span> the aid of prominent <br />
representatives of the two great leading parties in the <br />
Province. I have directed the report presented to me <br />

them, till another proposal, which had been made in <br />
the interim, had been ﬁrst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposed</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 6. When invited by the Governor General
to send <br />
Delegates to Quebec to discuss that wider question, I <br />
considered it my duty to obtain previously the con- <br />

on behalf of this Province, the same gentlemen who <br />
had represented her interests in the ﬁrst Conference. <br />
The second Conference commenced its sittings <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> <br />

The result of their labors, proposing a Union of <br />
British North America, on certain conditions embod- <br />

public, and will now be ofﬁcially communicated to <br />
you with all the correspondence connected therewith. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 8. The highest authority on such a
subject, the <br />
Colonial Minister of the Crown, has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recorded</span>
his <br />
opinion of the labors of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates.</span>
and has given <br />
them credit for the warmest sentiments of loyalty, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> <br />
also for conducting their deliberations with a patient <br />
sagacity, which enabled them to arrive at common <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusions</span> on the most involved

encomlums from such a <br />

must <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deeply</span> gratifying to that
