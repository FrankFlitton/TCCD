<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 226 PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It is clear that the moment the colonies <br />
manifest a disposition to separate from the par- <br />
ent state, that moment will the connection be <br />
severed. There will be no disposition on the part of <br />
England to force us to remain, while on the <br />
other hand, the greatest statesmen of the parent <br />
country have afﬁrmed in unmistakable terms tnat <br />
if the Colonies wish to be loyal, the power of old <br />
England will be used to protect them from ag- <br />
gression,all they ask is to put ourselves in a posi- <br />
tion to make our defence more easy. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 375 1100 1505 2763">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I have heard it stated over and over
again <br />
that England may forsake Canada and retain <br />
Nova Scotia. This I consider a perfect fallacy, <br />
and I defy anybody to produce proof in cor- <br />
roboration of such an idea, either from docu- <br />
ments emanating from any English statesman, <br />
or from any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speech</span> delivered by
any public <br />
man in Parliament. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span>
supposing it <br />
were true, what position, I would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask,</span>
would <br />
Nova Scotia be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">placed in?</span> It
would not be <br />
the ﬁrst time that she has been the battle <br />
ground of two great nations. When Canada <br />
and Cape Breton were French, and the rest of <br />
North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> English, Nova
Scotia was the <br />
arena upon which the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">struggles</span>
of these great <br />
powers in this contest too place—struggles <br />
which were continued till the extinction of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French power</span> in these Colonies.
Surely, no <br />
one would desire to see that state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things
re-</span> <br />
enacted; and yet, if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">idea</span> of
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aban-</span> <br />
donment of Canada were realized, we would <br />
be in even a worse position than we were in <br />
during the contest I have alluded to. But such <br />
an idea is absurd. The moment that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bond</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of connection</span> between Canada and
the Mother <br />
Country is severed, that moment we also cease <br />
to be a possession of the British Crown. <br />
Whether united with Canada by Confedera- <br />
tion or not, we are bound together by a common <br />
fate and a common interest, and we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span>
<br />
stand or fall together. There is one point <br />
that I intend to advert to for a moment, <br />
and that is to shew the reason why Great <br />
Britain has a right to dictate to us the method <br />
of our defence. No other such frontier as that <br />
which divides Canada from the United States  <br />
exists between two great countries. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In</span>
its <br />
length it is unlike any other,—and there is ano- <br />
ther peculiarity about it, that whilst the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fron-</span> <br />
tier of most other countries is defended by <br />
those who live <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">behind it</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the
case of Cana- <br />
da alone part of the forces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which
defend it</span> has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
to be brought from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some three or four
thousand</span>  <br />
miles away—while the great centres of popula- <br />
tion of the assailing force are at our doors.— <br />
Therefore, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I think, if Great</span>
Britain is obliged <br />
to defend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a frontier</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> extensive as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this, she</span> <br />
has a right to give some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advice,</span>
and we have a <br />
right to listen to her advice as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the
course</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> <br />
ought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> take, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attitude</span> we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought to</span> <br />
adopt on the question of defence. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It has</span>
been asserted by some that the tempta- <br />
tion to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the United</span> States to
take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possession of</span><br />
Canada is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater than</span> against
Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia.—</span> <br />
I am rather inclined to think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
the tempta- <br />
tion is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the other</span> way. Let us
look for a moment <br />
at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the twocountries.</span> There is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no doubt</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that Canada</span> in her ag<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ricultural re-</span> <br />
sources, is a great country—that her
extent and <br />
value are enormous; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> the
Western<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> States <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are largely</span> of the same
character. The prairies <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ohio, Minnesota,</span> Wisconsin, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> Michigan, <br />
afford ample room for the settlement of the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span>
turn to Nova Scotia, we ﬁnd <br />
she possesses <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a source</span> of
inexhaustible wealth <br />
not to be found along the whole seaboard of <br />
the United States. We ﬁnd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clustered</span>
along the <br />
coast large centres of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population,</span>
engaged in <br />
arts and and manufactures, for whom warmth <br />
and light have to be provided, while the materi- <br />
al for warming and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lighting</span> them
has to be <br />
sought for abroad. We ﬁnd this material <br />
supplied in in exhaustible quantities by a <br />
country just, at their doors, separated from <br />
them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> by a political line.
We ﬁnd <br />
their comfort and their commerce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depend-</span>
<br />
ent largely upon this little colony, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span>
<br />
their public men look at it as their pri- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vate me look at</span> it, (who have
already come <br />
down and peaceably acquired a large in- <br />
terest in our coal ﬁelds, with a shrewd eye <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <br />
the future,) I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> that so
far as temptations <br />
for conquest are concerned, the coal ﬁelds of <br />
Cape Breton are as likely to be coveted, as the <br />
ﬁelds and the plains of Canada.&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> There is another matter too, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span>
<br />
exercise some inﬂuence upon the public men <br />
of the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States—we</span> happen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to possess a</span> <br />
population of some 20,000 men, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engaged in</span> the <br />
ﬁsheries and navigation. To <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>
country desir- <br />
ous of extending her naval power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great-</span> <br />
er inducement could be held out than the pros- <br />
pect of adding 20,000 sailors <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to her</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">navy?</span> <br />
While, therefore, th<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e</span>
possession of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> num- <br />
ber of men in time of peace when engaged in <br />
the prosecution of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">valuable</span> branch of in- <br />
dustry, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most important</span> to any
country. Any <br />
one who knows how Northern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commerce has</span>
<br />
been swept <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sea by</span> a few Southern ves- <br />
sels can understand how we should suffer if <br />
the dogs of war were let <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loose</span>
upon the 8000<br />
vessels which constitute our marine, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span>
<br />
whose safety and earnings depends so much of&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
the beneﬁt and prosperity of our people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span>
<br />
the calamity of war does come we need not <br />
flatter ourselves either that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it w</span>ill not fall <br />
upon us, or that if it does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fall on us,</span>
that we <br />
shall be less sufferers than our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neighbors.</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> <br />
hon. Pro. Sec. had referred to another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span>
<br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> always largely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entered into</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
consideration of the question—the construction <br />
of the Intercolonial Railroad. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appeal</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <br />
those who have always attached <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impor-</span> <br />
tance to the completion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of that</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work whether</span> <br />
there ever was a time when its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />most sanguine <br />
advocates could have anticipated that it would <br />
be accomplished upon terms so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantageous</span>
<br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province, as those</span>
now within our reach. <br />
Surely if there should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span>
weakness in the <br />
other arguments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in favor</span> of
Union, the pros- <br />
pect of the immediate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">realization</span>
of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <br />
enterprise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is one which</span> ought
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have great</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weight.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages that</span>
Nova Scotia <br />
would derive from the completion of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span>

not <br />
