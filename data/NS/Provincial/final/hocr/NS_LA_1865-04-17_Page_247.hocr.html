<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> tlemen to continue the debate, although
not <br />
very well prepared at the present moment to <br />
address the house, rather than that time should <br />
be wasted, I shall take advantage of the pre- <br />
sent opportunity to offer the few remarks 1 in- <br />
tend to make upon the subject now under dis- <br />
cussion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In the ﬁrst place I shall refer to the
observa- <br />
tions made by the hon. Pro. Sec. on Thursday <br />
last upon a subject analagous to that now be- <br />
fore the house. He challenged the accuracy of <br />
the statement I then made that seven-eighths <br />
of the people of this country were opposed to <br />
the Confederation scheme, and asserted that <br />
so far from that being the case, at least that <br />
number were in favor of it. Now, sir, if he <br />
believes that to be the case—pledged as he is <br />
by his action at the Quebec Conference to carry <br />
out the scheme—why does he content himself <br />
by laying on the table of the house a resolu- <br />
tion which asks the house to go back to the <br />
olicy of last year—in favor of a union of the <br />
Maritime provinces—and declares that the <br />
larger union is impracticable? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Voting, as I did, last year for a
resolution si- <br />
milar to that now before the house I should be <br />
prepared to maintain it now, were it not for the <br />
observations of the hon. Pro. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sec.</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reiterated</span> <br />
by the leader of the opposition—that he re- <br />
garded this as a stepping stone for the larger <br />
union of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span>
American Provinces. <br />
Believing, as I do, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span>
of a union <br />
with Canada would be to deprive us of our <br />
present locus standi and to make us a mere de- <br />
endency of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province,</span> I feel
cempelled, <br />
olding these views, to vote against the resolu- <br />
tion, and I do so, as I have said, principally on <br />
account of the remarks made by the two hon. <br />
gentlemen I have referred to. Now, sir, I think <br />
the house will agree with me that the speeches <br />
Which we have listened to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from,</span>
the hon. Pro. <br />
Sec. and the hon. leader of the opposition have <br />
had very little connection with the resolution <br />
under discussion.  Scarcely a word has fallen <br />
from their lips upon the question of a union of <br />
the Maritime Provinces. As regards that <br />
union I may say that I am not opposed to it, <br />
provided that it can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effected</span>
upon terms fa- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vorable to the province; but I am most
decid- <br />
edly opposed to it as a means of accomplishing <br />
the larger union. We have been told that the <br />
views of Mr. Howe, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. <br />
Young were all in favor of union. Even sup- <br />
posing that this was the case, I do not see why <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinions</span> should be binding upon us. <br />
They have passed away into a different arena <br />
—whilst here they reﬂected the opinions of <br />
their constituents—we are here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now in</span>
their <br />
places, not to carry out their views, but to re- <br />
present the feelings and the interests of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole people of </span>Nova Scotia. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Before</span> alluding <br />
to the financial aspect of this question there <br />
are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one or</span> two matters to which
I shall brieﬂy <br />
refer—one is in connection with the loss of <br />
privileges which will be entailed upon the peo- <br />
ple of this country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> the
adoption of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme of</span> union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> right of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> taxed, <br />
only through the action of their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has always been considered one of the
dearest <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges a free people can possess,
and it is <br />
one that comes home to every man’s mind. At <br />
present not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">single penny of</span>
taxes can be im- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posed</span> upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> except with the consent <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the representatives</span> of the
people; but what <br />
will be the result after we are annexed to An-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nada? </span>What chance would 300,000

could the representatives of Nova Scotia make<br />
against the overpowering influence of the go-<br />
vernment of Canada? We would be in the <br />
position that we would have to submit, no<br />
matter how iniquitous the tax, or else be taunt-<br />
ed as rebels. Now we have the glorious privi-<br />
lege of electing our own representatives and <br />
arranging our own tariff, and I am happy to<br />
say that so far we have done so in a manner<br />
that has redounded to the credit of the province<br />
and has doubled the resources of the country<br />
in the last few years. But what would be the <br />
consequence if this attempt to barter away out<br />
rights and privileges were carried out? In-<br />
stead of as now—enacting our own laws, subject<br />
to the exercise of the royal prerogative—we<br />
would, by our own act, surrender to the su-<br />
preme government at Ottawa the right of pass-<br />
ing any laws, no matter how obnoxious they<br />
might be to our people, and we would be com-<br />
pelled to submit, or else be branded as rebels. <br />
Under the present sysyetm, if an act was pass-<br />
ed which was not suited to the wants of the<br />
people, it could be repealed at the next session—<br />
but adopt this union, and we surrender to the<br />
Ottawa government all control over our legis-<br />
lature, and leave ourselves entirely at their<br />
mercy.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Speaker, I regret very much that no abler<br />
man than myself should be found to raise his<br />
voice against this attempt to barter away our<br />
dearest rights and privileges,—sorry am I that<br />
Nova Scotia's most gifted sons should be found<br />
to have entered into this unholy compact to de-<br />
stroy our political existence; but, sir, humble<br />
as I am, I should consider myself recreant to <br />
my principles, and unworthy of the confidence<br />
of those who sent me here, if I failed to de-<br />
nounce, feebly it may be, but to the best of my<br />
ability, this scheme, which I consider so detri-<br />
mental to the best interests of the people of<br />
Nova Scotia. Sir, we all remember the old<br />
story of Esau selling his birthright for a mess <br />
of pottage, and how he aftwewards regretted it<br />
with an exceeding bitter cry—but there was<br />
this to be said in excuse for his conduct, that he<br />
sold it when he was hungry, and at all events<br />
he received some return,—whereas the Pro-<br />
vince of Nova Scotia was not hungry, and the<br />
only return she would receive for the surren-<br />
der of her rights would be a mess of bitter<br />
herbs, to be eaten in sorrow and digested in<br />
tears. We have been told that we would not be<br />
left without a Parliament—that the represen-<br />
tatives of the people would be in the same po-<br />
sition as when such men as Archibald, and <br />
Uniacke, and Haliburton adorned these halls<br />
by their presence. But it does not require<br />
much argument to prove that such will not be<br />
the case. They were the representatives of a <br />
Province having its own laws—its own tariff—<br />
the control of its own resources—while we will<br />
represent a dependency of Canada, with pow<br />
ers about as great as the Grand Jury and Ses-<br />
sions of a county. I do hope, if this scheme is <br />
carried out, for the credit of old times, and old<br />
associations, that the title of the representa-<br />
tives will be changed, and that instead of the<br />
time-honored name of M. P. P., they will sub-<br />
stitute taht of M. C. P., or Member of the Coun-<br />
cil of Puppets. I do&nbsp; not intend, Mr. Speaker,<br />
to go very largely into the financial question,<br />
so ably treated by the member for East Hali-<br />
fax (Mr. Annand), but I find that although in<br />
the main we agree, yet starting as we did from<br />
