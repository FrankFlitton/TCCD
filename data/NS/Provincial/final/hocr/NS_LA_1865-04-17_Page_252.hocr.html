<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justify
the United States in giving notice of the ter-<br />
mination of the convention. My lords, it was net<br />
to be expected that the United States should submit<br />
passively to such acts of violence without availing<br />
themselves of all the means of repression within their<br />
power."</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">An act then
which seems to strike horror<br />
into the mind of Colonial statesmen appears to<br />
British statesmen as merely a necessary means<br />
of self-protection. Mr. Cardwell, on the 23rd<br />
March, informing the British Parliament of the<br />
force to be employed on the lakes, says:</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"Since I
came into the House I have received from<br />
the noble lord the Governor-General of Canada<br />
(Lord Monck) a despatch which confirms the agree-<br />
able reports which had already reached us through<br />
the ordinary channels of intelligence. He informs<br />
me that he had received a telegraphic despatch from<br />
Mr. Burnley, at Washington, to this effect:—'The<br />
Secretary of State informs me that his government<br />
intends to withdraw the notice for the abrogation of<br />
the Treaty of 1817 (cheers), and the passport system<br />
will cease immediately.' (Renewed cheers.) Sir, I<br />
refer to that announcement with feelings of the great-<br />
est pleasure: and now I trust we may proceed to dis-<br />
cuss the important practical question which is before<br />
us in no spirit of panic, but in that just spirit which<br />
becomes the consideration of what is due to the hon-<br />
our and interests of our country, and which has char-<br />
acterized the mode in which the proposal has been<br />
considered by the house. (Hear, hear.) Because you<br />
are on friendly terms with the American Government,<br />
because you hope that the friendly spirit which ani-<br />
mates you is reciprocated by them, and because you<br />
are confident that two might nations of one blood,<br />
one origin and one language are united by ties which<br />
should forever forbid the possibility of bloodshed be-<br />
tween them,—those considerations do not render it<br />
the less necessary that you should temperately consi-<br />
der the nature of your defences, and that you should<br />
be dependent for your safety only upon the power of<br />
your own country."</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Lord Palmerston also says:</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Many gentlemen have argued this question
as if<br />
there was a general impression and belief that war<br />
with the United States was imminent, and that this<br />
proposal of ours was for the purpose of meeting a sud-<br />
den danger which we apprehended to be hanging over<br />
us. Now, I think there is no danger of war with<br />
America. Nothing that has recently passed indicated<br />
any hostile disposition on the part of the United States<br />
towards us, and, therefore, I do not base this mo-<br />
tion on the ground that we expect war to take place<br />
between this country and America.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The view taken by British statesmen must be<br />
felt to be perfectly correct by every dispassionate<br />
man—that it was necessary for the United States,<br />
in view of raids across the frontier, the capture of<br />
steamers, the robbing of banks, the burning of<br />
hotels, to take some precautionary measures for<br />
self-protection, which should not be considered in-<br />
dicatuous of hosilities with Britain.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It has been argued that we are so small a
ter-<br />
ritory, that we should endeavour to unite with<br />
some larger country, in order to enlarge our scope<br />
for action. I cannot understand why people who<br />
enjoy all the privileges, rights, and immunities of<br />
the British Empire, should desire to form any<br />
other connection in order that they may have<br />
greater room and scope. I cannot see how<br />
any connection that we can form with other<br />
territoy can increase the relative conjunctions<br />
of Nova Scotia to the British Empire.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Turn to the American States, and contrast
the size<br />
of Nova Scotia with some States there, and form<br />
which we have heard no talk of forming any<br />
Union with any other state, in order to increase<br />
their importance in the "Union." There are the<br />
</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 336 437 1507 1031">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">States of New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode
Island,<br />
Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusettes, Mary-<br />
land, &amp;c.—all very much smaller in area than<br />
Nova Scotia, and yet from these we hear of no<br />
Union being formed among them, in order that<br />
the citizens may have more area or room for<br />
development. NovaScotia contains 20,436 square<br />
miles ; New Hampshire 9,280 ; Vermont 9,056 ; <br />
Connecticut 4,730 ; Massachusetts, that occupies <br />
so conspicuous a position in the American nation,<br />
7,800. Yet Nova Scotia, that our statesmen look<br />
down upon with contempt, is larger than any<br />
two other States I have named ; and where we<br />
find the Americans perfectly satisfied with the<br />
proportions these States occupy in the American<br />
nation, we should, also, be content, that whilst<br />
we are Nova Scotians we are, at the same time,<br />
citizens of the British Empire, with all the room<br />
and scope which it afford for development.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Again it is contended we have not
population<br />
sufficient to give us an importance. Whist those<br />
who advocate Confederation, have not shown<br />
that the scheme will of itself increase our popu-<br />
lntion, they seem to forget that our Province is<br />
very much younger than those American States<br />
with whose condition they contrast ours. All we<br />
require is a little time, as our growthis more rapid<br />
now than theirs. I have examined the census<br />
returns of eighteen States from Maine Southward,<br />
and the average rate of increase for ten years is<br />
16 7-10, while the increase of Nova Scotia in the<br />
same period was 19 9-10, so that if those gentle-<br />
men will have a little patience, our population<br />
will become sufficiently numerous.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It seems, however, the determination of
the Prov. <br />
Secretary; that we shall not remain in our pres-<br />
ent happy and prosperous condition, that nothin<br />
short of a Union with some other province will<br />
satisfy him. When last year he introduced his<br />
resolution for a convention to consider the Union<br />
of the Maritime provinces, but little importance<br />
was attached to it,  as it was not likely to lead to any<br />
practical result ; but when it became known that<br />
the convention had arranged a Union of the<br />
whole British North American Colonies, and<br />
when the terms of the proposed Union were made<br />
public, the province was convulsed from the centre to<br />
circumference ; men at once set about petitioning <br />
this Legislature, and but for the opinion which<br />
got abroad that the Delegates had abandoned the<br />
scheme, your table would have been covered with<br />
petitions. So strong was public opinion found to<br />
be against the Quebec arrangement, that the Pro.<br />
Secretary has not had the courage and the manli-<br />
ness to carry it out, although bound in all faith<br />
to the other Provinces to make the attempt. When<br />
I consider the position of our delegates, I am re-<br />
minded of the fable of the fellows who sold a<br />
"bearskin" before they had killed the bear which<br />
so happily illustrates the case that I shall trouble<br />
the House with it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Five fellows, needing funds and bold,<br />
    A bearskin to a furrier sold,<br />
Of which the bear was living still,<br />
    But which they presently would kill—<br />
At least they said they would. <br />
    And if their word was good.<br />
