<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The house will perceive that every one of
<br />
these acts has taken place since the commence- <br />
ment of the year. It is impossible, then, for <br />
anybody to avoid seeing that, however unjust <br />
and unfounded it may be, a feeling of hostility <br />
and irritation has grown up in the minds of <br />
the American people, and a desire exists, <br />
whenever the ﬁtting opportunity comes, to <br />
revenge what they considered the humiliation <br />
of the Trent affair, to retaliate for the offences <br />
of the St. Alban raiders, and the depredations <br />
committed upon northern commerce by ships <br />
ﬁtted out in English ports. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span>
it was that induced British statesmen <br />
to look with an anxious eye upon events that <br />
were transpiring around us, and which called <br />
forth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> language from Lord
Derby : <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “Of these two measures (referring to the <br />
repeal of the lake armaments and the recipro- <br />
city treaties) it is impossible not to say that <br />
they are adopted in a spirit of hostility to this <br />
country. [Hear, hear.] One of them throws open <br />
questions of the most delicate and difficult character. <br />
The American people have derived, as they do not <br />
deny, great commercial advantages from the recipro- <br />
city treaty, and its termination is advocated only on <br />
the avowed ground that Canada derives still greater <br />
advantages. One effect of the termination of that <br />
treaty would be, if I am not mistaken, that the whole <br />
of the complicated question of the ﬁsheries, from the <br />
settlement of which the United States have derived <br />
incalculable advantage, would at once be thrown <br />
open. [Hear, hear.] I am old enough to remember <br />
what serious complications and difficult questions <br />
connected with the ﬁsheries occasioned, and how <br />
near to the point of war, they led this country and the <br />
United States ; and now all these questions are grat- <br />
uiously, and apparently without the slightest reason, <br />
thrown open at the risk and danger of war—than <br />
which, nothing could be more deplorable—between <br />
this country and the United States. [Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.]</span> <br />
It is not a little signigcant. too, that at the same time, <br />
when the abrogation of this commercial treaty lays <br />
open all these points of danger and difficulty, there <br />
is another step taken to abrogate another treaty. For <br />
a long period the lakes have served as the means of <br />
peaceful and proﬁtable coirmerce between the two <br />
countries lying alongside each other ; but I can recol- <br />
lect a period in the late American war when there <br />
was a race of ship-building on the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sides</span>
of the <br />
lakes, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end</span> when the party
obtaining the supremacy <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
matter gained the control of the lakes. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Hear,</span>
<br />
hear."]<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> When Lord Derby used these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressions</span> <br />
in reference to two of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures</span>
he did <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> allude to the resolution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> is the ﬁfth <br />
in the catalogue read, and which, in my opi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nion,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exhibits</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a more</span> determined feeling of <br />
hostilily than any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the
others. I allude to <br />
the notice to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abolish</span> the
extradition treaty. <br />
Could anything be more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">significant</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tent to</span> which these feelings had
grown than <br />
the fact that a statesman like Sumner should, <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place in</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Congress,</span> coolly contend that <br />
this treaty, the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
is regarded <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> all countries <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with any</span> pretensions to civili- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">zation</span> as a necesssary safeguard
for the punish- <br />
ment of crime<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">, and which</span> is
founded upon the <br />
princip<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">les</span> of common justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and humanity, <br />
should be terminated. This declares, in effect, <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that a man who committed murder in Canada
<br />
and ﬂed to the United States, or who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span>
<br />
mitted any similar crime there and ﬂed <br />
here, should enjoy immunity from pun- <br />
ishment of his crime. Surely no stronger <br />
evidence than this was needed to show how <br />
far the feeling he had alluded to had gone in <br />
the United States. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If then the fears to which I have alluded
<br />
should unhappily be realized, in what position <br />
I would ask would we be in?<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> On
this point I <br />
shall call the attention of the house to the <br />
opinion of Mr. Cardwell, than whom no man <br />
is in a better position to judge, than whom no <br />
man has greater responsibilities, or would be <br />
more likely to weigh well the meaning of his <br />
words before he uttered them. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He uses the following language : <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “I cannot express the feelings of regret
with <br />
which I should view any controversy between the <br />
United States and the subjects of the Queen. I <br />
should look upon it as a calamity unequalled by <br />
anything the world has ever seen.”  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> This then is the opinion of a responsible
minis- <br />
ter of the crown, as to what is likely to be the <br />
nature of that war if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we should</span>
be led into it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Truly then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span>
those whose posit on and <br />
opportunities entitle them to be the best judges <br />
of the character of the war when it comes, en- <br />
tertain these views, it behoves us to make some <br />
preparation for so frightful a contingency whence <br />
it shall arise.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> What provision, I would ask, do
Englishmen <br />
consider ought to be be made?&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hear the opinion of Mr. Foster who
introduced <br />
the subject to the notice of the Parliament. He <br />
says :—
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> “ The principle was becoming every day
more <br />
established that the relations between this country <br />
and the colonies of British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span>
were <br />
very much on the basis of an offensive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
<br />
defensive alliance between two self-governing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span> <br />
munities united together by allegiance to one <br />
legitimate Sovereign.” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> What attitude then ought we to assume in <br />
reference to the new duties devolving on us. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Is it not natural for British statesmen
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span>ook <br />
upon the Union of the Colonies, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a means</span>
of <br />
defence? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Do they</span> not feel, have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they not</span> a right <br />
to feel, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the</span> effect of
Union would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be largely</span> <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improve the possibility</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defence?</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It is a favorite argument <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against it</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> that <br />
by Union, we will obtain no more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money,</span>
no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> <br />
men, and how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is it</span> possible then
for Union to im- <br />
prove our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It is</span>
