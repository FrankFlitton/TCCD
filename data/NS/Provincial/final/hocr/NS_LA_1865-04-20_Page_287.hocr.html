<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> commercial prospects look more gloomy
than <br />
at the present—and he had appealed to the <br />
hon. members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Richmond and
Halifax to <br />
say whether he was right. Neither of these <br />
gentlemen had ventured to endorse the state- <br />
ment of the Financial Secretary, because being <br />
engaged in trade themselves they knew his <br />
anticipations of an increased revenue were <br />
without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foundation.</span> According
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calcu-</span><br />
lation of the member for Colchester (Mr. Arch- <br />
ibald) an additional burden of $400,000 a year <br />
will be placed upon the revenues of the pro- <br />
vince by the resolution now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span>
discussion. <br />
The member for Halifax (Mr.Tobin) makes <br />
out that the whole debt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will be</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$11,085,000,</span> and <br />
he calculates the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at $500,000.</span> How he <br />
arrived at that conclusion he (Mr. B.) was at a <br />
loss to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine ;</span> it certainly
was not at six per <br />
cent. By his own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calculations</span>
he made out <br />
the yearly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liability</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$665,000</span>
on the debt <br />
as stated by Mr. Tobin, and this, deducting the <br />
present debt, just agrees <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> Mr. Archibald’s <br />
estimate. He would ask the house whether <br />
they were prepared to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assume an</span>
additional <br />
liability of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000</span> per annum
for twenty <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> to come? If the Financial
Secretary <br />
can demonstrate that the ﬁnancial condition <br />
of the country will bear that enormous burden <br />
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should be</span> surprised indeed.
How, he would <br />
ask, could the members for Cape Breton go <br />
back to their constituents and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justify</span>
them- <br />
selves for voting for this resolution which will <br />
put £20,000 additional every year upon them. <br />
The great cry in that island always had been <br />
that Nova Scotia swallowed up the whole <br />
revenue, and did not return to Cape Breton a <br />
fair share of what she contributed. He for one <br />
could not go back to his constituents and tell <br />
them that he had consented to put £20,000 <br />
more upon them to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">build</span> a
railroad to Monc- <br />
ton and Annapolis. The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member for</span>
<br />
Victoria (Mr. O. J. Campbell) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denounced
the</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution introduced</span> last year,
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the strong-</span> <br />
est manner, in pretty much the same terms as <br />
he was then doing; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
resolution of last <br />
year sank into utter insigniﬁcance when com- <br />
pared with those now on the table. W<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hen</span>
it <br />
was considered that the Pictou railroad was <br />
going to cost £100,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than was</span> antici- <br />
pated when it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commenced,</span> he
did not <br />
envy the man who undertook to justify to the <br />
people of this country the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increased
expendi-</span> <br />
ture which it was proposed to make. He <br />
would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> last man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to say, that.upon</span> <br />
every public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a
</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> be bound <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">influenced
solely</span> <br />
by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of </span>his constituents. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty </span>to regard the interests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the
whole <br />
country, but still, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a question</span>
of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">kind</span>, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was proper that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
whether <br />
he was justiﬁed in<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> imposing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this additional</span> <br />
burden upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> Any</span> one who took the <br />
trouble to look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into the </span>statistics
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> the sub- <br />
ject <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will find</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cape</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Breton.</span>
paid into the <br />
revenue, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> loyalty on coal,
$29,000 being ten <br />
thousand dollars more than Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia</span>
pro- <br />
per, and yet this money is to be expended for <br />
the construction of a railroad to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">th</span>e
western <br />
part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the province.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Finl. Sec’y appear- <br />
ed to think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large expenditure</span> which <br />
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going on in</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cape B</span>reton will tend to in- <br />
crease the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue. </span>He (Mr. B.)
did not think<br />
that there was much in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
argument. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If any</span> <br />
reduction took place in the price of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span><br />
p<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roductions, she</span> would lose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more than could </span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be made </span>up in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that respect. </span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cape Breton sent</span> <br />

would ask <br />

The Pro. Sec. says the tariff <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must be</span>
increas- <br />
ed in order to provide for the increased expen- <br />
diture upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">works.</span>  What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> com- <br />
mentary upon the course pursued by that hon. <br />
gentleman a few years ago.  The government <br />
then to meet a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">temporary</span>
emergency were <br />
forced to increase the tariff.  Did the Financial <br />
Secretary agree to that?  On the contrary he <br />
denounced the government and appealed to <br />
the country with the cry that this reckless and <br />
extravagant government, instead <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retrench-</span> <br />
ing their expenses, were<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> increase <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
burdens of  the people by adding<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
to the duties <br />
they would have to pay.  He and those asso- <br />
ciated with him succeeded in frightening <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> for the time, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and he</span> attained the object <br />
he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in view.</span>  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> what did he propose to <br />
do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now—instead</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carrying</span> out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>retrench- <br />
ment he then advocated, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he </span>proposes
to add <br />
this additional burden of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$323,000</span>
a year to our <br />
present liabilities and to increase the tariff as <br />
well. He also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> that there
were certain <br />
public services which will not require the as- <br />
sistance they now receive; and ﬁrst of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all
he</span>
<br />
proposes to reduce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grant</span> for navigation <br />
securities from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$49,000</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,000.</span>  If the people <br />
of this province will agree to that reduction he <br />
(Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">B.)</span> would be much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">astonished.</span>  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Then <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again he said</span> the St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Peter’s</span> Canal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would </span>be <br />
ﬁnished and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that expenditure</span>
would be saved. <br />
He was at a loss to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> how
that could be <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case.</span>  That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work would certainly</span> not be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">completed before this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liability </span>would accrue. <br />
It was rather singular that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
the Financial Se- <br />
cretary,  in his present retrenchment scheme, <br />
should have hit upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span>
ﬁgures as the <br />
hon. Provincial Secretary used a few years <br />
ago; or, at all events, should have arrived at <br />
the same result.  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He is</span> going to save <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80,000</span> a <br />
year—just as the hon.Provincial Secretary in- <br />
tended to do before he got <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into office;</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but the</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and not</span> a word is heard about<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> reducing the <br />
salaries of public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcers. </span>
His plan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now is to</span> <br />
reduce the grant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">navigation</span> securities and <br />
