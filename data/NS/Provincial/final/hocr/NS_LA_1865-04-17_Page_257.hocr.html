<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">But it is not disparagement to Canada to be<br />
thus exceeded by Nova Scotia. consider the <br />
difference in our resources. I have spoken of<br />
the size of our Province—its area, but Nova <br />
Scotia should be measured for its cubic con-<br />
tents, and the measurers rod should also be run<br />
out three miles to sea—our fishing grounds<br />
are a part and parcel of Nova Scotia, as much<br />
as the field which the farmer cultivates—for<br />
all round the thousand miles of our sea coast<br />
we draw a perpetual harvest, provided by the<br />
waters of the world. For agriculture we have<br />
lands on both sides of the Bay of Fundy,<br />
unsurpassed—yielding produce of the high-<br />
est class, whilst the districts represented<br />
by the hon. member for Kings furnish fruit fit<br />
for the palate of Royalty itself. Looking down-<br />
ward, we have mines of gold and iron, whose<br />
wealth, as yet, is almost untouchedm but which<br />
is being graudally developed in coal. We are<br />
richer than the richest. Examine the geolo-<br />
gical map of Nova Scotia hanging in our <br />
library, and you see almost every part, not<br />
occupied by gold and iron, marked by coal<br />
measures. And who shall estimate the wealth<br />
of these mines, or the influence which Nova<br />
Scotia shall, through their possession, have<br />
upon the world. As bearing upon the value <br />
of our coal fields, let me read to the house an <br />
extract from an article by the Professor of <br />
Natural History, in the University of Glas-<br />
gow:—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THE POWER REPRESENTED BY COAL</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Interesting and impressive comparisons
have been<br />
instituted between the mechanical force of a given<br />
weight of coal applied as fuel in the steam-engine and<br />
the dynamic energy of a man. The human labourer<br />
exerting his strength upon a tread-mill,—a very eco-<br />
nomical mode of using it,—can, it be stated, lift his<br />
own weight,—we will say 150 lb.,—through a height<br />
of 10,000 feet per day, the equivalent of which is 1 lb.<br />
raised 1,500,000 feet in the same time. Now, the me-<br />
chanical virtue of fuel is best estimated by learning<br />
the number of pounds which a given quantity—let it <br />
be one bushel—will elevate to a given height, say one<br />
foot, against gravity. Applied in the steam-engine,<br />
this performance of the bushel measure of coal is call-<br />
ed its duty. In some improved modern Cornish en-<br />
gines, this duty,—the bushel's work,—is equivalent to<br />
the amazing result of raising 125,000,000 lb. one foot</p>

</div>
<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_3" title="bbox 348 534 1480 1235">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">high, or 1 lb. 125,000,000 feet hight.
Now, as there are<br />
84 lb. of coal in one bushel, this divisor 84, gives 1 lb.<br />
as equal to 1,488,000, or nearly oen million and a half<br />
of feet, which, as we have seen above, is just the re-<br />
sult of a man's toil for one day upon a tread-mill.—<br />
Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">a pound of good coal is in
reality worth a day's<br />
wages</span>. If, again, we estimate a lifetime of hard,<br />
muscular toil at twenty years, and portion three hun-<br />
dred working days to each year,—a full allowance,—<br />
we have for a man's total dynamic effort, six thousand<br />
days. But 6000 lb. constitute only three tons, so that <br />
we have arrived at the almost amusing fact, the cheer-<br />
ing truth, that every three tons of coal in the earth is<br />
the convertible equivalent of one man's life-long mus-<br />
cular activity.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">What a promise is here of the capacity of
civilized<br />
inventive man to find an ample substitute for the life-<br />
wearing, brutalizing and mind-benumbing expendi-<br />
ture of nerve and animal power exacted now of the<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">slaves of all complexions</span>.
What a pledge has the all-<br />
bountiful and good Creator here given us, that the<br />
common lot of mankind is not to be, as always in the <br />
past, a lot of physical labor, but in the long future,<br />
at least one of a far higher, happier mode of effort.<br />
When I behold a section or block from out of a coal<br />
seam, and reflect that each cubic yard is in weight<br />
somewhat more than a ton; and that a column of it a<br />
yard in base and only three yards tall has more work<br />
in it than a man, more mechanical energy than any<br />
force which willing effort, necessity, or the lash of the<br />
tyrant master, can exact from the human organiza-<br />
tion, I exult in the reverential thought of the super-<br />
abundant provision bequeathed to our race against<br />
the curse of over-physical toil in this marvellous con-<br />
densation of mechanical strength. Looking at the<br />
tall column of the material, thirty-seven feet high,<br />
representing a coal-bed in Nova Scotia, displayed in<br />
the recent great exhibition on London, I said to my-<br />
self, here is a black man, of the strength of some <span style="font-style: italic;">four</span><br />
of the stoutest dark-skinned men ever held in serf-<br />
dom, and see what a willing service, what a painless<br />
bondage it can be made to undergo. This, our inani-<br />
mate slave, can be compelled to work at any rate of<br />
gentleness or speed we choose. We can induce him <br />
to lengthen out his efforts for almost any term of <br />
years, or bid him convert himself into a herculean<br />
giant, concentrating the total force of four able-bodied<br />
men, spread over twenty years of life, and applying<br />
the whole of it in some titanic triumph against brute<br />
matter within a week or even a day.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Here it may be worth our while to turn
from our<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">giant man of all work,</span> and
take the census of those<br />
populations of this sort which rest sleeping beneath<br />
the groun, but are ever ready, under the magic sum-<br />
mons of a little art, to muster at the surface in any<br />
strength and await our bidding. Every acre of a coal<br />
seam, only four feet in thickness, and yelding one<br />
yard depth of pure fuel, will produce, if fitly minded<br />
about 5000 tons—equivalent to the life-labor of more<br />
then 1600 strong men. Every square mile of such coal-<br />
bed contains about 3,000,000 tones of fuel. and repre-<br />
sents one million of men labouring steadily through<br />
twenty years of their ripest vigour."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Here is a view presented to us in which <br />
the mind becomes absolutely lost in the maze<br />
of fogures required to represent the value of our<br />
great coal fields, and when we take in connec-<br />
tion with them all our other resources we<br />
have a country to whose attainments in<br />
wealth and prosperity, there is no reasonable<br />
limit. It is not so in a country like Canada,<br />
largely agricultural, when its lands are settled<br />
and the farms established, the extent of its<br />
prosperity is nearly attained. It is not extent<br />
of territory that renders a country great or <br />
wealthy, it is not material size that goves to <br />
any object its value. The diamond that spar-<br />
kles on beauty's brown, though it may scarcely<br />
equal in size or rival in brilliancy the eye that<br />
beams beneath it, yet in the markets of the <br />
world it would purchase an Island or a Moun-<br />
tain of rock. And so is it with our little gem<br />
of a Province it may be less in territory<br />
than other countries, it may indeed be over-<br />
shadowed by the gigantic and colossal pro-<br />
