<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">STEWART</span>

LEVESCONTE, although opposed to the <br />

</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MILLER wished to remove a misappre- <br />
hension upon that subject. It did not at all <br />
follow, that if they rejected this bill they must <br />
fall back upon the old law. A measure might <br />
be framed in consonance with the wishes and <br />
feelings of the people. The hon. gentleman <br />
commented upon the bill of last session at <br />
some length, and argued that by amendments <br />
it had been stripped of a great many of its ob- <br />
noxious features, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> not at
all the bill <br />
as originally introduced. Therefore it was <br />
not right for the hon. gentleman to say, that <br />
the house had only the option of accepting this <br />
bill, or being driven back to the obnoxious <br />
bill of last session. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span>
gentleman reca- <br />
pitulated the reasons why he should be com- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pelled</span> to vote against this bill
upon its third <br />
reading.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span>
ATTY. GENL. contended that the <br />
clauses relating to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> city of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Halifax,</span> were <br />
totally inapplicable to thinly settled districts. <br />
The principle might be carried out in the more <br />
populous districts, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> deno- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minations</span> had school houses of
their own. <br />
The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman referred</span> to
the fact that, <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> Scotia, no distinction
was made be- <br />
tween any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sect</span> or creed, and he
hoped that <br />
none would ever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seek</span> for any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preference.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> After some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further</span>
slight discussion, the <br />
question was taken upon Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Stewart</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Camp-</span> <br />
bell’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion—to</span> defer the Bill

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">WEDNESDAY, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Apri1 12.</span> <br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
The house met at 3 o’clock.  <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LEVESCONTE, chairman of the commit- <br />
tee on fisheries, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reported.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. TOBIN would like to know whether the <br />
committee had considered a subject which had <br />
been brought to their notice by petitions from <br />
Margaret’s Bay, relative to the practice<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
of <br />
setting seines; and whether they had suggest- <br />
ed any remedy for the grievance complained of. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LEVESCONTE said the committee had <br />
carefully considered the subject, but could not <br />
arrive at any deﬁnite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusion.</span>
They found <br />
it impossible to divise a law applicable to the <br />
whole Province.  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. SHANNON enquired if any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">action,</span> had <br />
been taken as regards the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trawl</span>
ﬁshery. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. LEVESCONTE said that there was not <br />
sufficient information before the committee to <br />
warrant them to interfere.&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. TOBIN alluded to the want of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention-</span> <br />
this important branch of industry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span>
<br />
from the house. He saw a number of gentle- <br />
men around the benches who should take an <br />
interest in the subject; and yet here was a re- <br />
port brought<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> in by a committee
after two <br />
months deliberation, and scarcely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a remark</span>
<br />
was elicited from them. The hon. gentleman <br />
alluded to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abolition</span> of the
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of Fish</span> <br />
Inspector, which he thought had rather depre- <br />
ciated the character of our ﬁsh in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreign</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mar-</span> <br />
kets. He thought that something might be <br />
done to improve the breed of ﬁsh. In France <br />
they imported spawn for this purpose, and he <br />
did not see why caplin could not be made to <br />
breed upon our shores, so as to improve the <br />
character of ﬁsh used for bait. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S.</span>
CAMPBELL thought that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> <br />
member for Halifax <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead of lecturing</span>
the <br />
committee ought to have addressed his re- <br />
marks to another quarter. He should like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
<br />
know why the government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ignored their</span>
duties <br />
in connection with the preservation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
the ﬁsh- <br />
eries any more than in relation to agriculture <br />
or any other branch of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">industry.</span>
He thought <br />
that there was a particular reason why <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
remarks of Mr. Tobin upon the improvement <br />
of bait should have been made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to th</span>e <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern-</span> <br />
ment, for if there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was a</span> body
of gentlemen <br />
who understood the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use of b</span>ait, it was the <br />
Executive of Nova Scotia. (Laughter.) And <br />
as they had taken charge of all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools</span>
of <br />
the province, perhaps it would be just as well <br />
if they also assumed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
protection of schools <br />
of ﬁsh. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trawl</span>
ﬁshery <br />
should engage the earnest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span>
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
government, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />as if something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
not done <br />
very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soon, </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
valuable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />cod ﬁshery <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span>
<br />
coast would be completely destroyed.<br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the serious attention</span> of the house and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov-</span> <br />
