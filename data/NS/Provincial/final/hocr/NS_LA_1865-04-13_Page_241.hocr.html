reference to the question of Confederation.</span><br />
Let it be marked, too, that of this number
only<br />
3000 could be induced to express the
opinion<br />
that they disapproved of the Confederation
of <br />
British North America. The remaining num-<br />
ber only said that they were not able to
make<br />
up their minds on the subject - they wanted<br />
more information. Contrast the meagre
results<br />
after the tremendous efforts that had been<br />
put forth, with those that had been
attained,<br />
some years ago, by one party alone in this<br />
country. In the course of some three or
four<br />
weeks, some 26,000 petitioners had
approached<br />
the House asking for a dissolution on the <br />
ground that the ment then in power did not
pos-<br />
sess the confidence of the country.<br />
</p>














































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The time would come when the people could<br />
legitimately be called upon to give their <br />
opinion on the question - when they were
fully<br />
informed, they would support it in the most<br />
convincing manner. He had had an opportu-<br />
nity of testing the feelings of the
country al-<br />
ready. He went up into the County of Hants,<br />
and at a large public meeting held in the
town<br />
of Windsor, had conclusive proof that the <br />
sentiment there, at all events, was in
favor of<br />
the scheme. Again, at a meeting held at<br />
Kentville - on that was called by the oppo-<br />
nents of Confederation, in a County where
the<br />
most deceptive and fallacious statements
had<br />
been promulgated - after a lengthy
discussion, <br />
a resolution to defer the consideraton of
the<br />
question was voted down at the close.
Again,<br />
he had delivered a lecture on the subject
in<br />
connection with the collegiate institution
in <br />
that country, and on that occasion the
demon-<br />
strations given were of the most
satisfactory<br />
character. Then he had attended a meeting
in<br />
Colchester, and he would ask gentlemen op-<br />
posite whether the Southern district would<br />
not rise up to-morrow, almost to a man, in
fa-<br />
vor of a Union of British North America? In<br />
Cumberland he travelled for a hundred miles<br />
- from Mill Village to Cornwallis - and
found<br />
the publlic sentiment, not only of one,
but of<br />
both political parties, in favour of the
scheme.<br />
Then he went into Annapolis, and attended
a <br />
meeting called at Bridgetown by the oppo-<br />
nents of Confederation. He found he did not<br />
stand alone there, but was supported by
some<br />
of the most highly educated, respectable
and<br />
intelligent men that had opposed the
Govern-<br />
ment. When the recently returned member<br />
(Mr. Ray) moved a resolution simply asking<br />
for delay, he (Dr. T.) called upon the
meeting<br />
to vite it down, and not even give a
semblance<br />
of opposition to a union of British North
Ame-<br />
rica. The hon. member then called upon the
<br />
supporterd of the reolution to follow him
out, <br />
and when they had done so, they were
hardly <br />
missed in that densely crowded house.
Again, <br />
he went to Annapolis, and there the same
hon.<br />
member, who acted with a great deal of
tact,<br />
saw that, in the temper of his
constituents, it<br />
was not wise to move a resolution similar
to<br />
the one at Bridgetown.</p>









<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Was it to be said, then, that nine-tenths
of <br />
the people of this country were opposed to<br />
Confederation? He believed there were cer-<br />
tain sections that had never hesitated to
oppose<br />
it - some there were whose predilections
were <br />
not so much in favour of British
institutions,<br />
but whose feelings as well as commercial
re-<br />
lations drew them largely towards the
neigh-<br />
boring republic. But no large body of peo-<br />
ple were found actually hostile to this
great<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />question. Was it not known that the head of<br />
the Episcopal Church - one of the most highly<br />
educated and influential gentlemen in this <br />
country - one who stood aside from all political<br />
parties - whose great object was the advance-<br />
ment of his church and the common interests<br />
of the province in which he lives - was openly<br />
and unequivocally in favor of union. Again,<br />
His Grace the Archbishop - a gentleman whom<br />
all creeds and classes respect - one of the most<br />
sagacious and far-seeing men in the country - <br />
had come out boldly and fearlessly to vindicate<br />
union. That eminent man did not believe the <br />
scheme would sell us to Canada; on the con-<br />
trary, that it would promote the security of<br />
Nova Sotia and preserve its present institu-<br />
tions and its connection with the mother coun-<br />
try, and, at the same time, advance, in common<br />
with the rest of those of the people, the inter-<br />
ests of which he is the ecclesiastical head. The<br />
organs of the Presbyterian church, (the Pres:<br />
byterian Witness,) of the Methodist, (the We-<br />
leyan,) and of the Baptist, (the Christian Mes-<br />
senger,) were all known to support the Con-<br />
federation of these provinces. Was it to be <br />
said, then, in the light of such facts as these<br />
that nine-tenths of the people were opposed to<br />
this great sheme?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Over in New Brunswick the opponents of <br />
confederation had had a very doubtful suc-<br />
cess. Notwithstanding all their exertions - all<br />
the misrepresentations of the opponents of<br />
confederation, they had only got in the whole<br />
of the province a bare majority of the votes of<br />
the people. So closely balances was the vote<br />
on either side that it was almost impossibe to<br />
draw the line between them. In fact, the op-<br />
ponents of confederation having polled 500<br />
votes more than the friends of the scheme.<br />
Yet the people of England was to be made to <br />
believe that not only nine-tenths of the people<br />
in Nova Scotia, but in New Brunswick as <br />
well, were opposed to the confederation of Bri-<br />
tish America. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">In the conclusion, he called upon the House to <br />
consider the position in which it would be <br />
placed if it passd the resolution. Would it <br />
elevate itself in the opinion of strangers, if it<br />
were to so far forget what was due to its posi-<br />
tion and dignity as to express unfriendly feel-<br />
ings on an occasion when some of the most<br />
eminent statesmen of British North America were <br />
touching our shores? He would recall the at-<br />
tention of gentlemen to the kindliness and ge-<br />
nerosity with which the people of Canada had<br />
greeted the Delegated from the Maritime Pro-<br />
vinces. So far was the feeling in Quebec at the<br />
commencement from being cordial towards the<br />
object of the delegates, that the chairman of the <br />
Board of Trade, at the dinner, actually felt<br />
himself bound to say that that Association did<br />
not feel itself prepared to express any appro-<br />
val of Union. The Delegates went to that din-<br />
ner under the conviction that a large number<br />
of the most eminent merchants of Quebec were<br />
in a position of avowed hostility to the objects<br />
of the Conference. But they did not attempt<br />
to hiss the Delegates when they explained their<br />
position, - they behaved themselves like edu-<br />
cated gentlemen, - they felt they could tender <br />
their hospitalities without compromising their<br />
own opinions. The feeling that prevailed all <br />
through Canada, wherever the Delegates went, <br />
was that the visit was an occasion for the dis-<br />
play of inter-provincial courtesy. Political<br />
men of all shades of opinion vied with each<br />
