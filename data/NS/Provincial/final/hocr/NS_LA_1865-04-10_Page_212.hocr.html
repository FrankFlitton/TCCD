<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work,
it has been on the I tercolonial Rail-<br />
way. For twenty years all parties have been<br />
willing to admit that the construction of this <br />
work was a matter of the most vital concern<br />
to the people of this country. I will not detain<br />
the house by going into any elaborate quota-<br />
tions by which the leading men of these pro-<br />
vinces have, from time to time, shown that<br />
they belived that the question of Intercoloni-<br />
al Railway was fraught with the most impor-<br />
tant consequences to the advancement of the <br />
Province of Noa Scotia, and when I state to<br />
the house that after every effort has been tried<br />
and failed, this scheme of union accomplished<br />
that work on terms such as no man had ever<br />
ventured to ask for this people. I feel that it <br />
is not only in the constitution of the House of <br />
Assembly and the Legislative Council, but<br />
also in respect to this great work that the de-<br />
legates from the Maritime Provinces brought<br />
back the indisputable evidence of the earnest<br />
disposition of Canada to unite their fortunes<br />
with our own in a common union which should<br />
be beneficial to all.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It is true it was a matter of great
importance <br />
for Canada to obtain this union - that it opened<br />
a door for the removal of the great difficulties<br />
that have distracted the country,and whatever <br />
may be the extent and resources of Canada - <br />
and they are inexhaustible, and I might almost<br />
say illimitable, -- it can never occupy the posi-<br />
tion it should except it has a free outlet to the<br />
ocean. Therefore, it is not strange that the de-<br />
legates from the Maritime Provinces came <br />
back not only with the evidence that they<br />
would have in the upper and lower branch all<br />
the guarantees they would require for the ad-<br />
vancement of the coutnry, but actually obtain-<br />
ed a pledge that New Brunswick and Nova <br />
Scotia should secure the construction of the <br />
Intercolonial Railway by paying only two-<br />
twelfths of the cost instead of seven-twelfths<br />
as agreed to by the Legislatures of the two<br />
lower provinces.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">IMMIGRATION WOULD BE PROMOTED.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Can there be a doubt that the Union of Bri-<br />
tish North America, whilst it would promoye<br />
trade and elevate out credit, would also give<br />
an impulse to immigration that we cannot now<br />
expect. We are not a field of emigration, in-<br />
stead of one for immigration. Nova Scotia, <br />
without trade, and commerce, and manufac-<br />
tures, does not afford a field to our young men.<br />
The consequence is, day after day we see our<br />
best men going into other countries, where they <br />
will occupy a better position, and find an open-<br />
ing for their talents and engeries that is denied <br />
to them in their native Province. Consolidate<br />
British North America, and you will stay and<br />
turn back that tide. You will then restore <br />
tens of thousands of her expatriated sons, who <br />
have gone to other lands to seek their fortunes, <br />
and swell the ranks of our rivals, if not foes.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">OUR SECURITY WILL BE PROMOTED BY <br />
UNION.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I will now glance at the most important
point<br />
of all in connection with this question, namely,<br />
the security of the country. It is necessary that<br />
our institutions should be placed on a stable<br />
basis, if we are to have that security for life and<br />
property, and personal liberty, which is so de-<br />
sireable in every country. It is quite impossible<br />
to place any country upon a stable and respec-<br />
table footing where security has not the gua-<br />
rantee of permanency - a guarantee that will</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspire confidence in the world. I do not in-<br />
tend on an occasion like this to make any in-<br />
vidious allusions to the great neighboring<br />
power near us, but I see events transpiring<br />
around us that would make it criminal for any<br />
public man to ignore facts which are of the <br />
most vital importance to British North Ame-<br />
rica.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">THE LESSON OF THE PRESENT.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yesterday. British America bordered upon a<br />
country great in its trade and peaceful pursuits<br />
- having a commerce second to none on the<br />
globe; but you have seen all that changed as it <br />
were in a day. Now you see alongside of us<br />
one of the most gigantic military and naval <br />
powers that the world has ever seen. There-<br />
fore it behoves us to consider whether any<br />
public man, in view of the changed attitude of<br />
that country would not be wanting in his duty<br />
to the Province if he attempted for a single<br />
moment to ignore these circumstances. I drea<br />
the attention of the house at its last session to<br />
the fact that British North America had owed<br />
a great deal of its security to the existence of<br />
slavery in the neighboring republic. Is it not<br />
necessary, in he light of events that have <br />
come to our knowledge to-day, we should con-<br />
sider how closee many be at hand the termination<br />
of the great struggle which has convulsed that<br />
great republic with civil war for four years<br />
past; but I think we may safely predict that,<br />
let the issue of that struggle end in any man-<br />
ner we can possible conceive, one thing is cer-<br />
tain, and that is, that slavery is doomed. The<br />
great slave power, which so long exercised<br />
control over the destinies of the States. I have<br />
ever looked upon as the best safeguard for <br />
British North America, since it was antaginis-<br />
tic to the acquistion of any anti-slavery terri-<br />
tory, and consequent increase of influence by<br />
the North. Therefore, when we see this gigan-<br />
tic republic relieved from that difficulty, and<br />
becoming one of the greatest military powers<br />
in the world, it is matter of deserving of our<br />
most serious deliberation. I regret to have to<br />
say - nor would it be right for me to ignore the<br />
fact - that whilst I feel it would be for the in-<br />
terests of British North America to preserve<br />
the most amicable relations with the United <br />
States, it is impossible for me to shut my eyes<br />
to the evidence before me that the tone of that<br />
power is decidedly hostile to this country. I <br />
deeply deplore that such should be the case<br />
but, at the same time, I would be recreant to<br />
my duty as a public man if I did not tell this<br />
house and explain the amount of influence<br />
that these considerations have had upon my <br />
own mind. Is is known that until recently the<br />
most kindly relations existed between the <br />
people of British North America and the <br />
United States. Trade was fostered in every<br />
way that was possible - every thing that would<br />
promote harmony and free commercial inter-<br />
course was done. But how do we stand to-<br />
day? Whether you regard the public senti-<br />
ment of the country though the declarations<br />
of its Press, its Parliament, or its Government<br />
you can arrive at but one conclusion.<br />
