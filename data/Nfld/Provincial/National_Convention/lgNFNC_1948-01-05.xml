<p>
     Whereas under Annex IV, page 16,<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> of the 
     <lb/>"Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland into Confederation" dated at 
     <lb/>Ottawa, Canada, October 30, 1947, under 
     <lb/>heading "Probable Expenditures", there is an 
     <lb/>item titled "Other Departmental Expendi<lb break="no"/>tures, $9,400,000" which it is understood is 
     <lb/>meant to take care of the cost of extending 
     <lb/>existent services to Newfoundland in a typi<lb break="no"/>cal year should Newfoundland enter into 
     <lb/>confederation; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Now therefore will the said Department of 
     <lb/>
     External Affairs inform this National Con<lb break="no"/>vention at the earliest possible moment as to 
     <lb/>
     the following: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Are the "Existing Services" referred to, 
     <lb/>
     those outlined under heading "Public Ser<lb break="no"/>vices provided by Canada", sections 3 to 6 
     <lb/>
     inclusive, excepting always of course, sec<lb break="no"/>tion 4, sub-sections (1) and (2) and section 5 
     <lb/>
     sub-section (1)? If so, what are the alloca<lb break="no"/>tions in respect of each several service? Or 
     <lb/>
     generally, it is desired that an understandable 
     <lb/>
     breakdown be made of the amount of 
     <lb/>
     $9,400,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     And the answer is as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     (a) With one exception the "Existing Ser 
     <lb/>
     vices" referred to are those outlined in the 
     <lb/>
     question. The exception is an estimate of the 
     <lb/>
     cost of operation of the telegraph system, 
     <lb/>
     which is not included in this table. Since 
     <lb/>
     revenues derived from the system are ex<lb break="no"/>pected roughly to balance expenditures, it 
     <lb/>
     was not thought necessary to include es<lb break="no"/>timates for either. (See succeeding answer.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (b) "Ordinary" Expenditures of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government in Newfoundland.
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
       
            <cb/>
            <p>
     The following items listed below, com<lb break="no"/>prising the $9,400,000 estimated for "Other 
     <lb/>
     Departmental Expenditures" (as shown on 
     <lb/>
     p.16 of "Proposed Arrangements for the 
     <lb/>
     Entry of Newfoundland into Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion"), were compiled chiefly from reports 
     <lb/>
     submitted by various departments of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion overnment. They represent es<lb break="no"/>timates of the additional cost of extending 
     <lb/>
     "ordinary" Canadian services, supplied by 
     <lb/>
     these departments, to Newfoundland in a 
     <lb/>
     "typical" year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The figures must be regarded as tentative 
     <lb/>
     estimates only, and not as commitments by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government. Actual expendi<lb break="no"/>tures might prove to be higher or lower than 
     <lb/>
     the estimates, depending upon circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which cannot now be foreseen. Since these 
     <lb/>
     figures are estimates of additional expendi<lb break="no"/>tures in a "typical" year and do not take into 
     <lb/>
     account the abnormal conditions prevailing 
     <lb/>
     at the present time, it is anticipated that addi<lb break="no"/>tional expenditures during the first few years 
     <lb/>
     of union might be considerably higher than 
     <lb/>
     the estimates shown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It should be emphasised again that these 
     <lb/>
     estimates relate to the additional expenditure 
     <lb/>
     arising from inclusion of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     therefore do not include any part of the exist<lb break="no"/>ing departmental expenditures, even though 
     <lb/>
     such existing expenditures may be of benefit 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland.

     particularly in clause 2 of the enclosure, 
     <lb/>
     which reads as follows: "The Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will include the territory of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador defined by the award of the Judicial 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Privy Council in 1927 as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland territory." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     Answer: It is not clear from the question 
     <lb/>
     what statement of the Honourable Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Duplessis is referred to, but in any case the 
     <lb/>
     letter of October 29, 1947, from the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Canada to His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor of Newfoundland, with its 
     <lb/>
     enclosure, is not modified thereby in any

     particular either with regard to clause 2 of the 
     <lb/>
     enclosure or any other clauses.

     Goods now imported from Canada would,

     those lines where Canadian goods are now 
     <lb/>
     closely competitive with foreign goods in the

     rates to the remaining foreign trade. On the

     basis of the 1943-1944 Newfoundland

     diversion to Canada, to $1,000,000 with the 
     <lb/>
     maximum diversion to Canada that could be

     anticipated. Weighing all possibilities, it was 
     <lb/>
     concluded that a figure of $2,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     though probably on the high side for the year 
     <lb/>
     1943-44, was a fair estimate, having in mind

     <lb/>
     if the data were to be reworked a figure

     somewhat higher than $2,000,000 would 
     <lb/>
     emerge (though this might be offset to some 
     <lb/>
     extent by reduction in duty pursuant to 
     <lb/>
     Geneva Agreement), but such adjustments, 
     <lb/>
     either upwards or downwards, are inevitable 
     <lb/>
     and would apply to all the estimates of both

 <p>Dear Sir, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have to refer to your letter of December 
     <lb/>
     4 addressed to the Secretary for Justice with 
     <lb/>
     which were forwarded copies of notice of 
     <lb/>
     two questions by a member of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The questions are hypothetical and it is not 
     <lb/>
     usual to give legal opinions upon such ques<lb break="no"/>tions. I am, however, to convey to you the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     exact terms upon which Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would become a province of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, clause 45 of the agreement forming 
     <lb/>
     the schedule to the Labrador Mining and 
     <lb/>
     Exploration Company Ltd. Act of 1938, 
     <lb/>
     which sets forth one of terms or conditions 
     <lb/>
     on which a company has acquired property

     Government of Canada and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland on July 29, 1946, would cease 
     <lb/>
     to operate as air transport to and from New<lb break="no"/>foundland is a matter which would lie entire<lb break="no"/>ly within the field of Dominion jurisdiction.

<p>
     Dear Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have to refer to the question asked by a 
     <lb/>
     member of the National Convention as to the 
     <lb/>
     latest date on which the recommendations of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention must be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Right Honourable the Secretary of State for 
     <lb/>
     Commonwealth Relations in order to ensure 
     <lb/>
     the holding of a referendum in the spring of 
     <lb/>
     1948. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Right Honourable the Secretary of 
     <lb/>
     State has already informed the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government that a period of at least one 
     <lb/>
     month will be required for the consideration 
     <lb/>
     of the recommendations of the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commission of Government have 
     <lb/>
     given consideration to the question of setting 
     <lb/>
     a date for the holding of the national referen<lb break="no"/>dum and I have been directed to communi<lb break="no"/>cate their views to the National Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is hoped that it will be possible to hold 
     <lb/>
     the referendum about the end of the month of 
     <lb/>
     May this year. It is impracticable to hold a 
     <lb/>
     poll during the period from early June to late 
     <lb/>
     September as so many people are away from 
     <lb/>
     their homes and may be disfranchised. Final 
     <lb/>
     arrangements cannot be made for holding the 
     <lb/>
     referendum until the necessary legislation 
     <lb/>
     has been passed and steps in this direction 
     <lb/>
     cannot be taken until a decision has been 
     <lb/>

     and other materials for all polling booths. 
     <lb/>
     The matters preliminary to the voting will

     <lb/>
     and publication of legislation for comment, 
     <lb/>
     passing of legislation, printing of ballots and 
     <lb/>
     other forms, setting up of polling stations and 
     <lb/>
     distribution of election material.

     <lb/>
     of voting, it will be necessary, if the referen<lb break="no"/>dum is to be held during the month of May, 
     <lb/>
     to have the recommendations of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion submitted at an early date. The Commis<lb break="no"/>sion are unable to give any assurance that the 
     <lb/>
     referendum will be possible this spring if the 
     <lb/>

     Consideration has been given to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion asked by a member of the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention concerning the time and method by

            <p>Question 1: </p>
<p>What was the total amount of taxes col<lb break="no"/>lected from the people of Newfoundland for

            <p>
     (a) Personal income tax (b) corporate in<lb break="no"/>come tax and (c) succession duties?

            </p>

            <p>
     In Annex IV of "Proposed Arrangements 
     <lb/>
     for the Entry of Newfoundland into Con<lb break="no"/>federation", are set out the estimates of addi<lb break="no"/>tional federal revenues from personal income 
     <lb/>
     tax, corporate income tax, and succession 
     <lb/>
     duties, that would probably arise as a result 
     <lb/>
     of the inclusion of Newfoundland within 
     <lb/>
     Canada in a full year at the rates of tax 
     <lb/>
     exacted in the 1947 federal budget on the 
     <lb/>
     assumption of a continuation of present 
     <lb/>
     levels of economic activity in New<lb break="no"/>foundland.

     Questions 2, 3 and 4: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Give a statement showing the customs 
     <lb/>
     duties collected on goods imported from the 
     <lb/>
     USA, Great Britain, Canada and other 
     <lb/>
     countries for the year 1946-47. In the event 
     <lb/>
     of union with Canada, what would be the 
     <lb/>
     duties collected on the same quantities of 
     <lb/>
     goods and value imported from the USA, 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain and other countries under the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian tariff as it at present exists, for the 
     <lb/>
     year mentioned above? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Give a statement showing the amount of 
     <lb/>
     taxes collected on liquors imported from 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, Canada and the USA, as well 
     <lb/>
     as other countries, for the year 1946-47. In 
     <lb/>
     the event of union with Canada, what would 
     <lb/>
     be the duties collected by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada under the Canadian rate of 
     <lb/>
     duty as now existing? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Give a statement showing the total 
     <lb/>
     amount of taxes collected on tobaccos, 
     <lb/>
     cigarettes and cigars imported from the 
     <lb/>
     United States, Great Britain and Canada and 
     <lb/>
     other countries for the fiscal year 1946-47. In 
     <lb/>
     the event of union with Canada, what would 
     <lb/>
     be the duties collected by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada for similar quantities under 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian rate of duties as now existing? 
     <lb/>
     Answer (to second part of each question): 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     One of the basic assumptions underlying 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian estimate of additional federal 
     <lb/>
     revenue to be derived from customs duties as 
     <lb/>
     a result of the inclusion of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Within Canada, is that goods imported into 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland from Canada would be free of 
     <lb/>
     duty under confederation and that a diversion 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland trade would take place 
     <lb/>
     from other countries to Canada as a result of 
     <lb/>
     the disappearance of the tariff barriers be<lb break="no"/>tween Canada and Newfoundland. This 
     <lb/>
     being the case it would be impossible to 
     <lb/>
     compare figures showing customs duties col<lb break="no"/>lected in Newfoundland during the fiscal 
     <lb/>
     year 1946—47, and estimates of duties col<lb break="no"/>lected after confederation. Both quantities 
     <lb/>
     and values of goods imported are expected to 
     <lb/>
     change. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     An estimate of die addition to federal 
     <lb/>
     revenue from customs duties and import 
     <lb/>
     taxes as a result of the entry of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     into confederation are set out in Annex IV of 
     <lb/>
     "Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into Confederation." The es<lb break="no"/>timate is as follows: Customs duties and im<lb break="no"/>port taxesz$ 2,000,000 
     <lb/>
     Questions 5 and 7: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What were the total excise taxes collected 
     <lb/>
     by the Department of Customs under the 
     <lb/>
     different headings for the fiscal year 1946-47 
     <lb/>
     and, in the event of union with Canada, what 
     <lb/>
     would be the total amount of similar taxes 
     <lb/>
     collected under the present Canadian excise 
     <lb/>
     rates? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the event of union with Canada and in 
     <lb/>
     the event of Canada supplying from its own 
     <lb/>
     manufacturing plants all our liquor require<lb break="no"/>ments, what would be the total excise tax 
     <lb/>
     collected by the federal government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada annually? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Answer (to second part of each question): 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It would be misleading to compare es<lb break="no"/>timates of increases in collections of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian excise taxes as a result of the in<lb break="no"/>clusion of Newfoundland within Canada 
     <lb/>
     with collections of excise taxes in New<lb break="no"/>foundland by the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment, since, in addition to excise taxes, the 
     <lb/>
     federal government levies excise duties on 
     <lb/>
     liquor and tobacco. Estimates of additions to

     Question 6: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What was the total amount of revenue 
     <lb/>
     collected by the Department of Posts and 
     <lb/>
     Telegraphs for the fiscal year 1946-47 and, 
     <lb/>
     in the event of union with Canada, what 
     <lb/>
     would be the amount of revenue collected by 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian federal government under their 
     <lb/>
     present system of posts and telegraph char<lb break="no"/>ges? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Answer (to second part): 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The estimate of the addition to federal 
     <lb/>
     postal revenue arising out of the inclusion of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland within Canada is $750,000. 
     <lb/>
     (See Annex IV., "Proposed Arrangements 
     <lb/>
     for the Entry of Newfoundland into 
     <lb/>
     Confederation"). 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No estimate of either revenues or expen<lb break="no"/>ditures in connection with the telegraph ser<lb break="no"/>vice are included in the tables setting out 
     <lb/>
     estimated additions to revenues and expendi<lb break="no"/>tures of the federal government. Since they 
     <lb/>
     appear to have roughly balanced over the past 
     <lb/>
     years it was not considered necessary to in<lb break="no"/>clude them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Question: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What rates of taxation would be imposed 
     <lb/>
     upon amounts received by beneficiaries 
     <lb/>
     under life insurance policies in the event of 
     <lb/>
     union between Canada and Newfoundland? 
            </p>

<p>
     Answer: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The present law in Canada relating to 
     <lb/>
     income tax and succession duties provides as 
     <lb/>
     follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. When proceeds of a life insurance policy 
     <lb/>
     are <hi rendition="simple:italic">received by the insured in a lump sum</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     whether through taking the cash surrender 
     <lb/>
     value, or by reason of maturity of an endow<lb break="no"/>ment type of policy, the proceeds are not 
     <lb/>
     subject to income tax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. When proceeds of a life insurance policy 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">are taken by the insured in the form of an


            <cb/>
  

     annuity, pension, or settlement option</hi>, the 
     <lb/>
     periodic payments shall be liable for income 
     <lb/>
     tax in the same way as payments under any 
     <lb/>
     other annuity contract, that is, only diat por<lb break="no"/>tion of the payments which represents inter<lb break="no"/>est is subject to tax, the portion which 
     <lb/>
     represents return of capital not being taxable. 
     <lb/>
     (See Sec. 3(1) (g) Income War Tax Act, 
     <lb/>
     copies of which have been supplied to the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention...) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. When proceeds of a life insurance policy 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">go to a beneficiary upon death of the insured</hi> 
     <lb/>
     the proceeds of the policy are included in the 
     <lb/>
     total estate of the deceased and are subject to 
     <lb/>
     succession duties as part of the estate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the proceeds of the life insurance policy 
     <lb/>
     are payable in the form of an annuity to the 
     <lb/>
     beneficiary the present value of the annuity 
     <lb/>
     at time of death is included in the estate of the 
     <lb/>
     deceased for succession duty purposes. The 
     <lb/>
     annuity payments will be subject to income 
     <lb/>
     tax in the hands of the beneficiary in the same 
     <lb/>
     way as payment under any other annuity 
     <lb/>
     contract. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Question: What is the population of Canada 
     <lb/>
     as at the taking of the last census? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Answer: The population of Canada as of the 
     <lb/>
     taking of the census of 1941 was 11,506,655. 
     <lb/>
     The population of Canada in 1947, as es<lb break="no"/>timated by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics 
     <lb/>
     on the basis of figures relating to natural 
     <lb/>
     increase, immigration, emigration, etc., was 
     <lb/>
     12,582,000.

            </p>

            <p>
     Question: Has the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     recently applied to the United States for a 
     <lb/>
     temporary loan? What was the amount ap<lb break="no"/>plied for, the amount received and under 
     <lb/>
     what terms was the said loan given? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Answer: On November 17, 1947, the Mini<lb break="no"/>ster of Finance announced that arrangements 
     <lb/>had been made with the Export-Import Bank 
     <lb/>of the United States for a credit of $300 
     <lb/>million (US dollars). Negotiations concern<lb break="no"/>ing this credit are still in process.

     Question: The annual revenues and expen<lb break="no"/>ses of the Canadian National Railways and 
     <lb/>
     its subsidiaries from the year 1931-32 to the 
     <lb/>
     year 1946-47, both years inclusive, showing 
     <lb/>
     the surplus or deficit each year as the case 
     <lb/>
     may be.

     the year 1931-32 to 1946-47 by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     treasury to the Canadian National Railways 
     <lb/>
     on account of deficits incurred or in the way 
     <lb/>
     of loans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What is the total debt of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     National Railways including the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     National Steamships also the Trans-Canada 
     <lb/>
     Airlines and any other tranSportation 
     <lb/>
     facilities? 
     <lb/>
  
 </p>


            <p>Answer:Attached is a table setting out the 
     <lb/>revenues and expenses of the Canadian Na<lb break="no"/>tional Railways for the years 1937-1946 in<lb break="no"/>clusive. Since the Canadian National 
     <lb/>Railways was reorganised at the beginning 
     <lb/>of this period the statements of revenues and 
     <lb/>expenditures before 1937 are not at all com<lb break="no"/>parable with those for the period shown. 
     <lb/>Therefore only the latter figures have been 
     <lb/>set out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Also attached are statements showing the 
     <lb/>
     change in the character of liabilities of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railways. It will be noted 
     <lb/>
     that loans by the Dominion government to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian National Railways have in<lb break="no"/>creased during the period while the amount 
     <lb/>
     of funded debt held by the public has 
     <lb/>
     decreased during the same period. The ex<lb break="no"/>planation for this is that during the recent war 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government loaned funds to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian National Railways to repatriate 
     <lb/>
     liabilities held by the public in the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The balance sheet in the annual report of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian National Railways indicates 
     <lb/>
     the assets and liabilities of the railway sys<lb break="no"/>tem. Also attached is a statement setting out 
     <lb/>
     the deficits of the Canadian National Rail<lb break="no"/>ways paid by the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     during the period 1937-46. From this is 
     <lb/>
     deducted the surpluses paid to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government by the railway and a statement 
     <lb/>
     of net payments by the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment is shown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Also attached is a statement setting out 
     <lb/>
     similar figures for Trans-Canada Airlines 
     <lb/>
     during the period 1938-46. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The annual report of Canadian National 
     <lb/>
     Steamships Ltd., contains the consolidated 
     <lb/>
     balance sheet of that company. A copy of the

            <p>
     Question: What is the per capita tax of the 
     <lb/>
     federal government of Canada? 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>
            <p>Answer: A very substantial portion of the 
     <lb/>Canadian govemment's revenues is derived 
     <lb/>from a graduated tax on personal incomes. 
     <lb/>Those below the exempt level pay no income 
     <lb/>tax and the weight of the tax rises propor<lb break="no"/>tionately to income. Succession duties are 
     <lb/>likewise related to the size of estates. 
     <lb/>Another substantial source of revenue is the 
     <lb/>corporation tax which ultimately affects the 
     <lb/>incomes of individual shareholders, most of 
     <lb/>whom are in the upper income brackets. Sub<lb break="no"/>stantially less than half of federal revenues 
     <lb/>will this year be derived from what might be 
     <lb/>termed consumption taxes, such as customs, 
     <lb/>excise, sales tax, tobacco and liquor taxes, 
     <lb/>etc., and, even in respect of those, the in<lb break="no"/>cidence of the taxes varies greatly as between 
     <lb/>individuals because of differences in income 
     <lb/>and other circumstances. Moreover, figures 
     <lb/>of tax revenues in Canada include collections 
     <lb/>in respect of previous years and do not there<lb break="no"/>fore reflect the current burden of the rates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Any attempt to calculate the per capita tax 
     <lb/>in Canada by dividing the total tax revenue 
     <lb/>in any year by the population is therefore 
     <lb/>most misleading, particularly if the figure so 
     <lb/>derived is compared with a similar figure for 
     <lb/>any other country; indeed, such a comparison 
     <lb/>might produce manifestly absurd results. 
     <lb/>Apart altogether from the reasons . given 
     <lb/>above it should be bome in mind that even 
     <lb/>though tax rates in country A are lower than 
     <lb/>in country B, if country A had a higher na<lb break="no"/>tional income per capita it might well have a 
     <lb/>higher average tax per head of population 
     <lb/>than country B. The only relevant figures 
     <lb/>would be those showing taxes paid by in<lb break="no"/>dividuals in different countries with the same 
     <lb/>income in respect of the same year, but this, 
     <lb/>of course, is a most difficult statistical com<lb break="no"/>putation.

     Question: What is the total national debt of 
     <lb/>
     the federal government of Canada? Give a 
     <lb/>
     statement of the national debt, showing each 
     <lb/>
     specific loan, its date of maturity and where 
     <lb/>
     the debt is held.

     <lb/>

     <lb/>national debt of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Answer: The most recent complete state<lb break="no"/>ment of the public debt of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>Canada is that given in the budget speech 
     <lb/>delivered by the Minister of Finance, the 
     <lb/>Honourable D.C. Abbott, on April 29, 1947. 
     <lb/>This statement is contained in the appendix 
     <lb/>to the budget, pages 56 to 64 of the "Budget 
     <lb/>Speech". This statement gives details of in<lb break="no"/>dividual loans including dates of maturity as 
     <lb/>at the date of the speech. Copies of this pub<lb break="no"/>lication have been made available to the Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention but an additional copy is 
     <lb/>attached to which reference may be made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The most recent estimate of the public 
   

            <cb/>
       

     debt is that of October 31, 1947, which shows 
     <lb/>
     the gross debt as being $17,223,229,733 (com<lb break="no"/>pared with $17,698,195,740 of March 31, 
     <lb/>
     1947) against which should be set active 
     <lb/>
     assets of $4,759,131,576 leaving a net debt 
     <lb/>
     of$12,464,098,157. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For purposes of comparison the following 
     <lb/>
     table sets forth the position of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, the United States, and Canada 
     <lb/>
     with regard to gross debt; net debt, popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and net debt per capita:<ref target="#fn_06">**</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Due to the fact that a large proportion of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian national debt is held in the form 
     <lb/>
     of bearer bonds, it is impossible to answer the 
     <lb/>
     question relating to where the debt is held. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Canadian government meets its debts 
     <lb/>
     as they fall due, but, like the US government, 
     <lb/>
     does not follow the practice of holding sink<lb break="no"/>ing funds against specific loans. 
     <lb/>
     Question: What amounts of money were 
     <lb/>
     paid by the Canadian government for each of 
     <lb/>
     the railway systems as follows: the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk, the Grand Trunk Pacific and the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Northern all three of which are now 
     <lb/>
     included in the Canadian National Railways 
     <lb/>
     system? What was the total amount in dispute 
     <lb/>
     and defaulted on by the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment in respect of the Grand Tmnk bonds 
     <lb/>
     held by English financial institutions? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Did the Canadian Treasury guarantee any 
     <lb/>
     loan to the Canadian Pacific Railway prior to 
     <lb/>
     1940 and if so, what was the amount? 
            </p>
<p>
     Answer: It has been found that the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion of adequate answers to these questions 
     <lb/>
     would involve a considerable amount of re<lb break="no"/>search. As it does not appear that the infor<lb break="no"/>mation sought in the questions bears any

<p>
     Answer: Attached are copies of the Monthly 
     <lb/>
     Statement of Assets and Liabilities of the 
     <lb/>
     Bank of Canada, as at October 31, 1947, 
     <lb/>
     showing the value of notes in circulation. 
</p>

<p>
     On April 30, 1940, an Order-in-Council 
     <lb/>
     (the Exchange Fund Order) was enacted, 
     <lb/>
     providing for the sale of the Bank's gold 
     <lb/>
     holdings to the Foreign Exchange Control 
     <lb/>
     Board and for temporary suspension of the 
     <lb/>
     Bank's minimum gold reserve requirement, 
     <lb/>
     as referred to in section 26 of the Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada Act. Since that time the Foreign Ex<lb break="no"/>change Control Board has been the 
     <lb/>
     repository for the gold reserves formerly held 
     <lb/>
     by the Bank. Under the Foreign Exchange 
     <lb/>
     Control Act of 1946 this provision was ex<lb break="no"/>tended until 60 days after the commencement 
     <lb/>
     of the first session of Parliament commenc<lb break="no"/>ing in the year 1949. Copies of the 1946 
     <lb/>
     annual report of the Foreign Exchange Con<lb break="no"/>trol Board are attached. On pp. 24 and 25 of 
     <lb/>
     that report is set out a statement of the assets 
     <lb/>
     and liabilities of the Board including stocks 
     <lb/>
     of gold and foreign exchange. In the state<lb break="no"/>ment to the House of Commons on December 
     <lb/>
     16, 1947 (see answer to question on the 
     <lb/>
     amount due by Canada to the USA as balance 
     <lb/>
     of trade as at October 31, 1947), the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance stated that the Canadian holdings 
     <lb/>
     of gold and US dollars at that time amounted 
     <lb/>
     to approximately $500,000,000.<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref>

     Answer: Copies of the Monthly Summary of 
     <lb/>
     Foreign Trade of Canada, November 1947, 
     <lb/>
     are attached. This summary contains state<lb break="no"/>ments of the Canadian balance of trade with 
     <lb/>
     all countries, with the United Kingdom and 
     <lb/>
     with the United States. Exports of foreign 
     <lb/>
     goods are covered in the statements but 
     <lb/>
     movements of gold are not.

     Copies of the official report of the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons Debates of Tuesday, December

     16, 1947 are also attached. On that date the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance made a statement in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons (pp.323-340) concern<lb break="no"/>ing the Canadian balance of payments with 
     <lb/>
     the United States. This statement may be of 
     <lb/>
     assistance to the National Convention.

     Question: The total amount of loans raised 
     <lb/>
     each year from the year 1931-32 to the year 
     <lb/>
     1946-47 both years inclusive, showing where 
     <lb/>
     such loans were raised and what interest is 
     <lb/>
     being paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Answer: Since the composition of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian public debt is constantly changing 
     <lb/>
     — some loans being paid off, some refunded, 
     <lb/>
     and the ownership of some being changed — 
     <lb/>
     only the last statement of the composition of 
     <lb/>
     the debt should be used. The preceding 
     <lb/>
     answer contains this statement.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, as I was saying 
     <lb/>
     last year when I was so rudely interrupted, on the 
     <lb/>
     question of taxation of property raised by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett, I was saying this: that if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada there would be people in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland who then would have three dif<lb break="no"/>ferent governments over them. The people of St. 
     <lb/>
     John's, for example, would then have three 
     <lb/>
     governments. They would have the government 
     <lb/>
     of St. John's, known as the city council, they 
     <lb/>
     would have the Government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     known as the provincial government, and they 


            <cb/>
       

     would have the Government of Canada, known 
     <lb/>
     as the federal government. In Windsor, Wes<lb break="no"/>leyville, Port-aux-Basques, in Grand Bank, For<lb break="no"/>tune, Harbour Grace and certain other places the 
     <lb/>
     people under confederation would also have 
     <lb/>
     three governments over them.... In other parts of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, where they have no town coun<lb break="no"/>cil, those people would have only two govern<lb break="no"/>ments — the government of the province, and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, as to taxing their property — and by a 
     <lb/>
     tax on their property I mean a direct tax on their

     houses, or their land that their homes stand on, or 
     <lb/>
     their outhouses and barns and buildings, their fish 
     <lb/>
     stores, flakes, and fish stages, their schooners and 
     <lb/>
     boats and fishing gear - that is what I mean by 
     <lb/>
     property. As to a tax on that property, if we 
     <lb/>
     become a province it must be made very, very 
     <lb/>
     clear, in the first place, that the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment does not collect any taxes whatsoever on 
     <lb/>
     property. The Government of Canada has no 
     <lb/>
     property tax. It never did, not for the last 81 years 
     <lb/>
     since the Government of Canada began in 1867. 
     <lb/>
     The Government of Canada has never collected 
     <lb/>
     a dollar, or a cent in property taxes from anyone 
     <lb/>
     in any of the nine provinces of Canada, and if 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland becomes a province then the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada will not collect any 
     <lb/>
     property tax from anybody in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Now that I hope I have made very, very clear... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now as to the provincial government, that is 
     <lb/>
     the next government you come to, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the province. Will they collect any 
     <lb/>
     property tax in Newfoundland? I, of course, not 
     <lb/>
     being in that government of the future, none of 
     <lb/>
     us being in it, that government of the future still 
     <lb/>
     not being in existence, I cannot and you cannot, 
     <lb/>
     and no man can answer finally for what they will 
     <lb/>
     do and what they will not do, but this we can 
     <lb/>
     answer, that the government of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is not <hi rendition="simple:italic">obliged</hi> to collect any 
     <lb/>
     property tax, is not <hi rendition="simple:italic">compelled</hi> to collect any 
     <lb/>
     property tax, is not <hi rendition="simple:italic">forced</hi> to collect any property 
     <lb/>
     tax. If they do so it will be of their own free will. 
     <lb/>
     If the government of the Province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland decides to collect a tax on one's homes 
     <lb/>
     or gardens or animals or boats or fishing gear or 
     <lb/>
     schooners, if they decide to collect such taxes it 
     <lb/>
     will be they who will decide it, and who will they 
     <lb/>
     be? They will be the elected members of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly, elected by the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. There is not a man sitting in this 
     <lb/>
     chamber today who, if he were a member of the 
     <lb/>
     future House of Assembly of this island would 
     <lb/>
     even dream of agreeing to putting any property 
     <lb/>
     tax on the people of Newfoundland. No one 
     <lb/>
     would dream of it.... Now remember they have 
     <lb/>
     not got to put them on. There is no law which says 
     <lb/>
     they must put on property taxes. The Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada does not say, and cannot say, "You, 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     must put on property taxes." They have no law 
     <lb/>
     that gives them the right to say it. The Parliament 
   

            <cb/>
       

     of Canada cannot say it. If our future government 
     <lb/>
     does it, it is because they decided to do it of their 
     <lb/>
     own free will, and that they are not likely to do. 
     <lb/>
     Someone may say to me, "But what about the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces that are in the union now, there 
     <lb/>
     are nine of them. And these nine provinces col<lb break="no"/>lect a tax on the property of the people of their 
     <lb/>
     provinces." Some do, some do not. I wrote a letter 
     <lb/>
     to the Premier of the Province of Nova Scotia on 
     <lb/>
     28 October last, and I asked the Premier to tell 
     <lb/>
     me what taxes the government of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia collects on property, and here is the

     Dear Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Honourable the Premier has asked me 
     <lb/>
     to reply to your letter to him of October 28 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the revenue derived by the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government from taxation on land 
     <lb/>
     or from real estate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this province, real and personal taxa<lb break="no"/>tion is the principal source of revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     municipal governments, but the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government as such does not impose any 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation on land or on real estate with 
     <lb/>
     the exception of a tax imposed by the 
     <lb/>
     province on wild lands and a further tax for 
     <lb/>
     a forest fire protection fund. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The land tax, so called, amounts to one per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the appraised value of the land and is 
     <lb/>
     imposed in respect of all holdings in excess 
     <lb/>
     of 1,000 acres... This tax produces about 
     <lb/>
     $70,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With respect to fire tax, so called, the tax 
     <lb/>
     is three-quarters of a cent per acre on all 
     <lb/>
     holdings of 200 acres or more. This tax pro<lb break="no"/>duces about $25,000 per year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The total provincial tax on real and per<lb break="no"/>sonal property is less than $100,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     and the total provincial revenue for the year 
     <lb/>
     ended November 30, 1946, the last complete 
     <lb/>
     year of the province, was $22,500,000, so 
     <lb/>
     that the total direct taxation on land or from 
     <lb/>
     real estate is less than one per cent of the 
     <lb/>
     provincial revenue.

     <lb/>two or three years.

            <p>
     I also wrote the Premier of New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     and he said he was having the information 
     <lb/>
     prepared for me, but so far it has not been sent. 
     <lb/>
     Now let's look at Nova Scotia, with a population 
     <lb/>
     of 620,000, just about double the population of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and what do they collect? The 
     <lb/>
     Government of Nova Scotia collects less than 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 out of a total of $22,500,000, less than 
     <lb/>
     half a cent out of every dollar of taxes they collect 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia. So if we become a province, and 
     <lb/>
     we have our provincial government, number one, 
     <lb/>
     no property tax from the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Number two, no property tax from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland, unless the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland itself on its own free will 
     <lb/>
     should want to put on a property tax, and if they 
     <lb/>
     should decide to do it, which is very unlikely, as 
     <lb/>
     I can't imagine any government getting elected 


            <cb/>
 

     in Newfoundland if they put on a property tax, 
     <lb/>
     unless it would be one on the absentee landlords. 
     <lb/>
     If I had to do it, it would go right on top of that 
     <lb/>
     land that's owned by absentee landlords who live 
     <lb/>
     in England, or the States, or Canada. I certainly 
     <lb/>
     would put a tax on that, but except for that I can't 
     <lb/>
     imagine a Newfoundland government for one 
     <lb/>
     moment even considering putting a tax on 
     <lb/>
     property in this island, but if they did, and if they 
     <lb/>
     followed the example of Nova Scotia, what 
     <lb/>
     would they collect? $50,000 a year, if they fol<lb break="no"/>lowed Nova Scotia. We, with half the population 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia, would collect $50,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     That is the great argument that the anti-con<lb break="no"/>federates have up their sleeve to bamboozle the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country.

     and one of very deep and very intense interest to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland, as I know from a

     recent visit across the island. I am addressing

     considerable amount of misunderstanding, and 
     <lb/>
     even to this moment there is a considerable 
     <lb/>
     amount of misunderstanding, and this is the 
     <lb/>
     point: if we go into confederation and become a 
     <lb/>
     province, and have our own House of Assembly, 
     <lb/>
     will that provincial government he forced to put 
     <lb/>
     a property tax on the Newfoundland people? And 
     <lb/>
     the answer is, "No, it will not", and furthermore, 
     <lb/>
     if anyone asks is it likely that they will do it even 
     <lb/>

     people of Newfoundland. Highly unlikely." No 
     <lb/>
     people in Newfoundland would elect members 
     <lb/>
     who would turn around and put a tax on their 
     <lb/>
     property.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a matter of fact Newfoundlanders already 
     <lb/>
     pay a property tax. Who pays it? The people of 
     <lb/>
     St. John's pay it. They pay it now. They have 
     <lb/>
     been paying it since the 1880s — for 60 years the 
     <lb/>
     people of St. John's have been paying a tax on 
     <lb/>
     their property, on their homes and buildings and 
     <lb/>
     land, on their shops, on their stock of trade in the 
     <lb/>
     shops, the people of St. John's have been paying 
     <lb/>
     that property tax for 60 years. Sometimes it has 
     <lb/>
     happened that the man could not pay that tax. 
     <lb/>
     That has happened in St. John's, and it has hap<lb break="no"/>pened that the city council has taken his house 
     <lb/>
     from him and sold it to pay his taxes.... Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett, in the speech to which I am replying, read 
     <lb/>
     out an act of the legislature of Nova Scotia, an act 
     <lb/>
     which authorises city councils, or town councils 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia to collect certain taxes. He did not 
     <lb/>
     read out the act of the legislature of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, which authorises the city council in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to collect property taxes. He did 
     <lb/>
     not read that out. He had a right not to read it out, 
     <lb/>
     a perfect right, but I have a right to point out that 
     <lb/>
     there is such an act in Newfoundland, passed in 
     <lb/>
     this very chamber, authorising — you will have 
     <lb/>
     lots of occasion to applaud before I am through, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Fudge, who I believe is supporting con<lb break="no"/>federation, will have lots of time to applaud 
     <lb/>
     before I am through.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, when we rose 
     <lb/>
     for the recess I was addressing myself to the 
     <lb/>
     question of property taxes — who taxes what, 
     <lb/>
     and I had got as far as pointing out that if New<lb break="no"/>foundland becomes a province, the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada will not collect any property taxes on 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland.... And I had got as 
     <lb/>
     far also as pointing out that the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment is not likely to impose a property tax. What 
     <lb/>
     we have left therefore are the town councils and 
     <lb/>
     the city councils. We have only one city council, 
     <lb/>
     that is St. John's, but we have at the present time 
     <lb/>
     20 town councils, and we have ten others that are 
     <lb/>
     in the process of being formed. That would give 
     <lb/>
     us 30, and I dare say, in the course of time, we 
     <lb/>
     will have other town councils, because it is the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the government, and has been now for 
     <lb/>
     several years, to encourage the people of the 
     <lb/>
     larger towns and settlements in Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     form up their own town councils, and these coun<lb break="no"/>cils are doing such good work that we hope to 
     <lb/>
     have more of them in the near future. My friend 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Vincent there is a great enthusiast on this 
     <lb/>
     matter, and my friend behind me, Mr. Miller, is 
     <lb/>
     the chairman of the town council in the Placentia 
     <lb/>
     area, and many people are growing very en<lb break="no"/>thusiastic about these town councils, because a 
     <lb/>
     town council is formed in a community to do 
     <lb/>
     things for that community which no one else will 
     <lb/>
     do. The Government of Newfoundland can hard<lb break="no"/>ly be expected to collect the garbage from the 
     <lb/>
     homes of the people in St. John's. The people of 
     <lb/>
     St. John's would scarcely expect the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland to do that, to use money that 
     <lb/>
     the government collects from all Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     to collect the garbage from their doors. The 
     <lb/>
     people of St. John's could not expect the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland to give them concrete 
     <lb/>
     sidewalks and drains and curbs and light their 
     <lb/>
     streets for them, and to provide parks and other 
     <lb/>
     conveniences and comforts of modem civilisa<lb break="no"/>tion. The people of St. John's could not expect 
     <lb/>
     the government to do that, and they don't expect 
     <lb/>
     them to do it, and the government don't do it, 
     <lb/>
     these things are done by the city council; and in

     the places outside St. John's if the people want 
     <lb/>
     these conveniences they will have to pay for them 
     <lb/>
     too. I see Mr. Northcott looking over in this 
     <lb/>
     direction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Lewisporte the people don't expect the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland to use taxes that 
     <lb/>
     they collect from the whole island and Labrador 
     <lb/>
     to provide special conveniences or improve<lb break="no"/>ments in Lewisporte, so what the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lewisporte did was form their own town council, 
     <lb/>
     and so have the people of 20 other places. Now 
     <lb/>
     where there is a town council, the town council 
     <lb/>
     does these things for their people, but where do 
     <lb/>
     they get the money? Well, we know that the 
     <lb/>
     government of the country, to encourage people 
     <lb/>
     to form the town councils, to encourage them, the 
     <lb/>
     government has been helping these town councils 
     <lb/>
     financially, giving them money and lending them 
     <lb/>
     money, but in all these towns where they have 
     <lb/>
     town councils they have the property tax.... As 
     <lb/>
     you study the financial statements of the various 
     <lb/>
     town councils what do you find? You find that 
     <lb/>
     already, here in our own little Newfoundland, we 
     <lb/>
     have the property tax.... Now these town councils 
     <lb/>
     collect that property tax, so much per head and so 
     <lb/>
     much per family, for what? To give it to the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government? No. To spend it in 
     <lb/>
     their own community, and for conveniences and 
     <lb/>
     improvements and comforts that they can't very 
     <lb/>
     well expect anyone else to give them. Now if we 
     <lb/>
     had confederation any community in New<lb break="no"/>foundland that wishes to form a town council is 
     <lb/>
     permitted to do it. That is the way it is now. We 
     <lb/>
     have not got confederation. Today if the people 
     <lb/>
     of any community decide to have a town council 
     <lb/>
     they go right ahead and have it. Of course in 
     <lb/>
     having it they have got to follow the law of the 
     <lb/>
     land. You can't form a town council like that! 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[snapping fingers]</hi> Mr. Quinton, who is now the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner for Public Health and Welfare, for 
     <lb/>
     three or four years was what they called Local 
     <lb/>
     Government Officer, and the government passed 
     <lb/>
     a law, and these town councils are formed under 
     <lb/>
     that law, and that law tells them what they can do 
     <lb/>
     and what they can't do. Any community in New<lb break="no"/>foundland can go right ahead and form that town 
     <lb/>
     council. That is the way it is now without con<lb break="no"/>federation, and that's how it will be with con<lb break="no"/>federation.... They have the right to form their 
     <lb/>
     councils and they have the right not to form the 
     <lb/>
     councils. If the people in any community in New<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
     foundland today do not want a town council then 
     <lb/>
     they don't have a town council.... That is how it 
     <lb/>
     would be under responsible government, and 
     <lb/>
     that's how it would be under confederation. The 
     <lb/>
     people of a community can decide to have a town 
     <lb/>
     council if they want it, and if they are willing to 
     <lb/>
     follow the law, and they can decide not to have a 
     <lb/>
     town council if they don't want it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, can we have a little 
     <lb/>
     less repetition in this matter? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, I am afraid, Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>
     I must hold that the point is well taken. I have to 
     <lb/>
     remind you, Mr. Smallwood, that when I gave 
     <lb/>
     you the floor I pointed out that while it was true 
     <lb/>
     Ihad no right to impose a time limit on a speaker, 
     <lb/>
     or any authority to decide the number of times he 
     <lb/>
     could speak, I did however point out, and I again 
     <lb/>
     reiterate, that in view of the fact that you have 
     <lb/>
     addressed yourself on this matter a number of 
     <lb/>
     times it is my right to intervene if you indulge in 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary or tedious repetition, and I asked that 
     <lb/>
     your reply to Mr. Hollett should be as brief as 
     <lb/>
     possible, and your remarks should be confined to 
     <lb/>
     matters of a novel nature raised by Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     and I will have to ask you to be as brief as possible 
     <lb/>
     and not to indulge in anything which may be 
     <lb/>
     fairly regarded as tedious repetition, because if 
     <lb/>
     my attention is drawn to it I will have to rule you 
     <lb/>
     out of order. Therefore in your own interest I will 
     <lb/>
     ask you to be as brief as possible, and not be 
     <lb/>
     unduly repeating yourself, but to confine yourself 
     <lb/>
     as nearly as possible to matters of a novel nature 
     <lb/>
     raised by Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have heard your comments, 
     <lb/>
     and I will of course, as always, bow to your 
     <lb/>
     ruling. It may be that there are some who would 
     <lb/>
     not want our people to know these things that I 
     <lb/>
     am talking about, and there may in fact, sir, be 
     <lb/>
     some who do not want the people to know the

     complete and simple truth.

     minds, and confine your remarks to the matter in 
     <lb/>

     not to be repeating the same statement two or

     me and mould me all over again, or sit me down. 
     <lb/>
     My style of speaking is to say a thing once and 
     <lb/>
     then repeat in a different way, and then say it a 
     <lb/>
     third time in a rather different way again, and I 
     <lb/>
     think I have succeeded in making myself under<lb break="no"/>stood to the people of Newfoundland, to whom, 
     <lb/>
     and not this Convention, I am talking.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I beg your pardon Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, while you are speaking in this House 
     <lb/>
     you are addressing the Chair. I am not concerned 
     <lb/>
     at all with how people listen to the speeches all 
     <lb/>
     over Newfoundland. There has been too much of 
     <lb/>
     that altogether. You are talking to the Chair in the 
     <lb/>
     first place, and I am not going to be concerned by 
     <lb/>
     the probable reaction of the public of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to any ruling I may be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     make.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In fairness to you, Mr. Smallwood, I want to 
     <lb/>
     say this: that if you persist in repeating, then it 
     <lb/>
     may very well be that you are running the risk 
     <lb/>
     that I will have to hold that you are indulging in 
     <lb/>
     tedious repetition and are therefore out of order. 
     <lb/>
     As to the alternative of destroying you or any 
     <lb/>
     other individual here, I don't think I need make 
     <lb/>
     any comment on that. But if you persist as you 
     <lb/>
     have been going, I will have to ask you to avoid 
     <lb/>
     as nearly as possible, if you will, repeatedly stat<lb break="no"/>ing the same thing, even though you do say it in 
     <lb/>
     a different form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> May I ask, in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the words "tedious repetition", does that refer to 
     <lb/>
     repeating a certain fact over and over and then 
     <lb/>
     making the statement again in different ways? 
     <lb/>
     Does it mean repeating the same topic over and 
     <lb/>
     over, or does it refer to describing that topic over 
     <lb/>
     and over? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the statements made by you 
     <lb/>
     are substantially the same, whether the verbiage 
     <lb/>
     employed, or phraseology employed may be 
     <lb/>
     slightly different in each case or not, if you are 
     <lb/>
     repeating yourself to the point where it is becom<lb break="no"/>ing tedious to the Chair, then, if any member 
     <lb/>
     raises that point of order, I will have to rule that 
     <lb/>
     this tedious repetition is out of order.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't know if you realise the

     implications contained in your remark. I am not

     making one rule for you and another rule for other

            <cb/>
    

     with everyone alike, however far short I may fall

     of my objective. As far as I am concerned, Mr.

     Smallwood, you need not single yourself out at 
     <lb/>
     all. To the best of my ability I intend to be 
     <lb/>
     absolutely impartial and fair to everyone.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was not imputing, what I was 
     <lb/>
     inquiring was this: who decides whether a debate 
     <lb/>
     has become tedious, is it the Chairman, or any 
     <lb/>
     member who wishes to object? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In the final analysis I have to 
     <lb/>
     decide whether it is tedious repetition or not. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins has taken the objection, and I think the 
     <lb/>
     objection is well taken.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In my first reply to Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     I was prevented from continuing because at that

     time we lacked a quorum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is not necessary to bring that

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> On the last day we met Mr.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Let us get down to the case and 
     <lb/>
     forget what has happened previously. What went 
     <lb/>
     on in 1947 is water under the dam. It is over and 
     <lb/>
     done with, and let us not refer to it again. A 
     <lb/>
     remark of that kind is only calculated to reflect 
     <lb/>
     on everybody in this chamber and the Chair in<lb break="no"/>cluded. Therefore I must ask you now, please, 
     <lb/>
     and this is the second time you have done it, don't 
     <lb/>
     refer again to what happened here on the 12th day 
     <lb/>
     of December. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is that an order, sir? Is that a 
     <lb/>
     ruling? Can't I mention that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am ruling that the events, and 
     <lb/>
     I do rule here now, that the events which 
     <lb/>
     transpired on Friday, December 12th last have 
     <lb/>
     absolutely no relevancy to this debate and are not 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We are trying to keep a quorum 
     <lb/>
     here now, sir. That is why I intervened, and that 
     <lb/>
     is the only reason you had no quorum on the 12th.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> May I object to that? I had been

     is gone and get on with the business before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I hope we will all observe that. 
     <lb/>
     Personally I would have been through by now if 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins had not interrupted. Mr. Hollett, on 
     <lb/>
     Friday the 12 of December, quoted to the House 
     <lb/>
     an act of the Province of Nova Scotia authorising 
     <lb/>
     town councils and other such municipal bodies to 
     <lb/>
     collect taxes in their respective areas, and also 
     <lb/>
     setting forth the penalties which could be im<lb break="no"/>posed by those town councils upon the residents 
     <lb/>
     in their areas if they refused or failed to pay their 
     <lb/>
     taxes. First let me ask you: this is a copy of the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland Gazette</hi>, and in it they have pub<lb break="no"/>lished the Town of Curling Act. Am I proper in 
     <lb/>
     quoting from it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Oh yes, we must take notice of 
     <lb/>
     law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> This refers to the town council 
     <lb/>
     of Curling. I assume it is similar to the other acts 
     <lb/>
     that apply to all town councils. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Smallwood read the act]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> So there is nothing extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary, there is nothing unusual, when one of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada passes a law giving 
     <lb/>
     authority to the town councils in that province to 
     <lb/>
     collect certain taxes. In doing that, if they set 
     <lb/>
     penalties that is quite usual, and that is exactly 
     <lb/>
     what has been done in respect of town councils 
     <lb/>
     and city councils here in Newfoundland. There is 
     <lb/>
     nothing unusual about it. If you are going to give 
     <lb/>
     the town council the authority to collect certain 
     <lb/>
     taxes, you must also set up the right to punish the 
     <lb/>
     man who refuses to carry out the law and pay his 
     <lb/>
     just taxes. Now, what does it amount to? If New<lb break="no"/>foundland becomes a province would the people 
     <lb/>
     have to pay taxes on their homes and boats and 
     <lb/>
     fishing gear, on their livestock and land, gardens 
     <lb/>
     and farms, generally on their property? Will they 
     <lb/>
     have to pay those taxes? And the answer is, "No, 
     <lb/>
     they will not have to pay those taxes".... They will 
     <lb/>
     not pay any taxes on property to the government 
     <lb/>
     of the province, and they will not pay any to the 
     <lb/>
     federal government of Canada. They will pay 
     <lb/>
     property taxes only if they have a town council, 
     <lb/>
     and as to whether they will have a town council 
     <lb/>
     or not is their own business. They decide that for 
     <lb/>
     themselves without any coercion from anyone 
     <lb/>
     else, whether it be the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland or the Government of Canada, should 
     <lb/>
     we become a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     That is all I want to say at this time about 
     <lb/>
     property taxes. I hope the other members will 
     <lb/>
     debate the matter. I would not like to see the 
     <lb/>
     matter hidden under a bushel. I would like to see 
     <lb/>
     it thrashed out. I would like the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to know what the facts are — the truth, 
     <lb/>
     the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, I turn to another aspect of the speech 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Hollett on Friday the 12th of December.... 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett examined the estimates, or guesses if 
     <lb/>
     you like, that I brought in as to what revenue or 
     <lb/>
     expenditure the provincial government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will have to make, and what revenue 
     <lb/>
     it will have to get to balance its books — a series 
     <lb/>
     of figures designed to show whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government of Newfoundland could 
     <lb/>
     pay its way — whether Newfoundland, as a 
     <lb/>
     province, could pay its way officially. Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     thought that we would need $15,138,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     for the first four years, and $15,638,000 a year for 
     <lb/>
     the next four years, and that on to that I should 
     <lb/>
     add something or other, I think it was $4 million, 
     <lb/>
     to bring the total up to around $19 million. It was 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett's contention that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland would need $19 
     <lb/>
     million more or less to pay its way, and as I had 
     <lb/>
     shown a revenue to go against the expenditure 
     <lb/>
     from all sources of only $14 million that therefore 
     <lb/>
     we would be about $6-7 million short. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> $5 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, $5 million short to balance 
     <lb/>
     our budget. We would fail by $5 million. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman put the figure I believe at $17 million, 
     <lb/>
     but Mr. Hollett upped it a bit and broughtit to $19 
     <lb/>
     million. I want to examine it, because that is a 
     <lb/>
     matter of prime importance. I said when I intro<lb break="no"/>duced the provincial budget so-called, that if the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government of Newfoundland could 
     <lb/>
     not pay its way and balance its budget without 
     <lb/>
     cutting down on the public services, and without 
     <lb/>
     driving up taxation, then that alone was enough 
     <lb/>
     to condemn confederation. I said that at the out<lb break="no"/>set, and I repeat it now. Now we have a yardstick 
     <lb/>
     to go by, and that is the Economic Report. The 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report gave us an estimate of $30 
     <lb/>
     million revenue per year, and an expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     $25 million per year. The $25 million was to 
     <lb/>
     cover all ordinary expenditures of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland — all ordinary expendi<lb break="no"/>tures. It did not include capital, or reconstruction, 
     <lb/>
     or special, just ordinary expenditure, and that 


            <pb n="1046" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-05_Page_1046.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1046</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
          

     would cover it all. That is if we were not in 
     <lb/>
     confederation, if the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     had to provide all the ordinary services that New<lb break="no"/>foundland needed. That figure is a bit more than 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Wild, the Commissioner for Finance, es<lb break="no"/>timated when he appeared before us in a private 
     <lb/>
     session. I think he estimated something like $23 
     <lb/>
     million, but it is a bit less than the figure esti<lb break="no"/>mated by Mr. James, the present Commissioner. 
     <lb/>
     I think Mr. James has it around $26 million, but 
     <lb/>
     what the Economic Report has done is to take the 
     <lb/>
     $23 million estimated by Mr. Wild and add a 
     <lb/>
     couple of million to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going to accept that $25 million, at least 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of argument. If we can accept that 
     <lb/>
     as the amount required under Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government or responsible government to carry 
     <lb/>
     on this country, to cover all ordinary expendi<lb break="no"/>tures and you want to get an idea of what it is 
     <lb/>
     going to cost the government of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, if we went into confederation, 
     <lb/>
     the thing to do is this: take that $25 million, and 
     <lb/>
     take off from it those items of expense which, if 
     <lb/>
     we became a province, the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment would not have to pay. That is reasonable.... 
     <lb/>
     Under confederation the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     has far fewer things to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The provincial government would not have a 
     <lb/>
     railway to pay any losses on. The provincial 
     <lb/>
     government would not have any lighthouses, or 
     <lb/>
     public wharves, or breakwaters or dredging, or 
     <lb/>
     what we call marine works.... The provincial 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland would not have to 
     <lb/>
     pay any pensions to ex-servicemen of any war.... 
     <lb/>
     The provincial government would not have to 
     <lb/>
     pay any deficit on the Postal Telegraph Depart<lb break="no"/>ment, and I remind you that between 1920 and 
     <lb/>
     1940, that department of ours dropped on an 
     <lb/>
     average of half a million dollars a year loss. The 
     <lb/>
     provincial government of Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     not have to pay the expenses of the Fishery 
     <lb/>
     Department — fishery inspectors, bait depots, 
     <lb/>
     and collection and distribution of bait, and 
     <lb/>
     generally what we call fishery matters, because 
     <lb/>
     these would be done by the federal government, 
     <lb/>
     and also the provincial government would not 
     <lb/>
     have to pay any interest on that part of our public 
     <lb/>
     debt which is known as the 3% guaranteed stock 
     <lb/>
     — $60 million odd — because the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada would take over that public debt, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore the provincial government would not 
 

            <cb/>
        

     have to pay the interest and sinking fund, if there 
     <lb/>
     was any sinking fund on it. Now all these things, 
     <lb/>
     and a number of other things — I won't delay the 
     <lb/>
     house to describe them all, or even to name them 
     <lb/>
     all, because I am trying to save time. I want to be 
     <lb/>
     out of this by the end of January, right out of it 
     <lb/>
     altogether, so I won't take the time to list over 
     <lb/>
     these item by item. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you don't mind Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, could I take that as an undertaking?

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of what, sir? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That it will be closed by the end

     thousands of people in the last two weeks, to get

     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> To get back to this estimate of 
     <lb/>
     ordinary expenditure brought in by the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Committee. I could take off from that item by

     item what would not be in it if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province, and the total is $11 million. Now that 
     <lb/>
     $11 million off $25 million, and what is left? 
     <lb/>
     What is left is what the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     would have to find and the amount, if my arith<lb break="no"/>metic is right, is $14 million. On the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     estimate of the Economic Committee, which I did 
     <lb/>
     not make and which is not my estimate, if we take 
     <lb/>
     off from that those expenditures and expenses 
     <lb/>
     which the Government of Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     not have to pay if we became a province, what 
     <lb/>
     would be left for the provincial government to 
     <lb/>
     find would be $14 million, not $17 million as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman suggested, not $19 million as Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett suggested, not even the $15 million that I 
     <lb/>
     brought in myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is still repetitious. Can't we go 
     <lb/>
     on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will walk out. I will resign 
     <lb/>
     myself. I will hold myself in sir, but... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now, Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't want to turn on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins, but ifI do someone will be hurt, and I 
     <lb/>
     won't be the one that will be hurt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> So what, Mr. Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You will find out if I tum on 
     <lb/>
     you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood, you are not 
     <lb/>
     going to turn on any other member, nor is any 
     <lb/>
     other member going to turn because he wants to. 
     <lb/>
     I quite agree that if the figure is $14 million there 
     <lb/>
     is no occasion for you to go on and say $19 
     <lb/>
     million and $17 million and $15 million... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I said, sir, that it is $14 million. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Please don't repeat it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I am most eager to co<lb break="no"/>operate with you. I am equally eager to stand on 
     <lb/>my rights in this Convention, and I do represent 
     <lb/>a section of this country, but I bow to you as I 
     <lb/>have always done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite agree, but I still say that 
     <lb/>
     if you are going to avoid the charge of tedious 
     <lb/>
     repetition, in quoting a certain figure it is not four 
     <lb/>
     or five or ten other figures. If it is something come 
     <lb/>
     right out positively and say what it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But as I was replying to a 
     <lb/>
     speech made by Mr. Hollett, and as Mr. Hollett 
   

            <cb/>
    

     in that speech put it at $19 million, am I not 
     <lb/>
     entitled to point out that it is $14 million and not 
     <lb/>
     the $19 million that Mr. Hollett said — that and 
     <lb/>
     nothing else? That is exactly what I was doing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am glad now, sir. $14 million is what would 
     <lb/>
    take for the provincial government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to carry on. Not the $15 million that I 
     <lb/>formerly estimated, not the $17 million that Mr. 
     <lb/>Hickman estimated, and not the $19 million that 
     <lb/>Mr. Hollett estimated, but $14 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not what you said before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, sir, I was under the im<lb break="no"/>pression that I had. Possibly my memory on that 
     <lb/>is defective. We have to find it in one way and 
     <lb/>another, some from the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>in taxation, some as I have shown in other ways 
     <lb/>from other sources. Incidentally, it has been 
     <lb/>pointed out to me by Mr. Hollett that I have taken 
     <lb/>the $28 million cash surplus that we have and put 
     <lb/>it on deposit with the Government of Canada at 
     <lb/>2.63% interest, and I have taken the interest for 
     <lb/>the first four years as $600,000 a year, and then 
     <lb/>for the second four years I have averaged it as 
     <lb/>$299,000, roughly $300,000 a year. I admit on 
     <lb/>the objection from Mr. Hollett that I won't have 
     <lb/>$28 million to put on deposit with the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. I will go a little further, and say 
     <lb/>that I will have $38 million, which Major Cashin 
     <lb/>has told us is the surplus in this country. I will 
     <lb/>now take the 2.63% interest on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Now sir, it is 5.45 pm, and you have asked me 
     <lb/>
     kindly to rise the House at this time. If we are 
     <lb/>
     meeting tonight... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't think it is possible to 
     <lb/>
     continue the debate tonight, and perhaps not for 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the week, and I don't think we will be 
     <lb/>
     able to come this evening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You mean that we can't meet 
     <lb/>
     for the rest of the week in the night, but we can 
     <lb/>
     in the day? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Oh yes, definitely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In that case I move that the 
     <lb/>
     committee rise and report progress and ask leave 
     <lb/>
     to sit again tomorrow.
