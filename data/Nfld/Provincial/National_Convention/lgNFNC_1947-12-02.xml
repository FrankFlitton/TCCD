<!--<p>
     Government of Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have had to rule my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett out of order, and I have had to do the same 
     <lb/>
     thing with Major Cashin, but you are getting 
     <lb/>
     pretty far afield now, as to whether or not, for 
     <lb/>
     example, Bowaters or the AND Company would 
     <lb/>
     have the right to take in residents from some part 
     <lb/>
     of Canada in lieu of Newfoundlanders, bearing in 
     <lb/>
     mind the fact that in becoming the tenth province 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland becomes a part of Canada. I want 
     <lb/>
     to say ... that we are getting very far afield. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is a very important point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> This Convention should not be 
     <lb/>
     improperly placed in the position where it has to 
     <lb/>
     make pronouncements upon far-reaching points 
     <lb/>
     of law, or where I am called upon to express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion upon a point of law; which I don't have 
     <lb/>
     to do, except insofar as it concerns the interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion of the Convention Act.... I think, Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, the point by you is well taken, that is, 
     <lb/>
     address your questions on legal points to the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Justice in this country or in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, consistent with our practice in submit<lb break="no"/>ting various other questions to various other 
     <lb/>
     departments of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge ....As far as this employment of 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians on the Labrador — I have 
     <lb/>
     asked in a good many cases, where we have 
     <lb/>
     signed agreements with employers, that 
     <lb/>
     preference be given to people who reside in the 
     <lb/>
     area. However, before we get the number of 
     <lb/>
     employees required, people from all over the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     island have flocked in and have been hired. 
     <lb/>
     Similarly, if there is work down there, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians will have their men there before we 
     <lb/>
     get the message. It is a waste of time to discuss 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> To get a clear-cut answer to the 
     <lb/>
     questions raised by Major Cashin, which I con<lb break="no"/>sider to be of far-reaching importance, the only 
     <lb/>
     thing to do is to address a series of questions 
     <lb/>
     calculated to determine whether there are exist<lb break="no"/>ing contracts, and whether Newfoundlanders are 
     <lb/>
     to be employed in the event of the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     status of the country being altered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Miller If we take measures to keep these 
     <lb/>
     workmen out of Labrador, it would be a poor 
     <lb/>
     basis to start off on. All the other provinces might 
     <lb/>
     set up laws to keep Newfoundlanders out of the 
     <lb/>
     other parts of Canada. If we start out by saying, 
     <lb/>
     "You cannot work in our province — keep out". 
     <lb/>
     they can put up a poster in any other province to 
     <lb/>
     the same effect.

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I do not believe any law or anything

     <lb/>
     we are Canadians and they are Canadians.

     Honourable the Commissioner for Justice, 
     <lb/>
     whether, in the event of Newfoundland becoming 
     <lb/>
     a Canadian province, it will void and annul sec<lb break="no"/>tion 45 of the Labrador Mining and Exploration 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1938, which states, "Except where it is

            <p>
     I also ask the Commissioner for Justice what

     effect, if any, the entry of Newfoundland into 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada will have upon article 11 of the 
     <lb/>

     which article provides that wherever possible

     ask His Excellency the Governor to seek 
     <lb/>
     clarification from the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom on the following point: under the 
     <lb/>
     Leased Bases Agreement, 1941, it was stipulated 
     <lb/>
     that upon the resumption by Newfoundland of the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional status held prior to the 16 February 
     <lb/>
     1934, the contracting parties would be the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the USA and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. What would be the position 
     <lb/>
     should Newfoundland enter into confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada? Would the contracting parties 
     <lb/>
     under said agreement be the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     USA and the provincial government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, or otherwise? And if otherwise, to 
     <lb/>
     inform this Convention as to the real position 
     <lb/>
     which will exist.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In connection with one of the 
     <lb/>
     questions of Major Cashin, when he asked how 
     <lb/>
     much money was paid for the Grand Trunk Rail<lb break="no"/>way etc., that now make up the CNR — I wonder 
     <lb/>
     if he meant the purchase price? I think it would 
     <lb/>
     make it clearer if he said that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, while we are on this 
     <lb/>
     point of questions, I think there are many ques<lb break="no"/>tions which I put on the order paper that the 
     <lb/>
     delegation has answers to, and we have not got 
     <lb/>
     them. They are not contained in the Grey Book 
     <lb/>
     or Black Books, or any other book. I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     we are just wasting time in asking them, or if we 
     <lb/>
     are going to get copies of meetings, etc. that the 
     <lb/>
     delegation had with the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     when they were in Ottawa. It would certainly 
  

            <cb/>
         

     expedite the business if we had this information, 
     <lb/>
     such as the information as to the per capita debt 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, the national debt of Canada. I take it 
     <lb/>
     that when they were discussing affairs with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government they talked about what the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian debt was, and what the provincial debt 
     <lb/>
     was; I have asked questions on that and it does 
     <lb/>
     not appear in the books, and I was wondering if 
     <lb/>
     that information is not in the possession of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates to Ottawa.  
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, it is.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> If that is so, why has it not been 
     <lb/>
     tabled for the information of this Convention? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite agree, Mr. Cashin. I have 
     <lb/>to sustain you on that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When we came back from England 
     <lb/>
     the House went wild because we were told to 
     <lb/>
     keep our records confidential, and we passed a 
     <lb/>
     motion here asking the British government to 
     <lb/>
     release them, and they did release them, and 
     <lb/>
     every delegate here was given a copy of the three 
     <lb/>
     meetings we had in London, a transcript of the 
     <lb/>
     actual discussion, and we have not had anything 
     <lb/>
     in that connection from the Ottawa delegation. I 
     <lb/>
     hold that we are entitled to it, if there is any such 
     <lb/>
     thing in existence. There is nothing secret, so far 
     <lb/>
     as this Convention is concerned, regarding the 
     <lb/>
     discussion in Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> With one possible qualification, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Cashin, I must sustain you on that point.... 
     <lb/>
     Unless and until I am shown some good and 
     <lb/>
     sufficient reason as to how and why any informa<lb break="no"/>tion coming into the possession of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation should be withheld from this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, then I am definitely going to sustain Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin by holding that it is the property of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. That is all I can do about it. That is 
     <lb/>
     what I propose to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I just remarked to Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin that we have a memorandum on the public 
     <lb/>
     debt of Canada.... We have that, and certainly 
     <lb/>
     there is nothing secret about the public debt of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and there is no reason, now that we 
     <lb/>
     remember that we have it, why it should not be 
     <lb/>
     mimeographed for all members of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and in the meanwhile Major Cashin or any 
     <lb/>
     member could make use of it for all I can see.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, in connection with

     tion, which sent them to Ottawa to do a certain 
     <lb/>
     job, and any information they got up there, or any 
     <lb/>
     talks they had with the Canadian government, or 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the Canadian government, I 
     <lb/>
     say that such records belong to this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     and not to those who went to Ottawa, just the 
     <lb/>
     same as the talks we had over in London were the 
     <lb/>
     property of this Convention... and if there was 
     <lb/>
     any secret stuff going on in Ottawa — I don't say 
     <lb/>
     there was — then we should have it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As I said before, unless I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied by clear and unmistakable evidence that 
     <lb/>
     is the right of the Ottawa delegation to withhold 
     <lb/>
     information from this Convention ... I hold that it 
     <lb/>
     is the property of the Convention, and it should 
     <lb/>
     not be withheld. If there are documents in the 
     <lb/>
     possession of the members of the delegation 
     <lb/>
     which reached them in a confidential capacity, on 
     <lb/>
     the express condition that their contents should 
     <lb/>
     not be disclosed, and they gave that undertaking, 
     <lb/>
     I will have to go further into the question and find 
     <lb/>
     out the circumstances.... I make a direction now 
     <lb/>
     that all other documents and memoranda in the 
     <lb/>
     possession of any such members should be 
     <lb/>
     mimeographed immediately and distributed to 
     <lb/>
     the Convention.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> May I point out that in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     English delegation the same question arose, and 
     <lb/>
     it was withheld for some little time, but was 
     <lb/>
     finally released by the British government and 
     <lb/>
     delivered to each member on condition that it did 
     <lb/>
     not go any further. Now surely the same proce<lb break="no"/>dure can be followed here. It does not seem to be 
     <lb/>
     reasonable. I find it very difficult to understand. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....I will have to be satisfied 
     <lb/>beyond reasonable doubt that any information in 
     <lb/>the possession of the Ottawa delegation is not the 
     <lb/>property of this Convention before I am prepared 
     <lb/>to hold that that is so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I state again, as far as my position 
     <lb/>
     is concerned in the matter, everything was to be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as secret until our report to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and then everything was to be released by 
     <lb/>
     the delegation. Now apparently some members 
     <lb/>
     of the delegation hold a contrary view, and, as it 
     <lb/>
     may be a matter of conscience for them, it might 
     <lb/>
     be better to ask the question directly to the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. As far as I am concerned, 
     <lb/>
     I am willing to release it immediately.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There are three schools of 
     <lb/>
     thought on the question raised by Major Cashin. 
  <lb/>

            <cb/>
         

     In the one case, I think you took the position that 
     <lb/>
     nothing was to be regarded as secret as far as the 
     <lb/>
     Convention was concerned at all. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand some members went to the other extreme, 
     <lb/>
     and said they regarded it as all confidential; and 
     <lb/>
     then in between, some members thought that it 
     <lb/>
     was secret for some purposes and not for others. 
     <lb/>
     I said the other day that I did not want to come 
     <lb/>
     between any man and his conscience, but I think 
     <lb/>
     your suggestion is the proper one. If Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin's point is well taken, and I think it is, then 
     <lb/>
     to relieve any members who may feel that I am 
     <lb/>
     coming between them and their conscience, I 
     <lb/>
     think that you, Mr. Higgins, or someone this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon should table another question to the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada, and let's have it disposed 
     <lb/>
     of once and for all: whether all or any of the 
     <lb/>
     information in possession of all or any members 
     <lb/>
     of the Ottawa delegation is to be treated as secret, 
     <lb/>
     in the sense that it can be withheld from the 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman. that is not what I was 
     <lb/>
     going to say. If the members of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation are willing, I believe we could table a 
     <lb/>
     motion the same as we did with the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation. We had the very same trouble there, 
     <lb/>
     and after a while it came through. One man looks 
     <lb/>
     at it from one angle, and another from another, 
     <lb/>
     but to be fair to the Ottawa delegation, and also 
     <lb/>
     to be fair to the Convention and the people, I 
     <lb/>
     believe that the Canadian government should be 
     <lb/>
     asked to release everything so that we can get 
     <lb/>
     down to thejob. If I may liken it to something, it 
     <lb/>
     is like coming in with the official log book. You 
     <lb/>
     lay it on the owner's table. What does he know 
     <lb/>
     about it? But if you bring in a scratch log he can 
     <lb/>
     see the whole thing in a nutshell, and it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me that is just like it. We havejust got the official 
     <lb/>
     log, and the scratch log is something secret. The 
     <lb/>
     members of this delegation have something that 
     <lb/>
     we are not allowed to have. I believe the right way 
     <lb/>
     to get at it is to table a motion and ask the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government if those people are bound 
     <lb/>
     by that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think perhaps the Convention 
     <lb/>
     would like to save a little time. You are going to 
     <lb/>
     table a motion to the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     through the regular channels, asking them if the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation may release certain docu<lb break="no"/>ments, and by the time that government gets that

     might be over. So if there is another way of doing 
     <lb/>
     it, possibly that would be the better thing to do. 
     <lb/>
     Let's get the thing straight. There is a lot of talk 
     <lb/>
     about the mysterious secret documents, and the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Convention may have a feeling 
     <lb/>
     that we have been living in an atmosphere of 
     <lb/>
     conspiracy and plots now for 14 months. A lot of 
     <lb/>
     members may feel that there are some dark and 
     <lb/>
     mysterious documents closely guarded under 
     <lb/>
     lock and key by the members of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation. There is no such thing. The fact of the 
     <lb/>
     matter is these Black Books contain 99.99% of 
     <lb/>
     what was given us in Ottawa. There is one docu<lb break="no"/>ment only, to my knowledge, speaking from 
     <lb/>
     memory ... which has not been put in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books, and that is the one to which I have just 
     <lb/>
     made reference in reply to Major Cashin. One 
     <lb/>
     only. All other documents appear in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Book in their final, official form.... Please let us 
     <lb/>
     have done with any further suggestions of secret, 
     <lb/>
     dark, mysterious documents under lock and key, 
     <lb/>
     that we are trying to keep back from the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. That is a completely wrong impression. All 
     <lb/>
     trash and nonsense.... 
     <lb/>
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I don't know if it is in the Black 
     <lb/>Book. The point I make is this: it is a very 
     <lb/>important document, and even if it is the only one 
     <lb/>that is left out, the point is it should have been 
     <lb/>tabled here the first day, because it relates to the 
     <lb/>public debt of Canada, and a comparison has to 
     <lb/>be made between the public debt of Canada and 
     <lb/>the public debt of Newfoundland. I tabled a ques<lb break="no"/>tion on this ten days ago, and I find now that my 
     <lb/>questions have gone off to Ottawa when the 
     <lb/>actual information is here in the city. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The fact that any memorandum 
     <lb/>or document in the possession of members may 
     <lb/>overlap the so-called Black Books is no reason 
     <lb/>for withholding it from the members of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention. On the contrary, in certain circles it 
     <lb/>might be regarded as very foolish, because in a 
     <lb/>sense it provides independent corroboration for 
     <lb/>what is in the Black Books. Therefore, there is 
     <lb/>every reason why it should be made the property 
     <lb/>of the Convention. But in that respect has any 
     <lb/>member of the Ottawa delegation anything to say 
     <lb/>on whether or not the document referred to 
     <lb/>should not be made the property of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion? Is there any reason why it should not be? 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry 
     <lb/>that the chairman of the Ottawa delegation is not 
   

            <cb/>
          

     here, Mr. Bradley, because I think that he might 
     <lb/>
     have some views on this matter, As far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned myself I want to see my position clear, 
     <lb/>
     to satisfy my own conscience, and to know that I 
     <lb/>
     am doing right. If I accepted, when I was a 
     <lb/>
     member of the delegation to Ottawa, certain 
     <lb/>
     documents which, in the compilation of the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books and the Grey Book, were used, and these 
     <lb/>
     documents came to me marked "Confidential". 
     <lb/>
     and in a folder marked "Secret", the question I 
     <lb/>
     must ask myself is whether or not I am permitted 
     <lb/>
     to divulge that information without permission 
     <lb/>
     from the people who supplied it. I might say I 
     <lb/>
     accepted that information as it was handed to me, 
     <lb/>
     as confidential and secret ... but I understood that 
     <lb/>
     these reports which had been prepared by sub<lb break="no"/>committees, etc., and supplied to the members, 
     <lb/>
     were superseded by these Black Books, and that 
     <lb/>
     these were to be the final word, so to speak. 
     <lb/>
      </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ... Mr. Smallwood has made the 
     <lb/>statement that 99.99% of the information con<lb break="no"/>tained in the documents, or memoranda to which 
     <lb/>you refer, is already set forth in the Black Books. 
     <lb/>Do you agree to that statement? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Well, I would not like to make 
     <lb/>any statement, but in the main, I don't know 
     <lb/>mind, but I am afraid that I could not say whether 
     <lb/>there is very much left out of these Black 
     <lb/>Books.... Of course, I don't want to withhold 
     <lb/>anything from the Convention, and if the 
     <lb/>Canadian government is satisfied to release it, 
     <lb/>that's up to them.... I understand Mr. Bradley is 
     <lb/>still ill, but I am sorry he is not here, because, as 
     <lb/>I said before, I consider that these things were 
     <lb/>given to us and marked "Secret", and whether or 
     <lb/>not I am entitled to read from these documents, 
     <lb/>that is a point that I want to be satisfied on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Burry, would you mind, as 
     <lb/>a member of the Ottawa delegation, addressing 
     <lb/>yourself on this very important question, because 
     <lb/>it is the second time that it has come before the 
     <lb/>Chair in the past four days and I would like to 
     <lb/>have it disposed of once and for all, if I could.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Well, Mr. Chairman, I stated my 
     <lb/>position in this case once. I don't know if I made 
     <lb/>myself clear or not, but I do not recall giving any 
     <lb/>undertaking that I would keep any of the docu<lb break="no"/>ments that I brought back from Ottawa from the 
     <lb/>Convention. I did not give any undertaking to 
     <lb/>keep anything secret. While we were there we 
     <lb/>were given documents that were marked "Con<lb break="no"/>

     fidential" and "Secret", we held them as such, 
     <lb/>
     and during our stay in Ottawa I was under secrecy 
     <lb/>
     as far as these documents were concerned; but I 
     <lb/>
     cannot recollect that the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     asked me to keep anything that I brought back 
     <lb/>
     from Ottawa from this National Convention. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In your judgement, Mr. Burry, 
     <lb/>would there be anything unusual or immoral in 
     <lb/>my directing a request to any members of the 
     <lb/>delegation who feel that they are not in con<lb break="no"/>science bound to keep from the Convention any 
     <lb/>of the information they received? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> As far as I am concerned, I have a 
     <lb/>
     folder in my bag with the information in it, and I 
     <lb/>
     have no scruples in letting any member see what 
     <lb/>
     is in it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Supposing I were to ask you, 
     <lb/>
     would you please have mimeographed this docu<lb break="no"/>ment which is in your bag — would you consider 
     <lb/>
     that an improper or unconscionable ruling? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> No, because I was not asked to do 
     <lb/>
     such.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I would advise you to ask 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley about that; I asked Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>
     myself, and his answer was that it was secret and 
     <lb/>
     confidential. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> With all due respect to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley, this is a matter of conscience.... But 
     <lb/>
     the opinion has been expressed by Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>
     Rev. Burry and Mr. Smallwood that they can see 
     <lb/>
     no reason why this information would be with<lb break="no"/>held from the Convention. Therefore I am now 
     <lb/>
     requesting these three gentlemen, if according to 
     <lb/>
     their own consciences they are free to do so, 
     <lb/>
     would they please be good enough to pass over 
     <lb/>
     any document or documents they may have to the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary to be mimeographed and distributed to 
     <lb/>
     the members. That does not obligate you, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ashbourne, or Mr. Bradley, or anyone else 
     <lb/>
     who thinks he is in conscience bound to withhold 
     <lb/>
     it from the Convention. At the same time it allows 
     <lb/>
     other members to exercise, or at least to govern 
     <lb/>
     their actions by the dictates of their conscience. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> Does that include minutes of 
     <lb/>plenary sessions? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That includes, as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, everything that came into the posses<lb break="no"/>sion of the delegation. You were sent down there 
     <lb/>
     by the Convention and as far as I am concerned, 
     <lb/>
     unless it is a matter of morals or scruples or 
     <lb/>
     conscience or something of that sort, I can see no 
 

            <cb/>
       

     reason in the world why your report back to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention should not be completed by passing 
     <lb/>
     over any ancillary or supplementary documents 
     <lb/>
     you may have in your possession.... My ruling is 
     <lb/>
     that Rev. Burry, Mr. Higgins and Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, who apparently feel they are not in con<lb break="no"/>science bound to withhold the information, and 
     <lb/>
     are willing to make available the information, 
     <lb/>
     should pass over to the Secretary to be 
     <lb/>
     mimeographed and distributed, any documents in 
     <lb/>
     their possession, to be made available to mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> All these dark secrets which we are 
     <lb/>
     talking about are merely reports of committees, 
     <lb/>
     talks across the table, minutes. The minutes we 
     <lb/>
     were asked to keep confidential. You understand 
     <lb/>
     in committees of that kind how embarrassing it 
     <lb/>
     would be for these things to get in the press, just 
     <lb/>
     at committee stage. We were at the committee 
     <lb/>
     stage — these Black Books are the ultimate find<lb break="no"/>ings of all committees. Anything not included in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Books, I take it, the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not want to include. If I understand it 
     <lb/>
     correctly, anything we had in our minor reports 
     <lb/>
     or minutes, we were actually asked to destroy 
     <lb/>
     before we left, except the official report of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation; and as Mr. Smallwood has said, the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books do contain in the main, I would say, 
     <lb/>
     the greater percentage of all the discussions and 
     <lb/>
     all talks. There are no secrets as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, but we all agreed that the across the 
     <lb/>
     table discussions would be kept to ourselves. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the discussions between the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland delegation and the Canadian 
     <lb/>government are literally or substantially con<lb break="no"/>tained in the Black Books, does not that of itself 
     <lb/>put beyond question any suggestion that the 
     <lb/>Canadian government ever intended them to 
     <lb/>remain secret? If they were to be secret and 
     <lb/>withheld from members of the Convention, why 
     <lb/>would they be incorporated in books which were 
     <lb/>sent for distribution to members of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion?

     it was now here to be made available and he saw

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I made the point very clear if 
     <lb/>
     there is a slight difference between the semi-of<lb break="no"/>ficial and the official; the official is what is in the

     Black Book. There is only one case of that which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins referred to. The point is, it may be 
     <lb/>
     found redundant and unnecessary, in the sense 
    

            <cb/>
            

     that the Black Book contains information which 
     <lb/>
     might overlap. Against that, by making this in<lb break="no"/>formation available, it eliminates or dissipates 
     <lb/>
     any suggestion that the information is being im<lb break="no"/>properly withheld. Therefore I ask the three

     That is the clause. I will confess to you frankly 
     <lb/>
     that as I am not a war veteran myself, and al<lb break="no"/>though I did attend the meetings of the committee 
     <lb/>
     on veterans' affairs of the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     which conferred with the Canadian committee ... 
     <lb/>
     I made an honest attempt to understand it, but it 
     <lb/>
     is highly complicated — there was the Veterans' 
     <lb/>
     Charter all outlined, rehabilitation and pensions 
     <lb/>
     scheme, all highly complicated.... The thing I was 
   

            <cb/>
       

     most interested in was the Veterans' Land Act, 
     <lb/>
     that would apply very much here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and might prove very beneficial. I 
     <lb/>
     tried to understand that above everything else.

     Between Mr. Ashbourne, Mr. Ballam and Mr.

     nel in Canada and Newfoundland. There is a note 
     <lb/>
     which says some of the benefits listed might have 
     <lb/>
     expired. I do not know if it is necessary to run 
     <lb/>
     over the differences between the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Canadian allowances. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> On the first note which says, "Some 
     <lb/>of the Canadian benefits listed might have ex<lb break="no"/>pired before union and others would require ad<lb break="no"/>justment for Newfoundland ex-servicemen", 
     <lb/>could your delegation tell me how many have

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> As to the difference between 
     <lb/>the Canadian and Newfoundland pension, in 
     <lb/>several cases they are similar. The point raised by 
     <lb/>Mr. Northcott as regards pensions of $900 a year 
     <lb/>for 100% disability, I think it is the same, with 
     <lb/>the exception that under the Pensions Act of 
     <lb/>1935, I do not think an ex-serviceman in New<lb break="no"/>foundland can receive anything for children born 
     <lb/>after the last of May, 1934; whereas, under the 
     <lb/>Canadian act he is permitted a pension or some 
     <lb/>allowance, I believe, up to l944. There is that 
     <lb/>difference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is there any great difference be<lb break="no"/>tween the benefits veterans in Canada get and

     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think in general, 
     <lb/>
     I have been talking to some veterans who have 
     <lb/>
     gone into this, there does not seem to be, in their 
     <lb/>
     opinion, there does not seem to be very much 
     <lb/>
     difference between the Canadian act and our 
     <lb/>
     own. There might have been a greater discharge 
     <lb/>
     or demobilisation pay from Canada, but that has 
     <lb/>
     been already availed of, and they would not get 
     <lb/>
     any extra or back pay. That is settled and done 
     <lb/>
     with. You have a period, I don't know how long 
     <lb/>
     it is, 18 months or something, to avail of your 
     <lb/>
     transition, or to take any vocational training. In 
     <lb/>
     Canada that is somewhat longer. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand where the Canadian taking a course, attend<lb break="no"/>ing university is allowed, I don't know whether 
     <lb/>
     it is $60 or $80 a month while they are there, the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland act here allows either $10 or $20 
     <lb/>
     a month more, but there is not a great difference 
     <lb/>
     in the whole thing. As I understand it it is pretty 
     <lb/>
     well identical, and those pensions that Mr. 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
       

     Northcott was asking about, that is the same thing 
     <lb/>
     as he quoted for Newfoundland, it is the same 
     <lb/>
     thing in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, we have here 
     <lb/>
     the public accounts of the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     for last year, and I have opened at the page which 
     <lb/>
     shows the Department of Veterans' Affairs, 
     <lb/>
     which shows the expenditures made. The expen<lb break="no"/>diture last year $401,707,964.26 or roughly $402 
     <lb/>
     million. Now there are some sub-headings of 
     <lb/>
     that, for example.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, it is not a point of 
     <lb/>
     order, and I don't want to interrupt Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, but I fail to see how these huge 
     <lb/>
     figures of payments in Canada are going to give 
     <lb/>
     any benefit to us here. It seems to me it is just a 
     <lb/>
     waste of time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Someone just asked how much 
     <lb/>
     was being spent, and I was hoping as I read these 
     <lb/>
     that whoever asked it would come across the 
     <lb/>
     items for which he asked. And so it goes on for 
     <lb/>
     30 or 40 pages. I would not dream of reading 
     <lb/>
     them all. One million for this and three million 
     <lb/>
     for that, 30 or 40 million for something else, and 
     <lb/>
     the total expenditure is $400 million odd, spent 
     <lb/>
     by the Government of Canada for the year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The point is whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     re-establishment credits on page 76 are not ex<lb break="no"/>cluded from Newfoundlanders who served 
     <lb/>
     during the war in branches of the services other 
     <lb/>
     than the Canadian services under the note or 
     <lb/>
     exceptions to section 2. I read section 2 as apply<lb break="no"/>ing to Newfoundland veterans, but in addition, 
     <lb/>
     under Canadian law, Newfoundland veterans 
     <lb/>
     who served with them in World War II, will, by 
     <lb/>
     reason of their new status as Canadian citizens, 
     <lb/>
     be eligible for use of re-establishment credits on 
     <lb/>
     the same basis as other Canadian veterans. But 
     <lb/>
     the point raised by Mr. Hollett and Mr. Hickman 
     <lb/>
     is that these re-establishment credits set forth on 
     <lb/>
     page 76, volume 2 of the Black Book, would not 
     <lb/>
     apply to Newfoundland veterans who did not 
     <lb/>
     serve in the Canadian forces during World War II.

     <lb/>Canada this has been extended up to May 30,

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Allowances for veterans 60 years of age

     they have the information that there is no known

     <lb/>
     a special permanent grant under the GWVA and

     Department of Public Health and Welfare. That 
     <lb/>
     is the parallel. It is surprising that you did not

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> We knew that, but it is not an act.

     If they have a case like this in Newfoundland they

     them, but we have no known parallel in this

     country for that section. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point, Mr. Ballam, is that

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As a matter of relief?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But in Canada it is a matter of 
     <lb/>
     statutory law. That's the difference. Yes, in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I suppose we are allowed to mention 
     <lb/>
     Canada. That is the very point we are discussing. 
     <lb/>
     Is the case in Canada, in such cases as that, 
     <lb/>
     paralleled in Newfoundland? Mr. Hollett says it 
     <lb/>
     is paralleled in Newfoundland, and has tried to 
     <lb/>
     prove that by saying that a burned-out war 
     <lb/>
     veteran, if he goes to the GWVA or the NPA and 
     <lb/>
     gets them to take up his case and go to the 
     <lb/>
     government and fight it out with them, may or 
     <lb/>
     may not get him a grant, and that's parallelling 
     <lb/>
     the mandatory statutory legislation of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     There is no parallel at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I put it to you, sir, that such a case 
     <lb/>
     has not got to fight it out with the GWVA or the 
     <lb/>
     NPA: they fight it out for him with the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They are the agent, like the veterans' as<lb break="no"/>sociation in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except this, under Canadian law 
     <lb/>
     he gets it as a matter of right, and here he gets it 
     <lb/>
     as a matter of case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In this country it is a matter of right 
     <lb/>
     if it can be proved that his case warrants it. I am 
     <lb/>
     not trying to prove that our veterans are getting 
     <lb/>
     more than they should. That is the parallel to this 
     <lb/>
     war veterans' allowance here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> May I ask Mr. Hollett a question, 
     <lb/>
     please? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. This bill is being piloted if 
     <lb/>
     you will, this measure, by Mr. Smallwood. If you 
     <lb/>
     want to address to Mr. Smallwood, and Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett feels like answering the question, that's all 
     <lb/>
     right, but you can't do it otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> Mr. Smallwood, have you to be a 
     <lb/>
     member of the GWVA to get into a hospital just 
     <lb/>
     like the Merchant Navy Hospital here in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't think so. The GWVA is 
     <lb/>
     one of the finest bodies in the whole country, 
     <lb/>
     doing a magnificent voluntary work, taking up 
     <lb/>
     every case that it can possibly take up amongst 
     <lb/>
     veterans, and doing the best it can do in their 
     <lb/>
     behalf with the government of the country. They 
     <lb/>
     succeed in many cases, and fail in many other 
     <lb/>
     cases. They never fail through any fault of their 
     <lb/>
     own, it is through the fault of the government, 
     <lb/>
     because here is a case in point that we are now 
     <lb/>
     discussing, the case of the burned-out veterans. I 
     <lb/>
     did not invent that word "burned-out", it seems 
   

            <pb n="925"

     to be current, it seems to be used in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     it means war veterans who, because of their war 
     <lb/>
     service, because of what they went through, are 
     <lb/>
     just burned out now. You can't put a scientific 
     <lb/>
     name on it maybe, but they are burned-out 
     <lb/>
     veterans.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of order. I thought

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well that's one on me. As I 
     <lb/>
     understand it a "woroner", or a "burned-out 
     <lb/>
     veteran", using both terms, is a man who, because 
     <lb/>
     of his service, not because he lost a limb, but in 
     <lb/>
     some way it renders a man incapable of doing the 
     <lb/>
     work that he would have been able to do, if he 
     <lb/>
     had not gone through the hell that he did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> It is not in the Grey Book or in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, it is in the dictionary, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. Am I only allowed the right to use the 
     <lb/>
     words in the Black Book? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The phraseology of this House 
     <lb/>
     is not going to be confined to the Black Book. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The dictionary has over a mil<lb break="no"/>lion words, and I think I am entitled to use any 
     <lb/>one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Could we include the members of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention in the burned-out veterans? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If we are here much longer 
     <lb/>some of us will be burned out! 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You can get ready to include me 
     <lb/>
     right away! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Anyway, that sort of relieved 
     <lb/>
     the tension, sir. According to the Black Book, in 
     <lb/>
     Canada there is a law, a statute which provides 
     <lb/>
     for them, and it is theirs by right, by law. In 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland I have no doubt that such cases in 
  

            <cb/>
         

     some instances have received some kind of com<lb break="no"/>pensation, but it is not theirs by right or by law. 
     <lb/>
     Some of them get it, and some don't. I know men 
     <lb/>
     myself, and I have no doubt that other men know 
     <lb/>
     war veterans in this country, of World War I, who 
     <lb/>
     are "woroners" or "burned-out".

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, worn out or burned-out, 
     <lb/>
     we all know men like that. You can't put your 
     <lb/>
     finger on it, you can only say that man is like he 
     <lb/>
     is because of the hell he went through in the war. 
     <lb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of course. But that man is not

     <lb/>That is all that clause says.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now to get back to where we

     The next is War Veterans' Allowance, and I 
     <lb/>
     think we went over that. There is an allowance

     this. In my district we have several returned

     in connection with war benefits. Does that apply 
     <lb/>
     here now? In Canada they get benefits up to 60 
     <lb/>
     years of age; in Newfoundland they get nothing?

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That point of Mr. Butt's is rather

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What kind of nonsense is that? 
     <lb/>
     What kind of trash and nonsense is it in fact? Here 
     <lb/>
     is a law in Canada which, as I pointed out before, 
     <lb/>
     may be interpreted generously, or in a mean and 
     <lb/>
     niggardly spirit. Canada is not noted for treating 
     <lb/>
     her veterans in a mean and niggardly spirit, she 
     <lb/>
     is noted for treating them generously. Because 
     <lb/>
     the act says "may" and not "shall", shall we 
     <lb/>
     interpret it as being in a mean and niggardly spirit 
     <lb/>
     that that will be carried out?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Mr. Chairman, I assume no such thing, 
     <lb/>
     and I would not dream of doing any such thing. I 
     <lb/>
     think Canada is a great nation, and anything I say 
     <lb/>
     is not anti-Canada. I admit quite freely that they 
     <lb/>
     have done great things for their veterans, and for 
     <lb/>
     their citizens for that matter. I admit that, but I do 
     <lb/>
     want to find out the truth of it. Here we have a 
     <lb/>
     known parallel, but it is not put down in an act. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Well, that's questioned as to 
     <lb/>whether or not we have that parallel. Of course 
     <lb/>the GWVA and the NPA as has been pointed out, 
     <lb/>has certain provisions for men who apply for 
     <lb/>them, but in this veterans' charter, sir, which is a 
     <lb/>book of 300 and some pages, the members can 
     <lb/>readily see the very same words as has already 
     <lb/>been read here, or printed here. I will just re<lb break="no"/>iterate them for members to check against them. 
     <lb/>"In Canada may receive an allowance." Well, 
     <lb/>then he may receive the allowance. That is for the 
     <lb/>veterans' allowance, and that is the law in 
     <lb/>Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> And the word is "may", and that's the 
     <lb/>
     right word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The point is that in statutory law 
     <lb/>
     "may" is permissible, and "shall" is mandatory. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore Mr. Butt takes the position that there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing mandatory in there. Therefore the point 
    

            <cb/>
      

     for which he contends is that the act from which 
     <lb/>
     you have quoted is not mandatory at all, and in 
     <lb/>
     its operations it is purely discretionary.

     order to protect themselves against cases which 
     <lb/>
     may be an abuse. They have to use the word. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> If that's the word they had to 
     <lb/>use, and it is there, I presume it is right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Butt's point is simply this: 
     <lb/>
     that it must not be assumed that that action shall 
     <lb/>
     be applied. Quite obviously the word "may" is 
     <lb/>
     used to permit investigation, and if, upon inves<lb break="no"/>tigation it is found that there is no fraud employed 
     <lb/>
     then the matter I presume will, as a matter of fact. 
     <lb/>
     be granted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I really don't like to have an opinion I 
     <lb/>
     give called trash and nonsense. In this particular 
     <lb/>
     case, according to what you just mentioned now. 
     <lb/>
     I even knew what I was talking about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, before you leave 
     <lb/>
     that point may I also point out that in the case of 
     <lb/>
     a veteran who has reached the age of 60 years, or 
     <lb/>
     a veteran of any age who, because of his dis<lb break="no"/>abilities is not... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> From what are you quoting? 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> From the War Veterans' Allowance 
     <lb/>Act, 1930, clauses 1 and 2. The point I want to 
     <lb/>make is that in this country it is not necessary that 
     <lb/>he must have served in a theatre of war, or that 
     <lb/>he has been wounded, but if he makes application 
     <lb/>to the GWVA they must take up his case in 
     <lb/>conjunction with the NPA with the Department 
     <lb/>of Public Health and Welfare, which treats the 
     <lb/>case on its merits. That is why I objected to there 
     <lb/>being no parallel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point is that there are cer<lb break="no"/>tain conditions precedent in Canada which have 
     <lb/>
     to be got over, which do not apply in New<lb break="no"/>foundland at all? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> For example, you make the 
     <lb/>
     point that he must have served 15 months over<lb break="no"/>seas, or must have been wounded, before he 
     <lb/>
     could qualify? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> But here, without reference to 
     <lb/>
     the fact of whether he served overseas or not, 
     <lb/>
     whether he lost a limb or not, pensions may and 
     <lb/>
     have been granted where his case has been spon<lb break="no"/>sored by the GWVA and the NPA, as the case 
     <lb/>
     may be.

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, I mean over 60 years of age. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if Mr. Hollett has any 
     <lb/>statistics from the GWVA or the NPA or the 
     <lb/>government showing what number have received 
     <lb/>it and what number have not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't see how that would mat<lb break="no"/>ter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, it makes a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     difference if there is no legislation whatever in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland on the matter, and men get it or 
     <lb/>
     do not get it depending on the efforts made in 
     <lb/>
     their behalf by the GWVA or the NPA; and if it 
     <lb/>
     should be the case that 1% get it and 99% don't, 
     <lb/>
     or 99% get it and 1% don't, there would be a good 
     <lb/>
     deal of difference in the situation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you take the stand that the

     percentage of applications actually sponsored

     and put through by the government, that might 
     <lb/>
     have some bearing upon it, but as far as bringing 
     <lb/>
     actual figures into it, the number of people who 
     <lb/>
     have received pensions through the good offices 
     <lb/>
     of the war veterans or the NPA would mean 
     <lb/>
     absolutely nothing at all.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> But they would not be 60 years of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think I may be permitted, as a

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would say that you are any<lb break="no"/>thing but burned out, Major! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, that is what we are termed 
     <lb/>
     here this afternoon — a burned-out soldier. We 
     <lb/>
     have gone through this Veterans' Act of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and we have tried to make some comparisons 
     <lb/>
     between that and Newfoundland, and we are 
     <lb/>
     squabbling over it whether Newfoundland is bet<lb break="no"/>ter or Canada is better. It is immaterial to me as 
     <lb/>
     far as I am concerned because I am not personally 
     <lb/>
     affected, but Mr. Starkes says that there are 
     <lb/>
     people down in his district on the dole, and I am 
     <lb/>
     telling you they are on the dole in Montreal. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> And not getting any pension? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And not getting any pension in 
     <lb/>Montreal either, and I know what I am talking 
   

            <cb/>
          

     about. And when you talk about this thing you 
     <lb/>
     are talking to one of these burned-out soldiers 
     <lb/>
     who knows something about it, and if you had 
     <lb/>
     been a burned-out soldier you might have known 
     <lb/>
     as well. We have gone through it this afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     and I think we have a fairly good idea what the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian act is, and what the Newfoundland act 
     <lb/>
     is, and we are wasting a lot of time when we 
     <lb/>
     should be getting on to something more construc<lb break="no"/>tive. I think we should consider that part of the 
     <lb/>
     Veterans' Act as read. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except for the fact that Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins proposed, and he was backed by Mr. Watton 
     <lb/>
     as a war veteran, and Mr. Watton was particularly 
     <lb/>
     anxious to have a comparison made of both situa<lb break="no"/>tions, and therefore, to facilitate both Mr. Watton 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Higgins I suggested to Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>
     that he might go along in the way in which he is 
     <lb/>
     going; but if the House feels it is a waste of time 
     <lb/>
     it is perfectly all right with me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is wasting time anyhow, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It was not my intention that all 
     <lb/>
     should be read, but that Mr. Ashbourne might tell 
     <lb/>
     us if page 84 applied, and so forth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, that was your proposal. 
     <lb/>
     Could we get a compromise between the two? 
     <lb/>
     Would it be too much to ask you Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>
     if you could perhaps speed things up by not 
     <lb/>
     reading all the comments on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     page? Could you perhaps paraphrase a little? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That is not an easy thing to do, 
     <lb/>but I will try. I might leave out something that 
     <lb/>some war veterans were trying to get at. There 
     <lb/>are a few other items here. Medical care and 
     <lb/>treatment is next. I don't know if members wish 
     <lb/>me to go over that or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It is about the same I think, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The whole thing is about the same. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> "All veterans may receive 
     <lb/>treatment for any disability arising within one 
     <lb/>year of discharge." Now the next is about the 
     <lb/>same. The next is land settlement. It is rather a 
     <lb/>little different in the land settlement, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I enquired about our 
     <lb/>
     land settlement scheme, and I am willing to admit 
     <lb/>
     that the Canadian one is a good bit better than 
     <lb/>
     ours, because Canada is of course an agricultural 
     <lb/>
     country. I am thinking now of the operations 
     <lb/>
     going on up on the west coast. I am prepared to 
 

            <pb n="931"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-02_Page_0931.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">931</fw>
         

     admit that it looks to me that the land settlement 
     <lb/>
     in Canada is slightly better, but to what extent I 
     <lb/>
     am not prepared to go. You know the government 
     <lb/>
     granted an amount up to $4,500 up on the west 
     <lb/>
     coast. They will clear in the first instance ten 
     <lb/>
     acres of land, and they will clear that gratis, and 
     <lb/>
     by the time the whole scheme is through the 
     <lb/>
     veterans will own 50 acres of cleared land and 
     <lb/>
     will have a house. The government provides a 
     <lb/>
     house and barn partially built and he finishes it, 
     <lb/>
     and he will have certain equipment and certain 
     <lb/>
     live stock. It is not so bad even for poor little 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to point out that 
     <lb/>
     under that Veterans' Land Act it is not only 
     <lb/>
     farmers who receive benefits, but fishermen also, 
     <lb/>
     on equal terms with farmers. A veteran who is a 
     <lb/>
     fisherman may receive under the act grants and 
     <lb/>
     loans and assistance for acquiring a home, a boat, 
     <lb/>
     an engine, fishery gear, etc. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is a loan? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, no, that is veterans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is a loan under the Farm Loan 
     <lb/>
     Act. For fishermen it is also a loan isn't it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, no. Under the Veterans' 
     <lb/>
     Land Act veterans who are fishing and not farm<lb break="no"/>ing may receive on equal terms with veterans 
     <lb/>
     who are farmers, benefits under the act, the only 
     <lb/>
     difference being that the equipment and material 
     <lb/>
     that they acquire under the act are for fishing 
     <lb/>
     purposes and not for farming purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> But it is a loan is it not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, no. There are loans also, 
     <lb/>
     but there are outright grants. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your question, Mr. Watton, is 
     <lb/>
     whether or not there is something of a com<lb break="no"/>parable nature in Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> I think that a veteran gets ... well, 
     <lb/>
     it is up to $700 in Newfoundland for a veteran 
     <lb/>
     who wants to go fishing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> It is $700 in Newfoundland. "A 
     <lb/>
     qualified veteran settling on provincial land ... 
     <lb/>
     may receive a grant ... for building material ... 
     <lb/>
     etc." As he said, the fishermen might figure in 
     <lb/>
     under that as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I will read the clause. I 
     <lb/>
     just found it this minute. It is the Veterans' Land 
     <lb/>
     Act. That is in the case of lending war veterans 
     <lb/>
     up to $6,000 for fishery purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Just to keep the records clear, I think 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Hollett said $4,500 a minute ago. I would 
    

            <cb/>
      

     point out that their estimated figure for the Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook area was $1.8 million for 300 full-time 
     <lb/>
     settlers. That means $6,000 that the government 
     <lb/>
     is to spend for a person in Newfoundland, as I 
     <lb/>
     understand it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is right, but the government 
     <lb/>
     will still clear the other 40 acres for them, and that 
     <lb/>
     takes up the balance. In connection with that 
     <lb/>
     point of fishing, under the Veterans' Land Act: 
     <lb/>
     "Those who have had practical experience in 
     <lb/>
     commercial fishing, whose normal occupation is 
     <lb/>
     in that industry, and who wish to ... officially 
     <lb/>
     certified"; I have the list who applied. I do admit 
     <lb/>
     that the Land Settlement Act in Canada is better 
     <lb/>
     than we have here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Ashbourne then read the time limits apply<lb break="no"/>ing to various benefits in Canada and New<lb break="no"/>foundland.]</hi>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In view of the fact that I presume 
     <lb/>
     that the debate from this time on will be on the

     <lb/>
     is pretty well a quarter to six, I propose to rise the 
     <lb/>
     committee until 8 o'clock: or if members want to 
     <lb/>
     open the debate on the financial aspects, they may 
     <lb/>
     do so.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Might I ask one question about the last 
     <lb/>
     clause: "General Benefits: Newfoundland mer<lb break="no"/>chant seamen, like other Canadian merchant 
     <lb/>
     seamen, will be eligible for Unemployment In<lb break="no"/>surance, and Merchant Seamen's Compensa<lb break="no"/>tion." That, I understand, is contributory. The 
     <lb/>
     unemployment insurance, I know, is con<lb break="no"/>tributory. As regards merchant seamen, I am not 
     <lb/>
     sure. I was wondering if Mr. Smallwood could 
     <lb/>
     give us any information as to whether that is 
     <lb/>
     contributory. I know our ships will be taxed for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose in dealing with that fund; to what 
     <lb/>
     extent, I do not know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am afraid Mr. Job has missed 
     <lb/>
     the point of that clause with respect to unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment insurance for merchant seamen. That means 
     <lb/>
     this: merchant seamen are defined as men who 
     <lb/>
     served in the war zone or the danger zone. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, that is the term. Merchant 
     <lb/>
     seamen who served in dangerous waters are 
     <lb/>
     treated, as far as unemployment insurance is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, exactly as though they had been soldiers 
     <lb/>
     or sailors or airmen. That is to say, for the period 
     <lb/>
     they served since June 30, 1941, they are treated 
     <lb/>
     as though they had been working in an insurable

     occupation and the premiums that would have 
     <lb/>
     been paid in by them and by their employer and 
     <lb/>
     by the government are now all paid by the 
     <lb/>
     government; so they have been fully insured 
     <lb/>
     against unemployment for that whole period. If 
     <lb/>
     they become unemployed, once they had been 
     <lb/>
     working 15 weeks after the war is over ... they are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to unemployment insurance benefits 
     <lb/>
     based ont he length of time the premium pay<lb break="no"/>ments were made while serving in the war. I think 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Job is dealing with a different matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He is speaking of the merchant 
     <lb/>
     seamen's compensation. He has advanced the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that these insurance funds are con<lb break="no"/>tributory in nature and he asks the respective 
     <lb/>
     proportions in which contributions are made, by 
     <lb/>
     the government, by the shipowner and by the 
     <lb/>
     crew member.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> My answer is, none. The whole 
     <lb/>
     amount is paid by the government in respect of 
     <lb/>
     the period after June 30, 1941, during which the 
     <lb/>
     merchant seamen was occupied in dangerous 
     <lb/>
     waters.... There is a Merchant Seamen's Act. I

     not realize it applied only to war veterans. I

     now come to the point where we are ready to

     begin to discuss and debate the financial side of 
     <lb/>
     the confederation terms or basis of union — the 
     <lb/>
     financial side and taxation, generally. In view of 
     <lb/>
     our discussion last night, we might agree to con<lb break="no"/>fine ourselves, to start with, to the question of 
     <lb/>
     what revenue the Government of Canada would 
     <lb/>
     probably collect from Newfoundland if we be<lb break="no"/>came a province and also what money the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada would spend in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. So I would ask the members to turn to 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book, page 15, Annex IV. The headline 
     <lb/>
     says, "Probable Federal Revenues And Expendi<lb break="no"/>tures With Respect To Newfoundland."

    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Before we move on, I would like to

     That is the reading of it. If I could be per<lb break="no"/>mitted, perhaps I might be able to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks. What we have here is an estimate made 
     <lb/>
     by the Government of Canada of how much it 
     <lb/>
     would collect from the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in taxes and how much money they would spend 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland under one heading or another. 
     <lb/>
     What we are going to deal with is their estimate 
     <lb/>
     of how much money they would collect from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. This estimate was made not by 
     <lb/>
     government members. It was made by financial 
     <lb/>
     authorities, experts, employed by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada in the Department of Finance and 
     <lb/>
     the Bank of Canada.... We met some of them — 
     <lb/>
     Mr. M.W. Sharp, who sat in with us, a man with 
     <lb/>
     a mind which you would rarely meet with in this 
     <lb/>
     life, with a wealth of information at the tips of his 
   

            <cb/>
       

     fingers. We met also, from the Bank of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. J. Coyne and Mr. A.D. Skelton; and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Watts, who has visited Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     who is the author of some of the economic data 
     <lb/>
     appearing in the book of Dr. MacKay; also 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Weeks. These estimates were made by those 
     <lb/>
     men — top-notch economists depended upon by 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada in its own financial 
     <lb/>
     and economic affairs.... They made estimates 
     <lb/>
     based on two kinds of information — one, the 
     <lb/>
     information which the Ottawa delegation fur<lb break="no"/>nished, and two, the information they had 
     <lb/>
     gathered throughout the years from the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Finance and the Auditor General. They 
     <lb/>
     had made a study of Newfoundland conditions 
     <lb/>
     and public affairs, and Newfoundland trade and 
     <lb/>
     commerce. One of the most important sources of 
     <lb/>
     information was the Canadian Department of 
     <lb/>
     Trade and Commerce which is represented here 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Britton, Trade Commissioner.... They 
     <lb/>
     have a most intimate knowledge of our trade and 
     <lb/>
     commerce.... They have an exactitude of 
     <lb/>
     knowledge about our trade that I imagine no one 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland possesses today. Of course, it 
     <lb/>
     is their job. They have that same type of informa<lb break="no"/>tion about other countries with whom they do 
     <lb/>
     business. On the basis of all this information, the 
     <lb/>
     experts have made these estimates of what 
     <lb/>
     revenue the government of Canada would get 
     <lb/>
     from the people of Newfoundland if we became 
     <lb/>
     a province. I want to draw your attention par<lb break="no"/>ticularly to the first couple of lines of the third 
     <lb/>
     paragraph, their calculations of what they would

     present rates of federal taxation. Neither as<lb break="no"/>sumption is realistic yet there is no way of 
     <lb/>allowing for or measuring future changes. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>Now, in simple language, that means this: if 
     <lb/>things continue as they are now in New<lb break="no"/>foundland; and if the rates of taxation charged by 
     <lb/>the Government of Canada stay as they are now; 
     <lb/>then they estimate they would collect 
     <lb/>$20,185,000 a year from Newfoundland. But 
     <lb/>they go on to say that neither assumption is 
     <lb/>realistic. It is not realistic to go on the assumption 
     <lb/>that the present level of economic activity in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland will continue. It is not realistic to 
     <lb/>take it for granted that the rates of taxation in 
     <lb/>Canada will stay as they are now. There is a very 
     <lb/>good reason for that. Three different times since 
     <lb/>the war came to an end the Government of 
     <lb/>Canada has reduced its rates of taxation. And it 
     <lb/>is not realistic to say that their present rates of 
     <lb/>taxation will stay as high as they are now. The 
     <lb/>realistic assumption is they will fall, and also our 
     <lb/>present level of economic activities will fall 
     <lb/>somewhere below where they are now. If they do 
     <lb/>not ... they estimate they will collect from New<lb break="no"/>foundland $20 million per year in Canadian 
     <lb/>government taxation. I think that is all I want to 
     <lb/>say at this moment. I am sure my friend Major 
     <lb/>Cashin and others will want to make their con<lb break="no"/>tribution to this particular part of the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I suppose it is all right, after hearing 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood tell us about those famous 
     <lb/>people who compiled these estimates, to venture 
     <lb/>an opinion that they are 20% out. The total in<lb break="no"/>come taxes, death duties, etc., collected last year 
     <lb/>was $10.5 million. According to these estimates 
     <lb/>the federal government is going to get ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $11 million. Under our income tax 
     <lb/>laws, a single man is exempt up to $l,000. He 
     <lb/>does not pay on less than $ 1,000. Under Canadian 
     <lb/>law he pays if he earns $750. A man with $1,000 
     <lb/>income in Newfoundland pays income tax on 
     <lb/>$250. How many people will be found in New<lb break="no"/>foundland not paying income tax today, who will 
     <lb/>be paying under federal legislation? The same 
     <lb/>thing applies to married persons. In New<lb break="no"/>foundland a married man is exempt up to $2,000. 
     <lb/>If I may be allowed to express a view — I take it, 
     <lb/>with so many experts, you have to have permis<lb break="no"/>sion to express a view — the amount the 
     <lb/>Canadian government will collect on income tax, 
     <lb/>corporation tax and death duties will be $14 

            <cb/>
          

     million. Consequently our experts were out $2 
     <lb/>
     million. I am rather nervous in saying it — we 
     <lb/>
     have so many doctors and so forth associated 
     <lb/>
     with this thing here — but some of them were 
     <lb/>
     guessing. I note that the Ottawa delegation puts 
     <lb/>
     it higher than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> A compliment to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No compliment to them, and I know 
     <lb/>
     something about Newfoundland expenditures 
     <lb/>
     and revenues. Customs and import duties; they 
     <lb/>
     say $2 million. The delegation says $3 million. 
     <lb/>
     They are again higher. With all their information, 
     <lb/>
     they do not check properly. I have taken the 
     <lb/>
     trouble to get some information on the basis of 
     <lb/>
     actual imports l946-47.... On liquor and tobacco 
     <lb/>
     alone, the customs duty would be twice the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian estimate.... I would say that the federal 
     <lb/>
     government customs will go to $9 million. They 
     <lb/>
     can send down their experts, and let them go over 
     <lb/>
     it with our experts, and see where they fit. I say 
     <lb/>
     they guessed it. Then again, sales tax, 8%.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think Major Cashin has not 
     <lb/>noticed the sales tax — one is provincial and the 
     <lb/>other is federal. The federal sales tax is collected 
     <lb/>by them at the source, from the manufacturer. It 
     <lb/>is not a retail sales tax. Major Cashin knows why 
     <lb/>that is.

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We are importing goods from the 
     <lb/>
     United States that cost $20 million. They arrive 
     <lb/>
     here and we pay 10% duty. We pay freight 8%. 
     <lb/>
     Is it on $20 million in the United States or on the 
     <lb/>
     landed cost in Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The figure he is putting is a 
     <lb/>
     hypothetical one. If we have free trade with 
     <lb/>
     Canada we are not going to pay duty from the 
     <lb/>
     United States. If we can get the goods from 
     <lb/>
     Canada free of duty we will get them there. If we 
     <lb/>
     import $20 million, pay Canadian customs duties 
     <lb/>
     on it, the federal sales tax is on the landed cost, 
     <lb/>
     landed in Newfoundland.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You are putting sales tax on

     barrel duty. We consume 100,000 barrels of pork 
     <lb/>
     and beef in Newfoundland, on which we would 
     <lb/>
     pay $6 a barrel; $600,000 for one item alone in 
     <lb/>
     duty. That is to protect the Canadian packers in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. They have local industries in Canada 
     <lb/>
      and they protect them. They protect them by 
     <lb/>
     putting 3 cents a pound on pork and beef. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are a bit ahead of our job. I feel, and I think 
     <lb/>
     we discussed it at a private meeting, that in order 
     <lb/>
     to get down to brass tacks we have to have before 
     <lb/>
     us an idea of how the Province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would operate — what the revenue and what the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure will be. We are not interested so 
     <lb/>
     much in how much the federal government is 
     <lb/>
     going to collect, as how we are going to run the 
     <lb/>
     province when she goes into confederation. Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa should prepare a proper report. This report 
     <lb/>
     is incomplete. It does not point out the sources of 
     <lb/>
     revenue we are going to collect taxes from. It 
     <lb/>
     does not point out the expenditures we are going 
     <lb/>
     to have as a province. And until such time as we 
     <lb/>
     know from a provincial standpoint where we are 
     <lb/>
     going, we cannot intelligently discuss the whole 
     <lb/>
     situation. We ought to defer discussion on these 
     <lb/>
     figures. They had experts in Canada; who are the 
     <lb/>
     experts in Newfoundland? Were they consulted 
     <lb/>
     to corroborate this? It is out at least 20%. I think 
     <lb/>
     before we go any further we should have a con<lb break="no"/>ference with the Finance Department and the 
     <lb/>
     Assessor and the Customs Department as to 
     <lb/>
     whether these figures are accurate. This is from 
     <lb/>
     Canada. We have to know from New<lb break="no"/>foundland....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Does Mr. Cashin think that the 
     <lb/>
     experts employed by the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland are better equipped, more competent 
     <lb/>
     to make a financial report than are the financial 
     <lb/>

     based on the Canadian income tax law, the total

            <cb/>
       

     Ottawa officially and there has been exchange of 
     <lb/>
     information back and forth — ordinary inter-cus<lb break="no"/>toms departmental procedure. But when it comes 
     <lb/>
     to the question of estimating the nature and 
     <lb/>
     volume of commercial transactions, I would say 
     <lb/>
     that, admirable as are some and many of our 
     <lb/>
     officials, they have not got the data. The depart<lb break="no"/>ment is not big enough. We have no economic 
     <lb/>
     research. We have no Department of Trade and 
     <lb/>
     Commerce. In our Department of Customs and 
     <lb/>
     Finance, we have a small staff. It is not fair to 
     <lb/>
     expect that they should be as competent to assess 
     <lb/>
     these matters and estimate on them as the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Research Department of the Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the Department of Finance of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we become a province of Canada, our trade 
     <lb/>
     is going to be different from what it is now and 
     <lb/>
     from what it has been in the past, as regards the 
     <lb/>
     source of our goods. We have imported in the past 
     <lb/>
     from the United Kingdom, from Canada, from 
     <lb/>
     the United States and roughly speaking, take the 
     <lb/>
     years 1900-l938 ... on the average this country 
     <lb/>
     imported roughly one-third of its goods from 
     <lb/>
     each of them. That is in normal times and under 
     <lb/>
     normal conditions, Newfoundland having her 
     <lb/>
     own customs tariffs and running her own affairs. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as a province becomes an entirely 
     <lb/>
     different country from the standpoint of tariffs 
     <lb/>
     and consequently from the standpoint of where 
     <lb/>
     she buys her goods. With free trade between the 
     <lb/>
     mainland and Newfoundland, we will naturally 
     <lb/>
     buy from Canada duty free all that we need that 
     <lb/>
     she has to spare. If she has not got them to spare, 
     <lb/>
     any businessman will import from wherever he 
     <lb/>
     can get them. When he does. he will pay taxation 
     <lb/>
     at the Canadian rate of duty — if there is a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian rate of duty. According to Chadwick 
     <lb/>
     and Jones, ....25% is the average rate of duty on 
     <lb/>
     everything coming into this island. It is higher if 
     <lb/>
     you take only goods paying 40% and 50% 
     <lb/>
     average duty. Take the same things in Canada and 
     <lb/>
     take all the imports into the Dominion, ... and 
     <lb/>
     what does it run to? 10% as against 25% in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Approximately half of all the 
     <lb/>
     imports that come into Canada, come in duty 
     <lb/>
     free.... If Newfoundland were a province and any 
     <lb/>
     importer bought goods from the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom or the United States, he would pay the 
     <lb/>
     current rate of duty on them, if there was a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian rate of duty. if there was no duty, they

     would come into Newfoundland free of duty. 
     <lb/>
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Point of order. We are not discuss<lb break="no"/>ing the Canadian tariff; we are trying to discuss 
     <lb/>this federal estimate of the revenue which the 
     <lb/>federal government would get. I held, and I think 
     <lb/>I am in order, that these figures are not correct. 
     <lb/>They should be corrected by the Assessor of 
     <lb/>Taxes, and also by the Secretary of Customs who 
     <lb/>is also a competent gentleman. Let us see if these 
     <lb/>Canadian officials made a proper survey of our 
     <lb/>situation.... Maybe they are guessing here. I have 
     <lb/>just as much right to guess. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The only point is this: we would 
     <lb/>
     have to go a step further and see the way these 
     <lb/>
     figures have to be checked. These figures are 
     <lb/>
     predicated on the assumption that the BNA Act 
     <lb/>
     is superimposed upon this country. It is an es<lb break="no"/>timate as to the probable revenue which would be 
     <lb/>
     collected under section 91. I have to hold that the 
     <lb/>
     system of excise and customs duty as presently 
     <lb/>
     obtaining in Canada has to be taken into account 
     <lb/>
     when determining whether or not these figures 
     <lb/>
     are correct....

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Did I understand you to say that 
     <lb/>
     duty on dutiable goods was 10%?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If you take the total value of all 
     <lb/>
     imports into Canada, dutiable and non-dutiable, 
     <lb/>
     and divide that value by the total amount of 
     <lb/>
     customs duty the government collects, it is 10% 
     <lb/>
     as against 25% in Newfoundland. It varies — 
     <lb/>
     some years 9%, some years 10%, some 11%, 
     <lb/>
     depending on the total imports and the propor<lb break="no"/>tionate cost in the same year.... We have here an 
     <lb/>
     estimate by the Government of Canada — $20 
     <lb/>
     million that they would collect from the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. Of that $20 million, $2 million 
     <lb/>
     consists of customs and import taxes. Mr. Cashin 
     <lb/>
     makes the point, if you take our trade last year at 
     <lb/>
     $30 million from the United States...

     would import from countries other than Canada 
     <lb/>
     only such goods as Canada could not sell us, or

     in connection with this little discussion. In this

     total $20 million which the Government of

     <lb/>
     amount of $2 million, customs duty and import 
     <lb/>
     taxes — 10%.... Here are the latest public ac<lb break="no"/>counts of Canada. Percentage distribution of the 
     <lb/>
     revenue, 4.28% of the total ordinary revenue. In 
     <lb/>
     the case of Newfoundland, 10% of the revenue 
     <lb/>
     they would raise here.... If our imports as a 
     <lb/>
     province were of the general order of the imports 
     <lb/>
     into the nine provinces, then they would be col<lb break="no"/>lecting 4.28%; and whatever 4.28% is, it is less 
     <lb/>
     than $2 million....

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not follow Mr. Crosbie. 
     <lb/>
     The one who introduced the 10% happens to be 
     <lb/>
     me. The Canadian experts did not say, "We will 
     <lb/>
     collect 10% in customs duty". That is based on 
     <lb/>
     the estimate of how much goods would be im<lb break="no"/>ported into Newfoundland, not from Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     from other countries, and collecting the rates of 
     <lb/>
     tariff on that, the figure they arrive at is $2 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. I pointed out that two million happens to be 
     <lb/>
     10% of the $20 million. That is much higher than 
     <lb/>
     the average rate in Canada. In Canada, from all 
     <lb/>
     the revenue they collect from the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, 4.28% is in customs duty. If they col<lb break="no"/>lected 10% of the total revenue, in customs 
     <lb/>
     duties, that they collect from the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, they would be collecting a higher 
     <lb/>
     proportion of general revenue from Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers in the form of customs duty than they do 
     <lb/>
     in fact from the people of Canada. I say it is a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable assumption. Instead of collecting 
     <lb/>
     more than $2 million in customs duties, if it 
     <lb/>
     works out as it does generally in Canada, it will 
     <lb/>
     be very much less.

     <lb/>
     customs duties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> OK. That is what you say. But 
     <lb/>
     page 123 of the Black Book says in comparing 
     <lb/>
     Canadian duties with those levied by New<lb break="no"/>foundland, differences in the composition of im<lb break="no"/>ports must also be kept in mind. In 1945, the ratio 
     <lb/>
     of import duties collected "to total imports into 
     <lb/>
     Canada was only 10.6 %, and in 1944 it was still 
     <lb/>
     lower at 10.1 %". Right here it says 10.6% and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood says 4.28%. Those Canadian ex<lb break="no"/>perts are crazy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is no connection what<lb break="no"/>soever in the wide world or even in the world 
     <lb/>
     hereafter between this figure which Mr. Crosbie 
     <lb/>
     has just quoted and the figure I quoted from the 
     <lb/>
     public accounts of Canada. No connection at all. 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
            

     This 10% here is a figure I quoted to Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
     I said that if you take all the imports brought into 
     <lb/>
     Canada for a year, the total value, divide that by 
     <lb/>
     the total amount, it works out at 9%, 10% and 
     <lb/>
     11%. This figure in the public accounts is refer<lb break="no"/>ring to something altogether different. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> It is referring to duties.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, they both refer to duties. 
     <lb/>
     In one case this percentage refers to one thing and 
     <lb/>
     in the other case it refers to something altogether 
     <lb/>
     different.

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think I understand him perfectly. He 
     <lb/>
     says this 10% is equal to 4%. Have you taken the 
     <lb/>
     same imports in each case? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. There is no need to do it.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of course.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In Canada the government col<lb break="no"/>lects taxes from all of the nine provinces and it 
     <lb/>collects them in various ways. Regardless of the 
     <lb/>ways, it collects a certain total amount for a year. 
     <lb/>Of that total amount, whatever that amount may 
     <lb/>be, 4.28% they get in the form of customs duty. 
     <lb/>We come to Newfoundland, apply the same taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, and you get a total of $20 million.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They estimate $2 million in customs duty, and 
     <lb/>
     that would be 10% of all the revenue they would 
     <lb/>
     get from Newfoundland. What they get from the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada is only 4.28%. That is the point

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Then what are these?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> These are also provided by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. There is no contradiction 
     <lb/>
     between them and the 10%. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I can be just as pigheaded and will 
     <lb/>
     labour the point as long as you can. They figured 
     <lb/>
     the duty at $2 million. What is the exact amount 
     <lb/>
     of goods they expect to be imported into this 
     <lb/>
     country outside of Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> On page 123 it says, "However, it 
     <lb/>
     must be recognised that these figures were great<lb break="no"/>ly affected by heavy imports of duty-free raw 
     <lb/>
     materials of little interest to Newfoundland." 
     <lb/>
     Would not that support the contention that the 
     <lb/>
     proportion of our revenue would be higher than 
     <lb/>
     that raised from Canada in duties? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> As I view it, the 10% we are 
     <lb/>
     talking about here happens to be 10% of $20 
     <lb/>
     million which the federal government expects to 
     <lb/>
     get. Now, if the amount of the ratio of total 
     <lb/>
     imports happens to be 10%, then they would 
     <lb/>
     expect it to be that, if the average was $20 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. I think it would be a logical basis to figure 
     <lb/>
     on. If the average customs duty collected was 
     <lb/>
     10% and they estimated the amount of $2 million 
     <lb/>
     which they think they are going to get in customs 
     <lb/>
     duty, would it not be a fair assumption to assume 
     <lb/>
     the amount would be $20 million? There are two 
     <lb/>
     different things. The 4.28% is the percentage of 
     <lb/>
     the total revenue as compared with import duties; 
     <lb/>
     not the total amount of goods imported at dutiable 
     <lb/>
     figures. Two different things altogether.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It still does not explain the 
     <lb/>
     theoretical conflict between the public accounts 
     <lb/>
     from which Mr. Smallwood quoted and the state<lb break="no"/>ment on page 123 referred to by Mr. Crosbie; the 
     <lb/>
     ratio of import duties collected and the total im<lb break="no"/>ports into Newfoundland which was 10.6% and 
     <lb/>
     in 1944 still lower, 10.1%. What, if any, connec<lb break="no"/>tion is there between the 4.28% referred to by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood and the 10%? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I can put that very shortly. This 
     <lb/>
     year, we are told, Newfoundland collected $40 
     <lb/>
     million revenue. Let us say $20 million was 
     <lb/>
     gotten in customs duty. That would make it, if it 
     <lb/>
     happened, 50% of all the revenue the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government got. In Canada 4.28% of 
     <lb/>
     the total amount of revenue was collected in 
  

            <cb/>
           

     customs duties. Mr. Newell put his finger on it.... 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would not be importing large 
     <lb/>
     quantities of raw materials and this goes a long 
     <lb/>
     way in accounting for duty-free imports — half 
     <lb/>
     the imports into Canada are duty-free, mostly raw 
     <lb/>
     materials, steel, iron, coal, oil and so on. New<lb break="no"/>foundland would import a smaller proportion of 
     <lb/>
     raw materials coming in duty-free than the rest of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. A larger share of our imports would be 
     <lb/>
     dutiable than is the average throughout Canada; 
     <lb/>
     for that reason therefore, instead of the average 
     <lb/>
     10% duty, we might, on all imports, pay l2% or 
     <lb/>
     14% and that accounts for this $2 million in the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book.

            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> We are taking all this trouble on this 
     <lb/>point. I think you will find that income in the 
     <lb/>Canadian bracket is broken down into two very 
     <lb/>easily handled taxes — direct and indirect 
     <lb/>taxes.... The direct taxes are $1,155,000,000 
     <lb/>which works out roughly at $96 per capita. But 
     <lb/>on the other tax, Newfoundland is going to have 
     <lb/>to pay...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Compare the direct with the in<lb break="no"/>direct.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Customs tax, excise tax, sales tax and 
     <lb/>
    other taxes — indirect taxes is $1,045,000,000 or 
     <lb/>$89.26 per capita.... Anyone here can put two and 
     <lb/>two together. In Newfoundland we collected $40 
     <lb/>million. Divide that by 320,000 people and we 
     <lb/>will get $122.36. That is the tax Newfoundland 
     <lb/>is paying. If she goes into confederation tomor<lb break="no"/>row, her indirect taxes will be $89 a head. We are 
     <lb/>going to eat as Canadians, have as many bath 
     <lb/>tubs. We must pay the same amount of taxes. I 
     <lb/>know we are going to pay it; every man, from the 
     <lb/>cradle to the grave will pay. I imagine every man 
     <lb/>and boy will be paying the works. Whether it is 
     <lb/>customs tax, excise tax, sales tax or other tax, I 
     <lb/>will bet my last dollar I am right — $89 per 
     <lb/>capita. Your tax under responsible government 
     <lb/>and Commission government, the highest I think 
     <lb/>was $122.36. There is the whole thing in a nut<lb break="no"/>shell. Whether it is 4% of the total or 6% or 3%

     has broken that down into per capita taxation at 
     <lb/>
     so much a head. Let us deal with that for a moment. 
     <lb/>
     The revenue of the Government of Canada — 
     <lb/>
     $2,200,000,000 — is from all the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada; but in fact the Province of Ontario alone 
     <lb/>
     contributed half the revenue.... It has a population 
     <lb/>
     of four million people. It is a very high per capita 
     <lb/>
     tax, is it not? But the other billion dollars is to be 
     <lb/>
     divided among 8 1/2 million people. From the 
     <lb/>
     other 8 1/2 million people, take the 3 1/2 million of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. What have you? The per capita tax for 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces is very small. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, the Minister of Finance does not 
     <lb/>
     say at the beginning of the year, "We are going 
     <lb/>
     to spend that, that and that. A total of $2 billion. 
     <lb/>
     We have to get $2 billion. There are nine provin<lb break="no"/>ces. Nine divided into $2 billion, therefore we 
     <lb/>
     must get that much from each province." Neither 
     <lb/>
     does he do this: "Our population is 12.5 million 
     <lb/>
     souls; divide that into $2 billion, that is so much 
     <lb/>
     per head; every head has to pay that much." He 
     <lb/>
     does not do this. He says ... "Let those who can 
     <lb/>
     pay it, pay it." There is an exception and that is 
     <lb/>
     indirect taxes. Indirect taxation is the most 
     <lb/>
     cursed, the most wicked thing ever invented. 
     <lb/>
     Direct taxation is fair. You know what you pay. 
     <lb/>
     Indirectly, you can be looted and fleeced. You 
     <lb/>
     never know how much is looted out of you. They 
     <lb/>
     have it in Canada. I wish they did not. In New<lb break="no"/>foundland, the bulk of taxes has come from in<lb break="no"/>direct taxation. It is a wicked and cursed burden 
     <lb/>
     on our people, a much heavier burden than in the 
     <lb/>
     case of Canada. In Canada, the bulk of taxation 
     <lb/>
     is raised by direct taxation, falling on the 
     <lb/>
     shoulders of those who can best afford to pay it. 
     <lb/>
     In Newfoundland, the very diapers on the baby 
     <lb/>
     born tomorrow morning will be taxed; the coffin 
     <lb/>
     in which you are buried will be taxed — a cursed, 
     <lb/>
     wicked imposition on the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. If we could abolish this wicked im<lb break="no"/>position; if we could do that; if some genius could 
     <lb/>
     do it; I think I would throw confederation and all 
     <lb/>
     out the window — if we could find a fair system 
     <lb/>
     of taxation, those who could afford to pay, and 
     <lb/>
     those who could not afford it would not have to 
     <lb/>
     pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I said I was not interested in direct 
     <lb/>
     taxation; all I was interested in was indirect. What 
     <lb/>
     is the difference in the indirect taxation of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and our taxes? I think you will find it is $43.36. 
     <lb/>
     Indirect taxation goes on the diapers; it is on the 
 

            <cb/>
         

     diapers in Canada and will be on the diapers if we 
     <lb/>
     enter confederation. How much tax has New<lb break="no"/>foundland paid to Ottawa on the $39 million we 
     <lb/>
     imported? If we send $30 million to Ottawa, we 
     <lb/>
     help pay their taxes. Not only are we helping to 
     <lb/>
     pay their taxes, we are helping the men who 
     <lb/>
     worked in the factories. I say this without fear of 
     <lb/>
     contradiction: every person in Canada is paying 
     <lb/>
     proportionate parts of Ottawa taxes; 82% of all 
     <lb/>
     industrial dollars is put in by two provinces and 
     <lb/>
     7% by British Columbia.

     is 89; and 89 from 100 is 11%; 11% of the in<lb break="no"/>dustrial dollars is invested by the other six provin<lb break="no"/>ces. Consequently, Ontario pays and Quebec 
     <lb/>
     pays and the other provinces pay.

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I would like to know the proportion 
     <lb/>
     of taxes we paid into the treasury last year out of 
     <lb/>
     this $30 million, into Ottawa. You are cursing the 
     <lb/>
     taxation of this country. I was fortunate in getting 
     <lb/>
     the figures and working them down. There is the 
     <lb/>
     percentage of indirect taxes — sales tax and other 
     <lb/>
     excise taxes and they will go on from the cradle 
     <lb/>
     to the grave. You are trying to tell us that by going 
     <lb/>
     in with Canada we will be getting clear of indirect 
     <lb/>
     taxation. Look at the direct taxes — $96 per 
     <lb/>
     capita. I know I am not paying as much as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Crosbie or Mr. Hickman or Mr. Job in the 
     <lb/>
     long run; but if I catch 50 quintals of fish and sell 
     <lb/>
     it to Mr. Crosbie, I paid a couple of dollars of his 
     <lb/>
     tax. We have wasted a lot of time on this 
     <lb/>
     hyphenated heifer dust.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I think we are getting away from the 
     <lb/>
     subject — this $2 million import tax and customs 
     <lb/>
     duty. I am anxious to know how it is raised. I note 
     <lb/>
     on page 7, volume I of the Black Books, a "Sub<lb break="no"/>committee on Finance composed of Mr. J.E. 
     <lb/>
     Coyne, Dr. R.A. MacKay, Mr. M.W. Sharp and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. G.S. Watts of the Public Service of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and Rev. Lester Burry, Mr. P.W. Crummey and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. J.R. Smallwood of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegation, to examine the financial implications 
     <lb/>
     of union...." We have three delegates — Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Burry, Mr. Crummey and Mr. Smallwood who 
     <lb/>
     sat in on that. I take it that at these sessions they

     worked out how they arrived at that particular 
     <lb/>
     figure of $2 million. I would ask Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     just how they worked it out and how they got it. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The reply is, we did not work 
     <lb/>it out. The table was worked out by the financial 
     <lb/>and fiscal and trade experts of the Government of 
     <lb/>Canada — the very men upon whom the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada depends for its fiscal and finan<lb break="no"/>cial policy; it is these very men who advise the 
     <lb/>Minister of Finance in his budget; the very men 
     <lb/>who derived this table. It was precious little 
     <lb/>contribution that Mr. Burry, Mr. Crummey or I 
     <lb/>made to these financial experts — that is, in 
     <lb/>compiling that table — precious little. I thank Mr. 
     <lb/>Hollett for the compliment to our ability; but 
     <lb/>compared with these financial men, we are just 
     <lb/>clod hoppers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I know that. We sent you up there 
     <lb/>
     as a delegation to go into the implications of 
     <lb/>
     union with the Dominion of Canada and to bring 
     <lb/>
     us back those so-called terms. You bring us back 
     <lb/>
     a table saying the federal government will collect 
     <lb/>
     $2 million from us in customs and import duties 
     <lb/>
     in the event of confederation and you or 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Burry or Mr. Crummey should be able to tell 
     <lb/>
     us how you arrive at that figure; if not, some 
     <lb/>
     people from the Finance or Customs should 
     <lb/>
     know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We asked the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to furnish us, as a delegation going 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa, with men from the Customs Depart<lb break="no"/>ment, from the Assessor's department, from the 
     <lb/>
     Railway and Post Office. We did indeed. The 
     <lb/>
     reply of the government was, in their opinion we 
     <lb/>
     did not need those men; that any information we 
     <lb/>
     wanted we could get before we went; after we got 
     <lb/>
     up there, if there was still information we needed, 
     <lb/>
     or the Government of Canada needed, the 
     <lb/>
     Government would be very happy to furnish that. 
     <lb/>
     All we had to do was write or cable. In common 
     <lb/>
     fairness, I would say that any information we 
     <lb/>
     sought before we went was given us. Any infor<lb break="no"/>mation we sought after we went, was given us. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You took up there certain facts and 
     <lb/>figures; you passed them over to the men on these 
     <lb/>various committees; you had nothing whatever to 
     <lb/>do in making up these tables, submitted to us, at 
     <lb/>all. You were up there 100 days and you know 
     <lb/>nothing whatsoever as to how these figures were 
     <lb/>arrived at.

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I am not quite sure where we are 
     <lb/>
     getting. I have been somewhat confused myself 
     <lb/>
     this evening. I do not know if the people listening 
     <lb/>
     in feel any better. I think we ought to get down 
     <lb/>
     to some basis of clarifying the procedure on a 
     <lb/>
     particular question or questions. I think it invol<lb break="no"/>ves two questions. We have been discussing 
     <lb/>
     federal revenue. Now, are we straight on that? As 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin said earlier this evening, these 
     <lb/>
     figures here may have been guesses or not. He 
     <lb/>
     does not agree with them. I agree with him. He 
     <lb/>
     made a suggestion with regard to page 15 of the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book. I think we ought to get those figures 
     <lb/>
     straightened out; get as near as possible a more 
     <lb/>
     accurate corroboration either from Mr. Allen of 
     <lb/>
     the Assessor's Department or from Mr. Howell 
     <lb/>
     of the Customs, if it is possible to do so. We have 
     <lb/>
     been kind of wandering around from taxes to 
     <lb/>
     taxes. That is just the federal end. We have to get 
     <lb/>
     into the provincial end. On income tax we seem 
     <lb/>
     to have skipped over a lot. I note in Canada in 
     <lb/>
     1945 — I daresay it was higher in 1946 and 1947 
     <lb/>
     — the total income tax collected was $650 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Out of that, people earning under $1,000 
     <lb/>
     paid $18 million; between $1,000 and $2,000, 
     <lb/>
     $139 million and $140 million. That is not the 
     <lb/>
     high income tax people. The high income tax for 
     <lb/>
     1945 is on page 232 of the book you have. These 
     <lb/>
     things have to be brought out a little better. In 
     <lb/>
     addition there is sales tax of 8%. We read the list 
     <lb/>
     of goods that are exempt, but the list it is on are 
     <lb/>
     not in the Black Book. There is a whole lot of 
     <lb/>
     taxes goes on before the sales tax of 8%. I am not 
     <lb/>
     going to read them. Mr. Smallwood just men<lb break="no"/>tioned the indirect taxation which he does not 
     <lb/>
     like. In Canada they have a lot of that too. For 
     <lb/>
     example, on a pair of shoes there are 126 taxes; 
     <lb/>
     on a loaf of bread 52 taxes; on a suit of clothes 
     <lb/>
     105 taxes before it gets to the consumer in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How does that compare with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> These taxes would be on if we 
     <lb/>
     became a province. I am talking about, if we went 
     <lb/>
     into confederation. Referring to federal revenue, 
     <lb/>
     I think the members ought to have before us a sort 
     <lb/>
     of provincial budget — provincial revenue and 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. The Economic Report was brought 
     <lb/>

     foundland question. They did try to give a picture 
     <lb/>
     of how it might be in the foreseeable future. I do 
     <lb/>
     think we should show how much money we are 
     <lb/>
     going to receive as a province and what the 
     <lb/>
     difference will be between that, and what we will 
     <lb/>
     need for expenditure. That much has to be raised 
     <lb/>
     — the difference between what we get from 
     <lb/>
     Canada and what has got to be raised from taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. I think that ought to be brought in here so 
     <lb/>
     that we can discuss that, as we did the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, and let the people see what has to be 
     <lb/>
     raised and from what source it has to come. It is 
     <lb/>
     my guess that we are going to be $2 million or $3 
     <lb/>
     million short on provincial revenue after paying 
     <lb/>
     8% of sales tax and all other taxes. We have to 
     <lb/>
     get the provincial side of it. I would rather have 
     <lb/>
     the people see both sides. I do not want to hide 
     <lb/>
     anything — how much have they to pay and who 
     <lb/>
     is going to pay? I do not know whether it would 
     <lb/>
     be in order to make any motion along those lines. 
     <lb/>
     I know Major Cashin introduced the subject ear<lb break="no"/>lier in the evening. I would prefer for him to 
     <lb/>
     express his opinion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I suggest, if that is going to be 
     <lb/>
     done, we might rise the committee; I go back to 
     <lb/>
     the Chair and then, if need be, put the motion 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair and call for a discussion is, if it 
     <lb/>
     meets with the approval of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> This is unexpected. It is not at 
     <lb/>
     all, as I understand it, in line with our discussion 
     <lb/>
     and decision of last night. My understanding of 
     <lb/>
     what we decided to do last night was that, pend<lb break="no"/>ing the time we should have some idea put before 
     <lb/>
     the House of the purely provincial taxation, we 
     <lb/>
     should go ahead first and discuss federal revenue 
     <lb/>
     and expenditure. That is what we are doing. On 
     <lb/>
     that, if the House is not satisfied with the estimate 
     <lb/>
     of the Government of Canada, of the experts of 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada. and cares to solicit 
     <lb/>
     estimates from anyone locally, there is nothing in 
     <lb/>
     the way of doing it. But why not dispose of the 
     <lb/>
     question of federal government revenues and ex<lb break="no"/>penditures for the Province of Newfoundland, if 
     <lb/>
     we became a province, before taking up the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial government revenues and ex<lb break="no"/>penditures? Whichever we take first, we must 
     <lb/>
     take one of them first. You cannot jumble up 
     <lb/>
     federal expenditure and revenue with provincial 
     <lb/>
     expenditure and revenue. You have to take one 
     <lb/>
     of them at first. It so happens it is more con<lb break="no"/>venient to take federal. That is what we have been 
  

            <cb/>
         

     doing. After all is said and done, it is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     true that we have got to consider what would be 
     <lb/>
     the revenue of the Province of Newfoundland; 
     <lb/>
     where it would get the revenue; what would be 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure of the provincial government. 
     <lb/>
     While we have to do that, is it not important also 
     <lb/>
     to know what the federal government will spend 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, and what it will take from the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland in taxes? Why not go 
     <lb/>
     into that for a day or two and spend the rest of the 
     <lb/>
     week on the provincial government expenditure? 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except for this point, I agree 
     <lb/>with your contention that we are discussion prob<lb break="no"/>able federal revenues and expenditures with 
     <lb/>respect to Newfoundland. That is quite so. In the 
     <lb/>course of your own remarks, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>you have pointed out that when this is finished, 
     <lb/>inevitably we must come to the time and place 
     <lb/>where we have to deal with purely provincial 
     <lb/>aspect of it. Now, members — at all events 
     <lb/>Mr. Hickman and Major Cashin — seem to be of 
     <lb/>opinion that they are not in a position to discuss 
     <lb/>the provincial aspect of it when we come to it. 
     <lb/>That raises the question as to whether or not it is 
     <lb/>necessary to secure supplementary information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I thought they were addressing 
     <lb/>themselves to the federal government revenues 
     <lb/>and expenditures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Would you allow me to finish? 
     <lb/>
     Assuming we have to come to the provincial 
     <lb/>
     aspect of it, some members feel that they have not 
     <lb/>
     sufficient data on the purely provincial side in 
     <lb/>
     order to be able to determine with any degree of 
     <lb/>
     accuracy, the impact of section 92 of the 
     <lb/>
     BNA Act upon the productive economy of this 
     <lb/>
     country, if and when we become a province. That 
     <lb/>
     being so, at this time, there is an inquiry as to 
     <lb/>
     whether that information should not well be 
     <lb/>
     secured from some source or sources: if that is so, 
     <lb/>
     it is my duty to facilitate members into an intel<lb break="no"/>ligent discussion of this thing. If some machinery 
     <lb/>
     has to be set up in order to discuss the provincial 
     <lb/>
     aspect of it when we leave the federal aspect, the 
     <lb/>
     sooner it is set up the better for all concerned. 
     <lb/>
     Even if the debate continues for several days, the 
     <lb/>
     machinery would be set up to secure the informa<lb break="no"/>tion and could be operating, which would mini<lb break="no"/>mize or eliminate a prolonged adjournment....

     of what they would collect from the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and that they suggested that 
     <lb/>
     another estimate be gotten locally from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Allen, Tax Assessor and from possibly 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howell, Secretary of Customs, at least in 
     <lb/>
     respect to income tax and customs tax, under 
     <lb/>
     confederation — to get the estimate of what the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people would give the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada under that heading. That was my 
     <lb/>
     understanding.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The position in which the Chair 
     <lb/>
     finds itself is, if at the time, because necessary 
     <lb/>
     information is not available to members at this 
     <lb/>
     time in order to pursue the matter, or if, as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman says, we have been going along all 
     <lb/>
     evening in a maze because certain other sup<lb break="no"/>plementary information has not been forthcom<lb break="no"/>ing; then whether it deals with the federal aspect 
     <lb/>
     of the thing or the provincial aspect of the thing, 
     <lb/>
     it is my duty to sympathetically consider and give 
     <lb/>
     every attention to the unenviable position in

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In connection with this whole

     again that personal income tax, corporation tax 
     <lb/>
     and succession tax amounts to only $11 million; 
     <lb/>
     and as I pointed out earlier this evening, it should 
     <lb/>
     be much more if we go into confederation. The 
     <lb/>
     people who computed this could not have been 
     <lb/>
     particularly well informed on the Newfoundland

     situation. Our own Assessor of Taxes or his as<lb break="no"/>sistant, or some of his chiefs, would know more

     about it than anyone in Ottawa. They could give 
     <lb/>
     us only an estimate, a fairly conservative estimate 
     <lb/>
     of what would be collected by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada if we went into confederation. 
     <lb/>With regard to customs duty, I cannot agree with 
     <lb/>the figure, because if they based their estimates 
     <lb/>of liquor taxes and which they put down at 
     <lb/>$400,000; last year $1,674,000 was collected. 
     <lb/>That is $1 million out. In the case of tobacco taxes 
     <lb/>which they put down as $500,000, last year it was 
     <lb/>$2.5 million. If the customs are out in proportion 
     <lb/>to tobacco and liquor taxes, you can see my point, 
     <lb/>what I am trying to drive at. They are just guessed 
     <lb/>at by those people in Ottawa from whatever in<lb break="no"/>formation was given them. Then turn over the 
     <lb/>other page of the book and look at the federal 
     <lb/>expenditure. The point I am getting at, the federal 
 

            <cb/>
          

     expenditures, for instance, tax agreement is what 
     <lb/>
     goes to the province; old age pensions, that goes 
     <lb/>
     to the province. Family allowances, that is from 
     <lb/>
     the federal government and has nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with the province. "Other departmental expendi<lb break="no"/>tures $9,400,000" — we certainly ought to know 
     <lb/>
     under what departmental heads it is going to be 
     <lb/>
     spent. I have had a little experience in this finan<lb break="no"/>cial business. I should know what I am talking 
     <lb/>
     about in connection with this. I want to get it over 
     <lb/>
     quickly; I was never particularly agreeable to 
     <lb/>
     having this Convention at all, as everyone knows. 
     <lb/>
     I feel the suggestion by Mr. Hollett is right; it 
     <lb/>
     should come before the Steering Committee and 
     <lb/>
     should get down to closer grips and see if we can 
     <lb/>
     work out places to get the proper information for 
     <lb/>
     the Convention as a whole. I suggest the commit<lb break="no"/>tee rise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am agreeable to have the 
     <lb/>
     committee rise. I would say this; my motion will 
     <lb/>
     be made as plainly as words can make it. I am 
     <lb/>
     personally anxious that this Convention finish 
     <lb/>
     before Christmas. I am sick and tired of it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now, I want to get out at some<lb break="no"/>thing else. I am fed up with it. I want to finish 
     <lb/>
     before Christmas. We will never do it if we do 
     <lb/>
     not use up every hour and every minute. I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to go ahead. I am satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     estimates of the Canadian government as to what 
     <lb/>
     revenue they will collect. I am equally satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with what they will spend. I do not think anyone 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland will tell us one word better than 
     <lb/>they estimate what they will spend. I estimate 
     <lb/>around $35 million or $36 million a year. Their 
     <lb/>own estimate of what they will collect is $20 
     <lb/>million. I am satisfied with that. I am prepared to 
     <lb/>go on.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I can say what I expect to spend; 
     <lb/>
     but what I expect to collect over the next year

     might be something entirely different. I know 
     <lb/>
     what I can do with the money I have in hand. I 
     <lb/>
     can see what I have in hand. But as to what can 
     <lb/>
     be collected over a given period, that might be 
     <lb/>
     something entirely different.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am entirely in agreement with the 
     <lb/>
     statements by Major Cashin and Mr. Hickman 
     <lb/>
     when I look at this particular item which they will 
     <lb/>
     collect in personal income tax from the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — $3.2 million. I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say they collected in personal income tax that 
     <lb/>
     much last year, on our rates. In other words, a 
     <lb/>
     single man earning $1,000 before he pays any 
     <lb/>
     income tax whatsoever in Newfoundland. After 
     <lb/>
     he passes $1,000, he pays 9%. A married man 
     <lb/>
     with no dependents but his wife can earn $2,000 
     <lb/>
     before he pays income tax. In connection with 
     <lb/>
     that, I would refer you to page 153, volume 2 of 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book, to show you how ridiculous that 
     <lb/>
     amount of $3.2 million might be. A single man 
     <lb/>
     pays income tax if he earns $750. Also he has to 
     <lb/>
     pay 8% sales tax on practically everything he 
     <lb/>
     buys in Canada. More than that, if he has to buy 
     <lb/>
     a present for his girl friend, he has to pay luxury 
     <lb/>
     tax. 


            <cb/>
           

     Mr. Smallwood You are quoting figures on the 
     <lb/>
     single men; what about the married men? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I said I would take the single men 
     <lb/>
     first. I am thinking mostly at the moment of our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen who fish out of Harbour Breton, 
     <lb/>
     English Harbour and Burin; the loggers who cut 
     <lb/>
     down the trees; the miners who dig out the ore; 
     <lb/>
     our paperworkers in paper mills. We have a lot 
     <lb/>
     of young men who came back from overseas who 
     <lb/>
     are in these income tax brackets. For instance this 
     <lb/>
     $1500; we had fishermen who earned as high as 
     <lb/>
     $2,200 in Fortune Harbour. Those fishermen in 
     <lb/>
     Harbour Breton or Burin will pay $264 in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, whereas here in Newfoundland he will 
     <lb/>
     pay $110. On top of that also, he pays 8% sales 
     <lb/>
     tax on practically everything he buys and 25% 
     <lb/>
     luxury tax. $2100 or $2200 or $2400 — we have 
     <lb/>
     a lot of people in this country earning $2400; a 
     <lb/>
     surprising number. In the industrial towns of 
     <lb/>
     Grand Falls and Corner Brook, a great many 
     <lb/>
     Banking fishermen, over on Bell Island there is 
     <lb/>
     an average of $1,600 or $1,800. That was worked 
     <lb/>
     out by the Mining Committee. We can go back to 
     <lb/>
     $2,200; on that he pays $264 in Canada if we 
     <lb/>
     become a province; whereas at the moment he 
     <lb/>
     pays $110. A single man should pay; he has no 
     <lb/>
     dependents; I grant you that. I also grant you this; 
     <lb/>
     if he is paying that much more, that is all the more 
     <lb/>
     reason why this $3.2 million is wrong. Take a 
     <lb/>
     married man with two dependents; he earns 
     <lb/>
     $1,980 before he pays any tax, then he pays $20. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Take a married man with three 
     <lb/>children under 16 years of age, of course he 
     <lb/>collects $72 a year average on each child — 
     <lb/>$216; he is better off by $196. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> When? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You were careful to point out 
     <lb/>
     what the single men would pay with confedera<lb break="no"/>tion and without. Now I am talking about how 
     <lb/>
     they will be better off. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> If you continue interrupting — 
     <lb/>
     how, when, where and why would they be better 
     <lb/>
     off? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Because of confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> No. He has to buy food, boots and 
     <lb/>
     shoes and clothing for his wife and three children. 
     <lb/>
     He has to pay 8% sales tax on all that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He pays more now in duty.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> A married man with three children, 
     <lb/>in this country, has to earn $2,900 before he pays 
     <lb/>income tax. In Canada, a man earning $3,000, 
  

            <pb n="944"

     with three children, pays $210 income tax; in this 
     <lb/>
     country, a man with a wife and three children 
     <lb/>
     pays $9. A man earning $3,500 pays $310 income 
     <lb/>
     tax in Canada. The point I want to make is this; 
     <lb/>
     if you take the amount of income tax which will 
     <lb/>
     be collected under confederation, the amount of 
     <lb/>
     income tax which will go to the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment, it will be much more than $3.2 million. 
     <lb/>
     That is why I think the suggestion made by Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin in having Mr. Allen and to get him to help 
     <lb/>
     us is right. Mr. Allen in collaboration with the 
     <lb/>
     census people, who have the number of people 
     <lb/>
     earning, and who know practically in what in<lb break="no"/>come groups they are, could help us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I was going to say, Major Cashin has 
     <lb/>
     pointed out some definite, concrete things; par<lb break="no"/>ticularly that liquor tax which is down here as 
     <lb/>
     $400,000; Major Cashin has shown very clearly 
     <lb/>
     that that should be $1.6 million. That, in itself, is 
     <lb/>
     an item that shakes your faith, absolutely shakes 
     <lb/>
     your faith, in this thing. Another thing is, if the 
     <lb/>
     federal government have made mistakes in this, 
     <lb/>
     their offer is all wrong, as it is upon this federal 
     <lb/>
     revenue that they based their offer. It is very 
     <lb/>
     important then to get this into the hands of experts 
     <lb/>
     and have it looked into carefully. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I would like to know if Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin would give me what the amount of liquor 
     <lb/>
     imported from Canada was last year. He gave us 
     <lb/>
     the duty collected on liquor and tobacco. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> These figures were excepting 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Liquor of all kinds imported, $12 mil<lb break="no"/>lion; yielded $1,674,800.00. This thing here says 
     <lb/>
     $400,000. In the case of imported cigarettes from 
     <lb/>
     the United States, 529,412 pounds; approximate<lb break="no"/>ly $2 million in duty. Here you have $500,000. It 
     <lb/>
     is quote evident that my friends in St. John's 
     <lb/>
     West are not going to get their liquor cheap if we 
     <lb/>
     go into confederation.

     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Bring in a motion to ask the Cus<lb break="no"/>toms Department and Assessor's Department to 
     <lb/>
     prepare such an estimate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Higgins thinks that not 
     <lb/>
     much can be accomplished if the meeting is held 
     <lb/>
     at 2 pm and we have to go into session at 3 pm.

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> We could adjourn if we are not

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> What will we go on with then? 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is why I want the Steering 
     <lb/>Committee meeting held. I must take note of the 
     <lb/>fact that there are difficulties confronting mem<lb break="no"/>bers here. I have a Steering Committee and it is 
     <lb/>my duty to call it together in an effort to resolve 
     <lb/>any difficulties which may confront members. 
     <lb/>My object in calling a Steering Committee meet<lb break="no"/>ing is to try and resolve difficulties which 
     <lb/>presently exist and which are likely to exist un<lb break="no"/>less something is done about it: to have them 
     <lb/>perhaps decide what <hi rendition="simple:italic">modus operandi</hi> can be 
     <lb/>employed in order to eliminate the difficulties 
     <lb/>which now confront the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am opposed to the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee making any decisions. Let the Con<lb break="no"/>vention decide. Let it be done in public. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Suppose I decide to appoint a 
     <lb/>
     special committee, which I have the right to do, 
     <lb/>
     in order to facilitate members to eliminate dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties which must otherwise come before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair; there are difficulties and they must con<lb break="no"/>tinue if they are not anticipated. My object is 
     <lb/>
     merely to secure advice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not to make decisions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the occasion so arrives, a

     pose a certain course of conduct is carried out; to 
     <lb/>
     carry that into effect, I will avail myself of my 
     <lb/>
     rights to appoint a special committee for that 
     <lb/>
     purpose. I might be put in a position where I 
     <lb/>
     would have to appoint a committee when mem<lb break="no"/>bers could accomplish the very same thing. If I 
     <lb/>
     am forced to do it, I certainly will appoint a 
     <lb/>
     Special committee to deal with future procedure 
     <lb/>
     of the matter now before the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am agreeable to the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee, but I would say that any suggestion 
     <lb/>
     or any decision should be a decision by the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, and not the Steering Committee. That is 
     <lb/>
     turning it into something it was never intended to 
     <lb/>
     be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The Convention has to make the 
     <lb/>
     decision.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are anticipating too much. 
     <lb/>
     I am asking the Steering Committee to meet me 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of discussing matters which have 
     <lb/>
     arisen this evening and which are not going to be 
     <lb/>
     resolved unless and until some course of proce<lb break="no"/>
            

            <cb/>
       

     dure is adopted. To that end, therefore, the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Steering Committee, not as a Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee at all, but rather in the status of an 
     <lb/>
     advisory committee are asked to meet me in the 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to try and find some means whereby 
     <lb/>
     the Convention members may be facilitated in the 
     <lb/>
     discharging of the duties assigned to them, in 
     <lb/>
     particular in regard to the business now before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. Surely there is nothing wrong about that. 
     <lb/>
     We will meet to consider and recommend. I have 
     <lb/>
     not attempted to force anything on this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. Recommendations will be made; if the Con<lb break="no"/>vention sees fit to adopt them, all right; if they see 
     <lb/>
     fit to throw them out, well and good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I move the adjournment until 3 pm 
     <lb/>
     Thursday.

     [Mr. Cashin gave notice that he would ask the

     Commissioner of Finance for detailed statements 
     <lb/>
     of revenue by source for the fiscal year 1946-47;

     and for a comparison of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canadian tobacco and excise taxes, and postal 
     <lb/>
     and telegraph rates. He also gave notice to ask 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government at which rate it would 
     <lb/>
     tax amounts received by beneficiaries of life in<lb break="no"/>surance policies] 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I give notice that I will on tomorrow 
     <lb/>lay on the table the following enquiry directed to 
     <lb/>the Canadian Department of External Affairs, 
     <lb/>through His Excellency the Governor, that is to 
     <lb/>say: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas under Annex IV, page 16, of the 
     <lb/>Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland Into Confederation dated at 
     <lb/>Ottawa, Canada, October 30, 1947, under 
     <lb/>heading "Probable Expenditures",1 and 
     <lb/>passed to this Convention by His Excellency 
     <lb/>the Governor, there is an item titled "Other 
     <lb/>Departmental Expenditures, $9,400,000" 
     <lb/>which it is understood is meant to take care 
     <lb/>of the cost of extending existing services to 
     <lb/>Newfoundland in a typical year should 
     <lb/>Newfoundland enter into confederation; 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Now Therefore will the said Department 
     <lb/>
     of External Affairs inform this National Con<lb break="no"/>vention at the earliest possible moment as to 
     <lb/>
     the following:  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Are the "existing services" referred to 
     <lb/>
     those outlined under heading "Public Ser<lb break="no"/>vices provided by Canada", sections 3 to 6 
     <lb/>
     inclusive, excepting always of course, sec<lb break="no"/>tion 4 sub-section (1) and (2) and section 5 
     <lb/>
     sub-section (1)? If so, what are the alloca<lb break="no"/>tions in respect of each several service? Or 
     <lb/>
     generally, it is desired that an understandable 
     <lb/>
     breakdown be made of the amount of 
     <lb/>
     $9,400,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, the wording 
     <lb/>
     adopted by Mr. Hollett in that question of which 
     <lb/>
     he gives notice is different from that used in the 
     <lb/>
     other questions. All other questions up to this one 
     <lb/>
     have been as from some member of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. This one puts it as from the Convention 
     <lb/>
     itself. I have wondered, with regard to all the 
     <lb/>
     questions to be forwarded to the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, whether those were to be regarded as 
     <lb/>
     having come from the Convention or from in<lb break="no"/>dividual members. In the case of Mr. Hollett's 
     <lb/>
     question, it is so worded as to have it come from
