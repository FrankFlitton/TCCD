     <!-- GL, 2017-02-09 Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            <!--<p>
     a guide as a cool head. But the cool head, the 
     <lb/>
     analytical mind, the wide vision, all will be 
     <lb/>
     necessary. I realised this clearer than ever the 
     <lb/>
     other day. When re-reading that classic on repre<lb break="no"/>sentative govemmentby John Stuart Mill, I came 
     <lb/>
     across a passage not inappropriate to this oc<lb break="no"/>casion, apassage worthy of serious consideration 
     <lb/>
     by each member of the Convention. It reads as 
     <lb/>
     follows: "To determine the form of government 
     <lb/>
     most suitable to any particular people", says Mill, 
     <lb/>
     "we must be able, among the defects and 
     <lb/>
     shortcomings which belong to that people, to 
     <lb/>
     distinguish those that are the immediate impedi<lb break="no"/>ment to progress; to discover what it is which, as 
     <lb/>
     it were, stops the way. The best government for 
     <lb/>
     them is the one which tends most to give them 
     <lb/>
     that for want of which they cannot advance, or 
     <lb/>
     advance only in a lame and lopsided manner. We 
     <lb/>
     must not, however, forget", John Stuart Mill con<lb break="no"/>tinues, "the reservation necessary in all things 
     <lb/>
     which have for their object improvement, or 
     <lb/>
     progress; namely that in seeking the good which 
     <lb/>
     is needed, no damage, or as little as possible, be 
     <lb/>
     done to that already possessed." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those are wise words; they were written some 
     <lb/>
     85 years ago, but they are very much up to date. 
     <lb/>
     I would commend them to the earnest consider<lb break="no"/>ation of every member of the Convention They 
     <lb/>
     will help you in your deliberations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gentlemen, you are honoured men. Your fel<lb break="no"/>low countrymen have called you to a very big job. 
     <lb/>
     You have their confidence. They trust you. They 
     <lb/>
     are expecting great things ofyou. When you have 
     <lb/>
     fulfilled your task as members of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention, they know that they will be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to exercise their civic responsibilities. Then 
     <lb/>
     one of, if not the most important election in the 
     <lb/>
     history of Newfoundland will take place. Your 
     <lb/>
     fellow countrymen look to you for guidance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     They look to you for guidance during your 
     <lb/>
     deliberations. They hope for your guidance when 
     <lb/>
     you return to your homes. They know you will be 
     <lb/>
     fully informed on all the aspects of all the 
     <lb/>
     problems confronting Newfoundland. They 
     <lb/>
     know that on the next occasion they go to the 
     <lb/>
     polling, they will have the destiny of the rising 
     <lb/>
     generation and following generations in their 
     <lb/>
     hands. They are relying on you in a very special 
     <lb/>
     manner to help them in every way to discharge 
     <lb/>
     that great responsibility. It is an aspect of your 
     <lb/>
     work which I know you are not likely to overlook. 
     <lb/>
     The whole of your work is preliminary but very 
     <lb/>
     closely associated with that forthcoming elec<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But your fellow countrymen will not by any 
     <lb/>
     means he the only people interested in your ac<lb break="no"/>tivities. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say 
     <lb/>
     that the whole civilised world is keenly inter<lb break="no"/>ested, I feel sure that you will be fortified in your 
     <lb/>
     work in the knowledge that you have millions of 
     <lb/>
     well-wishers beyond the long and rugged 
     <lb/>
     coastline of your native land. You have the good 
     <lb/>
     wishes of all your fellow countrymen. It is with 
     <lb/>
     that knowledge thatI would have you go on your 
     <lb/>
     way, and in declaring the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     open, I trust that unborn generations of New- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     foundlanders will rise to sing your praises for the 
     <lb/>
     grand job you did. That God's richest blessings 
     <lb/>
     will rest on all your labours is my earnest prayer. 
     <lb/>

            <p>Mr. Chairman Gentlemen of the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention, if it pleases you I should accept a motion 
     <lb/>for the adjournment of the Convention until 3 
     <lb/>o'clock tomorrow afternoon when a motion for 
     <lb/>the presenting an address of loyalty to His Majes<lb break="no"/>ty and thanks to His Excellency will be presented 
     <lb/>to the Convention.

                                          <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise with
                                          much <lb/> pleasure to move a vote of thanks to His
                                                 Excel<lb break="no"/>lency the Governor for his
                                          very fine opening <lb/> address yesterday to the National
                                          Convention, a <lb/> momentous occasion in the history of
                                          our <lb/> beloved country. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     We are now passing a landmark which I sin<lb break="no"/>cerely hope and believe will be the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of a period in which the people of all classes 
     <lb/>
     and denominations in Newfoundland will make 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
        
     a new start. Where this journey will end no one 
     <lb/>
     can at the moment forecast, but at any rate it 
     <lb/>
     would seem likely to eventuate at some not far 
     <lb/>
     distant date in an encouragement to every in<lb break="no"/>dividual of voting age to take a much wider and 
     <lb/>
     deeper interest than they have done in the past in 
     <lb/>
     the management of their country's affairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to review our past errors of 
     <lb/>
     omission and commission at this juncture; but it 
     <lb/>
     will be necessary during our deliberations to refer

     to errors of the past in order to learn from them, 
     <lb/>
     and I most earnestly hope that in doing so we will 
     <lb/>
     all, myself included, be able to make our 
     <lb/>
     criticisms constructive and helpful, and that we 
     <lb/>
     will not waste our time merely in venting or airing 
     <lb/>
     grievances with destructive criticisms. We will 
     <lb/>
     all have to weigh very carefully the possible 
     <lb/>
     effect of our words before uttering them, espe<lb break="no"/>cially in the heat of debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that we have a great and glorious 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of showing not only to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland who have elected us, but to the 
     <lb/>
     whole British Commonwealth, those of our 
     <lb/>
     neighbouring Dominion and the United States, 
     <lb/>
     upon all of whom we are so greatly dependent for 
     <lb/>
     our future welfare, that we are capable of discuss<lb break="no"/>ing in a frank but dignified and friendly spirit the 
     <lb/>
     somewhat involved problems of our future status. 
     <lb/>
     Let us not forget, however, that true as it is that 
     <lb/>
     we are largely dependent upon others, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly upon the United Kingdom, Canada and 
     <lb/>
     the United States, for our future welfare, it has 
     <lb/>
     been clearly demonstrated during the past 
     <lb/>
     strenuous six years that the many millions of 
     <lb/>
     people in these great countries are to a consider<lb break="no"/>able extent dependent for their protection upon 
     <lb/>
     the territory of our island, our Labrador territory, 
     <lb/>
     and our resources. This fact alone should assure 
     <lb/>
     us of sympathetic interest from the people of all 
     <lb/>
     these countries in our endeavours to maintain a 
     <lb/>
     decent standard of living here, under as inde<lb break="no"/>pendent an administration as this Convention and 
     <lb/>
     our electors may eventually decide to be the best 
     <lb/>
     for our circumstances. These neighbours all have 
     <lb/>
     an interest in seeing a happy and contented 
     <lb/>
     people here, and will not forget that the Atlantic 
     <lb/>
     Charter was solemnly negotiated in New<lb break="no"/>foundland waters. Do what we will, our future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity is dependent upon our economic rela<lb break="no"/>tions, especially our customs tariffs with the 
     <lb/>
     mother country, Canada and the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and upon our co-operation with all three of these 
     <lb/>
     great nations. I regard this as the most important 
     <lb/>
     sentence in my address. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The wide scope of our duties is shown by the 
     <lb/>
     opening paragraph of our National Convention 
     <lb/>
     Act,<ref target="#fn_z1">[1]</ref> which reads as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     Whereas it has been decided that 
     <lb/>
     provision should be made for enabling the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to examine the fu<lb break="no"/><cb/>ture of the Island and express their con<lb break="no"/>sidered views as to suitable forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment for the Island, having regard to the 
     <lb/>
     financial and economic conditions prevailing 
     <lb/>
     therein, and that this provision could most 
     <lb/>
     appropriately be the holding of an elected 
     <lb/>
     National Convention of Newfoundlanders.

            </quote>

            <p>
     Some of us have come here with more or less 
     <lb/>
     fixed ideas as to our future form of government, 
     <lb/>
     but the majority of the delegates will agree. that 
     <lb/>
     however rigid these ideas may be in some minds, 
     <lb/>
     it is our duty to be ready to modify or change them 
     <lb/>
     in accordance with the weight of evidence which 
     <lb/>
     will be produced as the result of our investi<lb break="no"/>gations and deliberations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel sure that unless this National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion is conducted (as I hope and believe it will be) 
     <lb/>
     in an open-minded way, and that unless we grasp 
     <lb/>
     this opportunity of showing to those who have 
     <lb/>
     elected us that we are capable of that "quiet calm 
     <lb/>
     deliberation which disentangles every knot", we 
     <lb/>
     will not be able to convince the electorate of this 
     <lb/>
     country, or of any other country, that we are 
     <lb/>
     qualified to revert in the immediate or even the 
     <lb/>
     distant future to the management of our own 
     <lb/>
     affairs. I think that most of us will probably agree 
     <lb/>
     that the goal at which every true Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     must eventually aim is self-government in some 
     <lb/>
     form or another, with or without restrictions, but 
     <lb/>
     whether the time for this has yet arrived, is a 
     <lb/>
     matter upon which no one should venture a 
     <lb/>
     definite opinion until there has been an exhaus<lb break="no"/>tive investigation into our current position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think that the electorate might justifiably 
     <lb/>
     reject any recommendations this Convention 
     <lb/>
     may make for self-government, or any other form 
     <lb/>
     of government, if we fail to discuss our future 
     <lb/>
     problems in a thoroughly searching manner. Un<lb break="no"/>less we can furnish an intelligent, well-reasoned 
     <lb/>
     report, there would be very poor hope that these 
     <lb/>
     recommendations would be adopted upon sub<lb break="no"/>mission to the electorate. An intelligent well 
     <lb/>
     reasoned report cannot be made without an ex<lb break="no"/>haustive debate upon the pros and cons of any 
     <lb/>
     changes favoured, after first securing every par<lb break="no"/>ticle of information we can gather to shed light 
     <lb/>
     upon our future economic position. There will no 
     <lb/>
     doubt be some expert advice offered to us. We 
     <lb/>
     should give such advice very careful considera<lb break="no"/>tion, but will have to use our own judgment as to 
     <lb/>

     whether the advice is sound as applied to our own 
     <lb/>
     particular problems. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Careful compliance by members with 
     <lb/>
     whatever rules of procedure may be adopted and 
     <lb/>
     utmost respect for the Chair and the rulings of our 
     <lb/>
     distinguished and experienced Chairman, will 
     <lb/>
     help create a pleasant atmosphere inside the Con<lb break="no"/>vention chamber and gain respect and confidence 
     <lb/>
     outside of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is in my opinion one regrettable feature 
     <lb/>
     about the composition of this National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and that is that our returned service men, 
     <lb/>
     especially of the younger generation, are not 
     <lb/>
     represented in a desirable proportion. The same 
     <lb/>
     remark may apply to the women of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, both those who have served abroad 
     <lb/>
     and those who have worked so hard for the com<lb break="no"/>mon good at home, during the past six years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suggest that this defect might be partially 
     <lb/>
     remedied by our inviting or requesting the 
     <lb/>
     GWVA<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> and indeed any other large association 
     <lb/>
     not adequately represented in this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     including one of the ladies organisations, such as 
     <lb/>
     the Jubilee Guilds,<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> to submit their considered 
     <lb/>
     views in writing, or to send a deputation to present 
     <lb/>
     them during the session of the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel quite incompetent to express in adequate 
     <lb/>
     terms our good fortune in being able to welcome 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency Sir Gordon Macdonald, 
     <lb/>
     KCMG, in his position as the representative of 
     <lb/>
     His Majesty and also as Chairman of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government to open the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention During the few months in 
     <lb/>
     which he has resided with us, His Excellency has 
     <lb/>
     displayed such amazing energy and such charm<lb break="no"/>ing tact that he has already endeared himself to 
     <lb/>
     our people of all classes. His delightfully sympa<lb break="no"/>thetic radio addresses, and more especially his 
     <lb/>
     personal contacts with the people residing in the 
     <lb/>
     very large number of places which he has visited, 
     <lb/>
     have definitely reached our hearts. It augues well 
     <lb/>
     for the future of this country that we have at this 
     <lb/>
     critical time as the nominal chief executive of our 
     <lb/>
     little Dominion (or should I say ancient. colony) 
     <lb/>
     one who has already shown such deep and intel<lb break="no"/>ligent interest in our problems, and one who has 
     <lb/>
     travelled already thousands of miles over our 
     <lb/>
     country, underby no means luxurious conditions, 
     <lb/>
     to see for himself the surroundings and especially 
     <lb/>
           
     <note xml:id="fn_01">[1] The Great War Veterans' Association.</note> 
     <lb/><note xml:id="fn_02">[2] A community service and self help group formed in 1935.</note><lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     the standards of living of our most important 
     <lb/>
     primary producers, namely, our fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     woodsmen, miners and farmers. His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     can rest assured that thanks to his fine addresses 
     <lb/>
     and evident sincerity, he has impressed the 
     <lb/>
     people of the capital as much as those of the 
     <lb/>
     outports, and can count on their full support.

            </p>

            <p>
     During the period in which the government by 
     <lb/>
     Commission in its present form continues to 
     <lb/>
     exist, I think we will most of us be happy to feel 
     <lb/>
     that the Chairman of the Commission is one who 
     <lb/>
     has wide experience in the management of public 
     <lb/>
     affairs, and is one who has shown the qualities of 
     <lb/>
     a statesman. With all due respect to the other 
     <lb/>
     members of the Commission of Government, we 
     <lb/>
     may perhaps be permitted to hope that His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency's influence during the continuation 
     <lb/>
     of the government in its present form will he 
     <lb/>
     more than merely nominal.

            </p>

            <p>
     The wise words and sound advice of His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency the Governor are on record and speak 
     <lb/>
     eloquently for themselves and need no comment 
     <lb/>
     from me; therefore Mr. Chairman, I now have the 
     <lb/>
     honour to move:

            <p>
     In supporting the motion I cannot but help 
     <lb/>
     make note of the fitness of the previous speaker 
     <lb/>
     for this occasion in view of the epoch-making 
     <lb/>
     nature of this unique constitutional assembly. For 
     <lb/>
     history is being made today as well as yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Job is very much a part of that history. 
     <lb/>
     He is one of the few living members of the former 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, which in this very building 
     <lb/>
     less than a score of years ago made laws for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders. Further<lb break="no"/>more, two or three years past, when comment on 
     <lb/>
     our confused status was frequent, Mr. Job in 
     <lb/>
     communications to the daily press suggested a 
     <lb/>
     body somewhat similar to the present National 
     <lb/>
     Convention to discuss our affairs; and it must be 
     <lb/>
     a source of pride and satisfaction to him now to 
     <lb/>
     realise that his suggestions undoubtedly had 
     <lb/>
     some, if not considerable bearing on subsequent 
     <lb/>
     developments Finally, Mr. Job comes from a 
     <lb/>
     family long associated with the life of this 
     <lb/>
     country in all its phases and aspects; he himself 
     <lb/>
     speaks with the wisdom of many years of the 
     <lb/>
     same experience and the sincerity of his words on 
     <lb/>
     this occasion cannot be questioned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For myself, I speak as a young man relatively 
     <lb/>
     unexperienced and untried in politics and govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but willing to learn and eager to serve to 
     <lb/>
     the best of my ability the land in which I was born. 
     <lb/>
     My family too has had long associations with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Their part may have been less 
     <lb/>
     spectacular, but nonetheless heroic. They were 
     <lb/>
     the good fishermen and farmers, tradesmen and 
     <lb/>
     sailors, the good wives and the good mothers. 
     <lb/>
     They worked hard for what they got; they loved 
     <lb/>
     this land for the work it gave them, and the 
     <lb/>
     freedom which in time they won because of their 
     <lb/>
     work and their zeal. The family antecedents of 
     <lb/>
     each man here fall into one of these two groups. 
     <lb/>
     Now the wheel has come full circle and we are 
     <lb/>
     here to serve their memory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Governor's speech, as indeed was ex<lb break="no"/>pected, fully lives up to the forthright, energetic 
     <lb/>
     and sincere individual whom we have met and 
     <lb/>
     heard in recent months. Being appointed to his 
     <lb/>
     responsible position at such a critical time, he has 
     <lb/>
     made every effort to acquaint himself first-hand 
     <lb/>
     with the country and the people, and not even 
     <lb/>
     Mercury, the winged messenger of mythology, 
     <lb/>
     could have travelled as fast and so far in the 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     interests of a better understanding, than Sir Gor<lb break="no"/>don has since his arrival. He has spoken of the 
     <lb/>
     honour and the responsibility that is ours, and the 
     <lb/>
     great opportunity we have for selfless patriotism. 
     <lb/>
     And he has refreshed our memories concerning 
     <lb/>
     the ancient glories of this, the people's house, and 
     <lb/>
     the honourable giants of men who in the past 
     <lb/>
     rendered noble service in the cause of their 
     <lb/>
     fatherland. In truth, I may say, as many other 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders are saying, we are glad that Sir 
     <lb/>
     Gordon Macdonald, "a man's man", is amongst 
     <lb/>
     us at this hour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A moment ago I said history is being made 
     <lb/>
     today. It prompts me to wonder if men who make 
     <lb/>
     history truly realise it at the time. I doubt if they 
     <lb/>
     do for such a realisation is almost enough to 
     <lb/>
     unman them. Still, whether we realise it or not, 
     <lb/>
     history is being made and it will continue to be 
     <lb/>
     made when this Convention has been disbanded 
     <lb/>
     and dispersed; and our names are on the records 
     <lb/>
     of history, for good or ill, and for the inspiration 
     <lb/>
     or dismay of those who come after us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundlanders have lived under many ad<lb break="no"/>ministrations and many forms of constitutional 
     <lb/>
     assemblies, but search as we may, we can find no 
     <lb/>
     precedent for the present body of which we are 
     <lb/>
     members. Yet that fact which may have been a 
     <lb/>
     concern to some of us, need not be a deterrent; 
     <lb/>
     for even the most conservative man will admit 
     <lb/>
     there must be a first time for everything. Inas<lb break="no"/>much as a man, according to Warburg, "cannot 
     <lb/>
     be a conservative until he has something to lose," 
     <lb/>
     I might say, perhaps, that a man cannot be other 
     <lb/>
     things until he has something to gain. And I say, 
     <lb/>
     let no man in this house be swayed by the thought 
     <lb/>
     of what he may lose or gain at this most critical 
     <lb/>
     juncture of our history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are older men here with a first-hand 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of days that are past, and young men 
     <lb/>
     like myself, whose knowledge for the most part 
     <lb/>
     is confined to what we have read and heard. There 
     <lb/>
     are men here who have been in government, and 
     <lb/>
     men who hope to be in it in the future. There are 
     <lb/>
     men here who cleave to certain ideas and turn 
     <lb/>
     away from other beliefs, and Walter Lippman 
     <lb/>
     remarks that "Men are much more likely to see 
     <lb/>
     the truth in that which they love than in that which 
     <lb/>
     they hate." Therefore there is need for calmness 
     <lb/>
     and unprejudice; for patience and tolerance. 
     <lb/>
     What we need to bring to this Convention, more 
     <lb/>
     than an open mind, is a fair mind that will respect 
     <lb/>

     each and every man's opinion, whatever our own 
     <lb/>
     beliefs or determination. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let every man too, be fearless and outspoken, 
     <lb/>
     within the bounds of the agreed rules of proce<lb break="no"/>dure, and with due respect for the Chair. Let no 
     <lb/>
     man be awed by the glib and prolix amongst us; 
     <lb/>
     each of us has his convictions and it is imperative 
     <lb/>
     that we express ourselves. Let us do so with 
     <lb/>
     directness, remembering at all times to preserve 
     <lb/>
     the dignity of this assembly in the face of the 
     <lb/>
     country and the outside world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No government in this country has ever under<lb break="no"/>taken so grave a responsibility as that which 
     <lb/>
     weighs on this assembly: to recommend a con<lb break="no"/>stitution or constitutions for the choice of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. We are told that the 
     <lb/>
     people want this or that, when in truth what the 
     <lb/>
     people want, simply, is a guarantee — a guaran<lb break="no"/>tee of good government and a guarantee that 
     <lb/>
     capable and honest men will not be lacking for 
     <lb/>
     the conduct of affairs. Given that guarantee, the 
     <lb/>
     present indecision about self-government will be 
     <lb/>
     swept away. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Too much time is devoted to talking about the 
     <lb/>
     problem of Newfoundland and not enough ener<lb break="no"/>gy applied to finding a solution. The prophets of 
     <lb/>
     gloom assert we are eternally on the edge of an 
     <lb/>
     abyss; that nothing can be done; that we have no 
     <lb/>
     future — as though no other country ever had a 
     <lb/>
     problem. What is this fantastic problem of New<lb break="no"/>foundland? We speak the same language; we 
     <lb/>
     enjoy religious freedom; we have no persecuted 
     <lb/>
     minorities; we do not want to make war on 
     <lb/>
     anybody to gain more living space. In this 
     <lb/>
     modern day our fishery resources are virtually 
     <lb/>
     untapped; we have forests; we have minerals; we 
     <lb/>
     are a hard-working and good-living people. 
     <lb/>
     Where then is the problem? It is nothing more or 
     <lb/>
     less than ourselves; we will not trust ourselves to 
     <lb/>
     ourselves and so we trust ourselves to others. 
     <lb/>
     That is not a problem — it is a state of mind that 
     <lb/>
     only mutual trust and a belief in our own integrity 
     <lb/>
     can overcome. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Part of that state of mind is our readiness to 
     <lb/>
     take the line of least resistance. It is so much 
     <lb/>
     easier to assume that nothing can be done than to 
     <lb/>
     actually try to accomplish some end. It brings to 
     <lb/>
     mind the phrase of an anonymous writer: "The 
     <lb/>
     reason some men do not succeed is because their 
     <lb/>
     wishbone is where their backbone ought to be." 
     <lb/>
     Is that part of our problem? Do we spend too 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     much time wishing for something to happen in<lb break="no"/>stead of working to make things happen? Is that 
     <lb/>
     why we feel we cannot run our country, because 
     <lb/>
     we haven't the backbone, and so we turn it over 
     <lb/>
     to others who have the backbone, but unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately for us have not the same ends in view? I 
     <lb/>
     think that the root of our problem is spiritual; not 
     <lb/>
     in the religious sense, but in the sense that means 
     <lb/>
     enthusiastic, mettlesome, animated with a belief 
     <lb/>
     and a flaming desire to make Newfoundland a 
     <lb/>
     better home, and Newfoundlanders a name to 
     <lb/>
     conjure with among all men. We are still a 
     <lb/>
     pioneer country, and we need the pioneer spirit, 
     <lb/>
     unafraid to blaze new trails, cross new frontiers, 
     <lb/>
     and look ahead to far horizons of achievement. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     In closing my remarks in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     seconding of the motion proposed by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Job, I address a special word to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, by whose faith in us we 
     <lb/>
     are here. Your responsibility did not end with the 
     <lb/>
     elections in June, for the most important vote you 
     <lb/>
     will ever make will be cast on the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions of this Convention in a future referendum. 
     <lb/>
     You must keep informed, and we will see to it 
     <lb/>
     that you are kept informed by radio and 
     <lb/>
     newspaper so that you will be enabled when the 
     <lb/>
     time comes to make the right decision. And in 
     <lb/>
     urging you to follow the proceedings of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention with all your attention, standing here in 
     <lb/>
     this chamber peopled with the ghosts of many 
     <lb/>
     public-spirited men, I warn you that no system 
     <lb/>
     can guarantee self-govemment to a people too 
     <lb/>
     indolent, too ignorant or too indifferent to cherish 
     <lb/>
     and fight for its own freedom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is in this spirit, Mr. Chairman and members 
     <lb/>
     of the National Convention, that I second the 
     <lb/>
     motion made by the Hon. Mr. Job that an address 
     <lb/>
     of loyalty be presented to His Majesty the King 
     <lb/>
     and an address of thanks be presented to His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency the Governor from this Convention. 
     <lb/></p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Does any other member
                                          wish to <lb/> speak to the motion? If not, is the
                                          Convention <lb/> ready for the question? <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     It has been proposed by Mr. Job and seconded 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Harrington that the Chairman of this Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention be requested to appoint a 
     <lb/>
     select committee to draft in suitable form two 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, one of which will be to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     the members of this National Convention, elected 
     <lb/>
     by the people of Newfoundland, desire to place 
     <lb/>
     on record, as their first act, an expression of

     sincere loyalty to His Most Gracious Majesty 
     <lb/>
     King George VI, and the other resolution to the 
     <lb/>
     effect that the Convention wishes to express its 
     <lb/>
     sincere thanks to His Excellency the Governor, 
     <lb/>
     Sir Gordon Macdonald, K.C.M.G., for his inspir<lb break="no"/>ing and forceful address on opening the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of this National Convention.

            <p>
     The committee on the address of loyalty to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty the King and of thanks to His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     the Governor will be:

            <p>
     I would suggest that Hon. Mr. Job might be 
     <lb/>
     the convenor of this committee. As I said to you 
     <lb/>
     yesterday, I submit for your consideration the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of the immediate appointment of a 
     <lb/>
     committee on rules and procedure. I need not 
     <lb/>
     stress the special importance and necessity of 
     <lb/>
     this. I suggest that the committee be immediately 
     <lb/>
     appointed to take up this all important matter. 
     <lb/></p>

     the rules of the House of Assembly, as we once

     knew them, should apply as far as possible to 
     <lb/>
     these proceedings of the Convention. When the 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
       
     committee has completed its task and made its 
     <lb/>
     report and you have accepted it, these rules will 
     <lb/>
     supplant the old rules. Perhaps one of you will 
     <lb/>
     propose and second the application of those rules 
     <lb/>
     to the Convention whilst awaiting the report of 
     <lb/>
     the committee.

                                          particular information? And <lb/> such requests having
                                          been made, would they be <lb/> deemed to be going to the
                                          party concerned as <lb/> from an individual, or would they
                                          be vetted by <lb/> the Convention and then come to the
                                          government <lb/> as a whole? And should they be directed
                                          to the <lb/> government as a whole, or to individual

                                          On these ques<lb break="no"/>tions I am very vague in the

                                          a great <lb/> amount of information will be sought from
                                          the <lb/> government. No doubt, the procedure for doing
                                          <lb/> so will be laid down in the rules, which may take
                                          <lb/> two or three weeks and in the meantime many <lb/>
                                          members may have questions on which they <lb/> desire
                                          authentic information. I do not know <lb/> whether members

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It appears to me that if we are going <lb/>about
                                          this inquiry into the state of affairs of our
                                          <lb/>country, and if we are to be delayed by each
                                          <lb/>member's asking any question as might occur to
                                          <lb/>him overnight, we are not tackling the matter in
                                          <lb/>the best systematic manner. We have a factual
                                          <lb/>statement of affairs in the Amulree Report<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> up to <lb/>1934. Our
                                          business is to find out how things stand <lb/>now; what
                                          has happened between 1934 and the <lb/>present time, and
                                          whether or not we are financial<lb break="no"/>ly and
                                          economically sound or self-supporting. If <lb/>we are to
                                          tackle it in the proper manner, we ought <lb/>to take it
                                          subjectively: take finance, deal with it <lb/>and be done
                                          with it; take fisheries, deal with each <lb/>matter under
                                          its own heading. I referred to the <lb/>Amulree Report. I
                                          think that report is pretty near <lb/>correct. We ought to
                                          deal with one department of <lb/>Newfoundland affairs at
                                          one time and be done <lb/>with it. What makes me speak of
                                          this is that I saw <lb/>a communication in the press where
                                          one of the <lb/>delegates had received a letter from the
                                          <lb/>Governor's private secretary relative to the
                                          <lb/>departure of the Commissioner of Finance.<ref target="#fn_04">[2]</ref> It <lb/>was thought that
                                          the commissioner ought not to <lb/>be leaving at this
                                          particular juncture. We had the <lb/>assurance given us
                                          that the Commissioner for <lb/>Finance would be here for
                                          two weeks. Therefore, <lb/>we ought to tackle the problem
                                          of finance first. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> The object is to inquire

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> After listening to the two previous <lb/>speakers, I
                                          am of the opinion that there has not <lb/>been enough
                                          provision made, and it would now <lb/>appear that the best
                                          thing would be to appoint a <lb/>special committee to
                                          draft a plan of action.... <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I had in mind, subject to the <lb/>wishes of the
                                          Convention, a steering committee, <lb/>that would have the
                                          setting out of the rotation of <lb/>business and plan of
                                          campaign. If my suggestion <lb/>is agreeable, the

            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> It is not, I take it, intended to limit <lb/>the

                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In the old days we had the order <lb/>paper, and
                                          the order paper was the daily agenda. <lb/>We will have to
                                          have the same method to enable <lb/>us to know what is
                                          going to be discussed and by <lb/>whom. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> As perhaps the oldest member of this <lb/>House, I
                                          might say that I do not see how we can <lb/>progress
                                          without some line of procedure. I move <lb/>that this
                                          house will adjourn until such time as the <lb/>Committee
                                          on Rules and Procedure has drafted a <lb/>plan and it is
                                          adopted, so that the House can be <lb/>guided by that line
                                          of procedure in the right way. <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am inclined to agree with <lb/>Mr. Hollett. One of
                                          the commissioners is leaving <lb/>Newfoundland; he holds a
                                          most important posi<lb break="no"/>tion in the government
                                          in regard to finance. <lb/>Whilst I agree with Mr. Brown
                                          that without cer<lb break="no"/>tain rules we cannot
                                          proceed, I feel we should <lb/>take advantage of the
                                          commissioner's presence <lb/>and direct financial
                                          questions to him. I would <lb/>suggest that these
                                          questions be put on the order <lb/>paper and that Mr. Wild
                                          come here and be further <lb/>able to answer questions
                                          that are not quite clear. <lb/>You will remember, Mr.
                                          Chairman, what hap<lb break="no"/>pened in the old days. A
                                          member placed ques<lb break="no"/>tions on the paper
                                          directed to the finance <lb/>department and the next day
                                          the department <lb/>tabled the information; and if the
                                          inquisitor <lb/>wanted any further information, the
                                          minister was <lb/>there and he got up and said "I want to
                                          know <lb/>something else." The only way to get information
                                          <lb/>is to have the Commissioner of Finance here and
                                          <lb/>whoever wants to ask a question, the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner is here to answer it. <lb/>

                                          asking of <lb/> questions was not the time for debate. The
                                          <lb/> answers could not be debated, but any explana<lb break="no"/>tion necessary could be made; then
                                          further ques<lb break="no"/>tions asked if the answer was

                                          <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I take it the idea of the
                                          Chair is that this <lb/> committee should deal with the
                                          question of a <lb/> programme. In view of the great
                                          importance of <lb/> this finance matter, I suggest that
                                          this committee <lb/> meet tomorrow and that the first item
                                          would be <lb/> the question of finance, and that would
                                          enable us <lb/> to meet and go ahead with that question.
                                          The <lb/> setting up of a programme, as stated by Mr.
                                                 Fog<lb break="no"/>will, is very important

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is evidently
                                          desirable to take <lb/> these matters up. <lb/>

                                          desirable to <lb/> plan a programme. I agree also with
                                          Major <lb/> Cashin in what he said regarding the presence
                                          of <lb/> the Commissioner for Finance. But why wait for
                                          <lb/> the Committee on Rules and Procedure? Decide <lb/>
                                          now. If we are to get information from the finance <lb/>
                                          department, then that is that. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The questions I have submitted <lb/>are typical of

                                          the question, and had <lb/>replied in writing. When he has
                                          produced the <lb/>documents then he could be here for

                                          <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Do we know what powers we
                                          have <lb/>
                                          <cb/> to summon anyone, whether it be a commissioner <lb/>
                                          or not? We should define our authority. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The Convention has no
                                          power <lb/> to compel attendance or to compel him to
                                          answer <lb/> questions. In the old days the statutory
                                          rules did <lb/> not cover this and they were amended in
                                          1890 by <lb/> laying down what is known as statutory
                                          authority <lb/> to subpoena witnesses and a committee
                                          would <lb/> take evidence on a particular point. This was
                                          <lb/> found not only desirable, but the only practical
                                          <lb/> method. The witness on a particular point would
                                          <lb/> attend before a select committee. They had <lb/>
                                          statutory authority and these witnesses were re<lb break="no"/>quired to answer. I am not giving a
                                          judicial <lb/> opinion, of course. There is no express
                                          authority <lb/> in the Convention Act giving the
                                          Convention <lb/> power to subpoena witnesses. <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> if we are going to
                                          discuss mat<lb break="no"/>ters, we must have evidence. If
                                          we have no <lb/> power, then our attendance seems useless.
                                          If you <lb/> would point out to us where we can get such
                                          <lb/> authority, it would be helpful. <lb/>

                                          be time for <lb/> that when we find they will not attend.
                                          I think <lb/> they will give us the information. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I can quite understand
                                          the desire of <lb/> every member of this Convention to

                                          popularly <lb/> elected body in Newfoundland, the first
                                          elected <lb/> body since 1932; His Excellency has con<lb break="no"/>spicuously graced it and appealed to

                                          come and <lb/> opened it and there exists all over the

                                          <lb/> Convention, and the last thing on earth the Com<lb break="no"/>mission would dare to do is refuse
                                          information <lb/> that we must have. There is no
                                          industrial concern, <lb/> no commercial society which
                                          would not be happy <lb/> to come here or write us in

                                          refuse it. With <lb/> all due respect, it is anticipating
                                          a most unlikely <lb/> thing to happen and if it does we
                                          will know how <lb/> to deal with it. There is a matter I

                                          visitors <lb/> Would this be a matter for the committee -
                                          <lb/> could it be arranged through the issuance of tick<lb break="no"/>ets or through delegates, so that
                                          anyone who <lb/> wishes to attend a particular session may
                                          do so? <lb/> A member may have three or four constituents <lb/>
                                          <cb/> who might wish to attend and they should not have

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think that can be arranged; but <lb/>the general

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The questions asked by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood at the last sitting have been trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to the department concerned, but as yet no 
     <lb/>
     reply has been received. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt As it is commonly reported that during 
     <lb/>
     the deliberations between a deputation of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government and the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Secretary in London during the summer of 1944, 
     <lb/>
     the then Dominions Secretary, speaking with the 
     <lb/>
      approval of the Cabinet, offered to cancel the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland sterling debt, or alternatively to 
     <lb/>make annual grant for several years that would in 
     <lb/>total be the equivalent of this debt, I give notice 
     <lb/>that I will at the next meeting request the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner for Finance or the department con<lb break="no"/>cerned to table the following information: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>1. Is this report accurate in part or in full? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. If so, has the decision or proposal then 
     <lb/>made been altered, amended or rescinded? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     3. If it has been rescinded, has the commis<lb break="no"/>sioner any knowledge that it is the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of the British government to make 
     <lb/>an alternative offer or financial or eco<lb break="no"/>nomic assistance to Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>any shape or form? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    

            <p>
     4. If any offer of assistance is to be made, 
     <lb/>
    what is its nature? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     We, the duly elected representatives of the

     people of Newfoundland in National Con<lb break="no"/>vention assembled do hereby desire to con<lb break="no"/>vey through you, as our first official act, an 
     <lb/>
     affirmation of our deepest loyalty to His 
     <lb/>
     Most Gracious Majesty King George VI, and

     We, the delegates of the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion in session assembled beg to thank Your

     Excellency for the gracious speech which 
     <lb/>
     you have been pleased to deliver at the open<lb break="no"/>ing session of the National Convention.

     Mr. Chairman I would accept a motion for the

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Apropos of that, His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     is not in town at the moment. In the old days the 
     <lb/>
     procedure was for a delegation to proceed to 
     <lb/>
     Government House and to present to His Excel~ 
     <lb/>
     lency the address in reply. Similar procedure 
     <lb/>
     might be followed in regard to the address of 
     <lb/>
     loyalty and the address of thanks; but as the 
     <lb/>
     Governor will not return for a fortnight, do you 
     <lb/>
     wish that the delegation should go to Government 
     <lb/>
