<!--<p>
     in our sinking fund? I say that statement is not 
     <lb/>
     true on the basis of the reply. Not a cent has been 
     <lb/>
     plundered, and in common fairness that state<lb break="no"/>ment must be proved or it must be retracted. We 
     <lb/>
     must draw a line somewhere with these charges 
     <lb/>
     of graft, of corruption and plundering. Talk of 
     <lb/>
     faith — how can we have faith if $1.75 million 
     <lb/>
     can be robbed and nothing done about it? Or if 
     <lb/>
     we can sit back and smile, as if the amount 
     <lb/>
     plundered is so much chickenfeed, and is so 
     <lb/>
     commonplace that we can afford to take it in our 
     <lb/>
     stride and forget about it? I am not going to forget 
     <lb/>
     about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman What steps can the Convention 
     <lb/>
     take in the matter? If there has been any sugges<lb break="no"/>tion of criminal libel, that is a matter of no con<lb break="no"/>cern to me or to the Convention. The person or 
     <lb/>
     persons who made it, if called upon to prove it or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, would have to go before a jury of 
     <lb/>
     peers. We are not sitting as a court of trial. I am 
     <lb/>
     Chairman of a fact-finding body. I wish all refer<lb break="no"/>ence to libel would be dropped, as there is no 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that we are going to try it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I am not suggesting legal ac<lb break="no"/>tion, I am suggesting this: Major Cashin made the 
     <lb/>
     statement in public session ... that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has been plundered of $1.75 million in our sink<lb break="no"/>ing fund — a most serious, grave, shocking state<lb break="no"/>ment, calculated if not disproved, if accepted as 
     <lb/>
     truth, to undermine all confidence and all faith in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Therefore what I suggest is either 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Cashin should proceed to prove his statement 
     <lb/>
     or withdraw it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I see absolutely no reason whatever 
     <lb/>
     for Major Cashin to prove his statement. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has not proven that Major Cashin was 
     <lb/>
     incorrect. He has not shown us how much of the 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund was spent in England to redeem or 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     buy up Newfoundland bonds. That document 
     <lb/>
     does not state that. Therefore he has not proven 
     <lb/>
     whether or not we lost money. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     has not proved that Major Cashin was wrong 
     <lb/>
     when he said we had lost $1.75 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Again I want to remind mem<lb break="no"/>bers that as far as I am concerned, so long as the 
     <lb/>
     proprieties of debate are observed, no member is 
     <lb/>
     going to be placed in a position where he has to 
     <lb/>
     defend his opinions. Major Cashin has expressed 
     <lb/>
     an opinion. If he chooses to defend that opinion, 
     <lb/>
     that is a matter for his discretion. Certainly as far 
     <lb/>
     as I am concerned, the question as to whether or 
     <lb/>
     not he proves it or disproves it is entirely up to 
     <lb/>
     himself. Again I want to say the proof of any 
     <lb/>
     statement made here, libellous or otherwise, is a 
     <lb/>
     matter with which I have no concern as a Chair<lb break="no"/>man of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Miller I wonder if each member will be 
     <lb/>
     supplied with a copy of the government's

            <p>Mr. Chairman I will have them tomorrow. I am 
     <lb/>assuming that Major Cashin will wind up the 
     <lb/>debate by dealing with questions directed to him 
     <lb/>during the course of the debate. Therefore ... I 
     <lb/>would like it to be understood that if no member 
     <lb/>occupies the floor, I will assume that no member 
     <lb/>desires to address himself further on the 
     <lb/>Economic Report. I will thereupon call upon 
     <lb/>Major Cashin to wind the matter up. If any mem<lb break="no"/>ber has anything to say on the Economic Report, 
     <lb/>I wish he would take the floor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin In view of the fact that there are 
     <lb/>
     several questions outstanding to which I have not 
     <lb/>
     received answers, I am not in a position to go 
     <lb/>
     ahead and finish this aftemoon....

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before, sir, we go on to the busi<lb break="no"/>ness on the order paper today I would like to 
     <lb/>
     submit to you and the Convention, an idea that I 
     <lb/>
     think is well worth our consideration. As you 
     <lb/>
     know, representatives of this country have been 
     <lb/>
     attending a convention at Geneva for many 
     <lb/>
     months, and have made a report in recent days to 
     <lb/>
     the government through Mr. Howell, Secretary 
     <lb/>
     for Customs. I suggest it would be most important 
     <lb/>
     for the members of this Convention to understand 
     <lb/>
     exactly what good is to be derived from the 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           

     meetings held at Geneva. For that purpose I 
     <lb/>
     propose that, if the Convention will agree to it, I 
     <lb/>
     will move that we have a private session at the 
     <lb/>
     completion of today's business, or at the earliest 
     <lb/>
     possible moment, with Mr. Howell, to get an 
     <lb/>
     understanding of what this whole business means 
     <lb/>
     for the country, for our trade, and for general 
     <lb/>
     customs duties. I don't know what time would be 
     <lb/>
     convenient or agreeable, but we might have it in 
     <lb/>
     the night, or have a private session tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     afternoon. It should be part of the Economic

     Report of the Finance Committee: Economic Report

            </head>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRAN1">Mr. Cranford</persName> ....Being a member of the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee, I had no intention of speak<lb break="no"/>ing on this Economic Report as I had given it 
     <lb/>
     every consideration before endorsing it. But the 
     <lb/>
     critics of this report have not even given the 
     <lb/>
     Committee the credit of admitting that some 
     <lb/>
     points of our report have been made by surmise 
     <lb/>
     or even conjecture. One member has shouted, 
     <lb/>
     "Let us be honest with ourselves — let us face the 
     <lb/>
     brutal facts". I cannot help but accept that chal<lb break="no"/>lenge, and will not forget it while this Convention 
     <lb/>
     lasts, as it rings in my ears day and night; not 
     <lb/>
     because I am afraid of being charged with 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty, but because I wonder if the people 
     <lb/>
     who are listening in will take it in the same spirit 
     <lb/>
     of why it was said as I do, and that it was nothing 
     <lb/>
     more or less than playing politics; I am sure that 
     <lb/>
     the person who shouted such words would not 
     <lb/>
     attempt to accuse any member of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee of being dishonest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, there has been thrown at the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee the condition of the fisherman in certain sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the country. Certainly these critics do not 
     <lb/>
     mean to try to say that the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee have no regard for the fisher<lb break="no"/>men of this country, particularly myself who has 
     <lb/>
     been a fisherman all my lifetime and has met with 
     <lb/>
     many reverses, perhaps more than any other than 
     <lb/>
     in this country, as I have always tried to market 
     <lb/>
     my own products. How well I remember 18 years 
     <lb/>
     ago when I began shipping fresh salmon to the 
     <lb/>
     Boston market on commission basis, salmon I 
     <lb/>
     had caught and bought. The largest shipment for 
     <lb/>
     that season had reached Boston on a Friday after<lb break="no"/>noon, too late for that day's consumption. It was 
     <lb/>
     the only salmon that my agent had for that day, 
     <lb/>
     and would have fetched a fair price but for the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     fact a Newfoundland firm had gone to a cold 
     <lb/>
     storage and got two carloads of frozen salmon 
     <lb/>
     and placed it on the market. Their salmon were 
     <lb/>
     bid in and placed back in cold storage and mine 
     <lb/>
     was sold at a loss, as the commission agent had 
     <lb/>
     no cold storage facilities. I lost more than the 
     <lb/>
     value of my whole season's catch. The commis<lb break="no"/>sion agent could not understand the attitude of 
     <lb/>
     this experienced firm, to have salmon from the 
     <lb/>
     cold storage on the market on a Friday afternoon. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, I understood it thoroughly and so do 
     <lb/>
     all my listeners. This did not discourage me as I 
     <lb/>
     have been shipping salmon ever since. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So you see, fishermen are going to meet rever<lb break="no"/>ses through bad voyages and poor markets. But 
     <lb/>
     the point I want to make is this: the critics of the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report who bring in the misfortune of 
     <lb/>
     our hard-working fishermen and throw it at the 
     <lb/>
     writers of the report, are only doing it for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of political propaganda and playing 
     <lb/>
     upon the misfortunes of our fishermen for their 
     <lb/>
     own political ends. My sympathy goes out to 
     <lb/>
     those fishermen who have toiled all season with 
     <lb/>
     practically no returns; and only fishermen like 
     <lb/>
     myself who have had the same experience know 
     <lb/>
     the feeling of it. And I, as a fisherman, dare any 
     <lb/>
     person to say that I have not used all my energy 
     <lb/>
     and influence in the interest of the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     while at this Convention. Many members have 
     <lb/>
     heard me say that the only industry that should 
     <lb/>
     have any protection, particularly customs tariff 
     <lb/>
     protection, is the fishermen. Also I have said, 
     <lb/>
     "Never mind the businessmen, protect the fisher<lb break="no"/>men and workers of this country to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     having them support their families, and business<lb break="no"/>men are duds if they cannot do business". 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If no other member rises and

     occupies the floor, I will assume that they or he 
     <lb/>
     as the case may be, are not interested in express<lb break="no"/>ing any further views on the Economic Report. 
     <lb/>
    
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is not quite the case. Par<lb break="no"/>liamentary practice provides that when a man 
     <lb/>moves a resolution he is entitled to make two 
     <lb/>speeches, when he moves it, and when he closes 
     <lb/>the debate. After he has closed the debate no one 
     <lb/>else may speak. In committee of the whole that is 
     <lb/>not the rule. No one has the right to close the 
     <lb/>debate in committee of the whole. He may be 
     <lb/>lucky enough to be the last speaker, but no one 
     <lb/>has the right to be the last.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You have actually given your 
     <lb/>
     ruling on that, Mr. Chairman. You said if no one 
     <lb/>
     else proposed to speak, you assumed the debate 
     <lb/>
     to be closed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is time I made my position 
     <lb/>
     clear on the matter. The debate will be presumed 
     <lb/>
     to be tentatively closed by virtue of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     if no member occupies the floor, I must assume 
     <lb/>
     no member is interested at this moment in ad<lb break="no"/>dressing himself any further on the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report. In view of the fact that it has been found 
     <lb/>
     that the introduction of Mr. Howell might very 
     <lb/>
     well result in some new evidence coming before 
     <lb/>
     the committee, and in view of the fact that a 
     <lb/>
     motion to adopt would be deferred from day to 
     <lb/>
     day until it has been determined when and if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howell is appearing before the committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole, I am afraid, Mr. Smallwood, that I intend 
     <lb/>
     to call upon Major Cashin to conclude, or tenta<lb break="no"/>tively conclude, the debate on the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report. I must assume a member is not interested 
     <lb/>
     at this moment in addressing himself further if he 
     <lb/>
     does not rise. I am not going to call members up 
     <lb/>
     if they do not get up voluntarily. At this time it is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to defer from day to day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> If Mr. Howell does not meet us, 
     <lb/>
     this will be the final part of the debate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not see what further matter 
     <lb/>
     there will be to debate. Let us deal with the 
     <lb/>
     present position before the Chair. The position is 
     <lb/>
     tentative pending the determination as to whether 
     <lb/>
     or not Mr. Howell is prepared to appear. If he 
     <lb/>
     does not appear, I think you are justified in as<lb break="no"/>suming for all practical purposes that the speech 
     <lb/>
     which Major Cashin will ultimately make in 
     <lb/>
     reply may be fairly regarded as the final speech. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It may be, but not necessarily 
     <lb/>so. When Major Cashin finishes his speech, if any 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          

     member wishes to speak, he has a perfect right to 
     <lb/>
     do so in committee of the whole. Speaking for 
     <lb/>
     myself, I hope I will not feel like commenting on 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin's speech. I cannot guarantee that. 
     <lb/>
     I have not heard his speech. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Let me remind you that if upon 
     <lb/>
     the termination of Major Cashin's reply a motion 
     <lb/>
     to adopt the report was placed before me, you 
     <lb/>
     would have the right to speak to the motion, and 
     <lb/>
     any member has a right to move that the question

     be put without further debate and I would have to

     the effect that the committee rise and report

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> After some 12 days the debate on 
     <lb/>this Economic Report has been concluded, and it 
     <lb/>now remains with me to wind up the discussion 
     <lb/>and to answer as best I possibly can the questions 
     <lb/>which have been put through you, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>in order to clarify the whole situation. The 
     <lb/>speeches of the delegates generally were of a high 
     <lb/>order and showed that the various reports sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to this Convention had received their 
     <lb/>closest attention. However, there were one or two 
     <lb/>speeches which were devoted primarily to 
     <lb/>destroying the basis on which the report was 
     <lb/>compiled, and to generally paint a gloomy picture 
     <lb/>of the country from every possible angle. Notably 
     <lb/>was the speech of the delegate from Bonavista 
     <lb/>Centre directed in this avenue. It reminded me of 
     <lb/>speeches delivered by soap box orators in Times 
     <lb/>Square in New York and in Hyde Park in London. 
     <lb/>None of our critics whose object was to paint a 
     <lb/>gloomy picture attempted to show any alterna<lb break="no"/>tive, and in this respect it is proven that there was 
     <lb/>a deliberate attempt by a few delegates to tear 
     <lb/>down the economic structure of the country, sole<lb break="no"/>ly for the purpose of trying to advance their own 
     <lb/>fanatical cause.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I must first deal, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     with the deliberate attempt to discredit the report

     made by Mr. Smallwood particularly, and I now 
     <lb/>
     refer to the question put to me by the junior 
     <lb/>
     member from Grand Falls, Mr. MacDonald. This 
     <lb/>
     particular question relates to our present liquid 
     <lb/>
     assets in the form of cash and other securities. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has been attempting to convey the 
     <lb/>
     idea that the figures contained in our report 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     regarding this matter are false and untrue. The 
     <lb/>
     same gentlemen made a similar attack on the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Report and was forced later to withdraw 
     <lb/>
     these attacks.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. I withdrew noth<lb break="no"/>ing. Can Major Cashin show me where I

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> He should have withdrawn, but he

     did not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The figures as regards revenues and 
     <lb/>
     expenditures contained in the Finance Report 
     <lb/>
     were proved to be absolutely correct. In connec<lb break="no"/>tion with this latest attempt to discredit our report 
     <lb/>
     and to try and show the country that the figures 
     <lb/>
     have been cooked up, so to speak, Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood states that our estimate of cash surpluses is 
     <lb/>
     incorrect. I refer to the amount of $35 million 
     <lb/>
     shown in the last paragraph on page 2 of the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report. I am referred to the budget 
     <lb/>
     speech made by Mr. James on May 7, 1947. I do 
     <lb/>
     not propose at this time to criticise Mr. James' 
     <lb/>
     budget speech, but at the same time I am com<lb break="no"/>pelled to point out that this budget speech does 
     <lb/>
     not reveal the true situation of the country. Before 
     <lb/>
     proceeding, let me point out that the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Report was compiled on information received 
     <lb/>
     from the various departments of government, but 
     <lb/>
     particularly its statements of figures were com<lb break="no"/>piled on information requested from the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Finance; also on information given the 
     <lb/>
     Convention by former Commissioner Wild over 
     <lb/>
     one year ago. This Economic Report was com<lb break="no"/>piled and presented to this assembly on Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 3, nearly seven months after the presentation 
     <lb/>
     of the Financial Report. The figures in the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report were based on information 
     <lb/>
     contained in the Finance Report, as well as infor<lb break="no"/>mation obtained since the presentation of this 
     <lb/>
     latter report. Now, what are the facts? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Mr. James' budget speech delivered in May 
     <lb/>
     last he stated that the total accumulated surplus, 
     <lb/>
     as at March 31, 1947, amounted to $28,789,000. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, if we take the revenue and 
     <lb/>
     expenditures from April 1, 1947 to October 31, 
     <lb/>
     1947, what do we find? We find that the total 
     <lb/>
     revenues for this particular period amount to 
     <lb/>
     $26,271,459, whilst the expenditures for the 
     <lb/>
     same period amount to $23,492,591. This period 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="779"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-20_Page_0779.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">779</fw>
     

     therefore shows a surplus of $2,771,868. These 
     <lb/>
     two amounts now added together make a total 
     <lb/>
     surplus of cash, as at October 31, of $31,560,868. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said a moment ago that the budget speech of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. James is anything but a complete picture of 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of Newfoundland. Why did I make that 
     <lb/>
     statement? For the simple reason that it is the 
     <lb/>
     truth. From information received by the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee, it will be observed that a sum of $3.5 
     <lb/>
     million was loaned to the St. John's Housing 
     <lb/>
     Corporation and other housing associations, and 
     <lb/>
     which is consequently an asset. Today the St. 
     <lb/>
     John's Housing Corporation and other housing 
     <lb/>
     associations owe the treasury over $4 million; 
     <lb/>
     $115,000 of this amount was a free grant; 
     <lb/>
     $625,000 is a recoverable advance but bears no 
     <lb/>
     annual interest charge, whilst over $3 million is 
     <lb/>
     bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.5% and 
     <lb/>
     debentures have been issued or are being issued 
     <lb/>
     by the Housing Corporation to cover this amount. 
     <lb/>
     In all, approximately $4 million. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I consider this particular $4 million asset just as 
     <lb/>
     good as our interest-free loans to Britain. I will 
     <lb/>
     go further and say it is better. We have security 
     <lb/>
     in this instance for our money and we unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately cannot say that with respect to our inter<lb break="no"/>est-free loans to Britain. In addition to these 
     <lb/>
     amounts, the Savings Bank shows an accumu<lb break="no"/>lated profit, together with its reserve, of not less 
     <lb/>
     than $800,000, and I refer delegates to the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General's Report of 1946, wherein it 
     <lb/>
     states that $719,000 is to the credit of that surplus. 
     <lb/>
     It is reasonable to expect that as at March 31, 
     <lb/>
     1947 this had increased to $800,000. Then we 
     <lb/>
     must take into account the amounts owed the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Public Health and Welfare by the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government and also the 
     <lb/>
     amount owed by the British government to the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Public Utilities on account of the 
     <lb/>
     operations of the Gander airport, as well as other 
     <lb/>
     recoverable loans due the government for advan<lb break="no"/>ces in connection with the development of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, together with the amount that would lie 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     to the credit of the Board of Liquor Control in the 
     <lb/>
     bank, all four of which will exceed $1 million. 
     <lb/>
     Now what is the result of this recapitulation? Is 
     <lb/>
     it as follows:<ref target="#fn_01">*</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This amount is exclusive of $3,232,000 which 
     <lb/>
     lies to our credit with the Crown Agents in Lon<lb break="no"/>don for the purpose of redeeming two loans com<lb break="no"/>ing due in 1950 and 1952. It is bearing interest at 
     <lb/>
     present at 2 or 2.5%. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again I must refer to Mr. James' budget 
     <lb/>
     speech of May 7 last. He states that after taking 
     <lb/>
     an amount of $3,232,000 from our interest-free 
     <lb/>
     loans to Britain for the purpose of redeeming two 
     <lb/>
     loans coming due in 1950 and 1952, that there 
     <lb/>
     remains to the credit of our country in this par<lb break="no"/>ticular respect, $7,868,000. I now draw your at<lb break="no"/>tention to an answer to a question by the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee on January 11 last as to how this 
     <lb/>
     particular loan stood. The reply given by the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary for Finance on January 15 last states: 
     <lb/>
     the total amount of the advances made by way of 
     <lb/>
     interest-free loans which were outstanding at 
     <lb/>
     December 31, 1946, was $9,068,000 (London, 
     <lb/>
     firm figure) and $242,000 (St. John's, ap<lb break="no"/>proximation only) a total of $9,310,000. If we 
     <lb/>
     turn to the Finance Report we find that the total 
     <lb/>
     amount of interest-free loans made to Britain 
     <lb/>
     amounted to $12,300,000. We have told you that 
     <lb/>
     $3,232,000 were taken from this amount and 
     <lb/>
     placed in a special account with the Crown 
     <lb/>
     Agents in London for the purpose of redeeming 
     <lb/>
     two loans coming due in 1950 and 1952. This 
     <lb/>
     should show a balance to our credit on account of 
     <lb/>
     these loans of $9,068,000. The difference there<lb break="no"/>fore between the two amounts is $1.8 million, and 
     <lb/>
     this amount should be added to our surplus cash, 
     <lb/>
     as it represents the purchase of war savings cer<lb break="no"/>tificates by our people and these certificates are 
     <lb/>
     shown as part of our national debt. Therefore the 
     <lb/>
     total cash surpluses, if we take this particular 
     <lb/>
     amount into account, is over $39 million. This 
     <lb/>
     amount has not been considered as a cash surplus 
     <lb/>
     by the Department of Finance even though they 
     <lb/>

     show the war savings certificates as part of our 
     <lb/>
     national debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we turn to page 102 of the Finance Report 
     <lb/>
     we find that our gross national debt amounts to 
     <lb/>
     $83,993,047. The first amount of $3.5 million 
     <lb/>
     coming due in 1950 and 1952 has been taken care 
     <lb/>
     of by the deduction from our interest-free loans 
     <lb/>
     of $3,232,000 which is invested at 2.5% and is 
     <lb/>
     sufficient with accumulated interest to take care 
     <lb/>
     of these two issues as they fall due. The second 
     <lb/>
     amount the Dominions Office agreed to cancel 
     <lb/>
     when the London delegation discussed New<lb break="no"/>foundland affairs with the United Kingdom rep<lb break="no"/>resentatives in May last. $1,600,000 or 
     <lb/>
     $1,700,000 against our sterling indebtedness of 
     <lb/>
     approximately $72 million. There is a sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund of $8,342,000, which leaves this amount of 
     <lb/>
     sterling debt at approximately $64.25 million. 
     <lb/>
     Now our local debt in bond issues and war 
     <lb/>
     savings certificates is approximately $7 million. 
     <lb/>
     Against this latter amount there is a sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     of $800,000, thus reducing our local debt to $6.25 
     <lb/>
     million. If we add this we have a debt of $70.75 
     <lb/>
     million. Against this we have cash and other 
     <lb/>
     securities, including war savings certificates, 
     <lb/>
     debentures from the St. John's Housing Corpora<lb break="no"/>tion, advances paid on account of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government and loans to private cor<lb break="no"/>porations of an amount in round figures of not 
     <lb/>
     less than $39 million. If we deduct this amount 
     <lb/>
     then from our total national debt we find that our 
     <lb/>
     net national debt on October 1, 1947, amounted 
     <lb/>
     to approximately $32 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This, Mr. Chairman, was practically the exact 
     <lb/>
     position of the finances of Newfoundland on 
     <lb/>
     October 1, 1947. These figures are critically cor<lb break="no"/>rect. In our Economic Report we stated that we 
     <lb/>
     had $35 million approximately in liquid assets to 
     <lb/>
     the credit of the country. The above statement 
     <lb/>
     shows the assets accumulated since 1940-41, to 
     <lb/>
     the amount of $39 million or possibly $40 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. The question of the advances to the Housing 
     <lb/>
     Corporation may be raised. Someone may say 
     <lb/>
     they are not worth the paper they are written on. 
     <lb/>
     That depression has been used in here before, but 
     <lb/>
     even if you did take that into account — $4 
     <lb/>
     million deducted from that — and give all the 
     <lb/>
     people their houses for nothing, we still have $35 
     <lb/>
     million left to the credit of the country.... When 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood makes the statement that the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            

     figures contained in the Financial Report and the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report are incorrect, he suggests the 
     <lb/>
     dilemma of Tennyson's grandmother, which I 
     <lb/>
     read about the other day in an English magazine, 
     <lb/>
     and it says that a lie which is all a lie may be met 
     <lb/>
     with and fought, but a lie which is part the truth 
     <lb/>
     is a harder matter to fight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, there is an adage to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that fools rush in where angels fear to tread... 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Hear, hear!

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And this was strongly brought to 
     <lb/>
     my mind. Now, Mr. Chairman, if we want to have 
     <lb/>
     any kind of decency in this place... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> And we are going to, and there<lb break="no"/>fore I want to make it clear now that Major

     Cashin is not going to be interrupted by any other

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am not referring to that at all. I 
     <lb/>
     have a very strong suspicion that the galleries

     <lb/>
     
            </p>

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> This was brought to my mind 
     <lb/>recently when I listened to the member from 
     <lb/>Bonavista Centre go into his song and dance. He 
     <lb/>is our prize jumper in the dark, and when some<lb break="no"/>one throws the light of information on him he is 
     <lb/>usually up to his neck in a bog of misunderstand<lb break="no"/>ing. This is the subject of our finances, and he 
     <lb/>bites off more than he can chew on our sinking 
     <lb/>fund. After listening to his hysterical oration I 
     <lb/>wonder whether he had read our reports at all. If 
     <lb/>he read the report he did not understand it, and 
     <lb/>that would account for his not knowing what he 
     <lb/>is talking about. I have to try and dispel some of 
     <lb/>the fogs in which this delegate is wandering and 
     <lb/>send him back on the road. I do this in the hope 
     <lb/>that it will save me the trouble of doing it later 
     <lb/>on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, nearly a year ago I was in<lb break="no"/>formed by our finance department that the total 
     <lb/>
     of our interest-free loans amounted to $12.3 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. They were given, not at the request of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government, but out of the big<lb break="no"/>heartedness of the local Commissioners, who 
     <lb/>
     decided to be generous with other people's 
     <lb/>
     money.... It is my firm conviction that it is doubt<lb break="no"/><pb n="781"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-20_Page_0781.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">781</fw>ful if ever a dollar will come back to us. The 
     <lb/>
     government of the United Kingdom must think 
     <lb/>
     we are a mighty generous country. This business 
     <lb/>
     began in 1941-42, when the sum of $3.8 million 
     <lb/>
     was passed over, free of interest, to Great Britain. 
     <lb/>
     At the same time they had to raise a loan of $2.1 
     <lb/>
     million from the United States to put our railway 
     <lb/>
     in good shape for war purposes, on which we had 
     <lb/>
     to pay 2½% annual interest. There's frenzied 
     <lb/>
     finance for you, if ever there was. There's honest 
     <lb/>
     handling of the people's money by trustees. We 
     <lb/>
     shipped out of this country $4 million as an 
     <lb/>
     interest-free loan, and then turn right around and 
     <lb/>
     hang on our people's neck a debt which, up to 
     <lb/>
     now, has cost them in annual interest nearly 
     <lb/>
     $200,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again in 1942-43 the trick was repeated. 
     <lb/>
     Another burst of generosity at our expense, and 
     <lb/>
     another $4 million leaves our shores. Again it is 
     <lb/>
     interest free, and we are told without the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom asking for the loan, and again our Com<lb break="no"/>missioners go out and borrow this sum from our 
     <lb/>
     own people, $1.5 million at 3 1/2 %  annual interest, 
     <lb/>
     whilst our people invested some $400,000 in war 
     <lb/>
     savings certificates. What can we say of this sort 
     <lb/>
     of thing, this taking in two years almost $8 mil<lb break="no"/>lion and sending it right out of the country? In the 
     <lb/>
     first place we lost the interest we should be 
     <lb/>
     making on it. We are losing this money just as if 
     <lb/>
     it had been stolen from us. It is just as if our 
     <lb/>
     treasury had been looted by thieves. What else 
     <lb/>
     can I call it but large scale plunder? And if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood doesn't like that he can call it rob<lb break="no"/>bery, thievery, breach of trust or whatever he 
     <lb/>
     wishes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point 
     <lb/>
     of order. I ask you, sir, quite seriously, is it in 
     <lb/>
     order for a man to stand on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, admittedly covering himself with 
     <lb/>
     veiled language, but nevertheless broadly to at<lb break="no"/>tribute thievery and plunder to the government? 
     <lb/>
     Can anyone do that with impunity? Is that in 
     <lb/>
     order? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Not with impunity. I think that 
     <lb/>
     as a matter of discretion Major Cashin is positive<lb break="no"/>ly unwise, but if he cares to risk the consequences 
     <lb/>
     of his language, that is not a matter for me to 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In reply, I would like to know, and 
     <lb/>
     I put it to you as a businessman, if you had 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 and you were going to lend it to me 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
     interest free, and then I go over to Mr. Hollett and 
     <lb/>
     borrow another $100,000 and pay him interest on 
     <lb/>
     it, that does not look like sense to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We might call it foolish, but we 
     <lb/>
     could hardly call it plundering and robbing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, what can I call it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You can call it foolish and be on 
     <lb/>
     the safe side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh no, foolish people don't do 
     <lb/>
     things like that!.... All we in Newfoundland know 
     <lb/>
     is that we have been deprived of what should be 
     <lb/>
     ours. Let us trace this claim. In 1943-44 still 
     <lb/>
     another $25 million shipment went from our 
     <lb/>
     treasury, and again it went without any interest. 
     <lb/>
     What a wonderfully self-supporting country they 
     <lb/>
     must have thought us! And again in that year, the 
     <lb/>
     old trick of borrowing another $2 million at an 
     <lb/>
     annual interest rate of 3%, to add another yoke to 
     <lb/>
     the neck of our taxpayers. This year we did some<lb break="no"/>thing extra, by way of a tilly, as it were. Those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who do business in the outports will 
     <lb/>
     appreciate it better than I do — a man who buys 
     <lb/>
     ten gallons of molasses figures he should get 
     <lb/>
     another gallon for "tilly". We sent other monies 
     <lb/>
     to redeem a loan which was not due for another 
     <lb/>
     year, and thereby lost another $50,000 in interest. 
     <lb/>
     The final spasm was in 1944-45 when the Com<lb break="no"/>mission sent out another $2 million to Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain under the usual interest-free conditions. 
     <lb/>
     The total of this whole business shows that the 
     <lb/>
     local agents of the government took $12 million 
     <lb/>
     of our money and loaned it free of interest, whilst 
     <lb/>
     at the same time they borrowed between $9-10 
     <lb/>
     million. In short, whilst they went looking for 
     <lb/>
     loans of $9 million on which they knew we had 
     <lb/>
     to pay interest, they gave away $12 million free 
     <lb/>
     of interest. Now if the member for Bonavista can 
     <lb/>
     show you or me that such conduct was giving a 
     <lb/>
     fair deal to this country, or that it was politically 
     <lb/>
     honest, I will give him a gold medal with his 
     <lb/>
     name engraved on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This sort of conduct on the part of an ordinary 
     <lb/>
     individual in the capacity of a trustee of the 
     <lb/>
     people's money would qualify him for a gaol or 
     <lb/>
     a mental asylum. It can only be regarded as a 
     <lb/>
     stripping of the people's treasury, no more and 
     <lb/>
     no less, and the self-appointed champion from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre will have to be a far better hand 
     <lb/>
     with a whitewash brush than he is. It will take 
     <lb/>
     more wind than he can summon, and that is not a 
     <lb/>
     little, to remove the stench of this thing from the 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="782"

     nostrils of our people. I estimate that if they had 
     <lb/>
     loaned that $12 million at current rates of interest, 
     <lb/>
     we should have earned nearly $2 million. On the 
     <lb/>
     other hand, if we had not had to pay the interest 
     <lb/>
     on the other $9 million we borrowed we should 
     <lb/>
     have received another $2 million. Working on the 
     <lb/>
     basis that a penny saved is a penny earned, this 
     <lb/>
     country has lost $4 million. We have been told 
     <lb/>
     that the United Kingdom did not ask us for these 
     <lb/>
     loans, and that the Commission government gave 
     <lb/>
     them as a voluntary gesture; but I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that there is anybody in the sound of my voice so 
     <lb/>
     gullible as to believe this. Behind it all can be 
     <lb/>
     seen the guiding hand of the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, we come to the matter of 
     <lb/>
     the sterling sinking fund. Mr. Smallwood admits 
     <lb/>
     that he had been hearing me talk about this matter 
     <lb/>
     for the past two years, and apparently he wants 
     <lb/>
     to hear me talk about it again. It is such a novelty 
     <lb/>
     to hear the member from Bonavista Centre say 
     <lb/>
     that he wants to listen to somebody else, that I 
     <lb/>
     think I should not lose the opportunity — I may 
     <lb/>
     never get it again, and I mean that. To those of us 
     <lb/>
     who can use ordinary intelligence, what I have to 
     <lb/>
     say will be an old, old story. In 1933 an act was 
     <lb/>
     passed which provided that beginning not later 
     <lb/>
     than July 1, 1938, there would be paid into a 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund for the redemption of our outstand<lb break="no"/>ing 3% sterling stock an amount equivalent to 1% 
     <lb/>
     of that stock, in this instance an amount 
     <lb/>
     equivalent to £177,950. On July 1, 1938, the first 
     <lb/>
     such payment was made. Each year this is paid 
     <lb/>
     to the trustees of the fund, and the trustees go out 
     <lb/>
     in the market and buy in the equivalent of this 
     <lb/>
     amount to the principal of our debt. They have 
     <lb/>
     been doing this for nearly ten years. Instead of 
     <lb/>
     reducing the principal of our debt each year by 
     <lb/>
     the amount of payment to the sinking fund, it is 
     <lb/>
     left to itself, consequently we have been sending 
     <lb/>
     over interest on interest. Therefore, if we com<lb break="no"/>pound these ten year payments at 3% each year, 
     <lb/>
     and allowing for the pound an average of $4.60, 
     <lb/>
     we find that the fund as at July 1, 1947, should 
     <lb/>
     total in the vicinity of $9.5 million.... I hold, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that each year when this sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     amounting to £177,950 is sent to England, and 
     <lb/>
     the trustees purchase our 3% stock, that then the 
     <lb/>
     national debt should be reduced by this amount 
     <lb/>
     and the stock cancelled; but if we survey the 
     <lb/>
     estimates of expenditure we find that no such 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
         
     thing has been done, and our treasury has lost no 
     <lb/>
     less than $1 million. I apologise to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, when I said $1.75 million the other 
     <lb/>
     day I spoke in the heat of argument, and I was 
     <lb/>
     thinking of the interest-free loans as well. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, it means that this country has been im<lb break="no"/>properly and unlawfully deprived of the amount 
     <lb/>
     referred to, but I want it distinctly understood, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, that the implication that I accused 
     <lb/>
     John Doe of the British Treasury of putting this 
     <lb/>
     money into his pocket is, of course, ridiculous. 
     <lb/>
     What I intended to convey was that through the 
     <lb/>
     unbusinesslike methods of some person, the 
     <lb/>
     treasury of Newfoundland has been deprived of 
     <lb/>
     around $1 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No official statement has been furnished 
     <lb/>
     regarding the handling of that particular fund, 
     <lb/>
     although I have requested the same, neither has 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood been able to give me this state<lb break="no"/>ment. He merely got an answer telling him what 
     <lb/>
     was happening. Also in the budget speech (last 
     <lb/>
     May) no statement was given, and the only state<lb break="no"/>ment given was in the annual statement of the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General. Why should we lose this $1 
     <lb/>
     million? Are we so rich that we can afford to 
     <lb/>
     overlook it, or are we so generous that we can 
     <lb/>
     come out and defend it? That $1 million would 
     <lb/>
     do a lot of good over where Mr. Bradley, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and Mr. Burry so often shed their 
     <lb/>
     crocodile tears. The position is that the people 
     <lb/>
     who control our cash are $1 million short, so to 
     <lb/>
     speak, in their bookkeeping. There may be a 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory explanation, but in this case, until 
     <lb/>
     they prove their innocence, I shall hold them 
     <lb/>
     guilty of negligence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Reverting back to the interest-free 
     <lb/>
     loans, there is another point which I should like 
     <lb/>
     to bring to your attention. At the time we were in 
     <lb/>
     London in May, there stood to the credit of this 
     <lb/>
     country as interest-free loans to Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     roundly $9 million. We discussed with Lord Ad<lb break="no"/>dison the possibility of applying this amount to 
     <lb/>
     the reduction of our sterling debt. Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     made what I regard as a most astounding answer. 
     <lb/>
     He told us that the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     had recommended that these loans remain intact 
     <lb/>
     and should not be used for this purpose. Now, 
     <lb/>
     when these interest-free loans were given, the 
     <lb/>
     pound sterling was valued at $4.45 and conse<lb break="no"/>quently Britain received pounds based on that 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="783"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-20_Page_0783.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">783</fw>
  
          

     figure. Today the pound sterling is valued at 
     <lb/>
     $4.04, which is 10% less than the figure quoted. 
     <lb/>
     If Britain had agreed to our suggestion, New<lb break="no"/>foundland would stand to gain approximately 
     <lb/>
     $900,000 and Britain would lose this amount 
     <lb/>
     because of the dropping of exchange rates. In 
     <lb/>
     addition, if the interest-free loans had to be ap<lb break="no"/>plied to the reduction of our sterling debt, our 
     <lb/>
     treasury would have been relieved of paying in<lb break="no"/>terest accordingly, as well as the sinking fund, 
     <lb/>
     and thus an additional $400,000 annually would 
     <lb/>
     have been saved. For the first year, approximate<lb break="no"/>ly $1.25 million would accrue in saving. Conse<lb break="no"/>quently, if we summarize the matters to which I 
     <lb/>
     have referred, we find that in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     interest-free loans, we would have saved $4 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Secondly, in the case of the sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     another $1 million, and finally by the application 
     <lb/>
     of the interest-free loans to the reduction of our 
     <lb/>
     national debt, another $1.25 million. A grand 
     <lb/>
     total, Mr. Chairman, which proper management 
     <lb/>
     would have saved Newfoundland, and which we 
     <lb/>
     would have to our credit today, of approximately 
     <lb/>
     $6 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it is timely to refer to the much-dis<lb break="no"/>cussed base deal. I regard this deal as the most 
     <lb/>
     far-reaching, and as far as we are concerned the 
     <lb/>
     most deplorable of all the acts perpetrated in our 
     <lb/>
     name by the Commission of Government. I refer 
     <lb/>
     to the negotiations which they conducted with the 
     <lb/>
     British and American governments, whereby the 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty of Newfoundland territories was 
     <lb/>
     given over to a foreign power under terms which 
     <lb/>
     amount to an absolute assignment and forfeiture 
     <lb/>
     of all our rights of ownership and administration 
     <lb/>
     into and over these particular parts of our country. 
     <lb/>
     We were never told then and we do not know 
     <lb/>
     today, the circumstances and conditions under 
     <lb/>
     which Newfoundland territory was placed under 
     <lb/>
     a foreign flag. But those who come after us will 
     <lb/>
     look upon this deal as the most shameful and 
     <lb/>
     traitorous act which has ever stained the pages of 
     <lb/>
     our history. For by that act there was taken, I 
     <lb/>
     might almost say stolen from us, something so 
     <lb/>
     priceless that other men and other nations have 
     <lb/>
     not hesitated to defend it with the last drop of their 
     <lb/>
     blood. It is a truly pathetic spectacle to read the 
     <lb/>
     story of that time, when Mr. Emerson and Mr. J. 
     <lb/>
     H. Penson, representing Newfoundland, were ap<lb break="no"/>parently ordered by Prime Minister Churchill to 
     <lb/>
     come to England and sign away our rights on an 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
       

     agreement which had already been written. What 
     <lb/>
     a tragedy that Newfoundland was not governed 
     <lb/>
     by her own people. How different might the story 
     <lb/>
     have been. What an opportunity there was here, 
     <lb/>
     if in the interests of our common war effort this 
     <lb/>
     national sacrifice was necessary, to obtain our 
     <lb/>
     proper compensation! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hold, Mr. Chairman, that if proper steps had 
     <lb/>
     been taken at that time, the national debt of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would have been cancelled by 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, and Newfoundland would have 
     <lb/>
     arranged and even demanded favourable trade 
     <lb/>
     concessions for her fishery products from the 
     <lb/>
     USA. But what happened? The United States was 
     <lb/>
     given the strategic bases it required, and Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain received material help in return for these 
     <lb/>
     bases from the United States. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     received nothing, unless we are to regard as a 
     <lb/>
     favour the monies which Uncle Sam was com<lb break="no"/>pelled to spend here for the erection of these 
     <lb/>
     bases. But even in this case the benefits we reaped 
     <lb/>
     were restricted ones, inasmuch as they were 
     <lb/>
     restricted upon the direct or indirect instructions 
     <lb/>
     of the Commission government, which advised 
     <lb/>
     the American contractors not to pay New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders the same rates of pay as those paid 
     <lb/>
     to either Canadians or Americans. The result of 
     <lb/>
     this infamous measure was that it was not uncom<lb break="no"/>mon to find Newfoundland workmen doing 
     <lb/>
     similar work, just as efficiently as the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     or American workmen, but receiving in many 
     <lb/>
     instances not more than half the wages of these 
     <lb/>
     outsiders. Would the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     have tolerated any such action under any of our 
     <lb/>
     former governments, or would any of our former 
     <lb/>
     governments so callously ignore the rights of 
     <lb/>
     bare-armed labour? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Directing our attention to another phase of this 
     <lb/>
     base deal, I have no hesitation in stating, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     and the Dominions Office had no moral or con<lb break="no"/>stitutional right to alienate Newfoundland ter<lb break="no"/>ritory to a foreign power. If we concede for one 
     <lb/>
     moment that they could have justly performed 
     <lb/>
     such an act, then we must also concede that they 
     <lb/>
     could for the same reason have given away our 
     <lb/>
     entire country to whomsoever they wished. Their 
     <lb/>
     first duty was to protect our sovereignty. This 
     <lb/>
     they did not do. And there is another feature in 
     <lb/>
     this connection which is worth mentioning: the 
     <lb/>
     British government, through its agents the local 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="784"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-20_Page_0784.jpg"/>

     Commissioners, were legally and morally bound 
     <lb/>
     under their own agreement to return this country 
     <lb/>
     to the people intact when she became self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting. But as it is, she can never give us back 
     <lb/>
     our country as it was when she took it from our 
     <lb/>
     control. It is no longer the Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     1933. It is now a country with which we will be 
     <lb/>
     forced to share ownership with Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     United States. And so it is, Mr. Chairman, that a 
     <lb/>
     foreign flag flies over our country today, and a 
     <lb/>
     part of Newfoundland is no longer New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Viewing the matter from a purely 
     <lb/>
     financial angle, a survey of the situation shows 
     <lb/>
     that because of the wage-cutting policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission government, our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     workmen were deprived of at least an additional 
     <lb/>
     $20 million or $25 million in eamings.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There were several notes I took during the 
     <lb/>
     debate in connection with the Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     and on which I did not prepare any set speech. I 
     <lb/>
     will try to the best of my ability to answer the 
     <lb/>
     questions asked. The first one was asked by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Northcott. I was not here that afternoon, but I 
     <lb/>
     understand it was how much gasoline comes into 
     <lb/>
     Lewisporte, lands at Gander and on which no 
     <lb/>
     duty is paid. I think it is 10-12 million gallons. If 
     <lb/>
     we got one cent a gallon on it, it would mean 
     <lb/>
     $120,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry asked what authority we had for the 
     <lb/>
     forecasts regarding this development on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. In reply, I would say we understand 
     <lb/>
     there is a piece of legislation, which has received 
     <lb/>
     its first or second reading, whereby a railway is 
     <lb/>
     to be built by the Labrador Mining Company 
     <lb/>
     from the St. Lawrence River right into this mine; 
     <lb/>
     150 miles of this territory is Newfoundland's, 
     <lb/>
     and the balance is Canadian. This piece of legis<lb break="no"/>lation is in the course of being adopted or 
     <lb/>
     negotiated with the Commission of Government. 
     <lb/>
     In connection with this 350 miles of railway, if 
     <lb/>
     my estimates are worth anything, it will cost that 
     <lb/>
     company in docks, loading piers and rolling 
     <lb/>
     stock, something around $100 million. I saw Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Timmins, President of the Labrador Mining 
     <lb/>
     Company, and he told me that this railway and 
     <lb/>
     docks would cost in the vicinity of $65 million. 
     <lb/>
     Half this railway is to be built in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     territory and considerable labour will be given 
     <lb/>
     our people.... Mr. Timmins would not be inter<lb break="no"/>ested in speculating such vast amounts of money 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           

     if he did not think there were some prospects of 
     <lb/>
     returns. The development started in 1935 by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McKay, and it was later handed over to the Hol<lb break="no"/>linger interests and Hanna interests of Cleveland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Prior to becoming interested in this develop<lb break="no"/>ment, these interests checked the reserves of iron 
     <lb/>
     ore in the Mesabi Range and I was told that from 
     <lb/>
     their investigation they felt that high grade ore on 
     <lb/>
     the Mesabi Range would be depleted within ten 
     <lb/>
     years, consequently they were taking no chances. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Timmins told me that he felt that within ten 
     <lb/>
     years ten million tons of iron ore would be 
     <lb/>
     produced annually. The big steel mills in the 
     <lb/>
     United States consume 100 million tons of ore 
     <lb/>
     annually. When the Mesabi Range is closed out 
     <lb/>
     there is only one place. The Labrador Company's 
     <lb/>
     property is good. Everyone is optimistic about it, 
     <lb/>
     and we find stock which went on the market at 
     <lb/>
     $l is now selling up to $8 and $9. There must be 
     <lb/>
     something to it. I have great faith in Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it is our greatest potential asset. In 
     <lb/>
     preparing this report in connection with Labrador 
     <lb/>
     we were conservative. Within ten years Labrador 
     <lb/>
     mineral deposits should be able to pay off the 
     <lb/>
     national debt of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In connection with the timber areas on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, when we went into the Forestry 
     <lb/>
     Report<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> there was some question about the 
     <lb/>
     amount of timber available for pulp and paper. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Burry was rather dubious as to the estimates 
     <lb/>
     of 50 million cords on the Labrador. Finally we 
     <lb/>
     brought in a supplementary report after we had 
     <lb/>
     had an interview with the General Manager of 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters, and in the Hamilton-Melville area 
     <lb/>
     alone there was shown to be 25 million cords. I 
     <lb/>
     realise timber in Labrador is difficult to transport 
     <lb/>
     as navigation is open only four months a year; but 
     <lb/>
     I am confident that within the next five or ten 
     <lb/>
     years the forest areas of North America will 
     <lb/>
     become depleted, even in Quebec. Then there 
     <lb/>
     will be only one place to go, and that is Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     That is why we discussed the possibility of a mill 
     <lb/>
     on the southwest coast. I discussed that matter 
     <lb/>
     with the General Manager of Bowaters — they 
     <lb/>
     were not interested at the present time, but the 
     <lb/>
     newsprint industry is now flourishing, they can<lb break="no"/>not meet the demand, they have contracts signed 
     <lb/>
     for the next ten years.... There is 150,000 horse<lb break="no"/>power in Bay D'Espoir which can be developed 
     <lb/>
     fairly reasonably. Consequently, we felt that in 
     <lb/>
            
<note xml:id="fn_02">1 Volume II:56. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>
          

            <pb n="785"

     the course of the next three or four years it is not 
     <lb/>
     improbable that another paper mill would be 
     <lb/>
     promoted and built on the southwest coast to be 
     <lb/>
     fed with timber from Labrador. Some people 
     <lb/>
     seem to think that the newsprint business is good, 
     <lb/>
     but it is not going to stay that way. No one can 
     <lb/>
     tell what is going to happen tonight.... Bowaters 
     <lb/>
     have faith in the country; they have borrowed up 
     <lb/>
     to $8-10 million to further develop that industry. 
     <lb/>
     If they have faith, how could we give a pessimis<lb break="no"/>tic report on woods operations in Labrador? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName>....I did not challenge 50 million 
     <lb/>cords; I did challenge the amount of 100 million 
     <lb/>cords.... The question I asked was not in relation 
     <lb/>to the great possibilities of the Labrador. I asked 
     <lb/>what authority they had for saying that the Grand 
     <lb/>Falls<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> would be developed... What reason have 
     <lb/>they for saying 1.5 million horsepower will be 
     <lb/>developed, and that it will be used in connection 
     <lb/>with Labrador and will be exported across the 
     <lb/>border? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We got the survey from the files of 
     <lb/>
     the Department of Natural Resources. The survey 
     <lb/>
     was made by the Aluminum Company of Canada 
     <lb/>
     in 1941. It was nearly developed in 1940-41, and 
     <lb/>
     it was unfortunate it was not. When the 
     <lb/>
     Aluminum Company at Arvida went down to 
     <lb/>
     survey it, they were seriously contemplating it for 
     <lb/>
     the production of aluminum and other products....   
     <lb/>
     It was held under agreement with the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Mining Company. Undoubtedly an agreement 
     <lb/>
     could have been made. I was told that by the 
     <lb/>
     General Manager of the Royal Bank of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     That is my authority. It may not all be developed 
     <lb/>
     at once. When the mine is developed within ten 
     <lb/>
     years, we are informed, it will produce 10 million 
     <lb/>
     tons in ten years, probably more. They have to 
     <lb/>
     have water-power to run the railway, they are not 
     <lb/>
     going to run it on coal.... I think the Committee 
     <lb/>
     felt justified in saying the water-power on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador would be developed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Northcott wanted to know why the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy on the Gulf steamer was cancelled in 1930. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland took over the railway in 1923; up 
     <lb/>
     to that time the Reid Newfoundland Company 
     <lb/>
     had been operating the railway, though the 
     <lb/>
     government had been financing it from 1920 or 
     <lb/>
     1921. Once the government took over the railway 
     <lb/>
     officially, all subsidies were cancelled. I was a 
     <lb/>
     member of the delegation which went to Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     
           
            <cb/>
          
     to try to negotiate a subsidy for the operation of 
     <lb/>
     the boat on the Strait. We discussed it with mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Mackenzie King cabinet at that time 
     <lb/>
     and they assured us that they were going to give 
     <lb/>
     serious consideration to giving us a subsidy. We 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that we felt we were justified, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly in view of the fact that then the private 
     <lb/>
     companies operating on the Gulf had received 
     <lb/>
     substantial subsidies from the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I am not in a position to say how much it 
     <lb/>
     was. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Was that really the reason? One 
     <lb/>
     was a company and the other a government. 
     <lb/>
     Governments don't charge governments any<lb break="no"/>thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I don't believe that, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     because they generally soak each other every 
     <lb/>
     opportunity they get. Now, my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and I have got to disagree again in 
     <lb/>
     connection with this mercantile marine.... The 
     <lb/>
     Amulree Report recommended that we should 
     <lb/>
     have a merchant marine, since we were shipping 
     <lb/>
     a lot of money out of the country annually. Now 
     <lb/>
     how much money does go out of the country on 
     <lb/>
     freights, etc.? Today we must have a gross busi<lb break="no"/>ness of some $70 million in and out, and I figure 
     <lb/>
     that at least 10% of that is freight.... That means 
     <lb/>
     $7 million a year in freight. How much of that 
     <lb/>
     goes out of the country today? Today we have 
     <lb/>
     nine or ten Clarenville ships which cost a lot of 
     <lb/>
     money, and now they are employing a lot of men 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland. We have two freighters, the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Random</hi> and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rockfield Park</hi>. They employ 
     <lb/>
     about 50 Newfoundlanders between the two of 
     <lb/>
     them, and the other ships have ten men each. 
     <lb/>
     That's only 140 seamen in the mercantile marine, 
     <lb/>
     apart from small ships that are operated by some 
     <lb/>
     local mercantile firms in the city who, I am glad 
     <lb/>
     to say, are going into the business further.... Our 
     <lb/>
     suggestion of a mercantile marine is one of the 
     <lb/>
     best things in our Economic Report because, 
     <lb/>
     apart from the employment it will give, it will 
     <lb/>
     keep money in our country and keep our seamen 
     <lb/>
     employed. I am prepared to back a mercantile 
     <lb/>
     marine tomorrow if we had the necessary funds 
     <lb/>
     to do so, and I feel that we should have a mercan<lb break="no"/>tile marine. If a private outfit wants to buy it let 
     <lb/>
     them buy it, or let the government guarantee the 
     <lb/>
     money and take a mortgage on the ship, or estab<lb break="no"/>lish one of their own under a Crown company.

            <p>
     The government bought two ships during the 
     <lb/>
     war, and if you look up the records of the railway 
     <lb/>
     department you will find that they paid about 
     <lb/>
     $700,000 for these two ships, and that they made 
     <lb/>
     a profit of over $1 million during the war.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going to refer shortly to our national debt. 
     <lb/>
     In my remarks this afternoon I stated that the 
     <lb/>
     national debt should have been cancelled when 
     <lb/>
     the base deal was put through. That is my own 
     <lb/>
     personal opinion. Why should I make that state<lb break="no"/>ment? These people who are operating the 
     <lb/>
     government were trustees and they have no right 
     <lb/>
     to give away our territory without some compen<lb break="no"/>sation, and they should have at least cancelled the 
     <lb/>
     sterling debt.... I am confident that if New<lb break="no"/>foundland was governed by a government of its 
     <lb/>
     own, one of the first steps could be to negotiate 
     <lb/>
     with the British government as to the reduction 
     <lb/>
     of that sterling debt. Why? War debts all over this 
     <lb/>
     world have been cancelled. $45 million of that 
     <lb/>
     money was spent during the war from 1914-18, 
     <lb/>
     that is to date what it has cost Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Well, if all other countries cancelled war debts 
     <lb/>
     we are just as much entitled to cancel them as 
     <lb/>
     anyone else, and I am compelled to state that if I 
     <lb/>
     was ever in a government of Newfoundland, one 
     <lb/>
     of the first things I would do would be to start 
     <lb/>
     negotiations with the British government for the 
     <lb/>
     cancellation of that debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one more matter, Mr. Chairman, and 
     <lb/>
     that is the matter brought up by my friend the 
     <lb/>
     Rev. Mr. Burry the other day, about this Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Development Company that's going out of busi<lb break="no"/>ness at the present time. I know something of the 
     <lb/>
     struggles the promoter of that company has had 
     <lb/>
     during the past 12-14 months trying to keep it 
     <lb/>
     afloat, trying to get sterling converted in dollars, 
     <lb/>
     that's been the great difficulty. He has 10-12,000 
     <lb/>
     cords of pit props which are required, mind you, 
     <lb/>
     on the other side.... This company was prepared 
     <lb/>
     to put up £50,000 in London and to cash it, so to 
     <lb/>
     speak, out here for $200,000, and the government 
     <lb/>
     would not do that. What is the result? The busi<lb break="no"/>ness closes down. The further result, the most 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate of all, is that these poor unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     people down there have got to be fed during the 
     <lb/>
     winter at government expense. I contend that it is 
     <lb/>
     criminal.... It means the loss of $300,000 this 
     <lb/>
     winter just because the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment or the Dominions Office, or the British 
     <lb/>
     Treasury refused to cash a cheque for £50,000 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          

     and give $200,000 worth out here and apply the 
     <lb/>
     £50,000 over there to the reduction of our debt.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Did the government agree? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The government here agreed to do 
     <lb/>it, and on the other side they said "no". Well, what 
     <lb/>can you expect? I can't understand my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood disagreeing with me at times when I 
     <lb/>make critical remarks about Dominions Office in 
     <lb/>London, and the manner in which they handle our 
     <lb/>financial affairs. A few days ago Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>took up the time of this House by over an hour. I 
     <lb/>am sorry Mr. Bradley is not here. He is one of the 
     <lb/>ablest speakers in this country. I have been a 
     <lb/>member of this House with him, and a member 
     <lb/>of the government with him, and I realise that he 
     <lb/>is one of the outstanding public speakers of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and I am sorry he is sick.... He gave 
     <lb/>us an instance of how easy it is, with a big brush 
     <lb/>and lots of black paint, to smear an entire country. 
     <lb/>He went scavenging back to our national ash 
     <lb/>barrels for half a century, resurrecting the 
     <lb/>decayed corpses of this country's misfortune, and 
     <lb/>rattled the bones of past history before us. His 
     <lb/>general motto seemed to be that if he could find 
     <lb/>nothing bad to say, he would say nothing good 
     <lb/>anyhow. I waited to hear him say something even 
     <lb/>faintly optimistic, something with a promise of 
     <lb/>hope, something that could be called constructive 
     <lb/>or helpful, but I waited, and you waited, and the 
     <lb/>country waited in vain. In presenting the 
     <lb/>economic picture of this country we have been 
     <lb/>accused of trying to lop off a few million dollars, 
     <lb/>but Mr. Bradley goes further than this — he lops 
     <lb/>off seven years as if they had never existed. Truly 
     <lb/>an amazing performance. He spoke of the dole 
     <lb/>days, just as if Newfoundland was the only 
     <lb/>country which had known dole. He spoke of the 
     <lb/>hard times of our people as if we were the only 
     <lb/>people in the world who had known hard times. 
     <lb/>He spoke of depression as if we were the only 
     <lb/>ones to feel its bite. Now we all know the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of fair criticism, but anyone listening to Mr. 
     <lb/>Bradley could only receive the same impression 
     <lb/>that I received, that I was not listening to a fair 
     <lb/>critic and an impartial discussion of the economic 
     <lb/>condition of this country, but to the voice of a 
     <lb/>person who had painstakingly and exhaustively 
     <lb/>and labouriously compiled what I regard as the 
     <lb/>most depressing wail of pessimism and despair 
     <lb/>which it has been my misfortune to hear in this 
     <lb/>House for nearly a quarter of a century.

 <p>
     Take note of the fact that Mr. Bradley makes 
     <lb/>
     no discrimination in the manner in which he 
     <lb/>
     placed the responsibility for the evils of which he 
     <lb/>
     complains. He conveniently combines the mis<lb break="no"/>deeds of Commission government with those of 
     <lb/>
     our previous responsible government. Mr. Brad<lb break="no"/>ley made much of the fact that our present 
     <lb/>
     prosperity is the result of war boom. He is ap<lb break="no"/>parently unable to see the real position, which is 
     <lb/>
     this: from an economic angle it does not matter a 
     <lb/>
     tinker's curse why or how our prosperity began. 
     <lb/>
     All we are concerned with are these two ques<lb break="no"/>tions, first: do we enjoy favourable economic 
     <lb/>
     conditions? and secondly: what are the prob<lb break="no"/>abilities in favour of their continuance?.... All this 
     <lb/>
     talk of how they came about has nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with the case. Let us be done with such childish 
     <lb/>
     quibbling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another point in Mr. Bradley's speech 
     <lb/>
     which I feel I cannot allow to pass. In drawing up 
     <lb/>
     his picture of this country he has actually wiped 
     <lb/>
     off the years from 1939 to 1947, with the idea of 
     <lb/>
     showing how our economy would have looked 
     <lb/>
     without the benefits of the war. Now I am going 
     <lb/>
     to take a similar liberty, and remove another war 
     <lb/>
     from our history.... I refer to the first world war, 
     <lb/>
     1914-18. Now as the speaker has fancied it a good 
     <lb/>
     idea to tie up war with finance in the years 1939- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     47, let us apply the same measure to the first 
     <lb/>
     world war, and see what effect it had on our 
     <lb/>
     economic life. What do we find? We find that ... 
     <lb/>
     this country would be the richer by some $45 
     <lb/>
     million. I am speaking now from the wholly 
     <lb/>
     economic standpoint, and would not dare to 
     <lb/>
     presume to put any value on the priceless lives of 
     <lb/>
     those who made the supreme sacrifice, and whose 
     <lb/>
     maimed and crippled bodies are still with us, 
     <lb/>
     some of whom are in this very chamber. I suggest 
     <lb/>
     that the speaker put that in his calculations, and 
     <lb/>
     he will find that the picture he sought to make is 
     <lb/>
     not so favourable to his cause as he fondly hoped 
     <lb/>
     it would be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have been accused of including guess<lb break="no"/>work and conjecture, but in the speech to which 
     <lb/>
     I refer there has been more that's outright guess<lb break="no"/>ing than in our entire Economic Report. I regard 
     <lb/>
     as a prize instance of this the delegate's  reference 
     <lb/>
     to the United States bases. He takes it upon him<lb break="no"/>self, without any authority whatever to inform 
     <lb/>
     us that the United States will give us nothing in 
     <lb/>
     return for these bases. He tries to show that we 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          

     are entitled to nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For myself, I can see as far through a stone 
     <lb/>
     wall as Mr. Bradley, and I expressed my firm 
     <lb/>
     belief that there is every reason to believe that we 
     <lb/>
     will be able to make satisfactory arrangements 
     <lb/>
     with the United States, provided we have the 
     <lb/>
     proper form of government in this country. I 
     <lb/>
     would remind Mr. Bradley of another interesting 
     <lb/>
     event which took place in his 50 year period. I 
     <lb/>
     refer to the Bond-Blaine treaty. At that time 
     <lb/>
     America had no bases in Newfoundland. We had 
     <lb/>
     nothing to give her by way of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi>, and 
     <lb/>
     she was prepared to accept our product, she was 
     <lb/>
     prepared to do business with us on favourable 
     <lb/>
     terms, but what happened? Canada interfered, 
     <lb/>
     she skilled the deal, she destroyed our high hopes. 
     <lb/>
     I ask Mr. Bradley how this deal would have 
     <lb/>
     compelled him to change his economic picture, 
     <lb/>
     and what this country would have been like 
     <lb/>
     today, praticularly for our fishermen in every 
     <lb/>
     section of the country if this deal had not been 
     <lb/>
     deliberately sabotaged by the interference of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This speech I regard as an effort by one who 
     <lb/>
     is politically partisan. It is a demagogic appeal to 
     <lb/>
     stir unrest and dissatisfaction among our 
     <lb/>
     people.... Certainly we had bad times, but so had 
     <lb/>
     all other countries. Canada was throwing out dole 
     <lb/>
     money by the millions. The USA was doing the 
     <lb/>
     same.... Is anyone so foolish as to think that we 
     <lb/>
     can find a way of life to banish hard times? What 
     <lb/>
     nonsense! Look at England today, look at all of 
     <lb/>
     Europe.... In our case we should thank Almighty 
     <lb/>
     God that things were no worse with us. We were 
     <lb/>
     one of the most fortunate countries in the world 
     <lb/>
     all things considered, and I am inclined to repeat 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley's words about marching to Zion. 
     <lb/>
     There is no Zion in this fallen world, where man 
     <lb/>
     must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, and 
     <lb/>
     do not expect me or Mr. Bradley or anyone else 
     <lb/>
     to lead you to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I believe I have dealt with the 
     <lb/>
     several matters contained in this report which 
     <lb/>
     seem to call for some additional information. But 
     <lb/>
     before I go any further there is one matter that 
     <lb/>
     was referred to me outside this House the other 
     <lb/>
     day, which I think I should like to speak about. A 
     <lb/>
     member of this Convention asked me to explain 
     <lb/>
     something to the best of my ability about what 
     <lb/>
     happened in 1932, or 1931 I think, in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the gold standard. I have told it many times, 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="788"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-20_Page_0788.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">788</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
            

     and I am going to do the best I can to give him 
     <lb/>
     that information. In 1931 I happened to be Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance in Newfoundland, unfortunately. 
     <lb/>
     When our loans were turned down, and when we 
     <lb/>
     cut everything to the bone, as I described it here 
     <lb/>
     the other day, at the end of October, 1931, the 
     <lb/>
     banks came to the government, asking us to go 
     <lb/>
     off the gold standard. At that time our people had 
     <lb/>
     some $24-25 million in gold, in money in the 
     <lb/>
     banks, which they could take out on demand in 
     <lb/>
     gold. We refused for two months. Finally we had 
     <lb/>
     to go off. As an Executive Council member at that 
     <lb/>
     time you will understand that I am not in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to reveal anything of what happened. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley was a member at the same time. But here 
     <lb/>
     is what did happen: when we eventually went off 
     <lb/>
     the gold standard, gold was $20.67 an ounce. It 
     <lb/>
     did not rise to a very great extent during the next 
     <lb/>
     year, but when the last President Roosevelt took 
     <lb/>
     over the administration of the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     United States in March 1933 ... he rose the price 
     <lb/>
     of gold in order that the banks would be able to 
     <lb/>
     issue more paper, and give more employment, 
     <lb/>
     and gold went up to $35 an ounce. That meant 
     <lb/>
     that if we had not gone off the gold standard, and 
     <lb/>
     we had compelled the Canadian banks to bring 
     <lb/>
     down that $25 million in gold to pay our 
     <lb/>
     depositors, in 1930 or somewhere in that vicinity, 
     <lb/>
     their money would be worth 80% more than it 
     <lb/>
     was before. Now who made that money? Some 
     <lb/>
     people think that the Canadian chartered banks 
     <lb/>
     here made it. I hold that they did not. There was 
     <lb/>
     a central bank established in Canada which con<lb break="no"/>trolled currency, and they took over all the gold 
     <lb/>
     and they, if anyone, made the money, not the 
     <lb/>
     chartered banks; and I have no brief for the 
     <lb/>
     chartered banks, because I hate to go into one of 
     <lb/>
     them if I owe them a note or something, but I give 
     <lb/>
     them credit they did not make all that money. I 
     <lb/>
     think they got a commission, so to speak.... They 
     <lb/>
     made the profit, but Newfoundland lost that 
     <lb/>
     profit. Whoever's fault it is, it is done and we 
     <lb/>
     can't undo it.... That is the story of the bank 
     <lb/>
     people. I have not given it to you in full, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Reddy, because I am not in a position to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, would Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin explain how, when the government 
     <lb/>
     brought in the act which put us off the gold 
     <lb/>
     standard, it was not a mandatory act but merely 
     <lb/>
     a permissive one, that would have enabled the 
     <lb/>
     government to put us back on the gold standard 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     at any moment.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That's what happened. I went out 
     <lb/>of the finance department shortly after that. We 
     <lb/>went off the gold standard New Year's Eve, 
     <lb/>about 12.30. It was really New Year's Day. We 
     <lb/>were technically defaulting on December 31, and 
     <lb/>before they would give us any money to pay our 
     <lb/>interest, they put the gun to our head and told us 
     <lb/>we had to go off the gold standard....

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think in fairness to yourself, 
     <lb/>Major Cashin, you did point out the other day that 
     <lb/>the banks of Canada had that money, and if you

     <lb/>worth of gold to depositors they would have gone

            <p>I think you will admit, Mr. Chairman, that our

     <lb/>regarded as the best efforts of the Committee 
     <lb/>was subjected to vicious attack from the moment 
     <lb/>it was laid on the table. From every conceivable 
     <lb/>angle its critics attacked it, making it a political 
     <lb/>football. They went through all its 45 pages, 
     <lb/>looking for an uncrossed "t", or an undotted "i", 
     <lb/>to furnish them with ammunition for their 
     <lb/>denouncements. Mr. Chairman, when you 
     <lb/>opened the debate you said all holds were fair, 
     <lb/>and the critics came out and tore the report to 
     <lb/>bits...

     undeniable facts. It was the job of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Commmittee to ascertain the standing of our 
     <lb/>
     country, and viewing the handicaps under which 
     <lb/>
     they laboured, I think we have been reasonably 
     <lb/>
     successful. We distorted no figures, we neither 
     <lb/>
     enlarged or lessened the facts of things as we 
     <lb/>
     found them, and we came to our conclusions 
     <lb/>
     because there were no other conclusions at which 
     <lb/>
     we could honestly arrive. As the report shows, 
     <lb/>
     our ultimate findings were first that New<lb break="no"/>foundland was self-supporting, and that finding 
     <lb/>
     is still unchallenged — it is a proven fact. Our 
     <lb/>
     second conclusion was that this report showed 
     <lb/>
     that we would remain so in the foreseeable future. 
     <lb/>
     No arguments have been produced to prove or 
     <lb/>
     even indicate the contrary.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The impression has been created that the fu<lb break="no"/>ture of this country must necessarily be limited to 
     <lb/>
     the figures forecast in this report. For instance, 
     <lb/>
     we allow for future revenues of approximately 
     <lb/>
     $30 million per year. This does not mean that our 
     <lb/>
     revenues may not far exceed this amount. And for 
     <lb/>
     the same reason, the amounts which we have 
     <lb/>
     estimated as available for old age pensions and 
     <lb/>
     other social services may be far in excess of the 
     <lb/>
     figures we have given. Indeed I would hazard 
     <lb/>
     the guess that undreamed of prosperity awaits 
     <lb/>
     this country. And why do I say this? Because of 
     <lb/>
     something which is only briefly touched on in the 
     <lb/>
     report, an asset which we have not included in our 
     <lb/>
     estimate of revenue. I refer to Newfoundland- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador.... I now make another forecast and it is 
     <lb/>
     this: that if a Newfoundland government is ever 
     <lb/>
     in a position to capitalise on our Labrador posses<lb break="no"/>sion, she will in less than ten years be, for her size 
     <lb/>
     and population, the richest little country in the 
     <lb/>
     world. But why have we not heard more about the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador? Simply because it is not in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of those who want to exploit our territory to 
     <lb/>
     advertise the fact. They are keeping very quiet 
     <lb/>
     about it all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I realise that the discussions on 
     <lb/>
     this Economic Report have gone far over the time 
     <lb/>
     we thought would be necessary. However, realis<lb break="no"/>ing the circumstances under which this report 
     <lb/>
     was introduced and the varying political senti<lb break="no"/>ments which are held by delegates, a prolonged 
     <lb/>
     and bitter debate was perhaps all that could be 
     <lb/>
     expected. As chairman, I wish to extend my 
     <lb/>
     sincere thanks to each individual member of our 
     <lb/>
     Committee for his help and co-operation in the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            

     compiling of the facts. Also do I thank the various 
     <lb/>
     other committees for the valuable information 
     <lb/>
     which their various reports made available to 
     <lb/>
     us.... Our work is finished and it remains for the 
     <lb/>
     delegates to accept our report or reject it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I move that the committee rise, report pro<lb break="no"/>gress and ask leave to sit again. 
     <lb/></p>

            <p>Dear Mr. Smallwood:

            </p>
            <p>Due to my absence from the Convention,

            <p>I therefore move order No. 2 on the order paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The motion is that the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion resolve itself into a committee of the whole 
     <lb/>to consider and discuss the proposals received on 
     <lb/>November 6 from the Right Honourable the

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before that motion is put, I would 
     <lb/>like to make a few remarks. Two or three days 
     <lb/>ago I suggested a private session to discuss the 
     <lb/>manner in which this particular motion is to be 
     <lb/>discussed. It was not thought fit by members at 
     <lb/>that time that we should have a private session, 
     <lb/>but that it should be discussed in public. There<lb break="no"/>fore I should like to have a full discussion on how 
     <lb/>it is proposed to give effect to this resolution. If 
     <lb/>the Convention goes into committee of the 
     <lb/>whole, how is it proposed that we discuss this 
     <lb/>matter? Are we going to read through the Black 
     <lb/>Books? I think we should have some definite plan 
     <lb/>of action before we turn ourselves into a commit<lb break="no"/>tee of the whole, and know where we are going. 
     <lb/>Probably you, sir, could give us some idea of how 
     <lb/>we should be guided in the matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> This is a procedural question 
     <lb/>before the Chair. The advisability or otherwise of 
     <lb/>proceeding with this matter by committee of the 
     <lb/>whole is a procedural question which must be 
     <lb/>decided by the Convention.... I think, however, 
     <lb/>your request is quite reasonable. In view of the 
     <lb/>fact that Mr. Bradley is sick, his request is that 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood should pilot this matter though 
     <lb/>committee of the whole; if you do not mind, Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood, would you be good enough to en<lb break="no"/>lighten us on how you think you should go about 
     <lb/>it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The last part of Mr. Bradley's letter 
     <lb/>is quite improper. It is a matter for the committee 
     <lb/>to appoint its chairman. Mr. Bradley has nothing 
     <lb/>to do with appointing him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In my own limited experience 
     <lb/>here, the Finance Report and the Economic

            <cb/>
    
     by this Convention. Therefore there is no depar<lb break="no"/>ture from established precedent in Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's presiding without a vote to that 
     <lb/>
     effect from the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Surely it must be agreed to by

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is purely a procedural matter 
     <lb/>which should have been dealt with, perhaps, by 
     <lb/>the Steering Committee.... I am not prepared, not 
     <lb/>having examined the documents, to express an 
     <lb/>opinion as to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">modus operandi</hi> if and when the 
     <lb/>Convention resolves itself into a committee of the 
     <lb/>whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What I had in mind was, first 
     <lb/>of all, not to make any long speeches in commit<lb break="no"/>tee of the whole; secondly, not to read through 
     <lb/>this communication from the Prime Minister of 
     <lb/>Canada; thirdly, not to read through the Black 
     <lb/>Books (that is, the report of the delegation). My 
     <lb/>proposal was to do this: immediately upon going 
     <lb/>into committee of the whole to read first, two or 
     <lb/>three passages from the speech of the Prime 
     <lb/>Minister of Canada opening our conference in 
     <lb/>Ottawa; secondly, one or two passages from the 
     <lb/>speech of Mr. Bradley in reply to the Prime 
     <lb/>Minister, because these two speeches gave the 
     <lb/>setting to the conference. Then, thirdly, I was 
     <lb/>going to read the letter of the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>contained in the Grey Book. Having done that, I 
     <lb/>was going to read clause one of the communica<lb break="no"/>tion of the basis of union, explain what that clause 
     <lb/>meant, and then sit down. If any member wishes 
     <lb/>to direct questions at me, bearing on clause 1, I 
     <lb/>would attempt to answer. If any member cared to 
     <lb/>make comments on Clause 1, he would, of 
     <lb/>course, be free to do so. Clause 1 having been 
     <lb/>disposed of, I then proposed to read clause 2, with 
     <lb/>some brief explanation of it, then sit down. Same 
     <lb/>procedure, clause by clause; to refer to the Black 
     <lb/>Books (the report of the delegation) only by way 
     <lb/>of explaining any point that required explanation. 
     <lb/>It seems to me that if we followed that proce<lb break="no"/>dure in a businesslike fashion, and tackled this 
     <lb/>communication clause by clause, consulting the 
     <lb/>documents — the supporting papers, so to speak, 
     <lb/>we should be able to get through this thing in 
     <lb/>eight or ten days.

     carry on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think we better discount that 
     <lb/>
     from our calculations. I have no knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley's condition.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I think you know my attitude 
     <lb/>
     regarding the whole confederation idea. I main<lb break="no"/>tain we are not a competent body to deal with it. 
     <lb/>
     I always felt we had no authority to do it and I 
     <lb/>
     still hold that. I suppose if I followed my con<lb break="no"/>science I would try to keep the thing from coming 
     <lb/>
     in here at all; but we did vote to send the delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Ottawa, and as a result His Excellency has 
     <lb/>
     chosen to send us some documents which he got 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. King. I therefore think we are duty 
     <lb/>
     bound to do something.... The point Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     raised is well taken. There were seven men on 
     <lb/>
     that delegation and either one, of course, would 
     <lb/>
     be eligible to take the chair. I have no objection 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Smallwood's taking the chair and piloting 
     <lb/>
     it through. Would you tell me this, sir, are you not 
     <lb/>
     in a similar position as the Speaker of the House 
     <lb/>
     of Assembly in the position which you hold now? 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. If I were Speaker of the 
     <lb/>House, I would not be occupying the committee 
     <lb/>chair at all. There would be a chairman of com<lb break="no"/>mittees to whom the thing in the ordinary course 
     <lb/>would go. I am in the paradoxical position of 
     <lb/>having to leave the equivalent of the Speaker's 
     <lb/>chair, take the chair of committee, come back and 
     <lb/>report to myself; it is most unusual. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> ....I would suggest in carrying out 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley's request, it would be quite in order 
     <lb/>
     for you to appoint whom you please, and I would 
     <lb/>
     say the logical person would be the person whom 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley suggests. To keep the record 
     <lb/>
     straight, I think it is definitely up to you to make 
     <lb/>
     the appointment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not so sure about my posi<lb break="no"/>tion here.... There is nothing in our Standing 
     <lb/>
     Orders which permits me to appoint a chairman. 
     <lb/>
     I therefore hold our Standing Orders are silent on 
     <lb/>
     that point. That being so, I must take refuge in the 
     <lb/>
     rules of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     which brings me to Rule 122: "in forming a 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole House, the Speaker 
     <lb/>
     before leaving the Chair shall appoint a Chairman 
     <lb/>
     to preside who shall maintain order in the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee." That order presupposes the appointment 
     <lb/>
     of a chairman to preserve order in committee, 
     <lb/>
     which I have been doing heretofore. Therefore 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
        

     Rule 122 does not apply to the case in point, 
     <lb/>
     namely the appointment of somebody to pilot the 
     <lb/>
     business before the House which is different from 
     <lb/>
     appointing a chairman for the purpose of main<lb break="no"/>taining order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> How do you construe that section? 
     <lb/>  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> "The Speaker, before leaving 
     <lb/>the Chair, shall appoint a Chairman to preside 
     <lb/>who shall maintain order in the Committee", that 
     <lb/>is to say, appoint a chairman of the committee for 
     <lb/>the purpose of maintaining order. In the House of 
     <lb/>Assembly a bill is piloted through, usually, by the 
     <lb/>person who introduces it. Now, this Grey Book 
     <lb/>was introduced here by me, or at my direction, 
     <lb/>in conformity with directions I had received from 
     <lb/>His Excellency the Govemor.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You introduced the documents; 
     <lb/>
     these are the ones we are to discuss and I hold it 
     <lb/>
     is your prerogative to appoint whom you please 
     <lb/>
     to pilot it through. I want to be clearly understood 
     <lb/>
     in this — I have no objection to Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     being appointed, but I would like to see it done 
     <lb/>
     right.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would suggest we decide whether 
     <lb/>
     we will go into committee of the whole first, then 
     <lb/>
     you will have a motion from the floor, and I can 
     <lb/>
     assure you it will not be embarrassing. Before we 
     <lb/>
     go on, there is one other point I would like to 
     <lb/>
     discuss. All the members here, with some ap<lb break="no"/>prehension and with just cause, are wondering 
     <lb/>
     how long the debate will continue. Is it possible, 
     <lb/>
     if we go into committee of the whole, that a 
     <lb/>
     motion under section 48: "A motion may be made 
     <lb/>
     during the proceedings of a Committee that the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman do report to the Convention" —do you 
     <lb/>
     view that as closing off the debate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> At any time a closure motion 
     <lb/>
     may be made. A closure motion is without

     debate. If it is deferred for any reason, it will be 
     <lb/>
     the right of any member to move that the question 
     <lb/>
     be put and I will have to put it. At any stage, it 
     <lb/>
     would be open to any member to move a closure 
     <lb/>
     motion, whereupon I would have to put the mo<lb break="no"/>tion without debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Under Section 47, "when all mat<lb break="no"/>ters have been considered the Chairman shall

     <lb/>
     motion, I have to put that motion.... A closure 
     <lb/>
     motion is non-debatable. If I receive that at any 
     <lb/>
     time, I have to put it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That is your ruling? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is my ruling as far as a 
     <lb/>
     closure motion is concerned.... I have to put any 
     <lb/>
     motions received in committee to you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> The method outlined by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood for procedure was probably the best 
     <lb/>
     way to tackle it. But I would like to be clear on 
     <lb/>
     this. Mr. Smallwood said in going through it 
     <lb/>
     clause by clause, we would go on from one to the 
     <lb/>
     other. I would want to make sure there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     to prevent a member from reverting back to a 
     <lb/>
     previous clause at any time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The context of any clause may 
     <lb/>
     only be resolved perhaps in reference back to 
     <lb/>
     other clauses. I can give you a definite assurance 
     <lb/>
     on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Coming back to this question 
     <lb/>
     of appointing someone to pilot this through com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole. We have a precedent to 
     <lb/>
     follow. Major Cashin steered the Forestry 
     <lb/>
     Committee's report through committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole. I know the Chairman of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     did not appoint him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Furthermore, even if it was the 
     <lb/>
     practice to have the chairman of a committee 
     <lb/>
     pilot it though the committee stage, I would rule 
     <lb/>
     that it is not applicable here. For this reason, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley was a member of that delegation by 
     <lb/>
     virtue of the fact that he was Chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> He was a member <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex officio</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Therefore, the moment he 
     <lb/>
     resigned his office, he lost his right to appoint 
     <lb/>
     anyone. The more I go on, the more I become 
     <lb/>
     convinced of the soundness of what Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     says; that it is going to devolve upon me to 
     <lb/>
     appoint somebody to steer it through, if and when 
     <lb/>
     you decide to go into committee of the whole. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, if the motion to go into committee of 
     <lb/>
     the whole is accepted, then I think I will appoint 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            

     a person to do it. In view of the fact that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley is absent, then I propose to appoint Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood to pilot it through. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> One other question I would like to 
     <lb/>
     ask, there is going to be certain information 
     <lb/>
     which we will require, to whom shall one direct 
     <lb/>
     these questions? To you or to whom? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think the questions should be 
     <lb/>
     directed, in the first instance, to the person pilot<lb break="no"/>ing it though. If you are not satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     information supplied, because it lacks official 
     <lb/>
     standing, then you should address your questions 
     <lb/>
     to me.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Before you put the question, I 
     <lb/>
     just want to say I associate myself with the 
     <lb/>
     remarks made by Mr. Hollett earlier in the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings. When the House divided on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, on both occasions my name appeared in the 
     <lb/>
     negative. I did not think we were competent to 
     <lb/>
     deal with this matter as a Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are stopped now from com<lb break="no"/>menting on the competency or otherwise of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, by virtue of the fact that you should 
     <lb/>
     have determined it before you sent the delegation 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> I did not send them at any time. 
     <lb/>
     I had nothing to do with it, first or last. Surely I 
     <lb/>
     can say that. Now that we have the documents 
     <lb/>
     before us, I suppose we have to make the best of 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If there was a division taken 
     <lb/>
     twice, and you voted against it, your position is 
     <lb/>
     already a matter of record, twice. In this par<lb break="no"/>ticular instance, Mr. Smallwood, I will appoint 
     <lb/>
     you to take over, by virtue of the fact that you 
     <lb/>
     were a member of that committee and in view of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that Mr. Bradley is absent and has re<lb break="no"/>quested you to pilot it through.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is that in view of Mr. Bradley's 
     <lb/>
     absence, or is it for the duration? I take it, when 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley comes back, he will take over. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood's appointment 
     <lb/>
     will be deemed to stand unless, upon his ap<lb break="no"/>pearance in the House, Mr. Bradley is prepared

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I guarantee you that what I said 
     <lb/>
     was, "I will read it, make a brief explanation and 
     <lb/>
     sit down." I have not made the brief explanation. 
     <lb/>
     The explanation is this: from the time we would 
     <lb/>
     become part of the Canadian union, we would 
     <lb/>
     have the status of a province with all the rights, 
     <lb/>
     powers and privileges and responsibilities of a 
     <lb/>
     province. That means this: as I see it, Canada is 
     <lb/>
     a union of countries called provinces — there are 
     <lb/>
     nine of them. If we became a province, there 
     <lb/>
     would be ten provinces. Canada is a union of 
     <lb/>
     provinces or of countries. Each of these provinces 
     <lb/>
     has its own legislature which it elects itself. That 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
           

     House of Assembly or legislature governs the 
     <lb/>
     province in all matters that are laid down for it to 
     <lb/>
     govern it. The other matters are handled, of 
     <lb/>
     course, by the government of the whole union, 
     <lb/>
     that is the federal government. Turn to Vol. 1 of 
     <lb/>
     the Black Books, page 81.<ref target="#fn_07">[4]</ref> You will find there a 
     <lb/>
     description of provincial governments. Section

     explain some clause which may be read. I under<lb break="no"/>stood you were to give a brief explanation and sit 
     <lb/>
     down; that questions would be addressed to you; 
     <lb/>
     in the course of your replies, if and when it 
     <lb/>
     became necessary, you would refer to the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books as independent corroboration of the ex<lb break="no"/>planation you would give. If my interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     your remarks is correct, I think you are premature 
     <lb/>
     in referring to the Black Books at this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We are at clause 1 . In this docu<lb break="no"/>ment there are 23 clauses. We are at the shortest 
     <lb/>
     one of them all. It might be very useful if we 
     <lb/>
     determine in advance that very point. A clause is 
     <lb/>
     given. An explanation of that clause is contained 
     <lb/>
     in the Black Books — that is, the report brought 
     <lb/>
     back by the delegation. There is no suggestion 
     <lb/>
     that we take up those two thundering great 
     <lb/>
     volumes, begin at the first page and read through 
     <lb/>
     to the end.... The background of the Grey Book 
     <lb/>
     is in the Black Book. The Black Book explains 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book. What is the use of telling the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland that "Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will have, as from the date of union, the status of 
     <lb/>
     a province" if you do not explain what is the 
     <lb/>
     status of a province? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Are you not anticipating the 
     <lb/>
     position? If, as Mr. Higgins contends, the clause 
     <lb/>
     is unambiguous and unequivocal, and is general<lb break="no"/>ly understood, then we must credit the people 
     <lb/>
     with at least as much intelligence as we have. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As much intelligence, but with 
     <lb/>as much information? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the clause or any phrase of the 
     <lb/>
     clause is ambiguous, then that will be a matter for 
     <lb/>
     question; and in reply to any questions, then of 
     <lb/>
     course you should be at liberty to then refer to the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books. I think you should, in conformity 
     <lb/>
     with the position as I understand it, and as I must 
     <lb/>
     assume the House understands it, content your<lb break="no"/>self with reading the clause, then give your ex<lb break="no"/>planation or interpretation of the clause. If any 
     <lb/>
     questions arise out of that, or if your interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion if questioned, then and only then may you 
     <lb/>
     refer to the Black Books. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Does that mean that unless 
     <lb/>
     some member of the Convention happens to ask 
     <lb/>
     a question, the answer to which can only be found 
     <lb/>
     in the Black Books, I may not refer to the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books? In that case we might as well take these 
     <lb/>
     and throw them out the window. Are the people 
     <lb/>
     not to get the information in this report? This is a

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is for members to decide.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> One question I would like to ask in 
     <lb/>
     reference to speeches which were made by the 
     <lb/>
     chairman of the delegation, and also the speech 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          

     of Mr. King. After stating that the matter is one 
     <lb/>
     for the Newfoundland people to decide, Mr. King 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say, "On the part of Canada, no final 
     <lb/>
     decision would, of course, be taken without the 
     <lb/>
     approval of Parliament". I would like to ask Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, what body makes the final decision 
     <lb/>
     with regard to Newfoundland? In Canada no final 
     <lb/>
     decision would, of course, be made without the 
     <lb/>
     approval of Parliament, but assuming that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland vote for confederation 
     <lb/>
     at the referendum, who makes the agreement 
     <lb/>
     with the Government of Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Let me repeat the question, if I 
     <lb/>
     may. "In the case of Canada, the decision to 
     <lb/>
     receive Newfoundland as a province is made by 
     <lb/>
     the elected Parliament of Canada. In the case of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, who makes the decision that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland become a province?" The answer 
     <lb/>
     is, the decision to have Newfoundland become a 
     <lb/>
     province or not is a decision to be made, if it is 
     <lb/>
     made at all, by the people of Newfoundland in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. I am sure Mr. Hollett will agree that 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland we have various institutions — 
     <lb/>
     magistrates' courts, Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>
     National Convention, etc. Over and above all 
     <lb/>
     these institutions are the people. They are 
     <lb/>
     supreme and they are sovereign. You cannot go 
     <lb/>
     higher than the people. In deciding what form of 
     <lb/>
     government we shall have, they are the last word 
     <lb/>
     of all. If anyone decides, the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will decide that Newfoundland shall 
     <lb/>
     become a province, or Newfoundland shall not 
     <lb/>
     become a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Smallwood has missed the 
     <lb/>
     point. I am aware that the people of any country 
     <lb/>
     are the people to decide the approved policy. 
     <lb/>
     Assuming the people of Newfoundland decided 
     <lb/>
     by referendum that they would like to go into 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada under proper terms, I am 
     <lb/>
     asking what body in Newfoundland ... would 
     <lb/>
     approve any terms of agreement which may be 
     <lb/>
     drawn up between the two countries? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is a very good question. 
     <lb/>
     Let us look at it. If we were a self-governing 
     <lb/>
     country, we have a House of Assembly, made up 
     <lb/>
     of government and opposition... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> We have not got that. We all know 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is worth explaining. If we had 
     <lb/>
     our own legislature, as we had up to 1934, the 
     <lb/>
     position would be this: that to the King or to the

     Parliament of Great Britain, two joint addresses 
     <lb/>
     would go. One from the Parliament of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and a joint address from the legislature of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. These two addresses go to the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of  Great Britain, praying that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland be made a province of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is common knowledge.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is not common knowledge. 
     <lb/>
     Most people have not read the BNA<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> Act. The 
     <lb/>
     British Parliament would pass an act making 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland a province. That would be an 
     <lb/>
     amending act of theBNA. There is no parliament 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. Your question is, how would 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland be made a province if once the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland decide in the referen<lb break="no"/>dum that this should be a province. How would 
     <lb/>
     it be brought about? I suggest to you there are a 
     <lb/>
     number of possible ways.

            <p>

     the Commission of Government would take the

     something of that sort. I ruled in Mr. Crummey's 
     <lb/>
     favour; that disposes of that. We are reduced to 
     <lb/>
     the position where I would like you to address 
     <lb/>
     your reply to Mr. Hollett, forgetting the point of 
     <lb/>
     order which Mr. Crummey raised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> I considered Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     was going in a long circuitous route to answer Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett, and so I answered it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I sustained you on your point. 
     <lb/>
     With that in mind, Mr. Smallwood, would you 
     <lb/>
     answer the question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Surely I am not to be put in the 
     <lb/>
     position of being told how I am to answer a 
     <lb/>
     question? Am I to be told I must state it in two or 
     <lb/>
     three or 19 words? I must answer it in my own 
     <lb/>
     way. I cannot get outside my own skin and be<lb break="no"/>come someone else. Getting back to Mr. Hollett's 
     <lb/>
     question. We have no legislature in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, so the legislature of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     cannot make a joint address to Britain. We have 
     <lb/>
     not got a legislature, not an elected one. The 
     <lb/>
     Commission is the legislature of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     at the present time; they are both government and 
     <lb/>
     legislature, filling both functions. That is one 
     <lb/>
     way; to have the purely formal petition go to the 
     <lb/>
     British Parliament; it would only be a formality 
     <lb/>
     once the people have pronounced upon it in the 
     <lb/>
     national referendum; all the rest is a mere for<lb break="no"/>mality, a mere technicality. The real thing is what 
     <lb/>
     the people want. If the people want confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, one way is to follow the BNA Act and say, 
     <lb/>
     "All right, there is a legislature in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     now". It was not elected, it is true. But it is the 
     <lb/>
     legislature. No one is going to deny that... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is this the answer, that the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government would do it? Remember that 
     <lb/>
     the Commission is composed of four Englishmen 
     <lb/>
     and three Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is not the ideal way, but it is 
     <lb/>
     the legislature, though not an elected one. 
     <lb/>
     Another way is this — take the parliament we

     <lb/>
     the one that governs us, that administrative 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Parliament of Great Britain. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose the Parliament of Great Britain... holds the 
     <lb/>
     referendum in Newfoundland and the people 
     <lb/>
     declare their choice, the British Parliament is the 
     <lb/>
     one who receives the people's answer. If the 
     <lb/>
     answer is, "We want confederation", the British 
     <lb/>
     Parliament might well amend the BNA Act to 
     <lb/>
     make us a province, provided always the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada also requested it. In this way, the 
     <lb/>
     British Parliament has two requests — from the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to make it a province; 
     <lb/>
     and from the Parliament of Canada to make New<lb break="no"/>foundland a province.... 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I might point out that the BNA 
     <lb/>Act has already made provision, under section 
     <lb/>49, for the entry of Newfoundland into con<lb break="no"/>federation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In a specific way — the joint 
     <lb/>addresses of the legislatures; but we have not got 
     <lb/>a legislature. We have the position that if in the 
     <lb/>referendum the people of Newfoundland say, 
     <lb/>"We want confederation" the rest is a mere 
     <lb/>technicality. I am not going to get excited over a 
     <lb/>mere technicality. What I am excited over is how 
     <lb/>the people will vote. The rest is mere formality. 
     <lb/>It is perfectly constitutional.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Some people do not care whether it 
     <lb/>is constitutional or not. But I also read the letter. 
     <lb/>Mr. King emphatically stated, apart from one or 
     <lb/>two matters like education, that this is the last 
     <lb/>word as far as terms are concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Financial terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> These are financial terms — that is 
     <lb/> what concerns the country most. I also point out 
     <lb/>there is a big discrepancy between the needs of 
     <lb/>this country as a province and the actual receipts 
     <lb/>from revenues. You made it out slightly over $1 
     <lb/>million; I figured it out myself at $2 million. Mr. 
     <lb/>King says, "This is the last word; we are afraid 
     <lb/>we will not be able to do anything further". The 
     <lb/>reason I asked the question as to who will 
     <lb/>negotiate these financial terms is, I want to know 
     <lb/>whether it will be the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>or the British government? 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Hollett has hopped from

     about the letter. I want it understood that if in the

     referendum a majority voted for confederation, 
     <lb/>
     then you say it is a mere technicality — "We do 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     million short on running the province, that is 
     <lb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Reverting to the letter, the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister says: "I feel I must emphasise that 
     <lb/>as far as the financial aspects of the proposed 
     <lb/>arrangements for union are concerned, the

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> This is something more important

            <p>With respect to those matters which are

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the government says these are financial

     terms, they mean on the financial side, the money

     side. On the conscience side, such as touches the

     dearest beliefs of our people, you have no hard

     not dealing with finance, such as education, do

     you think the government would not send back a

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Another thing I would like to ask. 
     <lb/>These speeches are very enlightening. We have 
     <lb/>occasion to refer to them many times. On page 
     <lb/>15,<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> Mr. Bradley says, "We believe we possess 
     <lb/>at least the basic possibilities of enduring 
     <lb/>prosperity." I want to refer to that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Why not read the whole para<lb break="no"/>graph? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I might be asked to read the whole 
     <lb/>
     book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is distortion. You are not 
     <lb/>
     reading the whole sentence. You are beginning 
     <lb/>
     in the middle of something. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, would you tell me 
     <lb/>
     where I have to start to read a sentence? "We 
     <lb/>
     believe we possess at least the basic possibilities 
     <lb/>
     of enduring prosperity; if once we come by the 
     <lb/>
     type of government that will be a help rather than 
     <lb/>
     a hindrance to sound development." I want to ask 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood does he honestly believe we pos<lb break="no"/>sess at least the basic possibilities of enduring 
     <lb/>
     prosperity? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Indeed I do.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I want to ask him what is meant by 
     <lb/>
     that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....If it means anything, it 
     <lb/>
     means this, a government that will give us free 
     <lb/>
     trade, take off customs duties on things going into 
     <lb/>
     basic industry, bring down cost of production and 
     <lb/>
     bring down cost of living. That is what that 
     <lb/>
     means. The kind of government that will give us 
     <lb/>
     free trade and thereby help, not hinder sound 
     <lb/>
     development. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I take it the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment which we have now, who in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with the report of Mr. Howell about reduction of 
     <lb/>
     duties are endeavouring to reduce taxes, they are 
     <lb/>
     not the proper form of government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is a statement made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley, not by Mr. Smallwood. I do not know, 
     <lb/>
     in fairness to Mr. Bradley, whether his alleged 
     <lb/>
     antipathy towards Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     should be stated here. It is capable of almost any 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           

     construction.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Did I say anything about alleged 
     <lb/>
     antipathy?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....The tenor of your question 
     <lb/>
     was whether Mr. Bradley regarded Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government a hindrance rather than a help. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I asked Mr. Smallwood if he

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I certainly regard Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government as a hindrance in development. 
     <lb/>
     They are not giving us free trade, they are still 
     <lb/>
     keeping on duties. If you are referring to the 
     <lb/>
     international multilateral trade agreements made 
     <lb/>
     between 23 countries, they have fallen in line 
     <lb/>
     with 22 other countries. You cannot credit the 
     <lb/>
     Commission government with that.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Could you tell us a form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment which will give us free trade?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Free trade with one other unit 
     <lb/>
     of the world? You can have free trade with all the

     Smallwood by what means we could go about 
     <lb/>
     increasing the population of this country? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I could give you an answer, but 
     <lb/>
     it might lead to bloodshed. Maybe the answer is 
     <lb/>
     in section 3 of the Grey Book, family allowances. 
     <lb/>
     I will drop the matter right now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is what you want? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was only joking. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> This is no place for joking. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sometimes it is better to joke 
     <lb/>
     than get angry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Perhaps that is good advice for 
     <lb/>
     some of us to take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> When we were discussing what 
     <lb/>
     body would eventually approve the terms of 
     <lb/>
     agreement, if Newfoundland were to enter into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, Mr. Crummey gave an opinion. 
     <lb/>
     He was present at the meeting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He quoted Mr. St. Laurent. He 
     <lb/>
     did not give an opinion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> The thing is not cleared up. There is 
     <lb/>
     a disagreement between Mr. Crummey and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. We are in a disarming position, we 
     <lb/>
     cannot get an agreement between two members 
     <lb/>
     of the delegation. It is a matter of indifference to 
     <lb/>
     me who is right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Are you asking me to make a 
     <lb/>
     decision on a matter in connection with which no 
     <lb/>
     records were kept? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I was wondering if Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     would concede to Mr. Crummey, and say that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Crummey was right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> Do you say I was wrong? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, indeed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> I was the one who asked the 
     <lb/>
     question, and I asked how to go about it and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     St. Laurent said that Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     was the government today, and we will have to 
     <lb/>
     proceed through them; they would have to go to 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government and dicker with 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Anything that may follow may be 
     <lb/>
     ill-founded. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is a disagreement. You 
     <lb/>
     must not draw conclusions, Mr. Miller, as to what 
     <lb/>
     may happen tomorrow or the next day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> As I see it, Mr. Crummey must be 
     <lb/>
     right, because Mr. St. Laurent sent these terms to 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government. Mr. St. Laurent 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          

     or Mr. King sent them to the Commission of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, he did not.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It looks that way.

                                          of the Commission of <lb/> Government. They were addressed

     Committee of the Privy Council in 1927 as New<lb break="no"/>foundland territory." This Convention knows and 
     <lb/>
     this country knows that Labrador was awarded, 
     <lb/>
     defined, laid down and declared in 1927 by the 
     <lb/>
     Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to be 
     <lb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> No, it does not say that. It says

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have to uphold you in this

     "will", as the expression "shall" implies that the

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Newfoundland owns Labra<lb break="no"/>dor. What Labrador does Newfoundland own? 
     <lb/>
     The Labrador defined by the Judicial Committee 
     <lb/>
     of the Privy Council in 1927. There is another 
     <lb/>
     part of Labrador on the other side of that bound<lb break="no"/>ary, which does not belong to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     This clause 2 says if Newfoundland becomes a 
     <lb/>
     province, the Newfoundland part will still be 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland-Labrador.... The boundary laid 
     <lb/>
     down in 1927 can be changed only with our 
     <lb/>
     consent.... That boundary can never be changed, 
     <lb/>
     except with the consent of the legislature of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. If the legislature should be foolish 
     <lb/>
     enough to do what they tried to do a few years 
     <lb/>
     ago, try to sell for a paltry $10 million, if the 
     <lb/>
     legislature wanted to sell it; if they wanted to 
     <lb/>
     change the boundary; they could allow the Par<lb break="no"/>liament to do it. It is up to the legislature. No one 
     <lb/>
     else can do it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is a very good point which Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood raises. He says the boundary is all 
     <lb/>
     right; it is Newfoundland-Labrador, but it can be 
     <lb/>
     changed with the consent of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     legislature — the provincial legislature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It can be changed now, without 
     <lb/>
     confederation. The government can sell it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is what your provincial 
     <lb/>
     government is going to do when we strike hard 
     <lb/>
     times. Canada will come across and say, "Look 
     <lb/>
     here, you are in a bad state. Let us see now, can 
     <lb/>
     we make a deal over Labrador? We will take that 
     <lb/>
     strip off. We will give you a loan to carry you 
     <lb/>
     on." That is their intention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Did they tell you that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> They told you a lot of stuff. You do 
     <lb/>
     not have to be told that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> In connection with what Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood says about Labrador, the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Quebec, Mr. Duplessis, thinks very dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from that. The Province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     controls the government of Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not quite so. The 
     <lb/>
     Province of Ontario and the Province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     supply the majority members to the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Let us deal with that. Everyone 
     <lb/>
     knows that Quebec would like to have Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     We all know that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> She is going to have it, she says. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Duplessis says more than 
     <lb/>his prayers. We know the Government of Quebec 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           

     and we know that Mr. Duplessis wants Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     He is the Premier of Quebec. He is one of the nine 
     <lb/>
     provincial premiers. That one premier would like 
     <lb/>
     to have Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Will you tell me who has the most 
     <lb/>
     control in the government of Ottawa? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Certainly. I am not trying to 
     <lb/>
     dodge it. We all know the Government of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     would like to have Labrador. So what? They were 
     <lb/>
     never satisfied to lose it, but did by the law case 
     <lb/>
     that was fought out in 1927 between New<lb break="no"/>foundland and whom? Between Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec? No! Between the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Not the Government of Quebec. Where should 
     <lb/>
     the boundary lie between Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canada down in Labrador? That was the question 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the Privy Council.... Quebec was 
     <lb/>
     trying hard. They had a lawyer sitting in the court 
     <lb/>
     with what they call a watching brief. Now, will 
     <lb/>
     any member of the delegation who was present 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa substantiate what I am saying when 
     <lb/>
     I say this: that Mr. St. Laurent told us as 
     <lb/>
     categorically, as plainly, as certainly and as final<lb break="no"/>ly as words could make it, that the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada accepted the award of the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, and what in the name of goodness else could 
     <lb/>
     they do? Is the Government of Canada not going 
     <lb/>
     to accept the award, the decision, the judgement, 
     <lb/>
     the verdict of the Privy Council? Of course they 
     <lb/>
     accept it, and they can do no other. Now I come 
     <lb/>
     to your question. We know Quebec wants 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. They were disgusted because they lost 
     <lb/>
     it.... But, you say, Quebec controls the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. Let us deal with that. First of all, 
     <lb/>
     I bring you back to section 3 of the BNA Act. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Penney knows the difference between govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Parliament: "The Parliament may, with 
     <lb/>
     the consent of any province, increase, 
     <lb/>
     diminish..." <hi rendition="simple:italic">With the consent!</hi> The Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     not the government. The Parliament includes the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party (who happen to have a majority in 
     <lb/>
     the government); the Conservative party, the So<lb break="no"/>cial Credit party and the CCF. Four political 
     <lb/>
     parties make up the Parliament. The Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     not the government could change the boundary, 
     <lb/>
     and Parliament could do it only with the consent 
     <lb/>
     of the Province of Newfoundland. That means 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Duplessis, if he should live long enough 
     <lb/>
     and still be premier, when he is an old man, he 
     <lb/>
     may still be roaring and bawling that he wants 
     <lb/>

     Labrador; and if he likes he can shout it when he 
     <lb/>
     dies, and if they open him up they will find 
     <lb/>
     Labrador engraved on his heart. He has nothing 
     <lb/>
     to do with it. It is the Parliament of Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of Canada is not the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I am not convinced over that. The 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada is controlled by the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party and the Liberal party is governed by 
     <lb/>
     the control of the Province of Quebec. It could be

     upset in the next general election. It holds the key. 
     <lb/>
     That is why I say there is something in what Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Duplessis says about Labrador and the boundary 
     <lb/>
     in particular. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The Province of Quebec elects 
     <lb/>
     65 members to the House of Commons. Ontario 
     <lb/>
     elects 96. A good many more than the Province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. Let me tell you something: there was 
     <lb/>
     a time when Quebec was not as big as it is now. 
     <lb/>
     At that same time, Ontario was not as big as it is 
     <lb/>
     now. What happened?.... Quebec was pushed 
     <lb/>
     north to the sea as far as she could go; Ontario 
     <lb/>
     was pushed north to the ocean as far as it could 
     <lb/>
     go. The last thing that can happen is that Quebec 
     <lb/>
     can be made bigger, because Ontario controls the 
     <lb/>
     government more than does Quebec. Quebec has 
     <lb/>
     65 members whom she elects; Ontario has, I 
     <lb/>
     think, 80-odd. Look in the Black Book and you 
     <lb/>
     will find the number. If you say Quebec controls 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament, why not say Ontario controls it 
     <lb/>
     still more? Do you think Ontario is going to sit 
     <lb/>
     by and allow Quebec to be made bigger? No. It 
     <lb/>
     cannot be done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> It has been proven those last years 
     <lb/>
     that Quebec is Liberal and it is their province that 
     <lb/>
     elected Mr. King and the government and kept 
     <lb/>
     them in power, and Ontario, although just as big, 
     <lb/>
     could not do anything to help her. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I agree with Mr. Penney.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That tells us a lot. That is a great 
     <lb/>
     contribution to the debate. It is very enlightening. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins tells us a lot. Now we know all about

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am afraid I must sustain Mr.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I have canvassed them as much as 
     <lb/>
     you have canvassed the l00,000 voters in this

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You would like to talk about

     Quebec. The population of Canada is 12.5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. The population of Quebec is of the order of

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am not interested in Ontario.

     When I ask a question, can I have the answer, not

     a roving commission? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Hollett asked you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, the population of Quebec.... You 
     <lb/>
     have not specifically answered his question.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I said it was of the order of four

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If by that token, the four mil<lb break="no"/>lions of Quebec can control Canada, by the same

     <lb/>
     more than control Canada. That follows, does it

     not?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> No. If Quebec went the other way,

     the present government would be out and we

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If Mr. Hollett is worried about 
     <lb/>
     the chances of the Liberal government of Canada

     falling, I would remind him that a matter of a 
     <lb/>
     month ago the thing that held up the delivery of 
     <lb/>
     this Grey Book was a by-election in a Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive constituency where the Liberal party won 
     <lb/>
     with the most thumping majority in recent history 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The Liberal government spent $1

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if the Conservative

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not ask them. I was not in touch 
     <lb/>
     with them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am well aware that there will 
     <lb/>
     be an effort made, in fact Mr. Penney practically 
     <lb/>
     made it, to indicate that because the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec — one of the nine provinces — has 65 
     <lb/>
     members in the House of Commons out of 245, 
     <lb/>
     Quebec controls Canada; therefore if Quebec 
     <lb/>
     wants Labrador she will get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I said nothing like that. I said the 
     <lb/>
     province controls the Liberal party at Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What I understood him to say 
     <lb/>was that the Liberal party supplied the balance of 
     <lb/>power. Quebec held the balance of power.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> That is what I said and I do not want 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood to put it in a different light.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> On that point, the suggestion is 
     <lb/>
     being made, that the members elected from 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ... would somehow or other persuade or 
     <lb/>
     force the Parliament of Canada, which has 245 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            

     members in it, to force Newfoundland to give 
     <lb/>
     Labrador to Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That fear has been expressed. 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The answer to that is this: I 
     <lb/>admit there may be a revolution. Quebec may 
     <lb/>raise an army and march into Labrador and be an 
     <lb/>army of occupation and say to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>province, "Get us out if you can". They might do 
     <lb/>that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> They might do it in a peaceful way. 
     <lb/> </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They might do it in an illegal 
     <lb/>way. They might — I do not suggest that will 
     <lb/>happen. How can they do it in a peaceful way?

     Mr. Chairman Yesterday afternoon, at the re<lb break="no"/>quest of members, a ten minute recess was taken

     Dear Sir:

            </p>

            <p>
     I refer to our telephone conversation of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday with reference to the request that I 
     <lb/>
     should appear before the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion sitting in committee of the whole to 
     <lb/>
     answer questions relating to the tariff agree<lb break="no"/>ments recently concluded at Geneva. I have

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     who instructed me to point out that a com<lb break="no"/>prehensive statement of the agreements in<lb break="no"/>sofar as they affect Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     recently issued by the government. In these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances the government would not be 
     <lb/>
     willing for me to appear before the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. If members desire further information 
     <lb/>
     about the agreement, and submit questions in 
     <lb/>
     writing, duly endorsed by the Information

     Committee, I shall be pleased to return 
     <lb/>
     answers provided I may properly do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have to point out that it will not be 
     <lb/>
     possible to answer questions relating to the

     Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a

     few remarks because I think we must all agree 
     <lb/>
     that we are not making very good progress under 
     <lb/>
     our present method of handling things. Yesterday 
     <lb/>
     the progress was distinctly poor, and it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me it will continue to be very poor unless some

     better method of tackling the report is adopted. 
     <lb/>
     There are too many interruptions, and too much 
     <lb/>
     time is wasted on technicalities. I suggest that 
     <lb/>
     better progress would be made if Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
