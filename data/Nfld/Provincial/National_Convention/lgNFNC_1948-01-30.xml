     other members; also to the various news bulletins 
     <lb/>
     and the different papers. They have done a mag<lb break="no"/>nificent job, and I think the country appreciates 
     <lb/>
     it fully. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman I would like to concur with the 
     <lb/>
     previous speakers in all they have said, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly the Broadcasting Corporation and the 
     <lb/>
     news bulletins and the papers. I do feel that we 
     <lb/>
     should make special reference to the reporting by 
     <lb/>
     the Daily News. They have given very complete 
     <lb/>
     coverage of our proceedings, and at no incon<lb break="no"/>siderable inconvenience to themselves... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry I would like to associate myself with 
     <lb/>
     this motion, because I represent the most remote 
     <lb/>
     district in this Convention, at district where the 
     <lb/>
     people depend upon the radio and the Broadcast<lb break="no"/>ing Corporation for their general news, and for 
     <lb/>
     the proceedings of this National Convention; and 
     <lb/>
     while I know it has been very hard on their dry 
     <lb/>
     battery supply this winter, and they will probably 
     <lb/>
     have to forego listening to other stations, perhaps 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     not being able to get a supply of dry batteries, yet 
     <lb/>
     I think they are very pleased to be able to listen 
     <lb/>
     to this Convention, and I want to express our 
     <lb/>
     warmest gratitude to the Corporation for broad<lb break="no"/>casting the proceedings of this Convention to the 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Reddy I wish to add a word of praise to the 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting station. The broadcasting of the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings has been a source of political educa<lb break="no"/>tion, especially to our outport people, the 
     <lb/>
     majority of whom had no other means of hearing 
     <lb/>
     of the work of the Convention. It will revive 
     <lb/>
     political interest throughout the country. It will 
     <lb/>
     perform a service to our people that cannot be 
     <lb/>
     measured in material costs. For the long hours 
     <lb/>
     those officials had to remain on duty, I presume 
     <lb/>
     they will be fully compensated. For the press and 
     <lb/>
     the Gerald S. Doyle News Bulletin I also add my 
     <lb/>
     praise. 
     <lb/>

     The Convention was opened by His Excellen<lb break="no"/>cy the Governor on September 11, 1946. As a 
     <lb/>
     first step in its investigations of the position of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, the Convention appointed nine 
     <lb/>
     committees consisting of ten members each to 
     <lb/>
     enquire into the following:

            <p>
     The duties of all the above-named committees 
     <lb/>
     now have been completed, and copies of the 
     <lb/>
     various reports submitted by them to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion will be found attached herewith. Each of the 
     <lb/>
     reports was in turn the subject of careful ex<lb break="no"/>amination and extensive discussion by the Con<lb break="no"/>vention in its general sessions. In some instances 
     <lb/>
     committees found it difficult to obtain all the 
     <lb/>
     information they would have desired for the 
     <lb/>
     making of a more comprehensive investigation. 
     <lb/>
     The Convention is satisfied, however, that under 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances, these various reports furnish 
     <lb/>
     a sufficiently accurate and complete review of the 
     <lb/>
     matters dealt with; and that their conclusions and 
     <lb/>
     recommendations are based upon substantial 
     <lb/>
     foundations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the course of its deliberations the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion deemed it advisable to send two fact-finding 
     <lb/>
     delegations abroad; one to London and the other 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa. The delegation to London left here on 
     <lb/>
     April 24, 1947, and returned on May 10, 1947, 
     <lb/>
     and reported the result of its three discussions 
     <lb/>
     with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs 
     <lb/>
     to the Convention; whilst, in addition, the actual 
     <lb/>
     conversations which took place, and which were 
     <lb/>
     reported stenographically, were supplied to each 
     <lb/>
     individual member for his private information 
     <lb/>
     only. The Ottawa delegation left on June 19, 
     <lb/>
     1947, and returned on October 4, 1947. During 
     <lb/>
     the absence of these two delegations the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion had been adjourned. The Convention recon<lb break="no"/>vened on October 10, 1947, and submitted an 
     <lb/>
     account of its meetings with representatives of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government which is contained in 
     <lb/>
     two volumes, copies of which are annexed 
     <lb/>
     hereto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Subsequent to the reconvening of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion on October 10, 1947, the Prime Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada, the Right Honourable 
     <lb/>
     W.L. Mackenzie King, forwarded by special 
     <lb/>
     courier to His Excellency the Governor, for trans<lb break="no"/>mission to the Convention, a document dated 
     <lb/>
     November 6, 1947, setting forth proposed arran<lb break="no"/>gements for the entry of Newfoundland into con<lb break="no"/>federation, with which was enclosed a letter from 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister of Canada also dated Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 6, 1947. A copy of the document and letter is 
     <lb/>
     annexed hereto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Also annexed hereto is the Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     on the present financial position and economic 
 

            <cb/>
     

     outlook of Newfoundland prepared by the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee of the Convention. This 
     <lb/>
     report was debated at length by the Convention 
     <lb/>
     and on January 14, 1948, was adopted unani<lb break="no"/>mously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The proposals received from the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government have been thoroughly discussed and 
     <lb/>
     analysed. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The following resolution was introduced and

    the minutes of the meetings of the Convention of

     Respectfully submitted, 
     <lb/>
     J .B. McEvoy, Chairman 
     <lb/>
     W.G. Warren, Secretary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     His Excellency accepted the said recommen<lb break="no"/>dations and addressed the Convention as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman and members of the Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention: It is now some 16 months 
     <lb/>
     since His Excellency the Governor, whose 
     <lb/>
     absence today we all regret, opened this Con<lb break="no"/>vention. In his speech he foretold, as it were, 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties which you would encounter in 
     <lb/>
     the performance of your task, and the consid<lb break="no"/>erable amount and the importance of the 
     <lb/>
     work which that task entailed. His prophesies 
     <lb/>
     have in a large measure been fulfilled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When an inquiry into the economic, politi<lb break="no"/>cal and financial affairs of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     was held in 1933, with a view to considering 
     <lb/>
     the remedy for our then serious situation, the 
     <lb/>
     task was entrusted to a royal commission 
     <lb/>
     consisting of three men chosen because of 
     <lb/>
     their particular qualifications for the work. 
     <lb/>
     For nearly nine months they laboured quiet<lb break="no"/>
     
            <pb n="1458" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-30_Page_1458.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1458</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
           
     ly, efficiently and speedily and in that com<lb break="no"/>paratively short time found themselves in a 
     <lb/>
     position to make their report and their recom<lb break="no"/>mendations. When it was decided to hold 
     <lb/>
     another enquiry, with a similar object in 
     <lb/>
     view, His Majesty's Government in Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain proposed a method along democratic 
     <lb/>
     lines, a method whereby the elected repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people, sitting in a National 
     <lb/>
     Convention should undertake work similar to 
     <lb/>
     that formerly performed by a chosen few. 
     <lb/>
     Now we all know that an elected assembly 
     <lb/>
     differs in many important respects from a 
     <lb/>
     small compact commission. The members 
     <lb/>
     are not chosen because of any particular 
     <lb/>
     qualifications; they come from different 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country and from different walks 
     <lb/>
     of life; they have different interests and have 
     <lb/>
     different conceptions of their duties and 
     <lb/>
     responsibilities. They work in public and in<lb break="no"/>stead of holding their discussion in the quiet 
     <lb/>
     detachment of a small conference chamber, 
     <lb/>
     they debate in full session and before a public 
     <lb/>
     audience, and, in the case of this particular 
     <lb/>
     Convention, over the wireless for the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of the public at large. That your proceedings 
     <lb/>
     have been prolonged, that your debates have 
     <lb/>
     from time to time resulted in some members 
     <lb/>
     wandering from the direct path of the terms 
     <lb/>
     of reference and that argument has frequently 
     <lb/>
     been passionate, all these things were, I 
     <lb/>
     think, to be expected. A great deal of the 
     <lb/>
     criticism which has been levelled at the Con<lb break="no"/>vention should therefore, in justice, be con<lb break="no"/>sidered bearing these factors in mind. The 
     <lb/>
     Convention, like similar national constitu<lb break="no"/>tional assemblies held in different parts of the 
     <lb/>
     world since the war has followed a pattern 
     <lb/>
     which was in large measure to be anticipated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Your debates have been followed with 
     <lb/>
     keen interest by our fellow countrymen and 
     <lb/>
     it is probably true to say that a great deal more 
     <lb/>
     information has been broadcast to a greater 
     <lb/>
     number of people by the means adopted, than 
     <lb/>
     would have resulted from the limited circula<lb break="no"/>tion and publicity given to a lengthy report of 
     <lb/>
     a royal commission. Your labours have been 
     

            <cb/>
    

     long and arduous and I feel sure that you will 
     <lb/>
     be happy at the release which becomes effec<lb break="no"/>tive today. In a short time a referendum will 
     <lb/>
     take place and our fellow countrymen will be 
     <lb/>
     enabled to disclose the extent to which their 
     <lb/>
     interest in their own welfare has been aroused 
     <lb/>
     by your efforts. The only manner in which 
     <lb/>
     they can show that they are really interested 
     <lb/>
     in an desirous of some form of democratic 
     <lb/>
     government, as we know it, is by exercising 
     <lb/>
     their right to vote in great numbers. Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government, excellent as it is as a 
     <lb/>
     temporary stop gap in the case of emergency, 
     <lb/>
     does not provide the proper spiritual outlet 
     <lb/>
     for the development of the political soul of a 
     <lb/>
     free people. Their ultimate goal must be 
     <lb/>
     democratic government either alone or as a 
     <lb/>
     partner in a greater democratic union. 
     <lb/>
     Whether democratic government is to come 
     <lb/>
     now or later, it is only by the exercise of the 
     <lb/>
     right to vote that the people can demand it, as 
     <lb/>
     it is only by similar action that they can 
     <lb/>
     control it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know that you will all agree that a special 
     <lb/>
     word of thanks is due for the services 
     <lb/>
     rendered by your various Chairmen, the late 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Justice Fox, whose sudden death 
     <lb/>
     was so much lamented, Mr. Bradley and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McEvoy, all of whom have given valuable 
     <lb/>
     gratuitous service in an office which was not 
     <lb/>
     at all times an enviable one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gentlemen, you have been separated from 
     <lb/>
     your families and your pursuits for a consid<lb break="no"/>erable time and in thanking you for your 
     <lb/>
     efforts in this historic Convention, I hope that 
     <lb/>
     now that you can return to your normal lives 
     <lb/>
     you will find happiness and good fortune. I 
     <lb/>
     know formally accept your recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions and assure you that they will be trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Right Honourable the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State at the earliest opportunity.
