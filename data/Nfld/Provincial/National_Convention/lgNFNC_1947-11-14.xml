<!-- GL, 2017-03-07, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->
            <!--<p>
     have, and I want to consider it too, Mr. Hollett, if 
     <lb/>
     you don't mind. You moved the adjournment, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins Yes, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job I would like to ask whether we are 
     <lb/>
     likely to be here for the next six months, or for 
     <lb/>
     how long? And whether we are going to still 
     <lb/>
     continue to meet for 2Â¼ hours a day, and if we 
     <lb/>
     are, how long will we be here? I would suggest 
     <lb/>
     very strongly that some steps be taken to either 
     <lb/>
     meet in the morning for a couple of hours, or in 
     <lb/>
     the evening. I don't know what the views of the 
     <lb/>
     members are with regard to that, but I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that we are getting through very little, and 
     <lb/>
     achieving very little, and the sooner we make up 
     <lb/>
     our minds to try and find a winding-up date the 
     <lb/>
     better.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins I thoroughly agree with Mr. Job in 
     <lb/>
     every way that we will have to step up our dis<lb break="no"/>cussions here. I think it might be better for all of 
     <lb/>
     us if, instead of having morning sessions, we 
     <lb/>
     decided we would have night sessions every day 
     <lb/>
     that the Convention is in session. I make the 
     <lb/>
     motion that, beginning Monday, we have night 
     <lb/>
     sessions on every day that we have a day session. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman Does the House agree to 
     <lb/>eliminate the necessity for notice? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I object. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman In that case, with a single dis<lb break="no"/>senting voice, you will have to give me notice. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Higgins If you will give me about three 
     <lb/>minutes I will deliver the motion, if that's satis<lb break="no"/>factory. I don't see why Mr. Smallwood must 
     <lb/>object. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood What I was thinking of is the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     fact that confederation has to be debated yet, and 
     <lb/>
     I want the people of Newfoundland to hear the 
     <lb/>
     debate, and if we have sessions every night... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Higgins I rise to a point of order. If we have 
     <lb/>this member objecting all the time, it's time we 
     <lb/>stopped sitting altogether. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Members will please remain 
     <lb/>
     silent. As far as I am concerned I am getting 
     <lb/>
     notice of motion. I can only waive notice by and 
     <lb/>
     with the universal consent of the House. That I 
     <lb/>
     have not got, together we will have to deal with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins' motion when it goes on the order 
     <lb/>
     paper, and when it comes before me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge Mr. Chairman, I agree with Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins and Mr. Job that we are trying to get on with 
     <lb/>
     the job, but at the same time I feel that it is very 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate that two of the members disagreed. 
     <lb/>
     If that had not happened this debate might not 
     <lb/>
     have been as long as it has been.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The committee rose and reported progress] 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman Mr. Bradley's motion â Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I move that that be deferred sir, 
     <lb/>
     and also number four. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins I move the deferment of number 
     <lb/>
     three, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The motions are that items two, 
     <lb/>
     three and four on the order paper will be deferred. 
     <lb/>
     [The motion carried] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins I would like to give notice of mo<lb break="no"/>tion. I will on tomorrow move that this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion hold night sessions on every day that a day's 
     <lb/>
     session of the Convention is held. 
     <lb/>

                                          started this <lb/> session. There are a few comments I
                                          must make <lb/> about our economic condition generally. I
                                          am not <lb/> going to quibble about individual sections,
                                                 sen<lb break="no"/>tences, figures or anything in
                                          the report which, <lb/> allowing for human fallibility,
                                          presents a fairly <lb/> comprehensive picture. However, I
                                          would like to <lb/> compliment my colleague from St.
                                          George's <lb/> West who, while he did not see fit to sign
                                          the <lb/> Economic Report, nevertheless gave a very clear
                                          <lb/> and concise expression of the point of view he <lb/>
                                          holds as a co-operative worker, and which, also <lb/> as a
                                          co-operative worker, I hold.... <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     On questions of economics there is bound to 
     <lb/>
     be disagreement, because we all see things from 
     <lb/>
     different points of view. Certainly, when we 
     <lb/>
     come to speak on the economic position of our 
     <lb/>
     country, which is a matter of grave concern for 
     <lb/>
     all of us, there is room for wide disagreement. 
     <lb/>
     The thing that bothers and annoys me is that we 
     <lb/>
     seem to have run into a son of iron curtain which 
     <lb/>
     separates us into different and opposing camps 
     <lb/>
     and through which we find it difficult to see. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Looked at from my attitude towards eco<lb break="no"/>nomic matters, there are certain things about this 
     <lb/>
           
   
            
          
            <cb/>
          
     Economic Report and the discussions on it which 
     <lb/>
     we have tended to overlook. I think, like the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the world, we are a little too much concerned 
     <lb/>
     with money. That is one of the fallacies of the 
     <lb/>
     materialistic age.... There are other things besides 
     <lb/>
     money. Let me say that I reiterate the views 
     <lb/>
     expressed by another delegate some time ago in 
     <lb/>
     discriminating between money and real value. I 
     <lb/>
     feel the discussions have, in other than one brief 
     <lb/>
     reference, overlooked the question of value. We 
     <lb/>
     have not taken into account in assessing 
     <lb/>
     economic value, the value of the dollar. Money 
     <lb/>
     is a standard of value. It is not wealth.... We have 
     <lb/>
     to take into account such things as our $80 million 
     <lb/>
     in savings today, which may not have a great deal 
     <lb/>
     more purchasing power than the $25 million we 
     <lb/>
     had in the Savings Bank in 1934. I must hold the 
     <lb/>
     view that the war economy has affected the situa<lb break="no"/>tion. The effect of the war, in my view, was 
     <lb/>
     whilst it increased our cash savings, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time it placed a limit on the purchasing power of 
     <lb/>
     these cash savings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question of real values was brought to my 
     <lb/>
     attention by a person who is not an economist - <lb/> he is a fisherman. They were arguing about the 
     <lb/>
     cost of providing twine for a fish net. Today, 
     <lb/>
     although you had to pay more for twine, he ar<lb break="no"/>gued, it was cheaper than it was ten years ago, 
     <lb/>
     because whereas it took ten cases of salmon to 
     <lb/>
     get it then, today you get it for the price of one. 
     <lb/>
     The difference in the price in salmon was brought 
     <lb/>
     about from the co-operative market. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been a great deal of talk about 
     <lb/>
     optimism and pessimism. I am optimistic because

     of a certain unit of statistics not in here at all. 
     <lb/>
     There are 10,000 people in the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement in Newfoundland, where in 1934 
     <lb/>
     there were not any. If there were we will probably 
     <lb/>
     hear from them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A lot of our troubles here might have been 
     <lb/>
     saved if we had agreed at the beginning of the 
     <lb/>
     debate to define our terms. I do not hold entirely 
     <lb/>
     with the view that debating a report is a waste of 
     <lb/>
     time. I can sympathise with that view, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly after hearing some of the debates we had 
     <lb/>
     on some of the reports. I feel the big question is 
     <lb/>
     not the report; it is the economic condition of the 
     <lb/>
     country. If the report serves no other purpose than 
     <lb/>
     as a starting point from which to assess the 
     <lb/>
     economic condition, it is our business to evaluate 
     <lb/>
     the economic condition as we see it, and get on 
     <lb/>
     with what we are going to do about it afterwards. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps if we had defined our terms we would 
     <lb/>
     have saved ourselves a great deal of needless 
     <lb/>
     discussion. There is the term "country". There is 
     <lb/>
     the term "self-supporting". It has been said here 
     <lb/>
     that no country is self-supporting; in that case 
     <lb/>
     there is no use discussing it. Suppose we use the 
     <lb/>
     word "solvent".... What do we mean by "the 
     <lb/>
     country?" Do we mean the government of the 
     <lb/>
     country? I would excuse, readily, any man who 
     <lb/>
     had spent considerable time in the government, 
     <lb/>
     if such a one were to consider the country as the 
     <lb/>
     government. I find it less excusable for a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the labour movement referring to the 
     <lb/>
     government as the businessmen of the country. 
     <lb/>
     Democracy must be in the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     majority. We must consider whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     country is economically sound on the basis of 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the economy is sound in the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the majority. We must consider whether 
     <lb/>
     we are completely and 100% self-supporting; we 
     <lb/>
     are not, if you think of all the people who are 
     <lb/>
     more self-supporting than in 1934. And yet I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if that is a fair comparison to make. In 
     <lb/>
     1934 we were going through unusual times. It has 
     <lb/>
     been said that the world was upside down. It was 
     <lb/>
     inside out also. Has the position of the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people changed in relation to the economic 
     <lb/>
     entity that is the state? As one interested in these 
     <lb/>
     matters in point of view of co-operatives, that is 
     <lb/>
     something which causes me very great concern. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....I hold and have held for many years that this 
     <lb/>
     country is capable of producing a frugal living for 
     <lb/>
     the majority of the people. I do not think that such 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     is possible under the economic set-up we have at 
     <lb/>
     the present time. I think we need better economic 
     <lb/>
     arrangements than we have. I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     under such an economy there is room for mil<lb break="no"/>lionaires âI would like to see 325,000 of them 
     <lb/>
     here in Newfoundland. I do not think our 
     <lb/>
     economy can make the majority of people self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting and still allow 66 corporations in a 
     <lb/>
     population of 325,000 people declare net taxable 
     <lb/>
     income of $250,000 each; which makes it one for 
     <lb/>
     every 500,000 population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Also I do not agree with the philosophy which 
     <lb/>
     expresses itself in these terms, "the poor you have 
     <lb/>
     always with you". That was the attitude adopted 
     <lb/>
     by tired and effete governments a little over a 
     <lb/>
     generation ago, that produced in large measure 
     <lb/>
     the chaos that we have in those countries today. 
     <lb/>
     The modern statesman does not accept that view. 
     <lb/>
     It smacks of defeatism. It is certainly not a 
     <lb/>
     philosophy for avowed optimists. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I find it necessary, when considering a subject 
     <lb/>
     like the economy of our country, to be critical. I 
     <lb/>
     know that I will be accused of running down 
     <lb/>
     the country. I will, perhaps, be further accused of 
     <lb/>
     running down the country if I suggest that if you 
     <lb/>
     put a group of Scandinavians in southern 
     <lb/>
     Labrador or northern Newfoundland they would 
     <lb/>
     make a good living for everybody. Why? Be<lb break="no"/>cause they would work harder? No, they 
     <lb/>
     couldn't. Because they have a different sense of 
     <lb/>
     social justice from ourselves; because they have 
     <lb/>
     a co-operative economy based on that sense of 
     <lb/>
     social justice. One thing has not changed since 
     <lb/>
     1934 â there is just too much of every man for 
     <lb/>
     himself; we want to make our own little pile 
     <lb/>
     quick. Perhaps this would be a good time for me 
     <lb/>
     to disassociate myself from the 44 hard-headed 
     <lb/>
     businessmen we are all supposed to be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I find very little in the report relating to the 
     <lb/>
     standard of living of our people. I want to make 
     <lb/>
     one discrimination of terms between standards of 
     <lb/>
     living and scales of living. By "scale of living" I 
     <lb/>
     mean that which we have achieved as compared 
     <lb/>
     to that which we aim at â which is the standard. 
     <lb/>
     Our scale of living has immeasurably improved 
     <lb/>
     since 1934, but if our scale of living has im<lb break="no"/>proved, standards have also gone up since 1934. 
     <lb/>
     We must consider...is there enough left over unto 
     <lb/>
     our people to provide them with the good things 
     <lb/>
     of life? You will notice I have upped the ante 
     <lb/>
     from three square meals a day. My contention is, 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="727"

     it is possible for us to do that, but it is only 
     <lb/>
     possible if we realize our shortcomings and are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to start in realising them and working 
     <lb/>
     for a more socially just economy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....I agree with the two members who said it 
     <lb/>
     was not necessary for the Committee to prepare 
     <lb/>
     a budget; but having prepared it, it is subject to 
     <lb/>
     our scrutiny. I wonder if in making up allowances 
     <lb/>
     for old age pensions the Committee is not basing 
     <lb/>
     the estimate on the standard of old age pensions 
     <lb/>
     given today? I worked it out myself.... I am 
     <lb/>
     puzzled just what we will have to do to qualify 
     <lb/>
     for one of these pensions. In a matter such as that, 
     <lb/>
     I think the Committee's estimate is too low. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to discuss either the merits or 
     <lb/>
     demerits of setting up a merchant marine. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it is incumbent upon the Committee to 
     <lb/>
     make such recommendations at this time. How<lb break="no"/>ever, if you are going to discuss such things, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps it would be well for the Convention and 
     <lb/>
     the Committee to discuss not only the setting up 
     <lb/>
     of a merchant marine, but also the setting up of a 
     <lb/>
     Crown company to run that paper company on 
     <lb/>
     the south coast in which there will be a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of money. All our wealth in one form or another 
     <lb/>
     is being shipped holus-bolus out of the country. 
     <lb/>
     We have no control over it. We benefit very little 
     <lb/>
     from it except in the matter of labour. While I am 
     <lb/>
     on this subject, I might offer this suggestion: how 
     <lb/>
     much stronger would the economy of this country 
     <lb/>
     be if the $8 million we have invested in the banks, 
     <lb/>
     were invested in organisations which could put 
     <lb/>
     that capital to work here in Newfoundland. Be<lb break="no"/>cause capital is the means of production, and as 
     <lb/>
     the report shows we have twice as much money 
     <lb/>
     as we had in 1934, or more. I imagine in the case 
     <lb/>
     of capital goods as well as money, we are also far 
     <lb/>
     ahead of 1934, and our means of production is a 
     <lb/>
     great deal ahead of what it was in 1934. To what 
     <lb/>
     greater extent than in 1934 is this means of 
     <lb/>
     production controlled and used by and for the 
     <lb/>
     people? The means of production, whether it lies 
     <lb/>
     in the Savings Bank, insurance or other forms, are 
     <lb/>
     being shipped out of this country and being used 
     <lb/>
     to produce wealth for other countries.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> Presum<lb break="no"/>ing that the means of production is twice as great 
     <lb/>
     as in 1934, is Newfoundland producing twice as 
     <lb/>
     much wealth? Is the Labrador fishery twice as 
     <lb/>
     great? Are we producing twice as much salmon, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     timber, and so on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland is hitched to the banking sys<lb break="no"/>tem of another country, with the result that real 
     <lb/>
     wealth leaks out of this country. Consequently, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland money is being used to develop 
     <lb/>
     and create wealth in other countries. As things 
     <lb/>
     stand at the moment the Canadian banks could 
     <lb/>
     depreciate Newfoundland's savings by 10% or 
     <lb/>
     15% at a stroke of a pen, and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     could not do a thing about it. One of the primary 
     <lb/>
     functions of a bank is the control of credit, and 
     <lb/>
     the control of Newfoundland's credit is vested 
     <lb/>
     with outside interests. This control could be used 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland's disadvantage. When New<lb break="no"/>foundland went broke in 1934, for example, there 
     <lb/>
     was $25 million in the banks. Yet the government 
     <lb/>
     could not borrow this money. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     could not control the financial system, and thus 
     <lb/>
     was not an independent financial unit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another point in Newfoundland's economic 
     <lb/>
     set-up which bothers me is that this country has 
     <lb/>
     little control over the production of foodstuffs. 
     <lb/>
     The question of Newfoundland's ability to 
     <lb/>
     double her agricultural production has been 
     <lb/>
     raised. But I wonder how far it can be pushed 
     <lb/>
     towards covering essential supplies. I am of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the gap left between this production 
     <lb/>
     and the actual requirements represents the degree 
     <lb/>
     to which Newfoundland must export or perish - <lb/> in other words, the degree to which New<lb break="no"/>foundland is dependent on other countries, and 
     <lb/>
     thus the degree to which Newfoundland is de<lb break="no"/>pendent on the export policies of these other 
     <lb/>
     countries.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to disassociate myself from the report's 
     <lb/>
     remarks on a lack of faith in the country. Actually 
     <lb/>
     I prefer the word "trust" to "faith". The people do 
     <lb/>
     have hope for the country, and if they lack trust, 
     <lb/>
     it is a lack of trust in political leaders. They need 
     <lb/>
     new leaders, or old leaders with new ideas. The 
     <lb/>
     report is definitely wrong in suggesting there is a 
     <lb/>
     lack of hope and trust. A recent storm did $ 10,000 
     <lb/>
     worth of damage in one settlement. But the 
     <lb/>
     people did not sit back and bemoan the fact, they 
     <lb/>
     began to rebuild. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The report ends with the words of President 
     <lb/>
     Roosevelt: "We have nothing to fear but fear 
     <lb/>
     itself". The people of Newfoundland are not 
     <lb/>
     afraid. If they are, perhaps, afraid of politics, it is 
     <lb/>
           
<note xml:id="fn_02">1 The following section of Mr. Newell's speech was reconstructed from <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Evening Telegram</hi>, 15 November <lb/>[1]947, p. 26.</note>

      because they have never controlled politics. 
     <lb/>
     Going on to another statement by Roosevelt 
     <lb/>
     about four freedoms, you cannot have political 
     <lb/>
     freedom without economic freedom. And given 
     <lb/>
     the latter, people would be less hesitant about 
     <lb/>
     taking over their political responsibility. 
     <lb/>
     Roosevelt's freedoms are passive freedoms: 
     <lb/>
     freedom from want, freedom from fear, etc. I 
     <lb/>
     prefer an active freedom. Freedom <hi rendition="simple:italic">to</hi> â freedom 
     <lb/>
     to live in comfort and basic security; freedom to 
     <lb/>
     buy food and education for children; freedom to 
     <lb/>
     develop natural abilities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel the Convention's discussions have not 
     <lb/>
     gone deeply enough into the roots of things. 
     <lb/>
     There are inequalities which stand in the way of 
     <lb/>
     economic and political freedoms, and in the way 
     <lb/>
     of social justice. I wonder if it is not time we 
     <lb/>
     examined our methods and attitudes. The attitude 
     <lb/>
     taken in economic matters will go far in deter<lb break="no"/>mining the action taken in political matters. Old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions and fishermens' insurance are not 
     <lb/>
     enough. They are only salve where surgery is 
     <lb/>
     needed. The Convention's search for political 
     <lb/>
     constitutions will be ineffectual if it is not allied 
     <lb/>
     to a desire for social justice, and an economic 
     <lb/>
     set-up more in keeping with the principles of 
     <lb/>
     Christian democracy.<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I maintain that how we think about these mat<lb break="no"/>ters will determine our choice of a constitution. 
     <lb/>
     We must take chances on the future, but our job 
     <lb/>
     is to reduce those chances as much as we can. 
     <lb/>
     Neither optimism or pessimism will get us 
     <lb/>
     anywhere. We must know where we stand. It is a 
     <lb/>
     grand thing to walk with your chin up, but we 
     <lb/>
     must have our feet on the ground. If I have a 
     <lb/>
     criticism, it is that I have wondered if our feet 
     <lb/>
     were planted on the ground. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have tried today to get outside of the political 
     <lb/>
     issue. I have considered it, if not as an anarchist, 
     <lb/>
     than as one who is not interested in any particular 
     <lb/>
     form of government. One point and I will close. 
     <lb/>
     In the early days we heard a lot about an open 
     <lb/>
     mind, and I doubted then that there was any such 
     <lb/>
     thing. But I say now that I do have an open mind. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I must apologise to the people for the <lb/>barrage
                                          of words from the National Convention, <lb/>but I must
                                          give an explanation as to why I feel <lb/>this country is
                                          in a sound economical position. <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Full justice cannot be given to our position 
     <lb/>
     without considering the epoch we live in. Much 
     <lb/>
     can be done for a country to solve its internal 
     <lb/>
     problems, but this has a limit. For example, the 
     <lb/>
     first blow to our economy was a revolution in 
     <lb/>
     Brazil, then sanctions against Italy. Both of these 
     <lb/>
     contributed to our economic state. If one studies 
     <lb/>
     history then one will see that whenever there is a 
     <lb/>
     war there is a surge forward in human endeavour. 
     <lb/>
     War and revolution bring men to their best, and 
     <lb/>
     make them see clearly. If we had had a war near 
     <lb/>
     our shores maybe we would see clearer. Today's 
     <lb/>
     events are the greatest leap forward the world has 
     <lb/>
     ever seen, and the future is bright. Notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing what our pessimists say, that wave of progress 
     <lb/>
     will reach us here in Newfoundland. The 
     <lb/>
     Americans are spending billions of dollars on the 
     <lb/>
     Marshall Plan, and we should keep this in mind. 
     <lb/>
     You should examine the conduct of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, and ask why they care about people 
     <lb/>
     thousands of miles away. In the 1920s the US 
     <lb/>
     withdrew into itself and left Europe in a slum of 
     <lb/>
     poverty and discontent, in which fascism grew. 
     <lb/>
     But that is not happening now because great 
     <lb/>
     minds are working against that, because we are 
     <lb/>
     all in the front lines now. The world has learned 
     <lb/>
     that it has to help itself. And the benefit of that 
     <lb/>
     will come to Newfoundland. There cannot be 
     <lb/>
     another world depression, and that's the reason 
     <lb/>
     that I know government revenue will stay up.<ref target="#fn_04">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Ask ourselves the question and think deeply 
     <lb/>
     about it: is the great USA, having shouldered the 
     <lb/>
     expenses of the Marshall Plan, and aid to Greece, 
     <lb/>
     Turkey, UNNRA, and the other billions the world 
     <lb/>
     will want, going to sit idly by and allow the 
     <lb/>
     eastern tide of communism to swamp all the 
     <lb/>
     sacrifices that the US government and people will 
     <lb/>
     make? All of you can and do remember that not 
     <lb/>
     alone Newfoundland, but the world was poorest 
     <lb/>
     when all the necessities of life were most plenti<lb break="no"/>ful. Can anybody believe that the veterans of this 
     <lb/>
     war, not only in the US, but all over the world, 
     <lb/>
     will sell apples on the street corners? If you do, 
     <lb/>
     then you have another guess coming. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The bomb that fell on Bikini cleared many 
     <lb/>
     more cobwebs than that, and whether we have

     must and will be a free exchange of goods 
     <lb/>
     throughout this earth.... I believe we are on the 
     <lb/>
     threshold of a new world, and we, as a free 
     <lb/>
     people, should gear our productive capacity, and 
     <lb/>
     hand in hand with our comrades throughout the 
     <lb/>
     world look forward to that day when the fear of 
     <lb/>
     not having the three meals a day, the tight roof 
     <lb/>
     and the clothes to cover, will be a thing of the 
     <lb/>
     past. The day won't come again when my genial 
     <lb/>
     friend, the member from Green Bay, will have to 
     <lb/>
     go through Naples or Leghorn or even Oporto, 
     <lb/>
     with a yaffle of fish, rolling a roll of paper before 
     <lb/>
     him, trying to sell them, and neither will anyone 
     <lb/>
     be able to make a couple of thousand dollars 
     <lb/>
     before breakfast. It seems that this is what our 
     <lb/>
     pessimists are afraid of. I am fully persuaded that 
     <lb/>
     these days are past. Those who control the wealth 
     <lb/>
     of this world cannot afford to let them come 
     <lb/>
     again, because if they do then all hell will break 
     <lb/>
     loose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know a little of the feelings of the underdog. 
     <lb/>
     I have given this extensive study, talked with men 
     <lb/>
     high in labour movements as well as the rank and 
     <lb/>
     file, both on this side of the Atlantic and on the 
     <lb/>
     other side. Labour is getting more world-minded. 
     <lb/>You'll see, if a country has a strike, then other 
     <lb/>countries won't scab. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     These are the reasons why I strongly believe 
     <lb/>
     in this report and would emphasise the fact that 
     <lb/>
     we should get ready to take our place in the 
     <lb/>

                                          comparisons, this Amulree Report, it presents a <lb/>
                                          story of conditions and reasons therefore. Sub<lb
                                                 break="no"/>mitted in the report are plain
                                          admissions that we <lb/> are not self-supporting and it
                                          makes recommen<lb break="no"/>dations for its correction.
                                          Our Economic Report <lb/> takes into consideration the
                                          results of these <lb/> recommendations, or as we know it
                                          better, the <lb/> reconstruction programme of Commission
                                          of <lb/> Government up to and including the war period,
                                          <lb/> and assessing this latter period as well. It deals
                                          <lb/> with our main industries, our revenue, and refers
                                          <lb/> to the fact that our national debt, $101 million in
                                          <lb/> 1933, is down to $35 million in 1947. It gives our
                                          <lb/> deposits in the bank, $26 million in 1933, at an
                                          <lb/> all time high of $80 million today. It is helpful
                                          <lb/> then, and interesting to make these comparisons.
                                          <lb/> 1933 â might I be permitted to put the terms of

            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Well, turning to this Amulree Report <lb/>we find
                                          such passages as this: "The broad facts <lb/>of the
                                          financial position in Newfoundland are <lb/>unfortunately
                                          all too plain. Ever since the war <lb/>period the country
                                          has been living beyond its <lb/>means. The Island is now
                                          in extreme financial <lb/>difficulty." That is about our
                                          finances and our <lb/>economics at that period. Now our
                                          Economic <lb/>Report presents a budget, and a loud clamour
                                          is <lb/>raised that its proposed expenditures are too
                                          high. <lb/>We want more for this and more for that. We
                                          want <lb/>to repeat the mistakes of the 1920s â spend our
                                          <lb/>surplus and have nothing for the rainy day. And
                                          <lb/>yet in the same breath they claim that three years
                                          <lb/>is not enough to look ahead â it must be 20, 50
                                          <lb/>years, what fantastic reasoning.... <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     Again, 1933 â "The situation today is that, as 
     <lb/>
     a result of the extravagance of the post-war 
     <lb/>
     period, a debt has been incurred which is out of 
     <lb/>
     all proportion to the country's capacity, and we 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
     cannot avoid the conclusion that, given this scale 
     <lb/>
     of indebtedness, there is no prospect of the Island 
     <lb/>
     being able to pay its way even under normal trade 
     <lb/>
     conditions...."<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> In the preceding paragraph they 
     <lb/>
     give the national debt as $101 million, or a per 
     <lb/>
     capita debt of $400. These are the facts, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, and in the calmer moments of our 
     <lb/>
     deliberations let us neither neglect nor fear to 
     <lb/>
     analyse them.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And so submitting these passages from the 
     <lb/>
     Amulree Report, I expect to find comparative 
     <lb/>
     answers in our Economic Report on present day 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. On page 41 of the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, "all throughout our object has been to 
     <lb/>
     try and give that good a picture as we possibly 
     <lb/>
     can of the state of our country. Any figures used 
     <lb/>
     by us, in most cases, have already been submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the Convention in the various committees' 
     <lb/>
     reports and have received the approval of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates. And in some cases, where we do ex<lb break="no"/>pect opinions, we have taken care to have their 
     <lb/>
     correctness endorsed by those competent to do 
     <lb/>
     so." With these remarks for a background they 
     <lb/>
     continue on page 43, "Our present revenues 
     <lb/>
     therefore, are substantially solid in their structure 
     <lb/>
     and seem capable of carrying on without any 
     <lb/>
     serious decline. However, in estimating future 
     <lb/>
     revenue, we prefer to err on the conservative 
     <lb/>
     side." From there it goes on to say that whereas 
     <lb/>
     present revenues have dropped at the $40 million 
     <lb/>
     mark, in their budget, they make allowances for 
     <lb/>
     a drop back to a normal figure, back to $30 
     <lb/>
     million. Dealing with the country's capacity to 
     <lb/>
     maintain this greatly reduced figure, a step-by- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     step presentation of the position of our country's 
     <lb/>
     industries is submitted. And may I be again per<lb break="no"/>mitted to examine briefly and compare just a few 
     <lb/>
     with the findings of previous investigators? Min<lb break="no"/>ing â very conservatively the Amulree Report 
     <lb/>
     said, "In general it may be said that the pos<lb break="no"/>sibilities of mineral development in New<lb break="no"/>foundland have been by no means exhausted." 
     <lb/>
     What does Chadwick and Jones say? Very dis<lb break="no"/>creetly they sum up, "it is not however possible, 
     <lb/>
     at this stage, to indicate what effects these 
     <lb/>
     developments may ultimately have on the econ<lb break="no"/>omy of the Island". What does our Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report say, page 17. Summing up on the sale of 
     <lb/>
     iron ore it says, "Thus we feel that under

                                          I read that <lb/> for you because as I see it, financial

                                          policy, as <lb/> we are asked to consider policy.
                                          Therefore if we <lb/> cannot deal with possible changes in

                                          years. And if I <lb/> must, I give credit for it to the

                                          We have <lb/> started an era of commercial farming. True,
                                          we <lb/> are late, as some speaker remarked a few days

                                          mechanisation confronts us. Despite all this we <lb/> are
                                          progressing. We are equal to the task, and <lb/> nothing
                                          can more effectively cushion a national <lb/> setback in
                                          any country than the products of the <lb/> land. It's as
                                          symbolic as the action of a man who <lb/> throws himself
                                          on the ground when an explosion <lb/> passes over him. But
                                          these prosperous years have <lb/> not tended to continuity
                                          of purpose. Money came <lb/> easy of late. Further, the
                                          high values for cattle <lb/> encouraged people to sell
                                          perhaps a little too <lb/> much. Add to this the meager
                                          supply of cattle <lb/> feeds, and there a new phase of
                                          farm life must be <lb/> tackled, the cultivation of seeds.
                                          This may take <lb/> half a century to climatise growth,
                                          but it can be <lb/> done and will be done. The greater

            <p>
     Fisheries. The most unnerving feature of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland life is, or was, our dependence on 
     <lb/>
     the fishery. In the past it was the incontestable 
     <lb/>
     argument explaining our slow advancement and 
     <lb/>
     low standards. In prosecuting this industry we 
     <lb/>
     were not alone in the world. We were unques<lb break="no"/>tionably left with a bounty of supply, but we were 
     <lb/>
     carefree, we were lax. Our government, our mer<lb break="no"/>chants and our fisherman were all to blame for 
     <lb/>
     the gradual loss to competitors of our markets. 
     <lb/>
     And so the tide flowed against us, and this had 
     <lb/>
     reached crippling proportions by 1933. Let us not 
     <lb/>
     lose sight of the fact that whilst we were sliding 
     <lb/>
     downhill our competitors, Norway and Iceland, 
     <lb/>
     were consolidating their positions in the fish 
     <lb/>
     markets of the world. Iceland's dependence on 
     <lb/>
     fishery was even greater than ours. I'll have to 
     <lb/>
     give you some figures on just what Iceland did in 
     <lb/>
     comparison to Newfoundland's progress. I am 
     <lb/>
     forced to give them, because we had an argument 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland was producing more than the 
     <lb/>
     demand was capable of absorbing. In 1885 
     <lb/>
     Iceland exported less than 100,000 quintals of 
     <lb/>
     wet and dry salted codfish, Newfoundland 1.3 
     <lb/>
     million. In 1932 Iceland exported 1.5 million 
     <lb/>
     quintals and was then ahead of Newfoundland by 
     <lb/>
     450,000 quintals of fish. I presume that they sold 
     <lb/>
     all that fish, that there was no overproduction. 
     <lb/>
     They produced it and they sold it, and we lost the 
     <lb/>
     market. And if you read the papers today we will 
     <lb/>
     find that we are losing markets in herring too. 
     <lb/>
     These are figures. Production must always keep 
     <lb/>
     a keen eye to the requirements of demand. In this 
     <lb/>
     we were neglectful. However, that age is past. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps slowly but surely, Newfoundland's fish 
     <lb/>
     is finding an honoured place on the food counters 
     <lb/>
     of continents far and near. This has been brought 
     <lb/>
     about by the combined effort of government and 
     <lb/>
     capital and has been furthered, in no little 
     <lb/>
     measure by the vigilance of the fishermen them<lb break="no"/>selves. Perhaps the most reassuring event of late 
     <lb/>
     was the recent increase in the price of fresh fish 
     <lb/>
     at some of our larger filleting plants. Yes, the 
     <lb/>
     weaknesses of our old position have been recog<lb break="no"/>nised and are being corrected â corrected by 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders themselves. Read the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report on this, page 26. It says, 
     <lb/>
     "...during the year 1930-31, when a financial 
     <lb/>
     crisis engulfed the world suddenly, prices for our 
     <lb/>
     saltfish product during the early thirties and prac<lb break="no"/>tically up to the beginning of World War II, had 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     reached the lowest figure in history." I consider 
     <lb/>
     this part of the report incomplete, for it offers no 
     <lb/>
     explanation why the price was down, other than 
     <lb/>
     in a general sense. That reason can be clearly and 
     <lb/>
     unmistakenly defined and here it is. We were 
     <lb/>
     selling our fish in sterling and converting to 
     <lb/>
     Canadian dollars â a condition much as exists 
     <lb/>
     today existed on the money markets. The value 
     <lb/>
     of the pound was down in its relation to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian dollar. And the value of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     dollar was down in its relation to the American 
     <lb/>
     dollar. This caused the fishermen to suffer a loss 
     <lb/>
     of 20% on the value of fish. In other words, by 
     <lb/>
     way of example, $10 of fish was sold for $8. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, this $8 was in some cases spent in 
     <lb/>
     buying American clothing, footwear, etc. There 
     <lb/>
     we had to pay a tithe of $ 1.22 Canadian funds for 
     <lb/>
     American funds. Converted into American dol<lb break="no"/>lars then, the price of $10 fish is reduced to 
     <lb/>
     slightly more than $6.50. If we had had our 
     <lb/>
     currency tied to the pound sterling the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     could have received the full $10 value for thier 
     <lb/>
     fish.... This condition is due entirely to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we use Canadian currency in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     â or until such time as Canada buys all our 
     <lb/>
     codfish and pays for them in dollars. What are the 
     <lb/>
     possibilities of this happening? I am extremely 
     <lb/>
     fair when I say I see no possibility of it happen<lb break="no"/>ing. Something that reduces the price of fish from 
     <lb/>
     $10 down $6.56 is a great big enemy of ours and 
     <lb/>
     should be removed. I do not propose to go any 
     <lb/>
     further here on this subject. To continue with the 
     <lb/>
     sections of their report on fisheries. It was during 
     <lb/>
     this period that modern methods in handling, 
     <lb/>
     curing and marketing of both fresh, frozen and 
     <lb/>
     salt codfish were begun by the establishment in 
     <lb/>
     various sections of the country of bait depots and 
     <lb/>
     cold storage plants, financed in many cases by 
     <lb/>
     our own government. I'm urged here to give the 
     <lb/>
     figures for the amount of bait that was used 
     <lb/>
     1933-1947: 1933, 1.8 million pounds; 1945, 6 
     <lb/>
     million pounds. As a result our people became 
     <lb/>
     confident of thier capability to secure paying 
     <lb/>
     voyages in fresh, frozen or salted fish. It is not 
     <lb/>
     unreasonable then to draw this conclusion (page 
     <lb/>
     31): "And it is not unreasonable to say that the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of methods that have brought prosperity 
     <lb/>
     to such a country as Iceland cannot fail but bring

     with the compilation of the Economic Report and 
     <lb/>
     having giving it due perusal, it wins my un<lb break="no"/>qualified praise. It was indeed a colossal under<lb break="no"/>taking.... All over it shows reference to previous 
     <lb/>
     reports that were approved in this House as 
     <lb/>
     authority for its statements. In essence then, it is 
     <lb/>
     a summing up of our work which was approved 
     <lb/>
     and thus in its collective stage must win our 
     <lb/>
     accord if we are to be consistent. Criticism of 
     <lb/>
     course can be worthwhile, but to be worthwhile 
     <lb/>
     it must be sound, practical and fair. It can be 
     <lb/>
     perverted, fanatical even, when dealing with a 
     <lb/>
     question so important, so all important as this 
     <lb/>
     present one. In some instances our standard of 
     <lb/>
     criticism has not been hard. And one tends to 
     <lb/>
     disregard these, for we are here for constructive 
     <lb/>
     purposes, not destructive. In the argument set 
     <lb/>
     forth there are some points which we seem to 
     <lb/>
     accept in our financial and economic set-up as 
     <lb/>
     being unavoidable and insurmountable. I feel it 
     <lb/>
     is unfortunate that these points should go unques<lb break="no"/>tioned.... For instance, it is said in a manner 
     <lb/>
     foreboding ill, ours is an export economy, New<lb break="no"/>foundland must export to live. I say, what is 
     <lb/>
     wrong about that? Let me repeat briefly these 
     <lb/>
     established facts about our natural resources and 
     <lb/>
     production. It has been proven to the satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     of the most critical, and it is thus no longer 
     <lb/>
     questioned, that our fish, ore, and paper industries 
     <lb/>
     are of the greatest potential value, are very sub<lb break="no"/>stantial in quantity and are being soundly and 
     <lb/>
     progressively administered. Demand in the 
     <lb/>
     foreseeable future is excellent for these products. 
     <lb/>
     Our equipment, wherewith we produce, has been 
     <lb/>
     greatly improved and enlarged during the war 
     <lb/>
     period and is now at a high point of efficiency. 
     <lb/>
     From this we could almost deduce certain issues. 
     <lb/>
     We could say that our production will be up and 
     <lb/>
     that our sales will be up. Consequently we shall 
     <lb/>
     go on living, go on exporting, but dark and 
     <lb/>
     sinister forebodings cannot easily be dispersed 
     <lb/>
     from the minds of those who would cherish them. 
     <lb/>
     And so a new insurmountable obstacle is intro<lb break="no"/>duced and in the calm air of "I told you so", they 
     <lb/>
     sit back to await the realisation of their horrors. I 
     <lb/>
     must pause here, Mr. Chairman, to say that a 
     <lb/>
     nation or a country so disposed, so devoid of all 
     <lb/>
     initiative and aggressiveness can only sink, sink 
     <lb/>
     to the low level of a kept people. Great God, what 
     <lb/>
     an answer. I feel, Mr. Chairman, that it is another 
     <lb/>
     type of people whose interest we serve here 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
           
     today, that they are not lowlife vermin-infested 
     <lb/>
     individuals some would lead us to believe, but 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders in the true sense of the word. 
     <lb/>
     If I thought otherwise I would not be here. But to 
     <lb/>
     go on. This new obstacle in our path to prosperity 
     <lb/>
     and self-support, in high sounding phraseology, 
     <lb/>
     is termed the vulnerability of our economy due to 
     <lb/>
     currency fluctuations. Yes, we are subject to just 
     <lb/>
     that. I admit it. But I cannot accept it as being 
     <lb/>
     insurmountable. True, we have in the past never 
     <lb/>
     tried to correct this situation. We have never 
     <lb/>
     fought back, we have never tried to forewarn 
     <lb/>
     ourselves and thereby forearm ourselves against  
     <lb/>
     these fluctuating currencies  â mainly, I say, 
     <lb/>
     because we were in no position to do so. I grant 
     <lb/>
     exception to this in one instance only, and I refer 
     <lb/>
     now to the effort of the present government in 
     <lb/>
     correcting to our advantage the situation which 
     <lb/>
     arose this year when Great Britain decided to 
     <lb/>
     suspend sterling conversion. Just so many years 
     <lb/>
     ago this would have been impossible and beyond 
     <lb/>
     our ability to correct. Today it appears in the light 
     <lb/>
     of ordinary business, nothing at all exceptional 
     <lb/>
     about it, just plain ordinary business â so ordi<lb break="no"/>nary, that similar methods could be adopted, and 
     <lb/>
     I believe to some extent were, by the business 
     <lb/>
     houses, they having the added advantage of being 
     <lb/>
     able to purchase English goods with sterling 
     <lb/>
     funds. I mention this but briefly in passing, be<lb break="no"/>cause I feel that by next year Britain will have 
     <lb/>
     regained her position in the export trade. Latest 
     <lb/>
     reports show her production to be increasing 
     <lb/>
     favourably. Added to this, there is a greater 
     <lb/>
     awareness in Canada and other countries of the 
     <lb/>
     necessity, for their own preservation, to increase 
     <lb/>
     their purchases from her, and that well describes 
     <lb/>
     our position too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One point relative to this subject warrants 
     <lb/>
     further comment and better understanding, and 
     <lb/>
     that is that when the government agreed to con<lb break="no"/>vert the sterling, no guarantee of the value the 
     <lb/>
     pound was made. At that time conversion was 
     <lb/>
     being negotiated on the basis of $4.03 for each 
     <lb/>
     pound sterling. It now appears that dollars will be 
     <lb/>
     made available only after sterling credits have 
     <lb/>
     been set up. This means that should the pound be 
     <lb/>
     further depreciated and is pegged at this artificial 
     <lb/>
     price, and subject to the whims of world finan<lb break="no"/>ciers, then the fisherman or the exporter would 
     <lb/>
     get proportionately less for his fish. It would 
     <lb/>
     appear that conversion of the estimated dollar 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="734"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-14_Page_0734.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">734</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          
    requirements should have been guaranteed at 
     <lb/>
     $4.03. There's where the government broke faith 
     <lb/>
     with our people, for this and only this could have 
     <lb/>
     stabilised the price of codfish for 1947. And that, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, is what I mean when I say we do 
     <lb/>
     not fight back. Further, no loss to our treasury 
     <lb/>
     need be incurred as it is unquestionable that the 
     <lb/>
     pound will recover given time, and we having no 
     <lb/>
     immediate need for our surplus, could await that 
     <lb/>
     time. Just such a transaction suggests the 
     <lb/>
     feasibility of holding some of our surplus in 
     <lb/>
     pounds sterling â an amount say equivalent to 
     <lb/>
     the interest-free loan, though not with the Crown 
     <lb/>
     Agents but in a special trading fund. It em<lb break="no"/>phasises the selection of business where and 
     <lb/>
     when it best serves our country. In other words 
     <lb/>
     our purchases should get channelled in the direc<lb break="no"/>tion where they are best calculated to stabilise our 
     <lb/>
     economy. Can we do this? Most certainly we 
     <lb/>
     can.... I am urged to suggest what machinery of 
     <lb/>
     government would be necessary to affect this. As 
     <lb/>
     I see it an actively functioning department of 
     <lb/>
     supply and a foreign exchange advisory board 
     <lb/>
     would be sufficient. We are years behind in at<lb break="no"/>tending to these matters. If we are to protect the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen's catch of 1948 as well as our other 
     <lb/>
     exports to sterling purchasers, it is essential that 
     <lb/>
     we act along these lines immediately. No one 
     <lb/>
     need get hurt. In fact, it would be good for all. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>But presently, a line of low grade com<lb break="no"/>modities is saturating our
                                          shelves. Where it isn't <lb/>low grade it is high grade,
                                          too high for the <lb/>economy of our people. Our people
                                          have been on <lb/>a spending spree. Some confuse that with
                                          a stand<lb break="no"/>ard of living. The profits have
                                          been eagerly <lb/>garnered, and I have good reason to
                                          believe are <lb/>being smuggled out of this country to go
                                          on <lb/>deposit in United States and Canadian banks.
                                          <lb/>How then, unless this is stopped, can we have our
                                          <lb/>local investments made and our local industrial
                                          <lb/>life developed? This is not an anticonfederate
                                          <lb/>argument. The question of government is far <lb/>from
                                          my mind. It is my suggestion, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"
                                          />man, of possible methods of dealing with a situa<lb
                                                 break="no"/>tion which makes our economy
                                          vulnerable. I say <lb/>this, because our trade with Canada
                                          has been, is, <lb/>and will continue to be the greatest of
                                          all deter<lb break="no"/>rents to Newfoundland's progress.
                                          It has been so <lb/>under past and present governments, it
                                          can be <lb/>only increased if by chance we subjugate

            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Yes, sir. Suppose we take a look at <lb/> what Canada
                                          is doing under very similar cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances.
                                          Canada, too, is an exporting country. <lb/> In fact she is
                                          referred to as great exporting <lb/> country. Turning our
                                          eyes to Great Britain, she <lb/> too found it difficult to
                                          market her produce due <lb/> to the limited dollar credit
                                          available to the old <lb/> country. And if the people of
                                          Britain had decided <lb/> to tighten their belts another
                                          hitch, which inciden<lb break="no"/>tally they do
                                          willingly in their country's interest, <lb/> then we'd be
                                          buying Canadian bacon in New<lb break="no"/>foundland at a
                                          very low figure. However, Britain <lb/> continued its
                                          collective purchasing and relied on <lb/> currency control
                                          to reinstate her position, and <lb/> Canada realising this
                                          decided there and then to <lb/> reduce, curtail to the
                                          very skeleton of its agree<lb break="no"/>ment its trade
                                          with the United States of America, <lb/> and increase its
                                          trade with Britain. This was done <lb/> of necessity to
                                          protect Canadian exports to Great <lb/> Britain which
                                          amounted in the first half of the <lb/> present year to
                                          $352 million. What the loss of this <lb/> market would
                                          have meant to the Canadian farmer <lb/> can be best
                                          appreciated by the Newfoundland <lb/> fisherman when he
                                          remembers the uneasy time <lb/> he has just passed
                                          through. True, Canada con<lb break="no"/>tinued unchecked
                                          its purchase of essentials such <lb/>
                                          <cb/> as coal, oil and cotton, using US dollars from its
                                          <lb/> tourist traffic â US dollars that Britain has been
                                          <lb/> spending in Canada, and resorting as well to the
                                          <lb/> sale of its gold to the US Federal Reserve Bank.
                                          <lb/> All this it is feared is not enough to offset the
                                          <lb/> unfavourable balance of trade, and rumour now <lb/>
                                          has it that Canada will seek a loan of $500 million <lb/>
                                          American. Yet Canada is considered a selfâsup<lb
                                                 break="no"/>porting country. All this gives little
                                          credence to <lb/> Canada's economic nationhood. And I'm
                                          glad, <lb/> Mr. Chairman, that we too assist Canada in no
                                          <lb/> little way through the US dollars received for our
                                          <lb/> exports to that country, and by the receipts in
                                          <lb/> Canadian banks in Newfoundland of US dollars. <lb/>
                                          On that sir, I am going to again refer to my old <lb/>
                                          friend, Chadwick and Jones, section 39. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland's balance of payments posi<lb break="no"/>tion cannot be determined with the available 
     <lb/>
     statistical material. The net balance of trade was 
     <lb/>
     positive throughout the thirties but the gains from 
     <lb/>
     the visible trade were more than offset by in<lb break="no"/>visible imports. During the war the balance of 
     <lb/>
     trade became negative and the negative balance 
     <lb/>
     on invisibles increased because of higher costs 
     <lb/>
     and mounting net insurance remittances. Ex<lb break="no"/>change losses are, however, borne by Canada 
     <lb/>
     since the Canadian dollar is legal tender in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and all banking transactions are car<lb break="no"/>ried on by Canadian banks. Any losses on 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland trading account were probably 
     <lb/>
     more than balanced by the earnings from the 
     <lb/>
     purchase of Canadian dollars by United States 
     <lb/>
     forces which for the four years ending 1945 
     <lb/>
     amounted to $77 million US. This money should 
     <lb/>
     directly be held in Newfoundland as New<lb break="no"/>foundland credits for our essential purchases in 
     <lb/>
     American markets. We have to buy US dollars at 
     <lb/>
     a premium and thereby further impoverish our 
     <lb/>
     economy. So as we consider the stability of our 
     <lb/>
     own economy, we would be well advised to view 
     <lb/>
     the clouds on the economic horizons of other 
     <lb/>
     countries 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What does all this add up to? Presently, a 
     <lb/>
     mess. Is the world full of insurmountable 
     <lb/>
     obstacles? Not at all, but to go forward we must 
     <lb/>
     act with initiative and aggressiveness.... We must 
     <lb/>
     shake off some misconceptions of our fore<lb break="no"/>fathers. We are doing it, let us pick up speed. It 
     <lb/>
     has been said that the outline of Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     economy lies in the shadow of the economy of 
     <lb/>
     other countries. I say it has been held there, and 
          
            <pb n="736"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-14_Page_0736.jpg"/>

     I further say that like a plant held in the dark once 
     <lb/>
     submitted to sunshine, it will grow, develop and 
     <lb/>
     be firm. Can we do this? Again the answer is yes, 
     <lb/>
     but first we must have representation, New<lb break="no"/>foundland representation. Now don't jump up, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, I am not talking about political 
     <lb/>
     representation. Newfoundland representation in 
     <lb/>
     the world programme. Turning again to the pic<lb break="no"/>ture of world trade relationships, whilst we are 
     <lb/>
     not a contributor to the political influences which 
     <lb/>
     determine the shape of things to come and the 
     <lb/>
     stabilisation of western Europe, there is every 
     <lb/>
     reason to believe that we will have a strong, 
     <lb/>
     favourable reaction in our fish markets. How 
     <lb/>
     will all this be removed from the scheme of things 
     <lb/>
     which in years gone by prevented us from selling 
     <lb/>
     our produce because trade sanctions were being 
     <lb/>
     enforced against our customers? The effect of 
     <lb/>
     these sanctions is shown in the Chadwick-Jones 
     <lb/>
     Report, Mr. Chairman, on page 23, and I quote, 
     <lb/>
     "Sanctions against Italy and civil war in Spain 
     <lb/>
     threatened to eliminate two of the most important 
     <lb/>
     European markets, and the value of exports of 
     <lb/>
     dried cod to European countries fell from 
     <lb/>
     $3,400,000 in the financial year 1934-35 to under 
     <lb/>
     $1,520,000 in 1937-38." Sanctions, New<lb break="no"/>foundland backing up sanctions, poor crippled

     <lb/>
     British Empire.<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The programme for Europe envisions the 
     <lb/>
     removal of all trade barriers. I do not wish, sir, to 
     <lb/>
     labour this point, the programme for Europe en<lb break="no"/>visions the removal of all trade barriers â and 
     <lb/>
     while I have not wished to labour this point, I 
     <lb/>
     hoped to express the importance to our economy 
     <lb/>
     of our external relationship, as well as an ap<lb break="no"/>preciation of the now apparent fact that an effort 
     <lb/>
     is about to be made to assist the countries of 
     <lb/>
     western Europe. A substantial proof that they will 
     <lb/>
     stand together in peace as in war is now evident, 
     <lb/>
     equally evident is their need to do so against the 
     <lb/>
     progressive assaults of communism; for once the 
     <lb/>
     world is divided into two camps of such dis<lb break="no"/>similar thinking, military and naval tension will 
     <lb/>
     not ease. And so we with our bases remain target 
     <lb/>
     no. 1 on the Atlantic seaboard. This is not a 
     <lb/>
     position to be coveted, but it is a part of our future 
     <lb/>
     whether we like it or not.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Perhaps as we speak here we do so as the last 
     <lb/>
     body of Newfoundlanders elected for a national 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     
     purpose. Let it not be said of us that we did not 
     <lb/>
     protest the injustices committed against our 
     <lb/>
     country by the impairment of our economy. 
     <lb/>
     Sometimes I think we accepted too quietly the 
     <lb/>
     restrictions enforced on us by Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government in preventing us from talking trade 
     <lb/>
     relationships and similar matters with the USA. 
     <lb/>
     In any other country such muzzling could have 
     <lb/>
     but one reaction, for how closely trade is inter<lb break="no"/>locked with economy has been amply shown in 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report. How different this report 
     <lb/>
     could have been if the Committee had been per<lb break="no"/>mitted to interview the American government on 
     <lb/>
     the aforementioned subjects. Evident now is their 
     <lb/>
     great handicap in forecasting the foreseeable fu<lb break="no"/>ture in a comprehensive manner by not knowing 
     <lb/>
     the condition and disposition of those with whom 
     <lb/>
     we do business.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And so the final report of the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention has been submitted, and I approach the 
     <lb/>
     climax of my responsibility when I say I 
     <lb/>
     corroborate it. From now on the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     slowly shifts to the people, and we will be left to 
     <lb/>
     justify our recommendations in our own hearts. 
     <lb/>
     That our conclusions will be based on actions 
     <lb/>
     governed by neither fear, favour nor prejudice 
     <lb/>
     will be our consolation, whatever the eventual 
     <lb/>
     result. That the road ahead will have its ups and 
     <lb/>
     downs, in this country as in other countries, one 
     <lb/>
     cannot dispute. Such are the realities of this earth 
     <lb/>
     and one would be a fool to disregard them. One 
     <lb/>
     would be a greater fool not to use all means to 
     <lb/>
     guard against them. Our economy is sound. Our 
     <lb/>
     future can be but the result of the actions of our 
     <lb/>
     people. That their actions will be governed by 
     <lb/>
     neither fear, favour nor prejudice, I am happy to 
     <lb/>
     think.

     to the motion, the possibilities
                                          are we will find <lb/> ourselves within the next two weeks
                                          without any <lb/> reporters at all.... Therefore I would

                                          <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I move an amendment that the

     I would like to add to the Chairman's remarks 
     <lb/>
     that, in consultation with our very efficient 
     <lb/>
     reporters, they very clearly stated it was not pos<lb break="no"/>sible to report on every night. This is a com<lb break="no"/>promise to meet the situation, and I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     very desirable.... I think that broadcasting can be

     done, even if it is a little delayed.

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There seems to be some

                                          members of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion are not trying
                                          to push the work of the <lb/> Convention as fast as people
                                          think it ought to be <lb/> done. That is not so. It was
                                          not possible before <lb/> now to have evening sessions....
                                          I do not want the <lb/> position of the Convention to be
                                          misconstrued. <lb/> We have gone into the matter and after

                                          per week.... <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> On the question of
                                          meeting at <lb/> night time. I would like to say this.
                                          There may be <lb/> in this Convention delegates who enjoy
                                          more <lb/> than I do, being in here. I have yet to meet
                                          them. <lb/> I enjoy being here as much as anyone. I love
                                          <lb/> every moment of it, I hate to think of its closing.
                                          <lb/> That is frank and it is sincere. Because, in my
                                          <lb/> view, the people of Newfoundland are getting an
                                          <lb/> education in the affairs of the country that they
                                          <lb/> have never gotten in the history of the country
                                          <lb/> since 1497. I love the thought of the people <lb/>
                                          finding out for the first time something of what is <lb/>
                                          going on in their country. As far as I am con<lb
                                                 break="no"/>cerned, I would like Mr. Higgins'
                                          motion to carry <lb/> â to meet every night. Not only
                                          every night, but <lb/> every day but Sunday. There cannot
                                          be too much <lb/> of a good thing. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     There is another matter. If this Convention is 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     going to close around the middle of December... 
     <lb/>
     that leaves one month between the end of this 
     <lb/>
     debate and the closing of the Convention. During 
     <lb/>
     that month we have two orders of business to deal 
     <lb/>
     with: the question of confederation, and the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the forms of possible future government 
     <lb/>
     that we will recommend to His Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government in the United Kingdom to be laid 
     <lb/>
     before the people in the national referendum. A 
     <lb/>
     month in which to do that! As far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned ... there should be a thorough debate on 
     <lb/>
     the terms of confederation, and that debate should 
     <lb/>
     be known and heard by all the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. To the extent that the holding of night 
     <lb/>
     sessions might prevent the people from hearing 
     <lb/>
     the debates, I would not advise holding night 
     <lb/>
     sessions. If the night sessions are not to be broad<lb break="no"/>cast, it means the people are hearing only half the 
     <lb/>
     debate, and that might be a half when some 
     <lb/>
     essential matters are debated. I would like to be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that debates held at night time are broad<lb break="no"/>cast. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not feel like making an amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     amendment; possibly it might be agreeable to 
     <lb/>
     add, "but that no night session shall continue 
     <lb/>
     beyond eleven o'clock on any night".... I would 
     <lb/>
     suggest that amendment to Mr. Job. Could that 
     <lb/>
     be done, with the understanding that the debates 
     <lb/>
     be broadcast so that the Newfoundland people 
     <lb/>
     will know what is going on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

                                          and has been advised that <lb/> they are very
                                          sympathetic.... I am advised that the <lb/> facilities of

                                          human endeavour will permit, will be <lb/> placed at the
                                          disposal of the Convention. It <lb/> depends upon the
                                          outcome of the motion. <lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Order please. Since resuming 
     <lb/>
     the Chair this afternoon, I received the following 
     <lb/>
     letter: 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>J. B. McEvoy, Esq, K.C., LL.B., 
     <lb/>Chairman, National Convention, 
     <lb/>St. John's, Nfld. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have to refer to your letter of November 
     <lb/>
     13, setting forth the resolution of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention requesting that the Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Commission arrange for the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the Convention Act, to enable 
     <lb/>
     members of the Convention, absent from ses<lb break="no"/>sions because of illness, to vote by proxy 
     <lb/>
     upon certain matters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commission of Government have 
     <lb/>
     given consideration to this request. Section 3 
     <lb/>
     of the act sets forth the duty and function of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, and empowers the making 
     <lb/>
     of recommendations to His Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government in the United Kingdom as to 
     <lb/>
     possible forms of future government to be put 
     <lb/>
     before the people at a national referendum. 
     <lb/>
     There is no provision that the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions of any particular proportion of the 
     <lb/>
     representatives should form the recommen<lb break="no"/>dations of the Convention, and the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion is not empowered to make any decisions 
     <lb/>
     as to the forms of government to be put 
     <lb/>
     before the people. It is the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     government that, as in the case of committees 
     <lb/>
     and commissions having power to inves<lb break="no"/>tigate and make recommendations, but not 
     <lb/>
     having power to make decisions, members of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention who hold a minority view on 
     <lb/>
     any question are entitled themselves, or with 
     <lb/>
     other members of the Convention, to have 
     <lb/>
     their recommendations go forward from the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. It is therefore difficult to see 
     <lb/>
     what purposes could be served by making the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     amendment requested. Members absent by 
     <lb/>
     illness can no doubt communicate with the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman or Secretary of the Convention and 
     <lb/>
     have their views on forms of government 
     <lb/>
     noted in any and all recommendations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of the foregoing the Commission 
     <lb/>
     are unable to agree to the request of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have the honour to be, sir, 
     <lb/>
     Your most obedient servant, 
     <lb/>
     W.J. Carew, Secretary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins I wonder Mr. Chairman if we could 
     <lb/>
     have copies of that mimeographed and dis<lb break="no"/>tributed to members? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman By all means, Mr. Higgins I 
     <lb/>should also like to inform the Convention that, 
     <lb/>arising out of your decision to continue evening 
     <lb/>sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday 
     <lb/>evenings, the Broadcasting Corporation has been 
     <lb/>contacted by Mr. Ryan. In fact he has been inter<lb break="no"/>mittently engaged in negotiations with that body 
     <lb/>since Saturday morning. The result is that all 
     <lb/>evening sessions will be recorded and the Cor<lb break="no"/>poration undertakes to rebroadcast the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings as nearly as possible, in view of point of 
     <lb/>time, after the sessions have taken place, as exâ 
     <lb break="maybe"/>igencies may reasonably permit and require. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should also like to inform members that all 
     <lb/>
     questions, and in one particular instance, notices 
     <lb/>
     given, have been attended to. We decided, or the 
     <lb/>
     Information Committee decided, that since the 
     <lb/>
     notice of question was given at the last session, 
     <lb/>
     and would in the ordinary course be put today, 
     <lb/>
     and since it has a bearing upon the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report which is now before the house, that the 
     <lb/>
     usual technical formalities ought to be raised, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore all questions and notices of questions 
     <lb/>
     up to this time have been submitted and attended 
     <lb/>
     to so far as we are concerned. 
     <lb/>
