<!-- GL, 2017-07-07, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            <!--<p>
     for myself, and I promise you that, as far as it lies 
     <lb/>
     in my ability at least, while you are in the Chair 
     <lb/>
     and for the remainder of this Convention's life, I 
     <lb/>
     for one will be an absolute model of parliamen<lb break="no"/>tary propriety, dignity and decorum. If the mem<lb break="no"/>bers who smile are inclined to doubt the sincerity 
     <lb/>
     of what I say, I will give you at this moment an 
     <lb/>
     earnest of the sincerity of my statement and in<lb break="no"/>tentions, when I offer, through you, to a member 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention about whom at the last sitting 
     <lb/>
     on Friday last, in the heat of debate and in a state 
     <lb/>
     of anger, I made a remark which now I wish to 
     <lb/>
     withdraw. I refer to the remark I made about my 
     <lb/>
     good and learned friend behind me, Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
     I withdraw the remark. I apologise sincerely to 
     <lb/>
     him, and promise him sincerely that he will have 
     <lb/>
     to provoke me much more than he has ever done 
     <lb/>
     in the past, before I will make another insulting 
     <lb/>
     remark about him.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I wish you every success in 
     <lb/>
     your office, and I believe you will be a success. I 
     <lb/>
     look upon you as one Newfoundlander, amongst 
     <lb/>
     others, who has come up from the ranks by hard 
     <lb/>
     work, great study and brilliance of mind. I ac<lb break="no"/>claim you as a Newfoundlander of whom we 
     <lb/>
     always can be proud. You have my respect, and 
     <lb/>
     you will have my co-operation to the dying hour 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't propose to 
     <lb/>
     make any extended remarks in reply to my friend 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood. I think probably he has the right 
     <lb/>
     to lose his temper once in a while, the same as the 
     <lb/>
     rest of us, and I can say frankly that I do very 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     heartily accept his apology for the words which 
     <lb/>
     he used towards me the other day, but, as I said, 
     <lb/>
     these words were spoken in the heat of debate and 
     <lb/>
     I am quite sure that he probably did not mean 
     <lb/>
     what he said, and if he did, he has recanted now. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood and myself have got along very 
     <lb/>
     peaceably in the past 12 months. We have fallen 
     <lb/>
     out once in a while, but it was always in the 
     <lb/>
     course of debate when we were trying to decide 
     <lb/>
     something which we each believed to be for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit, or otherwise, of our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am rather appalled at the attitude taken by 
     <lb/>
     some of the daily papers in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     little episode which happened here on Friday. 
     <lb/>
     Speaking for myself, I remember being in the 
     <lb/>
     British House of Commons last May at question 
     <lb/>
     time, and there were more cat-calls across the 
     <lb/>
     floors of that assembly than we have cast at each 
     <lb/>
     other in the whole 12 months. There were cat<lb break="no"/>calls and cries of "sit down" and "get out"; and 
     <lb/>
     nobody seemed to worry about that, it was in the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary course of debate.... I accept this apology 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. Smallwood, and l would like, sir, in 
     <lb/>
     accepting it, to offer to you my heartiest con<lb break="no"/>gratulations on this office which you have as<lb break="no"/>sumed, and which I know will tax even you; at 
     <lb/>
     times you will be taxed probably as to the correct 
     <lb/>
     decision to give, but I feel quite sure that I can 
     <lb/>
     add my words to Mr. Smallwood in offering you 
     <lb/>
     my whole-hearted support in this strenuous job 
     <lb/>
     which you have undertaken for your country. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>[The Convention adjourned]

     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Before I present myself to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject matter which is before us, I should like, sir, 
     <lb/>
     seeing that this is the first occasion on which I 
     <lb/>
     have spoken since your advent to our midst, to 
     <lb/>
     say a word of welcome to yourself.... It was a wise 
     <lb/>
     choice that led to your selection, and it is with 
     <lb/>
     considerable reassurance that we welcome you to 
     <lb/>
     the Chair of this assembly. It is to a most impor<lb break="no"/>tant undertaking that you are committed, to 
     <lb/>
     preside with impartiality and with wisdom over 
     <lb/>
     the deliberations of this House. The task to which 
    

            <cb/>
            

     this assembly is committed is of much moment 
     <lb/>
     to all the people. We are all little men sent here 
     <lb/>
     to serve a great purpose. But because the purpose 
     <lb/>
     is great, if we serve it worthily, some of the 
     <lb/>
     greatness will descend upon us. But if we serve 
     <lb/>
     this purpose unworthily, our names will stand 
     <lb/>
     forever cursed, and our posterity will point to us 
     <lb/>
     as men of little soul, who could not face the 
     <lb/>
     supreme power of our faith when its challenge 
     <lb/>
     came. I am quite confident that your guidance.

     <lb/>
     to which we are dedicated. Notwithstanding all 
     <lb/>
     the calumnies that have been heaped upon us by 
     <lb/>
     those who have judged our work under bias, I 
     <lb/>
     make the categoric statement that this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion has functioned with advantage to the people 
     <lb/>
     of this island; and they have no doubt that in the 
     <lb/>
     days of your chairmanship it will continue so to 
     <lb/>
     function.... It is a moment of high destiny for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland without equal since the first mo<lb break="no"/>ment of our achieving responsibility in govern<lb break="no"/>ment. In the crucial days that lie ahead, the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland will be looking to you to guide 
     <lb/>
     this Convention to the completion of its task with 
     <lb/>
     despatch and with dignity. I offer you my sincere 
     <lb/>
     wishes for your success in that endeavour, and

     my assurance of full co-operation.

     There is one other thing that I should like to

     add. In the manner of his chairmanship, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley can well afford to wait with equanimity 
     <lb/>
     for the verdict of history, and undoubtedly the 
     <lb/>
     most charitable thing to do about the incident that 
     <lb/>
     provoked his resignation is also to wait for the 
     <lb/>
     comment of history. The fullness of time has a 
     <lb/>
     way of arriving at conclusions into which the 
     <lb/>
     emotionalisms that harry in the heat of the day do 
     <lb/>
     not enter. And I feel that could he but foresee it, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley would find much cause for satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion in the verdict which history will pass upon 
     <lb/>
     his chairmanship. For purposes of such record of 
     <lb/>
     the incident on Friday, October 10, which may be 
     <lb/>
     preserved for the amazement of our posterity, I 
     <lb/>
     should like to make the statement that throughout 
     <lb/>
     the days of his chairmanship, Mr. Bradley did act 
     <lb/>
     with impartiality, honour, and dignity — and that 
     <lb/>
     he always had my confidence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was a member of the Committee responsible 
     <lb/>
     for the report that is now before us. The report 
     <lb/>
     makes a summary of what we did finally agree 
     <lb/>
     upon as the facts of our national financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion. It could not be expected that all the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Committee would agree as to the personal 
     <lb/>
     conclusions they would draw from the facts set 
     <lb/>
     forth. So I have to say that I cannot subscribe 
     <lb/>
     without question to the conclusion Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     intimated in yesterday's debate that he had come 
     <lb/>
     to, namely, that the country is self-supporting 
     <lb/>
     again. I regret that I have once again to voice in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention a disagreement with Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin. I have a high regard for the Major, in 
     <lb/>
     particular his consistency of purpose in pursuing 


            <cb/>
          

     relentlessly the goal of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     which he has set before himself. I say that in all 
     <lb/>
     sincerity. I have always believed that when the 
     <lb/>
     Major spoke he was calling a spade a spade, 
     <lb/>
     according to his own lights. It so happens that I 
     <lb/>
     have done exactly the same thing. And since our 
     <lb/>
     lights have been different, our disagreements 
     <lb/>
     have been inevitable. I would that it had been 
     <lb/>
     otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know that taken all in all. I have been a very 
     <lb/>
     disagreeable person at this Convention, and in 
     <lb/>
     consequence, I have come to be called everything 
     <lb/>
     from a communist to a confederate. A con<lb break="no"/>federate I gather is something that not even the 
     <lb/>
     grace of God could raise to the level of the depths 
     <lb/>
     of degradation. I do think that attaching ulterior 
     <lb/>
     motives to my actions has been rather un<lb break="no"/>charitable. I fail to see how insisting upon the 
     <lb/>
     importance of three square meals a day has made 
     <lb/>
     me a communist, any more than insisting upon 
     <lb/>
     hearing the terms of confederation has made me 
     <lb/>
     a confederate, and in any case, irrespective of 
     <lb/>
     what popular misconstructions may have been 
     <lb/>
     put upon my views and upon my conduct, I have 
     <lb/>
     the personal satisfaction of knowing that I have 
     <lb/>
     always acted according to the dictates of my 
     <lb/>
     conscience. If that has been improper, I prefer it 
     <lb/>
     that way. And so I have come to the making of 
     <lb/>
     this statement as a consequence of my examina<lb break="no"/>tion of our finances and economy. What I have to 
     <lb/>
     say will not be well received, for it is not the 
     <lb/>
     popular view. I know that again I shall be thought 
     <lb/>
     of as seeking to further some dark design that I 
     <lb/>
     am supposed to entertain. But a man should not 
     <lb/>
     be turned aside from the statement of what he 
     <lb/>
     believes to be true because he knows that he may 
     <lb/>
     be misrepresented or misconstrued. This state<lb break="no"/>ment is as objective an appraisal of our material 
     <lb/>
     national position as I am qualified to make 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our first purpose here is to consider and dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the changes that have taken place in the 
     <lb/>
     financial and economic situation of the island 
     <lb/>
     since 1934. Before I pass on to consider such 
     <lb/>
     changes, permit me to point out that there is 
     <lb/>
     somewhat of a difference between the financial 
     <lb/>
     and the economic. It is a difference of which 
     <lb/>
     many appear to be unaware, or prefer to ignore. 
     <lb/>
     At any rate, there is much confusion of the two, 
     <lb/>
     with the financial being taken to indicate that our 
     <lb/>
     economy is in good shape. Two examples will 
     <lb/>
     serve to illustrate what I mean. Take the matter 


            <pb n="596" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0596.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">596</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">October 1947</fw>
          

     of our per capita debt. Every now and then a great 
     <lb/>
     furor is made over the fact that our per capita debt 
     <lb/>
     is comparatively lower than that of some other 
     <lb/>
     countries. Thus the Finance Report notes with a 
     <lb/>
     gleam in its eye or maybe with its tongue in its 
     <lb/>
     check, that our per capita debt is $237, the per 
     <lb/>
     capita debt of Canada is $1,387, that of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain approximately $1,900, and that of the 
     <lb/>
     United States $1,853. So far, so good. But all that 
     <lb/>
     is a lot of statistics, sound and fury signifying 
     <lb/>
     nothing much in particular. Our per capita debt 
     <lb/>
     has a certain significance when it comes to the 
     <lb/>
     interpretation of our financial position. But the 
     <lb/>
     fact that it is lower than that of some other 
     <lb/>
     countries is of absolutely no significance as an 
     <lb/>
     index of our economic power to provide for our<lb break="no"/>selves. Nevertheless, many Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     seem to derive some measure of economic as<lb break="no"/>surance for the morrow from these facts. That 
     <lb/>
     comes very likely from the confused notion that 
     <lb/>
     the average Newfoundlander is, in some mystic 
     <lb/>
     way, better off than the average Canadian, be<lb break="no"/>cause he has but $250 per capita debt hanging 
     <lb/>
     over his head, whereas his counterpart across the 
     <lb/>
     Gulf has a per capita debt of $1,375 hanging over 
     <lb/>
     his. However, the economy of Canada is much 
     <lb/>
     more capable of carrying the burden of its per 
     <lb/>
     capita debt than is the economy of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     at carrying ours. I may add that in the instance of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United States, the national debts 
     <lb/>
     are to a large extent internally contained, whilst 
     <lb/>
     ours is overwhelmingly an external debt. They 
     <lb/>
     owe their per capita debts across the street. We 
     <lb/>
     owe ours across the Atlantic. These are the essen<lb break="no"/>tial considerations, and as I have said the current 
     <lb/>
     comparison of the per capitas signifies nothing 
     <lb/>
     much in particular. Something of decided sig<lb break="no"/>nificance would be if comparative statistics of 
     <lb/>
     our per capita income were to show New<lb break="no"/>foundland well out in front. However, such statis<lb break="no"/>tics we rarely see, and I wonder if it could be 
     <lb/>
     because they do in actual fact show New<lb break="no"/>foundland well to the rear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The second example I have in mind arises out 
     <lb/>
     of the current protestations that Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting again. Now self-support is some<lb break="no"/>thing decidedly in the province of economics. 
     <lb/>
     Yet the top arguments offered in evidence of 
     <lb/>
     self-sufficiency are a balanced budget and a 
     <lb/>
     treasury surplus, matters decidedly in the 
     <lb/>
     province of finance. The current emphasis upon 
  

            <cb/>
        

     a balanced budget and a treasury surplus as in<lb break="no"/>dication of self-support is the greatest single non 
     <lb/>
     sequitur that confuses this hour of decision in our 
     <lb/>
     land. The financial proceeds from the economic. 
     <lb/>
     It is upon the taxable capacity of its economy that 
     <lb/>
     every nation depends for the wherewithal to 
     <lb/>
     finance its sovereignty. So I shall turn first to the 
     <lb/>
     financial changes that have taken place in this 
     <lb/>
     island since 1934, and then endeavour to deter<lb break="no"/>mine if they proceed from fundamental change in 
     <lb/>
     our economy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we consult the statistics of revenue and 
     <lb/>
     expenditure over the years, we observe that 
     <lb/>
     public finance in this island has fluctuated 
     <lb/>
     through three phases — a period when we 
     <lb/>
     managed to make ends meet; a period when we 
     <lb/>
     didn't manage to make ends meet; and a period 
     <lb/>
     when we more than managed to make ends meet. 
     <lb/>
     We will more clearly appreciate the character of 
     <lb/>
     this last change with which we are today con<lb break="no"/>fronted if we begin where responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment began. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We began responsible government on a shoe<lb break="no"/>string. In the year when we set out upon the high 
     <lb/>
     adventure of being sovereign unto ourselves, the 
     <lb/>
     revenue of Newfoundland was but a meager half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     million dollars. There may be some among us 
     <lb/>
     who may be inclined to work themselves up into 
     <lb/>
     italics at the thought that government in those 
     <lb/>
     days could manage with so little, and who work 
     <lb/>
     themselves up further into injunctions to the 
     <lb/>
     government of these days to go and do likewise. 
     <lb/>
     There are others, however, well inclined to 
     <lb/>
     wonder, and I have heard them wondering so, out 
     <lb/>
     loud, if, since there was a gaunt half-million 
     <lb/>
     dollars to manage with in the first place, we 
     <lb/>
     should have been granted responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment at all. After all, they reason, to undertake 
     <lb/>
     responsible government is to undertake to pro<lb break="no"/>vide the population with many more public and 
     <lb/>
     social services. We still had those 6,000 miles of 
     <lb/>
     coastline in those days, even if there was only 
     <lb/>
     120,000-odd people to spread along them; and 
     <lb/>
     just how could it have been expected to serve in 
     <lb/>
     any adequate manner or fashion, so little spread 
     <lb/>
     out so widely? They are inclined to think that it 
     <lb/>
     would have made just as much sense, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     more, to have granted responsible government to 
     <lb/>
     Ferryland or Bell Island. They wonder if the 
     <lb/>
     founding fathers of this nation did not bite off 
     <lb/>
     much more then we could chew. They do know 
  

            <pb n="597" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0597.jpg"/>

     that ever since we have had to bleed ourselves 
     <lb/>
     white in an attempt to provide the trappings of an 
     <lb/>
     elephant on the back of a mouse; and that we have 
     <lb/>
     never, until recently, quite succeeded. However, 
     <lb/>
     those people are wondering with the hindsight of 
     <lb/>
     history. In defence of the "great dead" who did 
     <lb/>
     achieve for us responsible government, it must be 
     <lb/>
     said that they could not be expected to foresee the 
     <lb/>
     shape of things to come in this 20th century. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, practically all the territory they had 
     <lb/>
     to think of providing the public services to in 
     <lb/>
     those days was the Avalon Peninsula. And in<lb break="no"/>deed, until the advent of Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, democracy in this island was mostly a 
     <lb/>
     matter of government of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador by Newfoundlanders for the Avalon 
     <lb/>
     Peninsula. Then it must be remembered that the 
     <lb/>
     mid-19th century was a nice, cozy time in which 
     <lb/>
     to be alive. Every day in every way, things were 
     <lb/>
     getting better and better. Mankind was going to 
     <lb/>
     move right straight ahead to the conquest of the 
     <lb/>
     universe. The spirit of laissez-faire was a 
     <lb/>
     broadened world. Economic liberalism was the 
     <lb/>
     order of the political day. The best government 
     <lb/>
     was the government that governed least. The role 
     <lb/>
     of government and the economy was consciously 
     <lb/>
     kept down to the minimum. God was in his 
     <lb/>
     heaven, all was going to be all right with the 
     <lb/>
     world. The British nation would see to that. And 
     <lb/>
     so in the brave new world of 1855 responsible 
     <lb/>
     government looked like a safe enough bet, even 
     <lb/>
     if there was only half a million dollars to pull and 
     <lb/>
     haul on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For over 60 years, from 1855 to 1919, we 
     <lb/>
     managed to make both ends meet. True, we had 
     <lb/>
     often to scrape the bottom of the barrel to do so. 
     <lb/>
     In the years when there was a margin to the good, 
     <lb/>
     it was meager; and once or twice the budget went 
     <lb/>
     into deficit. But by and large for 60-odd years we 
     <lb/>
     managed to keep our heads above water. In the 
     <lb/>
     economic sphere, however, almost every time the 
     <lb/>
     fishery failed, a lot of people nearly starved to 
     <lb/>
     death. Dole was not something unheard of until 
     <lb/>
     the days of Commission. Substantial expenditure 
     <lb/>
     on relief of the able-bodied poor had to be in<lb break="no"/>curred within five years of the obtaining of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. And the first eight years 
     <lb/>
     of the 1860s were among the grimmest of our 
     <lb/>
     history. Once indeed, even in the financial 
     <lb/>
     sphere, it was touch and go, during the bank crash 
     <lb/>
     of 1894. Involved in the crisis was the Union 
 

            <cb/>
         

     Bank with which the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     had made arrangements to provide the half-year<lb break="no"/>ly interest on the public debt due in London on 
     <lb/>
     January 1, 1895. The Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     suddenly found itself with a first magnitude 
     <lb/>
     crisis. It had to get its hands on a quarter of a 
     <lb/>
     million dollars in a hurry. And so first, the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government went to Britain with its 
     <lb/>
     hat in its hands. But Britain wanted to set up a 
     <lb/>
     royal commission of inquiry as a condition of a 
     <lb/>
     rescue loan, and the government of the day 
     <lb/>
     wouldn't have that. And so it turned around and 
     <lb/>
     went to Canada with its hat in its hands. But 
     <lb/>
     Canada wouldn't bid high enough. Canada 
     <lb/>
     pinched the pennies and lost the tenth province. 
     <lb/>
     Bond finally negotiated the long-term loan in 
     <lb/>
     England which saved Newfoundland from 
     <lb/>
     default — for a little while, however. The New<lb break="no"/>foundland government had appeared in a role that 
     <lb/>
     presaged the final financial disaster that came 
     <lb/>
     upon it — the role of chasing around with its hat 
     <lb/>
     in its hands in a frantic effort to borrow enough 
     <lb/>
     to carry on. We were to see the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government in that role again, practically all 
     <lb/>
     during the period from 1920 to 1933, the period 
     <lb/>
     when we didn't manage to make both ends meet. 
     <lb/>
     During those 13 years we incurred 11 budget 
     <lb/>
     deficits, and borrowed $57 million. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, we went behind at an average rate of $4.8 
     <lb/>
     million per year. And so we came at last to the 
     <lb/>
     end of our financial tether and passed into the 
     <lb/>
     hands of a glorified receivership. Even the 
     <lb/>
     receivership couldn't do anything to achieve 
     <lb/>
     financial stability, and budget deficits continued 
     <lb/>
     through the first seven years of Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A careful study of what led to our financial 
     <lb/>
     collapse in the early thirties leads inevitably to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that it occurred because our 
     <lb/>
     economy could not provide adequate revenue to 
     <lb/>
     defray the cost of the public and social services a 
     <lb/>
     western people demand. The Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people are a western people. It was inevitable that 
     <lb/>
     sooner or later they would begin to look to their 
     <lb/>
     government to try to keep up with the Joneses on 
     <lb/>
     the North American mainland. And with World 
     <lb/>
     War I it began. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The 20th century began in Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     the 1920s. Up until the time of the first world war, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland slumbered along content with its 
     <lb/>
     19th century lot. But when the boys came march<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="598" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0598.jpg"/>

     ing home the first time, they came to a land 
     <lb/>
     suddenly aware of the public amenities of the 
     <lb/>
     industrial civilisation on the mainland New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders were looking with envious eyes at 
     <lb/>
     the standards and services of the nations on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the fence, and soon they were want<lb break="no"/>ing some for themselves at the top of their voices. 
     <lb/>
     Government did the best that it could with the 
     <lb/>
     little it had. It managed to provide a few more 
     <lb/>
     miles of road and a few other pathetic odds and 
     <lb/>
     ends. But that extra effort was the last straw that 
     <lb/>
     broke the camel's back. Notwithstanding all the 
     <lb/>
     blame that has been heaped upon their heads, it 
     <lb/>
     was not so much our politicians who failed us in 
     <lb/>
     that hour as our economy. Came the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, and for seven years, it did little better than 
     <lb/>
     the politicians. I have always thought that the 
     <lb/>
     Commission would have done much better if it 
     <lb/>
     had acted as a commission. It had the power, had 
     <lb/>
     in the beginning the goodwill of the people. Ithad 
     <lb/>
     a better chance to do a more notable job than any 
     <lb/>
     government this island has ever had. But it fell 
     <lb/>
     short of what it might have accomplished. Some<lb break="no"/>where along the line it seems to have become 
     <lb/>
     more concerned with heeding the dictates of its 
     <lb/>
     ear to the ground, than proceeding with the 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction paths to which it was committed, 
     <lb/>
     and standing for no nonsense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And then the seven years of plenty were upon 
     <lb/>
     us. The phrase is more euphonious than exact, but 
     <lb/>
     I have yet to be convinced that what the war 
     <lb/>
     brought to this land may rightly be termed 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. I still agree with myself in what I said 
     <lb/>
     at the beginning of this Convention — that all that 
     <lb/>
     came of the war jobs and the war dollars, was that 
     <lb/>
     a few more Newfoundlanders than ever before 
     <lb/>
     came a little closer than ever before to achieving 
     <lb/>
     a decent standard of living. For the most part, in 
     <lb/>
     most instances, where there was something over 
     <lb/>
     and to spare it went to replace and to restore what 
     <lb/>
     had rotted and mildewed away during the depres<lb break="no"/>sion years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the matter of public finance, the last seven 
     <lb/>
     years have been years of surplus. We have more 
     <lb/>
     than managed to make ends meet. In each year 
     <lb/>
     there has been a comfortable margin over and to 
     <lb/>
     spare. However, as far as I am concerned it is an 
     <lb/>
     open question whether we should have today a 
     <lb/>
     $30 million treasury surplus. Granted, the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government acted in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the first principle of modern cyclic finances to tax 


            <cb/>
         

     to the hilt in periods of prosperity so there may 
     <lb/>
     be a backlog to fall back on in times of depres<lb break="no"/>sion. But the Newfoundland people had endured 
     <lb/>
     so much, and had so much to restore and to 
     <lb/>
     replace — in many instances down even to bed 
     <lb/>
     linen and kitchen utensils — that it is an open 
     <lb/>
     question if that $30 million accumulated in the 
     <lb/>
     treasury should not have been foregone in the 
     <lb/>
     interests of a lower cost of living; if instead of the 
     <lb/>
     preoccupation with a system of taxation — that 
     <lb/>
     is the fine an of squeezing blood out of a turnip 
     <lb/>
     carried to perfection — the authorities had been 
     <lb/>
     more concerned to control living costs, New<lb break="no"/>foundland might have been better served. 
     <lb/>
     Government has latterly shown, and is showing 
     <lb/>
     a belated and ponderous concern with the cost of 
     <lb/>
     living. It was rushing around frantically to lock 
     <lb/>
     the stable door after the horse was stolen, just 
     <lb/>
     seven years and possibly $30 million too late. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our continuing ability these last years to 
     <lb/>
     balance the budget and have a couple of million 
     <lb/>
     to the good is a new phenomenon in local public 
     <lb/>
     finance. The phenomenon is all the more remark<lb break="no"/>able in that the budgets of these last years have 
     <lb/>
     provided for many new improved public and 
     <lb/>
     social services. This continuing ability marks a 
     <lb/>
     drastic change with all that has gone before. If 
     <lb/>
     there is reason to expect that this intoxicating new 
     <lb/>
     ability to more than make ends meet will continue 
     <lb/>
     to be ours in the normal times of the future, then 
     <lb/>
     are we saved indeed. Is there reason to expect 
     <lb/>
     that? We must search our economy for the 
     <lb/>
     answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the past our economy was never equal to 
     <lb/>
     the task of providing such revenue as could 
     <lb/>
     finance the striving after public and social ser<lb break="no"/>vices that would in some measure compare with 
     <lb/>
     those on the mainland. In consequence we came 
     <lb/>
     upon catastrophe. What we must look for today 
     <lb/>
     is some fundamental change indicative of an 
     <lb/>
     increase in taxable capacity to support the desired 
     <lb/>
     social services. To look for less than that would 
     <lb/>
     be to presuppose that the Newfoundland people 
     <lb/>
     will be forever content with decidedly inferior 
     <lb/>
     standards of public and social services than those 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed by other British and American peoples. 
     <lb/>
     I know of no good and sufficient reason why we 
     <lb/>
     should be reconciled to a destiny so meager and 
     <lb/>
     austere. I have yet to be convinced that we, who 
     <lb/>
     stand at the crossroads of the Atlantic com<lb break="no"/>munity, should be content to stand in sackcloth

     and ashes, forever doing the penance of an 
     <lb/>
     emaciated pauperhood for sins of history that 
     <lb/>
     were not ours. It needs no more than a glance to 
     <lb/>
     see that in its essential characteristics the 
     <lb/>
     economy of Newfoundland has not changed. His<lb break="no"/>torically our economy has always been an export 
     <lb/>
     economy. It still is. The dynamics that move our 
     <lb/>
     economy today are, as always, the production of 
     <lb/>
     staple products for sale abroad. For the most part 
     <lb/>
     our production has no vested interest in serving 
     <lb/>
     our own island. We have to import most of what 
     <lb/>
     we need, even considerable quantities of 
     <lb/>
     potatoes. We are geared, after some fashion, to 
     <lb/>
     serve the world, not to serve ourselves. The 
     <lb/>
     population upon which the whole market is 
     <lb/>
     founded is so meager that it does not permit of 
     <lb/>
     such mass production as would be essential to 
     <lb/>
     any servicing of ourselves with manufactured 
     <lb/>
     goods. And so the essential character of our 
     <lb/>
     economy remains the same; it has not taken upon 
     <lb/>
     itself any of the characteristics of an industrial 
     <lb/>
     economy. Nevertheless, modifications have 
     <lb/>
     come with the years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For years the economy of Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     almost entirely a matter of what came of the 
     <lb/>
     export of dried salt codfish. When the fishery and 
     <lb/>
     the world markets were favourable the people ate 
     <lb/>
     — fish and brewis; when they weren't, people 
     <lb/>
     tightened their belts and ate fish and hoped that 
     <lb/>
     the winter wouldn't be too hard. In time the 
     <lb/>
     economy came to be broadened out at the base to 
     <lb/>
     the export of other fish besides cod; and still 
     <lb/>
     further the economy came to be expanded in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the export of newsprint and some 
     <lb/>
     minerals. In comparatively recent years, one or 
     <lb/>
     two other odds and ends such as blueberries have 
     <lb/>
     come to be exported; and then the expansion of 
     <lb/>
     the economy at its base came to an end. We had 
     <lb/>
     run out of natural resources. Thereafter there 
     <lb/>
     could be room only for quantitative expansion. 
     <lb/>
     The export expansion would have to be by way 
     <lb/>
     of the seams. In the meantime our economy has 
     <lb/>
     not shown any signs of going out at the seams. 
     <lb/>
     There have been no indications of middle-age 
     <lb/>
     spread. Rather has the shape of our economy been 
     <lb/>
     mostly such as that induced by taking in another 
     <lb/>
     notch in the belt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Any expansion that has materialised since 
     <lb/>
     1934 has been in quantity rather then variety. 
     <lb/>
     What has been involved has been increased 
     <lb/>
     capacity to him out the same commodities as 
 
            <cb/>
          

     before — in some instances in new forms. There 
     <lb/>
     has been no production of new commodities 
     <lb/>
     derived from the tapping of natural resources of 
     <lb/>
     other categories than those previously worked, 
     <lb/>
     production of such dimension as did materially 
     <lb/>
     affect the economy of the country. Whether that 
     <lb/>
     is a condition that will continue to obtain for the 
     <lb/>
     duration of our time is anybody's guess. It is not 
     <lb/>
     impossible that we might have some minor 
     <lb/>
     developments in asbestos and coal. But whether 
     <lb/>
     they would make a noticeable impact upon our 
     <lb/>
     economy is imponderable. Also among the im<lb break="no"/>ponderables, is the impact we may expect the 
     <lb/>
     development of Labrador to have upon our 
     <lb/>
     economy. There is reason to think that its 
     <lb/>
     economic potential is considerable. The pertinent 
     <lb/>
     question is, injust whose interest is that potential 
     <lb/>
     to be developed, the people of Labrador or the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland? It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     until now the people of Labrador have fared none 
     <lb/>
     too well at our hand. We haven't gone out of our 
     <lb/>
     way to provide them with even minimum public 
     <lb/>
     and social services. I understand that luxury roads 
     <lb/>
     of the type of the Topsail Road are few and far 
     <lb/>
     between down that way. Indeed I understand that 
     <lb/>
     roads of any type are as few and as far between 
     <lb/>
     down that way as street lights and railways and 
     <lb/>
     other public amenities. Come to think of it, in the 
     <lb/>
     days when we did have responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     we never even thought it worth our while to 
     <lb/>
     extend to the people of Labrador the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     a ballot. Indeed, we didn't get around to giving a 
     <lb/>
     second thought to Labrador until it seemed as if 
     <lb/>
     we might get something out of it. It would be 
     <lb/>
     interesting to know the thoughts of Labradorians 
     <lb/>
     when they hear some of our political pundits 
     <lb/>
     raising the roof over the raw deal 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's gotten from somebody or other. 
     <lb/>
     It must sometimes occur to them that New<lb break="no"/>foundland doesn't do so badly itself when it 
     <lb/>
     comes to dishing out raw deals. I have a hearty 
     <lb/>
     dislike of that mentality that is concerned with 
     <lb/>
     Labrador only to the extent that it may be ex<lb break="no"/>ploited for Newfoundland's advantage. The most 
     <lb/>
     that we have any right to expect of the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of Labrador is the provision of sufficient 
     <lb/>
     revenue to support the public and social services 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador people have every right to expect. 
     <lb/>
     These we are in any case obligated to provide 
     <lb/>
     even if Labrador should go undeveloped. If we 
     <lb/>
     make no effort to provide them then I think that 


            <pb n="600" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0600.jpg"/>

     Labrador people would be quite justified in seek<lb break="no"/>ing to terminate their dependency upon us. If 
     <lb/>
     we're going to insist upon self-determination 
     <lb/>
     let's not draw the line at the Straits of Belle Isle. 
     <lb/>
     The people of Labrador too are surely entitled to 
     <lb/>
     a voice in the disposition of their own destiny.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is some promise of significant expan<lb break="no"/>sion of our economy for the future. The increased 
     <lb/>
     output capacity planned for Corner Brook's 
     <lb/>
     paper mill will step up considerably the impact 
     <lb/>
     of our chief forest industry. But we might as well 
     <lb/>
     keep a tight reign on any great expectations with 
     <lb/>
     regard to our forests and our mines. The most we 
     <lb/>
     can ever hope to see come of their exploitation is 
     <lb/>
     that a few will do pretty well and a few more will 
     <lb/>
     manage to get along. But the number of New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who can ever hope to draw upon 
     <lb/>
     our forests and our mines for a full and steady 
     <lb/>
     livelihood is decidedly limited. Today, as ever, 
     <lb/>
     for such period of the future as is in any way 
     <lb/>
     foreseeable, the great mass of our people must 
     <lb/>
     depend upon fish and what can be made from its 
     <lb/>
     export. The gross national production of this 
     <lb/>
     island is compounded of much more than what 
     <lb/>
     comes of the export of fish. But the fishing in<lb break="no"/>dustry is the only significant point of contact that 
     <lb/>
     most of our people have with the gross national 
     <lb/>
     income — the only point at which they get to 
     <lb/>
     share in it at all significantly; and if there is no 
     <lb/>
     future in fish, then we had better vacate this 
     <lb/>
     island, preferably by tomorrow sunrise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The most significant development within the 
     <lb/>
     structure of our economy since the days of Cabot 
     <lb/>
     came during the war with the great diversion to 
     <lb/>
     frozen fish processing on a large scale. This was 
     <lb/>
     a more significant development even than the 
     <lb/>
     coming of the paper mills. It touched with a 
     <lb/>
     golden touch the lives of more people and 
     <lb/>
     released many man hours for productive work. 
     <lb/>
     We have had high hopes that this diversification 
     <lb/>
     within the structure of our chief industry would 
     <lb/>
     lead to greater stability of our economy, since it 
     <lb/>
     would mean that we would have one more basket 
     <lb/>
     into which to put our eggs. This year our frozen 
     <lb/>
     fish trade has received a set-back at the hands of 
     <lb/>
     our ancient enemy the foreign market, and we 
     <lb/>
     have been salting away our fish almost as franti<lb break="no"/>cally as at any time since the beginning. Yet there 
     <lb/>
     is the decided difference that, in all the years 
     <lb/>
     since the beginning, there is a greater measure of 
     <lb/>
     centralisation. Even if we have had to salt much 
 

            <cb/>
       

     fish that would under different circumstances 
     <lb/>
     have been frozen, that salting has to a greater 
     <lb/>
     extent than previously been done at central sta<lb break="no"/>tions, with fishermen thus being able to dispose 
     <lb/>
     of their catch green and our economy has been at 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of the extra man hours released for 
     <lb/>
     productive work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the intensive development of our fresh 
     <lb/>
     frozen fish industry lies our greatest hope for the 
     <lb/>
     future. With regard to salt cod, I don't think that 
     <lb/>
     we have any longer any grounds to hope for a 
     <lb/>
     more spacious destiny there. In a little while, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the time is even now, world production 
     <lb/>
     of salt cod is going to be in excess of a world 
     <lb/>
     demand which those best qualified to judge admit 
     <lb/>
     cannot be increased. I grant you that we shall 
     <lb/>
     always be able to sell some salt cod provided we 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to sell at a low enough price. In any 
     <lb/>
     case, as I survey the totality of our economy, in 
     <lb/>
     the light of all that l have learned at this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, I can see only in the intensive development 
     <lb/>
     of our fresh frozen fish structure any way of 
     <lb/>
     coming by those three square meals a day, and a 
     <lb/>
     decent suit of clothes on the back, and a tight roof 
     <lb/>
     over the head, that I have been looking for my 
     <lb/>
     last forgotten fishermen on the bill of Cape St. 
     <lb/>
     George — and the last forgotten fishermen on all 
     <lb/>
     the bills of all the capes of this island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Will the condition of the world markets in the 
     <lb/>
     years to come admit our proceeding with such 
     <lb/>
     intense development? Your guess is as good as 
     <lb/>
     mine. Our local fish processors are full of high 
     <lb/>
     hopes and most anxious to make the effort. But 
     <lb/>
     in the last analysis, the things that matter in fish 
     <lb/>
     are out of their hands. The shape of things to 
     <lb/>
     come in fish is the most uncertain thing in a world 
     <lb/>
     loaded with uncertainties. At this moment we 
     <lb/>
     must remain in the dark about our destiny be<lb break="no"/>cause we must remain in the dark about fish. It 
     <lb/>
     has ever been thus, and there are no indications 
     <lb/>
     it is going to be any different for a long time to 
     <lb/>
     come. That means the historic vulnerability of 
     <lb/>
     our economy will project into the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another important respect in which our 
     <lb/>
     economy has retained its essential character, is in 
     <lb/>
     its mercurial reaction to the least change that 
     <lb/>
     takes place in the markets of the world. Twice in 
     <lb/>
     this year we have had reminders of how much our 
     <lb/>
     economy is at the mercy of factors utterly beyond 
     <lb/>
     our control. In the early part of the year the United 
     <lb/>
     States terminated meat rationing, and in conse<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="601" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0601.jpg"/>

     quence of that action, plus loss of British war 
     <lb/>
     contracts, our newly-erected frozen fish structure 
     <lb/>
     was forced into considerable idleness and we 
     <lb/>
     were reduced to salting much of this year's catch 
     <lb/>
     of cod. At the end of August, Britain froze ster<lb break="no"/>ling convertibility, and in a day or two all that the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen of this island could obtain for their fish 
     <lb/>
     were open receipts. We escaped a considerable 
     <lb/>
     economic crisis by a hair's breadth, because 
     <lb/>
     during the last several years we had accumulated 
     <lb/>
     a little over and to spare. But without our war- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     begot national surplus to fall back upon, we 
     <lb/>
     should certainly at this moment he in the thick of 
     <lb/>
     an economic depression of the first magnitude. In 
     <lb/>
     this island the margin between ability and in<lb break="no"/>ability to make ends meet is a matter of a few 
     <lb/>
     million dollars, and were it not that at this time of 
     <lb/>
     sterling crisis we had a few millions in the sock 
     <lb/>
     we should now be on our uppers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The point I wish to make is that overnight two 
     <lb/>
     acts completely external to this country brought 
     <lb/>
     into prejudice the very livelihoods of many of our 
     <lb/>
     people, and we couldn't raise a finger to help 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. There is nothing much that we can do 
     <lb/>
     to lessen the vulnerability of our economy. The 
     <lb/>
     devices that nations of greater economic power 
     <lb/>
     may resort to, such as deficit financing and cur<lb break="no"/>rency manipulation, are beyond our means. And 
     <lb/>
     already there has been done as much as could be 
     <lb/>
     done. Until quite recently we used to put a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of effort into cutting our own throats on the 
     <lb/>
     world's fish market. The disastrous competition 
     <lb/>
     among local fish dealers in the days of consign<lb break="no"/>ment shipping generated a considerable internal 
     <lb/>
     vulnerability in our economy. Fortunately an end 
     <lb/>
     has come of all that, and now in the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Associated Fish Exporters Ltd. we 
     <lb/>
     have an instrument to prevent us from cutting the 
     <lb/>
     ground from under our own feet in the foreign 
     <lb/>
     markets. Our economy has retained its essential 
     <lb/>
     characteristic of an export economy, but a new 
     <lb/>
     element of considerable significance has never<lb break="no"/>theless come to enter into it, the advantage of 
     <lb/>
     increased national income from the services 
     <lb/>
     rendered by Newfoundlanders at the military 
     <lb/>
     bases. Since these bases are likely to be long 
     <lb/>
     maintained, unless some Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the near or next-to-near future manages 
     <lb/>
     to break the leases, that increased income may be 
     <lb/>
     counted upon to continue. We may take it then, 
     <lb/>
     that a stabilising influence of significant propor<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>
          

     tions has come to appear in our economy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not possible at this moment to rate Gander 
     <lb/>
     in the same category. The last report we had of 
     <lb/>
     Gander in this Convention gave reason to believe 
     <lb/>
     that it would be a charge upon the treasury for 
     <lb/>
     some time to come. Under these circumstances 
     <lb/>
     the increment to our economy from the earnings 
     <lb/>
     of individuals at the airport must be viewed as 
     <lb/>
     something for which this country pays through 
     <lb/>
     the nose, so that those employed there may have 
     <lb/>
     the privilege of earning what they do in that 
     <lb/>
     particular way — whereas they might be 
     <lb/>
     employed in other productive work that would 
     <lb/>
     yield a similar income. Since the incidental in<lb break="no"/>come at Gander, by which I mean that which 
     <lb/>
     derives from purchases made by transients and 
     <lb/>
     other than official services rendered to them for 
     <lb/>
     which they tip and pay extra, is an unknown 
     <lb/>
     quantity, the absolute value of Gander to the total 
     <lb/>
     economy of the country must remain in question 
     <lb/>
     until such time as the airport is paying its own 
     <lb/>
     way. Maybe that time is now. I confess to no 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the latest figures, but I understand 
     <lb/>
     that the number of daily flights through Gander 
     <lb/>
     has increased considerably these last few months. 
     <lb/>
     In any case, just to what extent the pay in Gander 
     <lb/>
     could be depended upon as a stabilising agent in 
     <lb/>
     our economy must ever remain in doubt. For 
     <lb/>
     there could never be any certainty that planes 
     <lb/>
     would not take to overflying the airport, in which 
     <lb/>
     case Gander would become a ghost town and we 
     <lb/>
     should find on our hands the greatest white 
     <lb/>
     elephant in the world since the Maginot Line. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To sum up then, it may be said that our 
     <lb/>
     economy would stand a fighting chance of sup<lb break="no"/>porting us in the manner to which we have lately 
     <lb/>
     become accustomed, given the right kind of 
     <lb/>
     world conditions. But there's the hitch. Given the 
     <lb/>
     wrong time in world conditions, and my last 
     <lb/>
     forgotten fishermen on the bill of Cape St. 
     <lb/>
     George will probably starve again, only the next 
     <lb/>
     time I hope he won't be so persistent about it. The 
     <lb/>
     best formula ever put forward to stabilise the 
     <lb/>
     economy of Newfoundland was put forward by a 
     <lb/>
     citizen of the United States. He was Wendell 
     <lb/>
     Wilkie. He had a plan for "one world". Only in 
     <lb/>
     such a world, wherein the great currents of trade 
     <lb/>
     and commerce would flow freely, could New<lb break="no"/>foundland and all the other islands of the sea ever 
     <lb/>
     come to know any consistent measure of 
     <lb/>
     economic security. And what are the chances for

     the emergence of such a world? At this moment 
     <lb/>
     they appear meager indeed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The breakdown of the multilateral trade sys<lb break="no"/>tem is taken as one of the realities of the hour. 
     <lb/>
     During his recent speech outlining Britain's new 
     <lb/>
     export targets, Sir Stafford Cripps said Britain 
     <lb/>
     would be forced into a large degree of bilateral 
     <lb/>
     trading, and in consequence bilateral balances of 
     <lb/>
     payments with various individual countries. The 
     <lb/>
     political arrangements that would result in one 
     <lb/>
     world seem as far away as ever. It will not be out 
     <lb/>
     of order if I relate such conclusions as may be 
     <lb/>
     drawn from the foregoing to the question of 
     <lb/>
     whether we are or are not self-supporting. It's not 
     <lb/>
     so directed in our terms of reference that we 
     <lb/>
     should concern ourselves with that specific ques<lb break="no"/>tion, but the people have been led to expect us to 
     <lb/>
     come to some conclusion on the point, and that 
     <lb/>
     makes it a legitimate question for us to take into 
     <lb/>
     account. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question of whether or not we are self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting is one to which there are many facets. 
     <lb/>
     For the most part emphasis has currently been put 
     <lb/>
     upon the one side of the story, namely a balanced 
     <lb/>
     budget and a treasury surplus. It so happens that 
     <lb/>
     these things are not enough. Having considered 
     <lb/>
     the matter seriously, dispassionately and at 
     <lb/>
     length, I have come to the conclusion that I 
     <lb/>
     cannot honestly accept less than this minimum as 
     <lb/>
     evidence of self-support. We have come to where 
     <lb/>
     we can, out of our resources, provide ourselves 
     <lb/>
     with some view of the public and social services 
     <lb/>
     that are the proper inheritance of a western people 
     <lb/>
     in this mid-20th century. It is little enough that 
     <lb/>
     we have advanced to, and no Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     will willingly see a single one of those services 
     <lb/>
     discontinued. And minimum evidence of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     support is only this: reason to expect for a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable period of the future, gross national 
     <lb/>
     income of such dimension and distribution as will 
     <lb/>
     ensure a decent living for all Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     and leave them with enough over and to spare to 
     <lb/>
     maintain these services at not less than their 
     <lb/>
     present level. If any one of us wishes to contend 
     <lb/>
     that this last should not be attempted, maybe he 
     <lb/>
     would care to name for me which of the cottage 
     <lb/>
     hospitals he would close down if he were Mini<lb break="no"/>ster of Health in our new government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My emotions make me want to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     future holds that minimum for us. And there is no 
     <lb/>
     getting away from the fact that we have some<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
          what more reason to be hopeful then ever before. 
     <lb/>
     But neither is there any getting away from the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the future is loaded with a greater concentra<lb break="no"/>tion of imponderables and unpredictables than 
     <lb/>
     we and men everywhere have ever faced before. 
     <lb/>
     If next year the fishery fails or we can't sell fish, 
     <lb/>
     then we all know that many a family economy 
     <lb/>
     will go, out at the elbows and down at the heels 
     <lb/>
     overnight. It is all as simple as that. Fish in this 
     <lb/>
     island is still a matter of life or death. As things 
     <lb/>
     stand today, we find that our economy has 
     <lb/>
     received such fillip as enables it to provide a 
     <lb/>
     luxury living for a few of us, a frugal living for 
     <lb/>
     some more of us, and a living on the margins of 
     <lb/>
     subsistence for the rest of us. We find the taxable 
     <lb/>
     capacity of our economy enhanced to such 
     <lb/>
     proportions as to be sufficient to defray the nor<lb break="no"/>mal costs of government, and yet finance a better 
     <lb/>
     number of public amenities and social services 
     <lb/>
     than ever before, even though the number be 
     <lb/>
     meager. And to whatever extent that may signify, 
     <lb/>
     we may not avoid the possibility of self-support. 
     <lb/>
     But it is, at its best, a hand-to-mouth self-suf<lb break="no"/>ficiency that may have come upon us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If these were normal times — the world is no 
     <lb/>
     nearer to the multilateral arrangements that 
     <lb/>
     would make a bulwark against economic regres<lb break="no"/>sion. And since we seem always to be able to keep 
     <lb/>
     ahead of the world when it comes to going 
     <lb/>
     downhill, it may be wondered if economic 
     <lb/>
     regression has not already set in, what with the 
     <lb/>
     curtailment of our frozen fish enterprises, the 
     <lb/>
     failure of the Labrador fishery, the unavailability 
     <lb/>
     of dollars and all the rest of it. I am not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to accept with good grace for the future anything 
     <lb/>
     less than the minimum standards of living, public 
     <lb/>
     and social services we now know, or to accept as 
     <lb/>
     evidence of a condition of self-support less than 
     <lb/>
     some assurance that we can maintain those min<lb break="no"/>imum standards for a reasonable period of the 
     <lb/>
     future; and I know that at this moment nobody 
     <lb/>
     can give me satisfactory assurance on that score. 
     <lb/>
     So I cannot join in giving to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people the categoric assurance that we are self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The whole question is impossible of satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory resolution. Your guess is as good as mine. 
     <lb/>
     Once again I am compelled to agree with myself 
     <lb/>
     that the Convention is being held about five years 
     <lb/>
     too soon, and that we could better make the 
     <lb/>
     judgements we must make after the world has had 


            <pb n="603" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0603.jpg"/>

     time to stop vibrating and the post-war pattern of 
     <lb/>
     life time to become distinct. The final word, the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion to draw from an examination of our 
     <lb/>
     finances and economy is this. In the past our 
     <lb/>
     economy was not able in normal times to provide 
     <lb/>
     the revenue to support the public and social ser<lb break="no"/>vices that other western peoples enjoy. There is 
     <lb/>
     no evidence at this moment that would seem to 
     <lb/>
     indicate we may expect that our economy will be 
     <lb/>
     able to do the like for the normal times of the 
     <lb/>
     future. Indeed, everything would seem to indicate 
     <lb/>
     that our only hope of ever coming by such ser<lb break="no"/>vices would be by subsidy from the outside. I say 
     <lb/>
     that without seeking to prejudice the argument 
     <lb/>
     for one form of government or another. I state it 
     <lb/>
     as an inevitable conclusion to be drawu from our 
     <lb/>
     history and our foreseeable prospects, and I do 
     <lb/>
     urge that to whatever form of government we 
     <lb/>
     now go forward, we do advance with our eyes 
     <lb/>
     wide open on that score. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't intend today to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the subject that Mr. Keough has just discussed so 
     <lb/>
     brilliantly and in such choice language — the 
     <lb/>
     question of whether or not Newfoundland is self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting and of what chance there is of her 
     <lb/>
     being self-supporting in the years to come. That 
     <lb/>
     I will leave for another occasion. But I would like 
     <lb/>
     to review the Report of the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     which Major Cashin is sponsoring here today, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it would not be very courteous to the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee or to Major Cashin if we 
     <lb/>
     failed to show by our interest and by our debate, 
     <lb/>
     how important we think that report is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have here before me, Mr. Chairman, figures 
     <lb/>
     which I compiled in the past 12 months showing 
     <lb/>
     for every year since Newfoundland got respon<lb break="no"/>sible government down to the present time how 
     <lb/>
     much taxes the various governments took from 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland people; whether they have a 
     <lb/>
     surplus or a deficit each year since 1855; what 
     <lb/>
     borrowing they did; what was the amount of the 
     <lb/>
     public debt; and what was the amount of the 
     <lb/>
     country's total trade. I have these figures for 
     <lb/>
     every year from 1855 down to the present year... 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Could I ask the source from 
     <lb/>which these figures were obtained? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The figures are compiled by me 
     <lb/>
     from official publications of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I have no intention whatever of 
     <lb/>
     using these figures for that long period of nearly 
     <lb/>
     100 years. But as the Report of the Finance Com<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
       
mittee starts for the year 1909 ... I wonder, sir, if 
     <lb/>
     you would bear with me if I extended the period 
     <lb/>
     of review in my present remarks back to the year 
     <lb/>
     in which I was born, 1900.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> On that point I have to direct the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the members to the fact that the terms 
     <lb/>
     of your mandate restrict you to inquire into the 
     <lb/>
     financial and economic position of the island as 
     <lb/>
     and from 1934. Insofar as any figures prior to that 
     <lb/>
     time might facilitate an understanding of the 
     <lb/>
     financial and economic position from 1934 up to 
     <lb/>
     the present time, I feel the time to be well taken.... 
     <lb/>
     If you feel that any period that you like is calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to facilitate the House in an understanding 
     <lb/>
     of the financial and economic position as and 
     <lb/>
     from 1934, then I have to hope that your remarks 
     <lb/>
     on that account are proper and relevant. Other 
     <lb/>
     wise I'm afraid I'll be reluctantly forced to take 
     <lb/>
     the position they are immaterial and irrelevant. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>how entirely to your ruling and I assure and 
     <lb/>promise you that the remarks I will make about 
     <lb/>the period between 1900 and 1934 are only for 
     <lb/>the purpose of throwing light on the period since 
     <lb/>1934. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, I hope you will forgive me if I make 
     <lb/>
     this a little personal because what I have in mind 
     <lb/>
     is less the gentlemen who are present this after<lb break="no"/>noon visibly, and more our masters — the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. I am attempting to deal with 
     <lb/>
     one of the most difficult things, figures and statis<lb break="no"/>tics. So I am trying to make them sound as inter<lb break="no"/>esting as possible by using personal allusions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, if I were 50 years old instead of 47 my life 
     <lb/>
     would fall into five ten-year periods, from 1900- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     1910 and so on.... But it falls into four ten-year 
     <lb/>
     periods plus one period of seven years. When I 
     <lb/>
     was born in 1900 the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland spent that year in the public business 
     <lb/>
     of the country $1.85 million. In that same year 
     <lb/>
     the export of all the goods exported from New<lb break="no"/>foundland amounted to $8.5 million, in other 
     <lb/>
     words, 21% of the value of all the goods exported 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland went to the government for 
     <lb/>
     the public expense. And the taxation that the 
     <lb/>
     government placed on the people that year was 
     <lb/>
     $8.50 a head, on 220,000 people....

            <p>
     Now, sir, I bring you down to 1910. For the 
     <lb/>
     first ten years that I was alive in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Newfoundland took from the 
     <lb/>
     people a total of $24 million in taxes and spent 


            <pb n="604" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0604.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">604</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">October 1947</fw>
           

     that money on the public services.... But in those 
     <lb/>
     same ten years, the total value of all exports came 
     <lb/>
     to $107 million; so that the government took $24 
     <lb/>
     million or 22% and for the first ten years of this 
     <lb/>
     century, the average taxation put on our people 
     <lb/>
     was $10.50 a head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now take the next ten years which would 
     <lb/>
     bring us down to 1919. The total value of all the 
     <lb/>
     goods exported from Newfoundland was $189 
     <lb/>
     million. And out of $189 million the government 
     <lb/>
     took $42.5 million or 23%. The percentage went 
     <lb/>
     up a little. But here's what happened. For the first 
     <lb/>
     ten years of the present century, the taxation on 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland was an average of 
     <lb/>
     $10.50 a head. But for the next ten years, from 
     <lb/>
     1910-1919, it was $17 per head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now come on to the next ten years, 1920- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     1929, and in those ten years the total value of all 
     <lb/>
     the goods exported from Newfoundland was an 
     <lb/>
     amount of $263 million. And out of that the 
     <lb/>
     government took in taxes $108 million or 41%, 
     <lb/>
     and the total taxation on the people was $39 a 
     <lb/>
     head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now when you come to 1930-1939, what you 
     <lb/>
     find is this, that the total value of all the goods 
     <lb/>
     exported from Newfoundland was $293 million; 
     <lb/>
     and that the Government of Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     those ten years took $121 million from the people 
     <lb/>
     in taxation, or 43%. In those ten years the taxation 
     <lb/>
     on our people was $41 per head.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, when you begin at 1940 you can 
     <lb/>
     only come down to 1947; and in those eight years 
     <lb/>
     we find that the total value of all goods exported 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland in the eight years 1940 to 
     <lb/>
     1947, to the end of the fiscal year in March, was 
     <lb/>
     $359 million....

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As I was saying, sir, in the last 
     <lb/>
     eight years of our country's history, the total 
     <lb/>
     value of the goods exported from Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     was $359 million, and in those years the govern<lb break="no"/>ment took from us in taxes $169 million, or 46%. 
     <lb/>
     Let us look just at the last three years. In 1945, 
     <lb/>
     the total value of all the goods exported from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was nearly $49 million, and the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure by the government — taxes taken 
     <lb/>
     from us — was $22.75 million or 46% of our total 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, our total exports. Now in 1946, the 
     <lb/>
     value of our exports was $61 million. It went up 
     <lb/>
     a bit. But the government that year look or spent 
     <lb/>
     $29 million or 48%. And in 1947, the total value 
     <lb/>
     of our exports was $62 million, thus the govern<lb break="no"/>ment took $37 million or 60%. If you average it, 
     <lb/>
     for the last three years, you will find that over 
     <lb/>
     51% of the total value of all the goods exported 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland was taken by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and spent on public service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That is not correct. The ordinary 
     <lb/>
     expenditure wasn't counted. You mustn't forget 
     <lb/>
     that there was about $50 million each year on 
     <lb/>
     capital account, and that's leaving the impression 
     <lb/>
     that the ordinary expenditure of the country is 
     <lb/>
     $37 million. That is not true. The ordinary expen<lb break="no"/>diture of the country last year was around $26 
     <lb/>
     million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I appreciate the point that 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin has made. I understand why he has 
     <lb/>
     made it, and if it comes to this, that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should separate their expenditures under 
     <lb/>
     ordinary and extraordinary, capital and 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction, I agree with Major Cashin com<lb break="no"/>pletely. But he will not deny that in the fiscal year 
     <lb/>
     1947, the Government of Newfoundland did 
     <lb/>
     spend $37,141,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, and $13 million of that was 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But whatever it was. the fact 
     <lb/>
     remains that in 1947 the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland spent $37,141,000 and in the year 
     <lb/>
     before they spent $29,087,000 and in the year 
     <lb/>
     before $22,739,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, what did they spend the year 
     <lb/>
     before? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The year before, it was 
     <lb/>
     $20,965,087. And the year before that, $14 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, ...

            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They spent much more than $14 
     <lb/>million in 42.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, Mr. Chairman, I give the 
     <lb/>
     figure. If Major Cashin disagrees he can produce 
     <lb/>
     the figures to show that I am wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The figures are in the Finance

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The figures are in the Finance

     Report. I have it open at the very page and I was 
     <lb/>
     going to ask Major Cashin before this debate 
     <lb/>
     finishes to justify these figures. Because accord<lb break="no"/>ing to my understanding, the figures beginning in 
     <lb/>
     the year l919-20 are wrong from there down to 
     <lb/>
     the present year. And I was going to ask Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin to explain where he got these figures. But 
     <lb/>
     if he doesn't mind, we'll let that stand over for 
     <lb/>
     the present moment. I say that the figures I have 
     <lb/>
     here are correct and if they can be...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> What year, you say, 41-42?

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The reply is simply this. I have

     figures showing the revenue and expenditure of

     the government every year from 1855 down to 
     <lb/>

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> And your reply to that is? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And my reply is, table the official 
     <lb/>documents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> But I understood him to say that 
     <lb/>
     there were no official... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I doubt if there's any official docu<lb break="no"/>ments prior to 1919 regarding the Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General's report, because I tried to get them and 
     <lb/>
     I couldn't. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Do you make the positive state<lb break="no"/>ment they are not in existence, Major? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They may be in existence, but they 
     <lb/>
     weren't obtainable to the Finance Committee. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....May I ask you Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood, please, have your figures been ob<lb break="no"/>tained from official sources, or are they merely 
     <lb/>figures and statistics prepared by yourself? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The answer in reply, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, is simply this. As you may know, 1 have 
     <lb/>
     spent possibly the last 20 years of my life doing 
     <lb/>
     research, historical research in this country. If I 
     <lb/>
     had been a member of the Finance Committee I 
     <lb/>
     could have told the committee where to get all 
     <lb/>
     kinds of figures and statistics about New<lb break="no"/>foundland... These I got, number one, in the 
     <lb/>
     public library, which is a government institution; 
     <lb/>
     number two, in the vault of the Home Affairs 
     <lb/>
     department; number three, in the Department of 
     <lb/>
     Finance and Customs where I have spent many 
     <lb/>
     days in the last ten or twelve months; number 
     <lb/>
     four, in my own personal library; number five, in 
     <lb/>
     the files of the newspapers which are on file 
     <lb/>
     running back for 100 years. It is possible, not very 
     <lb/>
     likely, that in copying them off I could be wrong. 
     <lb/>
     But I hope to show before this debate is over, that 
     <lb/>
     the figures in the Finance Report on page 112 or 
     <lb/>
     113 showing from 1897-98 down to 1945-46 
     <lb/>
     revenue and expenditure, that from the year 
     <lb/>
     1919-20 these are not correctly entered there. 
     <lb/>
     There's something left out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> May I anticipate you by asking, 
     <lb/>
     is it your intention to address specifically any 
     <lb/>
     questions to Major Cashin as chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee based upon the figures which 
     <lb/>
     you are now quoting? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, it was my intention. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well in that case Major, may I 
     <lb/>suggest that you'll have the opportunity.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Just one moment, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
     
     
    Mr. Smallwood made a statement a minute ago 
     <lb/>about the year 40-41 — what was the revenue and 


            <cb/>
         

     expenditure you said there? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have only the expenditure not 
     <lb/>revenue.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, what is the revenue?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have only the figures for ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, not revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, what is the expenditure?

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The expenditure 40-41 ... 
     <lb/>$14,534,237.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Here's the Auditor General's 
     <lb/>
     report, now we'll fix it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Before I look at it I'll tell you.... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> At this stage Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>may I direct your attention to page 113 of the 
     <lb/>Finance Report, which reads 1940-41 expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, $15,830,699. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, that's on page 113? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> 113, yes. Under the caption "ex<lb break="no"/>penditures". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Right, yes, that's what's there. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That's what's there. That is cor<lb break="no"/>rect. Here it is in the Auditor General's report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If you like, before I go on with 
     <lb/>my own remarks, possibly this would be a good 
     <lb/>moment to clear up this mystery about these 
     <lb/>figures here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You just ask me the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right, I'll do that now. I 
     <lb/>
     have checked carefully the figures here from 
     <lb/>
     1897-98 on, expenditure. It was expenditure that 
     <lb/>
     I was concerned with not revenue. I find them 
     <lb/>
     quite correct from 1897-98 down to 1918-19. 
     <lb/>
     But, starting in 1919-20 and coming on 1 find a 
     <lb/>
     big discrepancy. And they do not agree, these 
     <lb/>
     figures in your report, starting with 1919-20, with 
     <lb/>
     any figures that are in any other reports, in the 
     <lb/>
     Amulree royal commission's report or... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Now we're coming to it... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right, we're coming to it if 
     <lb/>
     you like. I would like Major Cashin to tell us if 
     <lb/>
     the figures he has in his report beginning 1919-20 
     <lb/>
     for expenditure are complete figures showing the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland for each of those years... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that point 
     <lb/>
     came up. The figures of revenues and expendi<lb break="no"/>tures shown here, and I refer now particularly to 
     <lb/>
     expenditures, are expenditures on ordinary ac<lb break="no"/>count. They're not on capital account. and in the 
     <lb/>
     Amulree report, in order to make a rotten picture 
 

            <pb n="607" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0607.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">October 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">607</fw>
          

     they added our capital expenditure into the ordi<lb break="no"/>nary expenditure. To prove my point that those 
     <lb/>
     figures are correct, we'll pick the total expendi<lb break="no"/>tures and total revenues for the 50 years ap<lb break="no"/>proximately down in this paper here. And I'd like 
     <lb/>
     the members of this house to notice. The total 
     <lb/>
     expenditures and total revenues — revenue 
     <lb/>
     $464,531,403, total expenditures $469....so, so. 
     <lb/>
     That shows a deficit there, doesn't it, of $5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. One would imagine therefore that our public 
     <lb/>
     debt today was only $5 million, whereas it's 
     <lb/>
     around $75 million. Consequently it goes to show 
     <lb/>
     that these other expenditures, which prior to the 
     <lb/>
     advent of Commission government were not in<lb break="no"/>cluded in ordinary expenditures, were included 
     <lb/>
     as capital account. Now, where did that other $70 
     <lb/>
     million go? Here's where it went. It didn't go to 
     <lb/>
     pay the ordinary running expenses of the country 
     <lb/>
     at all. We built a railway that has cost New<lb break="no"/>foundland over $45 million up to the present 
     <lb/>
     time. Since we took it over in 1923 it has cost us 
     <lb/>
     roughly $30 million. But prior to that New<lb break="no"/>foundland paid $15,000 a mile, if my memory 
     <lb/>
     serves me right. We built all our public buildings, 
     <lb/>
     all our lighthouses, a lot of schools around the 
     <lb/>
     country. We paid $45 million in the first war 
     <lb/>
     including interest up to the present time. And this 
     <lb/>
     one we spent $10-15 million. Now what does that 
     <lb/>
     mean? That means for 50 years that we operated 
     <lb/>
     this country practically on ordinary expenditure 
     <lb/>
     for nothing, and that those assets which we have 
     <lb/>
     to our credit — forget the war — today represent 
     <lb/>
     $36 million. I'll put it that way because, as I 
     <lb/>
     pointed out yesterday, if we took the $35-36 
     <lb/>
     million in cash we have at the present time, and 
     <lb/>
     devoted it towards the reduction of our whole 
     <lb/>
     debt, our net debt would be between about $36 
     <lb/>
     million in round figures. Now that's entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent. The Amulree report, yes it shows it, but it 
     <lb/>
     didn't show what was spent on capital and what 
     <lb/>
     was spent on ordinary. They piled it all on to 
     <lb/>
     ordinary expenditure. And I knew that's how Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood was evidently misled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wasn't misled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You knew it but you were trying to 
     <lb/>
     put it over... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh no... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh yes, yes. You were trying to put 
     <lb/>
     it across that the ordinary operating expenses of 
     <lb/>
     the country were more then they actually were. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh yes, by some millions of dollars. 
     <lb/>
     Whereas in actuality we've taken the year, what 
     <lb/>
     year? Any year you wish to pick out in the days 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Take 30-31. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We'll take 30-31. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $12,898,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, we spent much more money. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Surely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Certainly we did. But in ordinary 
     <lb/>
     operating of the country that's what we spent, 
     <lb/>
     $12,898,000. Now how did we spend the other 
     <lb/>
     money? It was on capital account. We re-railed 
     <lb/>
     part of the railway. We charged it up to capital 
     <lb/>
     account. We built roads charged up to capital 
     <lb/>
     account... If you get the Auditor General's report 
     <lb/>
     you'll find that he outlines what they actually 
     <lb/>
     spent on capital account. But this here shows just 
     <lb/>
     ordinary expenses, which is entirely different 
     <lb/>
     than capital expenditures. And when Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood points out we exported $45 million 
     <lb/>
     worth of fish or whatever it might be, and that we 
     <lb/>
     spent that year — they took out of the country 
     <lb/>
     probably $25 million and he says that's 50% of 
     <lb/>
     what we exported that we spent. He must remem<lb break="no"/>ber ordinary account and what we spent on capi<lb break="no"/>tal account. Take this year, we spent $13 million 
     <lb/>
     over this past year. How did we spend it? We 
     <lb/>
     don't buy ships every year. We don't have to 
     <lb/>
     replace a new ship that costs a million dollars 
     <lb/>
     again next year. That's a capital expenditure, and 
     <lb/>
     should be written off accordingly each year, in 
     <lb/>
     the course of 20 years. Now that's entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from the way people have been trying to 
     <lb/>
     convey the expense. And Amulree was the worse 
     <lb/>
     offender. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now we have Major Cashin's 
     <lb/>
     explanation. But I would ask him this question. 
     <lb/>
     Here is presented to the Convention the Report 
     <lb/>
     of the Finance Committee. And on page 112 it 
     <lb/>
     says, "We give herewith the annual revenues and 
     <lb/>
     expenditures of the country from the fiscal year 
     <lb/>
     1898 to the fiscal year 1946, both years in<lb break="no"/>clusive." Then it gives it, revenue and expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. Now what I want to ask Major Cashin is this, 
     <lb/>
     whatever you call it, whether it's ordinary, capi<lb break="no"/>tal, or whether it's reconstruction expenditure, 
     <lb/>
     whatever heading it falls under, it's all expendi<lb break="no"/>ture — I doubt if Major Cashin has in this table 
     <lb/>
     here any figures, I know they' re there throughout 
     <lb/>
     the report, sure, year by year, but in this table I 


            <pb n="608" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-17_Page_0608.jpg"/>

     doubt very much if he's put in the government's 
     <lb/>
     expenditures on the Newfoundland Railway. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They are in the report, yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In this table? On page 112? 
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, they become part of our deficit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Exactly, exactly. And yet 
     <lb/>Major Cashin, Mr. Chairman, is the very 
     <lb/>gentleman who, standing roughly where I'm 
     <lb/>standing now, was the first one — and I gave him 
     <lb/>credit for it — to demand that the Railway 
     <lb/>expenditures should be in the budget, should be 
     <lb/>in the public accounts and should be included in 
     <lb/>the government's expenditures. You, Major, ad<lb break="no"/>vocated that. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And he was perfectly right. 
     <lb/>
     They can't be in this table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They are in some table... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No sir, no, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
     What the report does is this. It reviews each year 
     <lb/>
     separately. It shows what the revenues and ex<lb break="no"/>penditures were for the Railway but, when it 
     <lb/>
     comes to telling us what the government spent 
     <lb/>
     altogether, year by year, from 1898 down to date, 
     <lb/>
     he leaves out the expenditures on the Railway. I 
     <lb/>
     was going to raise that very point. It's not a 
     <lb/>
     complete showing of the expenditure of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, turn to page 109. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right. Let's turn to 109. 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would like to point out that if 
     <lb/>the figures given on pages 112 and 113 are in<lb break="no"/>tended.... From your standpoint, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>they're incorrect. From Major Cashin's 
     <lb/>standpoint however, and I must sustain him on 
     <lb/>this point, a very fundamental distinction has to 
     <lb/>be drawn between ordinary current expenditure 
     <lb/>and capital expenditure. Capital expenditures, 
     <lb/>you pay out the money, and the assets in which 
     <lb/>the investment is made are there to be seen. They 
     <lb/>may be ships, railroads, hospitals, cottage hospi<lb break="no"/>tals, or public buildings and other public utilities, 
     <lb/>as opposed to ordinary current expenditure which 
     <lb/>simply means the cost of maintaining govern<lb break="no"/>ment over the period in question. It might very 
     <lb/>well be that the views of the members are recon<lb break="no"/>cilable, if and when the distinction between ordi<lb break="no"/>nary and capital expenditures is borne in mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I accept your ruling on that, Mr. 
     <lb/>Chairman, cheerfully and completely, and I ac<lb break="no"/>cept through you Major Cashin's point that a 


            <cb/>
          

     distinction must be drawn in government expen<lb break="no"/>ditures between ordinary and capital expend<lb break="no"/>ture, or reconstruction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Very definitely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I accept that. But, sir, when on 
     <lb/>
     page 112 of the Financial Report... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I said, turn to page 109. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right, you were back. Just 
     <lb/>
     let me finish my statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Go ahead. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> On page 112, there's a great 
     <lb/>
     table given showing for 50 years, somewhere 
     <lb/>
     around there, the annual revenues and expendi<lb break="no"/>tures of the country for each year, and we turn to 
     <lb/>
     the columns showing the expenditures, and dis<lb break="no"/>cover that from 1919-20 on, the ordinary expen<lb break="no"/>ditures on account of the Railway for example, 
     <lb/>
     are not included. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You say they're not included where 
     <lb/>
     ... hold on a minute... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Some years they are, some 
     <lb/>
     years they are not.... In some years you've in<lb break="no"/>cluded Railway expenditure and in some years 
     <lb/>
     you have not. I've got to check very carefully on 
     <lb/>
     these figures to see just what has happened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> May I suggest, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     that is the conclusion which may or may not be 
     <lb/>
     fair to the compilers of the report. I respectfully 
     <lb/>
     submit that before any conclusions are drawn on 
     <lb/>
     figures or anything else in the Report, the proper 
     <lb/>
     thing to do is to address the question first of all 
     <lb/>
     to the chairman of the Finance Committee, Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, get his reply and upon the strength of his 
     <lb/>
     reply, then of course you're quite naturally en<lb break="no"/>titled to predicate any opinion which in your 
     <lb/>
     judgement you are conscientiously to take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Page 109. He said we didn't show 
     <lb/>
     anything about the Railway. We find that the total 
     <lb/>
     cost of the Railway and each subsidiary, which 
     <lb/>
     includes the purchase price of $2 million from 
     <lb/>
     1920 to December 31, I946, amounts to 
     <lb/>
     $29,8l0,88l — approximately 50% of this 
     <lb/>
     amount was capital expenditure while the other 
     <lb/>
     50% represents deficits incurred in the operation 
     <lb/>
     of the entire system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, I have of course read that. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Incidentally Mr. Chairman, my 
     <lb/>friend opposite was the chairman compiling the 
     <lb/>Railway report. We got so little information out 
     <lb/>of it we had to go over it ourselves in order to try 
     <lb/>to fix it up.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid 
     <lb/>
     that if Major Cashin thinks that he put more 
     <lb/>
     information into his Finance Report than we had 
     <lb/>
     about the Railway in our Transporation Report, 
     <lb/>
     he'll have to check it all over again. There's a 
     <lb/>
     thousand times more information about the rail<lb break="no"/>way system in our report than there is in the 
     <lb/>
     Financial Report, and that's what you'd expect... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now order, gentlemen, 
     <lb/>please.... I suggest we proceed on the assumption 
     <lb/>that however bad or however good it may be, the 
     <lb/>members put their all into it, and to me it's a very 
     <lb/>imposing document, and I'll need to hear a great 
     <lb/>deal of argument before I can conclude other<lb break="no"/>wise. But I don't think it's proper at this juncture 
     <lb/>to make any comment upon the amount of work 
     <lb/>which may have put in by any of the individual 
     <lb/>members who were instrumental in composing or 
     <lb/>compiling the report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I agree completely with 
     <lb/>
     you and no one has praised the Financial Report 
     <lb/>
     more then I have done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I don't want to be half-accused of 
     <lb/>
     misrepresenting... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, no, there's not a case of... 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You're trying to put across there 
     <lb/>this evening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Gentlemen, please bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     that opinion is a matter of judgement upon which 
     <lb/>
     men might reasonably differ. A man can be quite 
     <lb/>
     erroneous but still honest in the expression of his 
     <lb/>
     opinion. Any opinion that any member draws 
     <lb/>
     from any document tabled in this house isn't 
     <lb/>
     necessarily dishonest because he may be er<lb break="no"/>roneous in the conclusions to which he arrives. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now at the point at which 
     <lb/>Major Cashin interrupted me I was trying to 
     <lb/>show the total expenditure of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>government from 1900 to 1947 each year. And I 
     <lb/>put in those figures everything they spent, 
     <lb/>whether it was on ordinary, special, reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion, capital or any other account, the total of it 
     <lb/>each year. And Major Cashin arose to point out 
     <lb/>that I was lumping them altogether, all the expen<lb break="no"/>ditures, and in reply to that I say yes, that's 
     <lb/>exactly what I have done — the total amount 
     <lb/>they've spent every year is the figure that I've got 
     <lb/>down.... Sir, you wouldn't remember, because it 
     <lb/>was before your time in this Convention, but I 
     <lb/>moved that the Convention desired to get the 
     <lb/>Government of Newfoundland to provide us with 


            <cb/>
        

     the services of an expert statistician-economist, 
     <lb/>
     so that we would have his services in compiling 
     <lb/>
     certain figures and statistics about our country's 
     <lb/>
     affairs. That motion unfortunately was defeated 
     <lb/>
     and we never got the statistician-economist.... If 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin should ever become Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance in Newfoundland, he can never be suc<lb break="no"/>cessful unless he has a certain kind of information 
     <lb/>
     which he hasn't got, which I haven't got, which 
     <lb/>
     nobody has, because its not to be got in New<lb break="no"/>foundland until the proper steps are taken to get 
     <lb/>
     it. And here it is. This present year we're told that 
     <lb/>
     the government is taking about $40 million from 
     <lb/>
     the people in taxes. Is that right? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, about $38 million, I suppose. 
     <lb/>
     
     
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $38 million or $40 million the 
     <lb/>government is taking from the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>people this year. Could Major Cashin tell us, or 
     <lb/>could anyone tell us, what proportion is that $40 
     <lb/>million of the total wealth produced in New<lb break="no"/>foundland in the year? Is it 10% of all the wealth 
     <lb/>produced forthe year? Is it 20%, 30%, or 40%?.... 
     <lb/>What proportion is that $40 million of the total 
     <lb/>wealth produced by the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>this year? He doesn't know. I don't know. No one 
     <lb/>knows. Every other country knows this. The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance, when he brings in his budget, can 
     <lb/>safely take say 12% of the total wealth produced 
     <lb/>in his country for the year in taxation, and that 
     <lb/>won't be too heavy a burden on the people of his 
     <lb/>country, or it may be 15%, but he knows exactly 
     <lb/>what percentage he can safely take in taxes out of 
     <lb/>the total wealth produced in a year. Now we 
     <lb/>haven't got that in Newfoundland because we 
     <lb/>don't know the value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Are you addressing a question 
     <lb/>
     to Major Cashin at this time, Mr. Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well sir, I'm afraid what I did 
     <lb/>was address the question to him and then I 
     <lb/>answered it for him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now, so that we know where we 
     <lb/>
     are. is your question this? That you're asking the 
     <lb/>
     chairman of the Finance Committee what propor<lb break="no"/>tion of the value of the productive economy of 
     <lb/>
     the country was exacted by the government in 
     <lb/>
     taxation over that same year? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, that's my question. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder would the Major answer that for me? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I'll give you an approximate idea. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, how approximate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I should imagine that the total earn<lb break="no"/>

     ing power of the country, or the export value to 
     <lb/>
     the country plus what was manufactured locally, 
     <lb/>
     plus our agriculture.... I should imagine we got 
     <lb/>
     about $120 million plus interest on our invest<lb break="no"/>ments. The people own in the country their life 
     <lb/>
     insurance and all that kind of thing — at least 
     <lb/>
     $120-150 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I'm sure that 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin will take this in the spirit in which 
     <lb/>
     I say it, when he tells me the value of the gross 
     <lb/>
     national product of Newfoundland, when he puts 
     <lb/>
     it at $120 million, he reminds me of the school 
     <lb/>
     teacher who ... caught one of the students reading 
     <lb/>
     a book when he should be listening. The teacher 
     <lb/>
     was lecturing on electricity, and he caught this 
     <lb/>
     boy and he said to him, "You weren't listening." 
     <lb/>
     "Yes, sir," he said, "I was." "Well," he said, "tell 
     <lb/>
     me what is electricity?" And the boy said "Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I know but I've forgotten." And the teacher 
     <lb/>
     said, "Well now, that's too bad — you're the only 
     <lb/>
     one in the world who knows what electricity is, 
     <lb/>
     and you've gone and forgotten it." And Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin is the only one in the world who knows 
     <lb/>
     the value...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now, Mr. Smallwood...

            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well sir, I won't be facetious 
     <lb/>
     with the Major any more. You're the Chairman 
     <lb/>
     and we have to obey you, and that I will do at all 
     <lb/>
     costs. Now to come back. I think it will be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that I haven't been very smooth in this 
     <lb/>
     because since I stood up, I don't know how many 
     <lb/>
     interruptions there have been, but I'm going to 
  

            <cb/>
         

     try to state my case anyhow if the chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee will permit me. Sir, what I have done 
     <lb/>
     is this. I have taken the value of our country's 
     <lb/>
     exports every year as being the nearest we've got 
     <lb/>
     to showing the value of the wealth production of 
     <lb/>
     the country. Now we haven't got accurate 
     <lb/>
     figures. I'm afraid we can't get them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In that case Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     may I suggest that members use approximate 
     <lb/>
     figures. If there are no official figures or statistics 
     <lb/>
     available, then I think one can't go wrong if he 
     <lb/>
     gives his figures as approximate figures, bearing 
     <lb/>
     in mind the fact that his figures are given to the 
     <lb/>
     best of his ability and to his knowledge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. Here is a country which 
     <lb/>
     exports just about everything it produces. We 
     <lb/>
     grow some vegetables and we produce other 
     <lb/>
     things for our own use that we don't export. But 
     <lb/>
     in the main, here is a country which exports to 
     <lb/>
     other markets most of what it produces. So what 
     <lb/>
     I've done is this. I've taken the value of the 
     <lb/>
     country's exports every year from 1900 to 1947 
     <lb/>
     as being the nearest we can get to a value of the 
     <lb/>
     country's wealth produced each year. I've taken 
     <lb/>
     the total expenditure of the government and com<lb break="no"/>pared it each year for the 47 years with the total 
     <lb/>
     value of all our exports. And I've reduced it to 
     <lb/>
     percentages to show what percentage of the total 
     <lb/>
     exports is taken by the government and spent for 
     <lb/>
     public purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your position is this Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood: on the one hand you take a national 
     <lb/>
     income which is after all the monetary measure 
     <lb/>
     of' the country's productive economy.... As 
     <lb/>
     against that, you've taken figures over the same 
     <lb/>
     period relating to the cost of government, and 
     <lb/>
     then in the light of that, you've completed your 
     <lb/>
     ideas as to the approximate cost of government 
     <lb/>
     over the period taken by you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, and I've reduced it to per 
     <lb/>
     capita percentages. Here's the story. Here's what 
     <lb/>
     it cost the people of Newfoundland to be 
     <lb/>
     governed — from 1900-1934 by responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, from 1934 to now by Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. Here is the cost of government per 
     <lb/>
     head, every man, every woman, every child, per 
     <lb/>
     head:

            <p>
     So that I have lived long enough, being born in 
     <lb/>
     1900, to see the cost of government in New<lb break="no"/>foundland rise from $8.50 a head of our popula<lb break="no"/>tion up to $113 a head last year. In the same 47 
     <lb/>
     years, I have lived to see the government expen<lb break="no"/>diture rise from 21% of the country's exports up 
     <lb/>
     to 60%. Although it's true that the figure of the 
     <lb/>
     value of our exports in any given year is not a tme 
     <lb/>
     value of the wealth produced in the country, 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless it does represent the money that 
     <lb/>
     comes back into Newfoundland. The only money 
     <lb/>
     that comes back into Newfoundland in any year, 
     <lb/>
     with exception of a few dollars, is the money for 
     <lb/>
     the fish, the iron ore, the paper and the pulp, and 
     <lb/>
     the pit props we ship out, and the oils and the 
     <lb/>
     other products of the country — our exports. And 
     <lb/>
     we have come to the day when 61% of the total 
     <lb/>
     value of all our country's exports is being taken 
     <lb/>
     by the Newfoundland government and spent on 
     <lb/>
     public services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I'm sorry the Major was absent for a 
     <lb/>
     couple of minutes while I was making that bit of 
     <lb/>
     a speech. I'd like him to have heard it. However, 
     <lb/>
     I guess he's heard it before. Let me take these four 
     <lb/>
     decades and describe the condition of the country 
     <lb/>
     for each of them. For the first ten years, from 
     <lb/>
     1900-09, the condition of Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     fair. I think Major Cashin would agree with that. 
     <lb/>
     In those ten years, the average taken from our 
     <lb/>
     exports by the government was 22%. The average 
     <lb/>
     taken from the people was $10.50 a head. Our 
   

            <cb/>
         

     condition was fair. Now let's take the next ten 
     <lb/>
     years, 1910-1919, what was our condition then? 
     <lb/>
     Fair plus, fair and better than fair. Why is it?.... 
     <lb/>
     Here's why. Number one, they built the branch 
     <lb/>
     railways; number two, they started Grand Falls, 
     <lb/>
     so there was construction work in two directions; 
     <lb/>
     number three, the war. Now these three things in 
     <lb/>
     that decade made the condition of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     a bit better than fair, fair plus. Now come down 
     <lb/>
     to the next ten years, from 1920-1929, what was 
     <lb/>
     the condition of Newfoundland? Bad, and then 
     <lb/>
     fair. We all remember it. I remember the rock 
     <lb/>
     sheds, I remember the unemployment, I remem<lb break="no"/>ber the riots, I remember the dole, I remember the 
     <lb/>
     hard times here in Newfoundland from 1920- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     1929. It began bad and it ended up fair. Why? 
     <lb/>
     Bad, because the post-war depression hit us in 
     <lb/>
     1920-21. 1922, 1923, Humber started, the con<lb break="no"/>struction out on the Humber, and they spent, if I 
     <lb/>
     remember rightly, $45 million on the project. 
     <lb/>
     Men worked, they poured out there from all pans 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. There was a tremendous 
     <lb/>
     change and turnover of men, thousands got jobs 
     <lb/>
     out on the Humber. So it began to be fair. Then 
     <lb/>
     the Buchans mine started — and that made those 
     <lb/>
     ten years not so bad — began bad but ended fair. 
     <lb/>
     Now we take the next ten years, 1930-1939, what 
     <lb/>
     have you got, the worst period in the whole 
     <lb/>
     history of Newfoundland. And when I say that 
     <lb/>
     I'm not forgetting the years of "injun" meal and 
     <lb/>
     molasses. I'm not forgetting some of the hard 
     <lb/>
     times in the 1850s and 1860s and 1870s in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. But I still say that 1930- 1939 were the 
     <lb/>
     worst in the history of this country. Why? Of 
     <lb/>
     course the world depression, we all know that. 
     <lb/>
     But, I suggest to you, mainly because in those ten 
     <lb/>
     years there were no windfalls. Now what were 
     <lb/>
     the windfalls? From 1910-1919 we had three 
     <lb/>
     windfalls. The starting of Grand Falls, the start<lb break="no"/>ing of the branch railways, the starting of the war 
     <lb/>
     — these were the three windfalls that came to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland.... 1910-1919, three windfalls. 
     <lb/>
     1920-1929, two windfalls — the Humber and 
     <lb/>
     Buchans. In 1930-39, no windfalls and the worst 
     <lb/>
     times that Newfoundland has ever seen. But from 
     <lb/>
     1940-1947, a lot of windfalls. The war, the base 
     <lb/>
     construction which poured, what, $400 — 500 
     <lb/>
     million into Newfoundland, in all these military 
     <lb/>
     bases, Canadian and American and British — and 
     <lb/>
     increased prices for our fish. You could sell any<lb break="no"/>thing, the only trouble was to be a little fair to

     your customers, to parcel it out, give them all a 
     <lb/>
     little bit, try to keep them going. Now what I want 
     <lb/>
     to know is this... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Excuse me Mr. Smallwood, are 
     <lb/>
     you going to address some questions now? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well sir, it is a question, 
     <lb/>
     whether the chairman of the Finance Committee, 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin, cares or whether all the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention care or whether the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland care to answer it in their own 
     <lb/>
     minds; it's an oratorical question, if you like. To 
     <lb/>
     be satisfied in my own mind, what I want to know 
     <lb/>
     is this. From 1900-1947, there is the story of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. From 1947-2000, or to 1997, for 
     <lb/>
     the next 50 years, what are the prospects of more 
     <lb/>
     windfalls? Are there any more paper mills, any 
     <lb/>
     more Buchans mines? Are there any more branch 
     <lb/>
     railways that can be started? Or if not, must we 
     <lb/>
     wait for more world wars? Must the whole world 
     <lb/>
     be deluged in blood so that we may prosper? 
     <lb/>
     What windfalls may we fairly and honestly ex<lb break="no"/>pect in the next 47 years to make us equal our 
     <lb/>
     condition in the last 47 years? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood, I am reluctant<lb break="no"/>ly compelled to remind you that we're now dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the Financial Report tabled in the House. 
     <lb/>
     Prognostications as to the future economic poten<lb break="no"/>tialities of the country might properly arise out of 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report. As far as I'm concerned, 
     <lb/>
     there is no such report.... I must therefore request 
     <lb/>
     you to confine yourself to the report itself, rather 
     <lb/>
     then to go outside of it and ask questions which 
     <lb/>
     are not covered, or not intended to be covered, by 
     <lb/>
     the report. What the future holds for us is at this 
     <lb/>
     time, not a proper matter for comment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will abide by your ruling 
     <lb/>
     there, sir. I would like to point out, a propos of 
     <lb/>
     the finances of the country to date that in the 
     <lb/>
     time that I've been alive, our population in New<lb break="no"/>foundland has increased to be half as much again 
     <lb/>
     as it was the day I was born. It's increased 50%. 
     <lb/>
     But in the same 47 years, our exports have in<lb break="no"/>creased six times.... But, and here's the but, the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of the Newfoundland government is 
     <lb/>
     now 19 times greater then it was the year I was 
     <lb/>
     born. Let me repeat that. Our population has 
     <lb/>
     increased half as much or more as it was when I 
     <lb/>
     was born. Our exports have increased six times. 
     <lb/>
     But our government, our government is taking 19 
     <lb/>
     times as much from us in taxation as they took 
     <lb/>
     from us 47 years ago. Now what I'm going to 


            <cb/>
       

     suggest therefore is this: that we can't stand it. 
     <lb/>
     They're taking too much from us. In the last three 
     <lb/>
     years, they've taken over 51%, over half the 
     <lb/>
     value of all our exports. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Is that opinion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It's opinion, sir, yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ... is that opinion predicated 
     <lb/>
     upon the contents of the report itself? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, indeed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is predicated upon the report? 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Indeed it is, sir. It's predicated 
     <lb/>upon the figures and facts contained in the 
     <lb/>Finance Report. I have summarised the statistics 
     <lb/>given in the report and drawn from them a deduc<lb break="no"/>tion. I've made an interpretation of them. That 
     <lb/>Newfoundland has now come to the point where 
     <lb/>she must either reduce expenditure or she must 
     <lb/>increase the value of her exports; that today 
     <lb/>government expenditure is eating up too much of 
     <lb/>the value of what we produce. That today in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland the government is too heavy a 
     <lb/>burden on us. We can't carry it. And either they 
     <lb/>must reduce the burden of taxation, or they must 
     <lb/>increase the value of our exports. Now can we do 
     <lb/>that? That is a matter that will come before us, as 
     <lb/>you have suggested, when the Economic Report 
     <lb/>is presented. I don't propose to try to guess or 
     <lb/>estimate what we can do in the future. But I do 
     <lb/>pose this problem now that faces us, that must be 
     <lb/>solved. Namely that Newfoundland is in what my 
     <lb/>friend Mr. Keough would call an extremely vul<lb break="no"/>nerable position when just this past year 60% of 
     <lb/>the total value of all our exports was taken by the 
     <lb/>government and spent on public services. We 
     <lb/>must reduce the cost of government or we must 
     <lb/>increase the value of our wealth production in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. Now sir, I don't know what the 
     <lb/>intentions are. All this talk... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Carry on to 6 o'clock anyhow. 
     <lb/>
     
     
         </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All that I have been saying this 
     <lb/>afternoon is nearly one point. And it's a long 
     <lb/>time, you may say. But in justice to me you'll 
     <lb/>admit that Major Cashin wished to clear up some 
     <lb/>of the observations I made as I went along. I have 
     <lb/>another point to make, which I would not like to 
     <lb/>make today and I was hoping that I would have 
     <lb/>an opportunity of making it, an extremely impor<lb break="no"/>tant point which might take as much as 20 <choice><sic>min<lb break="no"/>tues</sic><corr>minutes</corr></choice> or a half an hour to make. Sir, I haven't got 
     <lb/>my notes by me, and if I were to do it, we would 
     <lb/>be in the position where no one else would have

     an opportunity today to make any remarks about 
     <lb/>
     the report, and in case there is, sir, I was going to 
     <lb/>
     resume my seat and if no one else did speak to 
     <lb/>
     this report, I propose then to move the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the debate, and let's try to clean it up on 
     <lb/>
     Monday, if it's humanly possible. But there are 
     <lb/>
     important points yet to be made about this report 
     <lb/>
     before the Economic Report comes before us.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Would you make clear, Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, the point that you hope to make tomorrow, 
     <lb/>which should take 20 minutes; could he make it 
     <lb/>clearer, indicate to us what that point is? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I wouldn't mind indicat<lb break="no"/>ing the general nature of it. What I proposed 
     <lb/>
     doing was this: to take the period from 1920 to 
     <lb/>
     1934 and deal only with the question of deficits 
     <lb/>
     and surpluses. But I wanted to make it clear, and 
     <lb/>
     if I'm not interrupted by Major Cashin on Mon<lb break="no"/>day, I would undertake to complete it in 15 or 20 
     <lb/>
     minutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would like to remind members 
     <lb/>
     that we're in committee and of course I'll bend 
     <lb/>
     over backwards, as I must, to relax the rules of 
     <lb/>
     debate. But I have to direct the attention of mem<lb break="no"/>bers to the purpose for which they were 
     <lb/>
     created... The language of the act is unmistaken<lb break="no"/>ly clear... The statute lays upon members the 
     <lb/>
     obligation to inquire into the changes that have 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the financial and economic situa<lb break="no"/>tion of the island since 1934 — since 1934.... 
     <lb/>
     There is a definitely described period. And that 
     <lb/>
     is why, Mr. Smallwood, in reply to Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     in View of the fact that you proposed the dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the period ... 20-24? 34? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I apologise sir, if I said that, 
     <lb/>
     what I meant was, from 1920 to date, to now. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Anything that you might have to 
     <lb/>say on the period from 1935 to 1947, has to be 
 

            <cb/>
         

     relevant and is clearly within the scope and ambit 
     <lb/>
     of the act. Any opinion expressed on the period 
     <lb/>
     anterior to 1935 is irrelevant save and except if it 
     <lb/>
     is calculated to enlighten us on any matters aris<lb break="no"/>ing from this period of 1935 up to 1947 which 
     <lb/>
     would otherwise remain ambiguous and in doubt. 
     <lb/>
     We can't sit in this chamber and discuss what 
     <lb/>
     happened in 1810 or 1762. There must be some 
     <lb/>
     limit beyond which we can go because if there is 
     <lb/>
     going to be undefined limits we're going to be 
     <lb/>
     here until judgement morning. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would it be your ruling that 
     <lb/>
     what we are permitted to do is discuss such 
     <lb/>
     periods before 1934 as it may be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     throw light on the period since 1934, and only so 
     <lb/>
     far as it will do that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> After serious consideration, not 
     <lb/>
     an opinion which is being expressed by the ex<lb break="no"/>igencies of the moment, it is my view that mem<lb break="no"/>bers should not concern themselves with the 
     <lb/>
     period of our financial and economic history 
     <lb/>
     prior to 1934. Now I'm going to give this section 
     <lb/>
     of the act the greatest possible latitude, save 
     <lb/>
     insofar as any discussion prior to that time is 
     <lb/>
     calculated to enlighten us on matters which have 
     <lb/>
     arisen since that time.

            <p>

     <lb/>
     on that point.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Motion is that the committee

     consider this Finance Report,¹ there is a matter 
     <lb/>
     which I would like to draw to your attention, and

     to the attention of the delegates; that is with

     the compilation of the Finance Report on Friday

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName>, consciously or unconsciously,

     would lead one to believe that myself and those

     associated with me practically cooked up the

     figures and, whilst he might not have meant it, at 
     <lb/>
     the same time it was conveyed to the outside

     public that such was the case. Consequently, Mr.

     <lb/>
     these things from outside, to call a special meet<lb break="no"/>ing of the Steering Committee this morning, and
