<!--<p>
     the Convention ready for the question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Before you put that — it is clearly 
     <lb/>
     understood, I take it, that such indication by any 
     <lb/>
     member, by telegram, letter or otherwise, will be 
     <lb/>
     available to the members and to Hansard or in 
     <lb/>
     some other manner? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....The opinions of all members 
     <lb/>
     will be recorded and the opinions of such mem<lb break="no"/>bers who express a preference will also be 
     <lb/>
     recorded. Therefore, if I receive from any mem<lb break="no"/>ber any expression of opinion on either or both 
     <lb/>
     of these two questions, by letter or by telegram, 
     <lb/>
     from and bearing the signatures of any such 
     <lb/>
     member, it will be my duty to see that his vote on 
     <lb/>
     either or both questions will be in the records of 
     <lb/>
     the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The motion carried] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> May I advance a little further along 
     <lb/>
     so that I can have it understood — I intend to 
     <lb/>
     communicate with Mr. Brown. I take it, when we 
     <lb/>
     finish this debate tomorrow, if the motion is 
     <lb/>
     carried there and then, the members will not have 
     <lb/>
     to express their preference? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is another point and I 
     <lb/>
     want to make this clear. If any member of the 
     <lb/>
     House has any objection to it, I want him to state 
     <lb/>
     it now. Suppose for argument's sake a poll is 
     <lb/>
     taken at 5 o'clock, and 30 minutes after the poll 
     <lb/>
     has been taken the letter or cable arrives from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown. I intend to record the views expressed by 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Brown whether or not the document contain<lb break="no"/>ing his expressions has reached me at the time the 
     <lb/>
     poll is taken.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I take it, the deadline would be the 
     <lb/>
     time the Drafting Committee had completed its 
     <lb/>
     report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is my view. Any time be<lb break="no"/>tween now and when it goes to the Drafting 
     <lb/>
     Committee, any letters or telegrams directed to 
     <lb/>
     me from any members, like Mr. Brown, who are 
     <lb/>
     unavoidably absent through illness or any other 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, I will cause their views to be be 
     <lb/>
     recorded the moment I receive the letter or cable, 
     <lb/>
     and the deadline can only be at the moment when 
     <lb/>
     you pass the matter over to the Drafting Commit<lb break="no"/>tee for finalisation, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> On that, would it not be passed over 
     <lb/>
     to the Drafting Committee after voting is taken? 
     <lb/>
     Would that allow much time to record his vote? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....As you know, it was agreed 
     <lb/>that Monday and Tuesday would be devoted to 
     <lb/>the final order now on the order paper and that 
     <lb/>means the matter would not go before the Draft<lb break="no"/>ing Committee before Wednesday morning. At 
     <lb/>all events, it is proposed to submit the draft to the 
     <lb/>Convention for ratification and adoption on 
     <lb/>Thursday. Any time up to next Thursday, before 
     <lb/>it comes up for ratification, anything I receive 
     <lb/>definitely will be recorded.

     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> Yesterday I moved the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the debate with the hope of getting 
     <lb/>
     precedence to the floor; since then I have been 
     <lb/>
     told that there are quite a few members who wish

     to speak on this motion and I may say that I 
     <lb/>
     propose to finish my address within 20 minutes.

            </p>

            <p>
     As the Convention fast draws to its long-ex<lb break="no"/>pected end, its conduct has indeed become com<lb break="no"/>mendable; so much so that one of my delegate 
     <lb/>
     friends yesterday called it the glad-handers club; 
     <lb/>
     and in speaking to the motion certain members 
     <lb/>
     have even waxed poetical. My respected and 
     <lb/>
     close personal friend, Mr. Hickman, at the con<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>
      
clusion of a very fine address a few days ago, 
     <lb/>
     invoked in his usual masterful way the poetical 
     <lb/>
     phraseology of our national ode. Mr. Vardy, my 
     <lb/>
     associate from Trinity North, content with noth<lb break="no"/>ing less than the original, wrote a poem which he 
     <lb/>
     quoted in support of his arguments, and seriously, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, our poet of the year, your friend 
     <lb/>
     and mine, delegate Ike Newell,<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> had better look 
     <lb/>
     to his laurels or Mr. Vardy with his free verse may 
     <lb/>
     supplant him — that verse was entirely free, I am 
     <lb/>
     sure, Mr. Vardy! 
     <lb/>

            <p>

     Newfoundland, the land we love, finds herself at 
     <lb/>
     the crossroads, a bit hesitant as she reads the 
     <lb/>
     signpost plainly marked, "A Date With Destiny", 
     <lb/>
     I too would become poetical and quote from a 
     <lb/>
     little poem which I have carried in my scrapbook 
     <lb/>
     for some years now. I do not know the author, sir, 
     <lb/>
     but it does seem timely and appropriate as New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders generally wait expectantly for the 
     <lb/>
     referendum day. It goes like this:<ref target="#fn_02">*</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be rather far-fetched, sir, to say that our 
     <lb/>
     date with tomorrow will be from there to forever, 
     <lb/>
     but certain it is that in the national referendum 
     <lb/>
     which is to be held next spring, we trust, the road 
     <lb/>
     we as Newfoundlanders take may determine to a 
     <lb/>
     great extent our way of life for years to come, and 
     <lb/>
     possibly the destiny of generations yet unborn. 
     <lb/>
     What of the future, then? Is the road ahead a clear 
     <lb/>
     one? Is it likely to lead to the uplands of happiness 
     <lb/>
     and prosperity, or is it still to be befogged and 
     <lb/>
     dimmed with hesitation and uncertainty? Does 
     <lb/>
     government play an important role in determin<lb break="no"/>ing our way of life? Or is it true that our pros<lb break="no"/>perity, our future place in the sun will be 
     <lb/>
     determined by economic factors beyond our con<lb break="no"/>trol? One delegate speaking a few days ago 
     <lb/>
     pleaded for a government that would provide 
     <lb/>
     those elusive peaks of attainment called 
     <lb/>
     economic security and political stability. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I very much doubt if any government 
     <lb/>
     in the world can provide such blessings, and 
     <lb/>
     although I am inclined to agree with that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman that there is a form of government that 
     <lb/>
     might go a long way toward such an attainment, 
     <lb/>
     yet in the main, the responsibility for our future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity as a people and for our stability of 
     <lb/>
     government will rest entirely with us. For 
     <lb/>
     whatever form of government we adopt, there 
     <lb/>
     will still be those strong westerlies dashing the 
     <lb/>
     cold Atlantic spray in the face of the industrious 
     <lb/>
     fisherman as his boat navigates the stormy waters 
     <lb/>
     of Cape Freels. There will still remain those long 
     <lb/>
     and weary nights as fearless schooner fishermen 
     <lb/>
     keep their watch and hope for daylight, as their 
     <lb/>
     ships plough up the coast to the far-flung har<lb break="no"/>bours of the Labrador. Yes, there will still be the 
     <lb/>
     elements to contend with, the vagaries of the 
     <lb/>
     weather to worry over for Mr. Fudge's hardwork<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
 

     ing farmer in the Humber valley. Forms of 
     <lb/>
     government cannot change this, yet good, wise 
     <lb/>
     government can and will help to a large extent in 
     <lb/>
     the alleviation of a great many of the vexing 
     <lb/>
     problems that now face our people. But we must 
     <lb/>
     not expect too much. And here I would quote the 
     <lb/>
     words of John Galsworthy, when he wrote: "His<lb break="no"/>tory tells us that the status quo is of all things the 
     <lb/>
     most liable to depart; the millennium of all things, 
     <lb/>
     the least likely to arrive." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I believe I am right in saying 
     <lb/>
     that there is not a man or woman of voting age in 
     <lb/>
     this country who does not believe in the concept 
     <lb/>
     of self-government. That almost legendary fig<lb break="no"/>ure, honest Abe Lincoln, talked of a government 
     <lb/>
     of the people, by the people and for the people. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe such a government never did exist. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe it is like Sir Thomas More's Utopia, a 
     <lb/>
     myth, a daydream, which for its author meant 
     <lb/>
     having his head cut off by order of an un<lb break="no"/>scrupulous monarch whose only philosophy was 
     <lb/>
     a blind belief in the divine right of kings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In addressing myself to this motion, I am 
     <lb/>
     placed in a rather awkward position. As a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this Convention, I ask myself what is 
     <lb/>
     expected of me at this juncture. A great-uncle of 
     <lb/>
     mine at the turn of the century contested a section 
     <lb/>
     of the district which I have the honour to repre<lb break="no"/>sent. Unfortunately he was defeated. Asked some 
     <lb/>
     years later what caused his defeat, he said his 
     <lb/>
     defeat was the result of his having the courage of 
     <lb/>
     his convictions. At the risk of suffering a like fate, 
     <lb/>
     should I at some future date decide to follow 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin's career as a politician, I am going 
     <lb/>
     to frankly state my convictions, although in order 
     <lb/>
     to be fair, I must first say that I support the idea 
     <lb/>
     of placing both forms on the ballot paper in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. I would explain here, sir, that I am 
     <lb/>
     merely supporting the putting of responsible and 
     <lb/>
     commission forms of government on the ballot; 
     <lb/>
     I cannot and will not recommend them. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, I want to make it unmistakably clear 
     <lb/>
     that in supporting them, I am not trying to place 
     <lb/>
     any restriction or limitation in the way of the 
     <lb/>
     people in their exercising a choice of a form of 
     <lb/>
     government not included in this resolution.

     the early stages of the debate in the autumn of 
     <lb/>
     1946, I said that if a referendum were to be held 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow I would not vote for a retention of 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government. In January 1948, I 
     <lb/>
     see no reason to change my opinion. As Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Keough said, Commission of Government may 
     <lb/>
     have brought system and method to the civil 
     <lb/>
     service; Commission of Government may have 
     <lb/>
     introduced many long-wanted reforms; Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government may have expanded our 
     <lb/>
     public health service. With that I entirely agree, 
     <lb/>
     but gentlemen, Commission of Government has 
     <lb/>
     outlived its usefulness, it has nothing to offer for 
     <lb/>
     the road ahead. It was a necessary expedient. But 
     <lb/>
     the measure of its performance in the past, under 
     <lb/>
     circumstances vastly different from what they 
     <lb/>
     will be tomorrow, can be no prediction of its 
     <lb/>
     achievement in the future. In fact, sir, the whole 
     <lb/>
     concept of such a form of government is wrong. 
     <lb/>
     Any form of government which is in itself the 
     <lb/>
     essence of naked power, and which shows scant 
     <lb/>
     respect for, and little concern with popular public 
     <lb/>
     opinion, cannot in my opinion be a good form of 
     <lb/>
     government — in short, it is a dictatorship. Let 
     <lb/>
     me illustrate, let me take you back to the northeast 
     <lb/>
     coast, where 15,000 people living between 
     <lb/>
     Gambo and Carmanville are isolated from 
     <lb/>
     December until April. Their economy is for the 
     <lb/>
     most part built on the fisheries. All supplies and 
     <lb/>
     local products are, of necessity, waterhauled. 
     <lb/>
     From time to time intelligent and progressive 
     <lb/>
     citizens have petitioned for a road system to link 
     <lb/>
     up those northern communities. Such a road sys<lb break="no"/>tem would naturally be a costly project and 
     <lb/>
     maybe not commercially profitable; but from an 
     <lb/>
     economic standpoint it might well lead to a wider 
     <lb/>
     diversification of the fisheries there; it might 
     <lb/>
     enable fishermen to rush their product to a 
     <lb/>
     centralised curing plant, and their salt product to 
     <lb/>
     a sheltered shipping point. It might well be a wise 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of public monies heretofore called 
     <lb/>
     'dole', but petitions of popular opinion on such 
     <lb/>
     matters are given scant attention. In more cases 
     <lb/>
     than one, high officials of government have little 
     <lb/>
     inside knowledge of the real wants of the people. 
     <lb/>
     But yet without stint or scruple that same govern<lb break="no"/>ment will expend many thousands of dollars on 
     <lb/>
     a macadamised Road De Luxe,<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> while fishermen 
     <lb/>
     and labourers in Bonavista Bay and Notre Dame 
     <lb/>
     Bay wallow in mud, and get pushed around with

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, our hard-working toilers want 
     <lb/>
     more than three square meals and a tight roof, and 
     <lb/>
     they deserve more, and I would repeat that they 
     <lb/>
     do not take very kindly to the policy of any 
     <lb/>
     member of this Convention or government that 
     <lb/>
     would put the Avalon first and the rest of the 
     <lb/>
     country afterwards. I see no earthly reason why 
     <lb/>
     we should retain the Commission government. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood said a few days ago that there are 
     <lb/>
     many who would vote for it. I do not follow that 
     <lb/>
     line of reasoning. Do they believe that Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government brought prosperity to New<lb break="no"/>foundland? Are they forgetting the lean years of 
     <lb/>
     six cents a day dole? Do they think Commission 
     <lb/>
     should be credited with the upsurge of prosperity 
     <lb/>
     created by the influx of scores of millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars of foreign capital into this country during 
     <lb/>
     the war years? Or would they credit the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government with world prosperity — a 
     <lb/>
     prosperity engineered by the warmongering of 
     <lb/>
     that misguided prophet called Hitler. Further<lb break="no"/>more, sir, in the event of our being financially 
     <lb/>
     unsound in the not too distant future, are the 
     <lb/>
     adherents of this form of government asking 
     <lb/>
     themselves now, do they expect the brave but 
     <lb/>
     impoverished mother country, now battling infla<lb break="no"/>tion with a fierce austerity programme, to come 
     <lb/>
     to our aid? The Englishman is a gallant fellow, 
     <lb/>
     but just now he is up to his neck with his own 
     <lb/>
     worries, and it is just plain folly to expect help 
     <lb/>
     from the imperial government should we fall 
     <lb/>
     upon lean times. It is just not good cricket and it 
     <lb/>
     is unreasonable. With no assurance of help, 
     <lb/>
     financial or otherwise, let us ask ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     "Should we retain Commission of Government?" 
     <lb/>
     The answer should be emphatically, "No." It 
     <lb/>
     would indeed be a grave mistake. Our date with 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow is going to be a long one, not just 
     <lb/>
     another temporary expedient. We must take the 
     <lb/>
     long-range view, for our choice may well be the 
     <lb/>
     government of a century. In summing up this 
     <lb/>
     phase of the motion, I repeat that I will not vote 
     <lb/>
     for Commission and I will not recommend Com<lb break="no"/>mission. It has outlived its usefulness and should 
     <lb/>
     go. I repeat again, I am unable to recommend it 
     <lb/>
     to my constituents or to Newfoundlanders generally. 
     <lb/>

     1933. After a span of a natural lifetime, heavily 
     <lb/>
     burdened with debt, its people impoverished, its 
     <lb/>
     government confused, the oldest colony of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire gave up self-autonomy. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     did not give up reluctantly. The erstwhile 
     <lb/>
     dominion found herself in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     receivers and little remained for her but to submit 
     <lb/>
     to the indignity of losing her suffrage and becom<lb break="no"/>ing the administrative agency of a country 2,000 
     <lb/>
     miles away. May I review briefly some of the 
     <lb/>
     factors that led up to that drama of 1933? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (1) Newfoundland had an export economy, and 
     <lb/>
     there was then a world depression. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) Newfoundland was dependent on the 
     <lb/>
     economy of countries thousands of miles away. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>(3) Newfoundland had no internal market for her 
     <lb/>products; moreover, she had to import even the 
     <lb/>everyday commodities of life from abroad. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (4) Newfoundland's chief industry, the fisheries, 
     <lb/>
     was replete with the vagaries and uncertainties 
     <lb/>
     that, for want of a better name, must be called in 
     <lb/>
     this country acts of God. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (5) Newfoundland never could raise any sub<lb break="no"/>stantial internal loans; thus her debt for the 
     <lb/>
     greatest part was external. In other words, her 
     <lb/>
     financiers were investors who wanted their 
     <lb/>
     pound of flesh, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (6) With 6,000 miles of coastline and more than 
     <lb/>
     1,300 settlements, she was burdened with a cost 
     <lb/>
     of government that, to say the least, was exces<lb break="no"/>sive; or as someone aptly put it, she carried the 
     <lb/>
     trappings of an elephant on the back of a mouse. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>(7) Responsible government did not always 
     <lb/>adopt policies that were conducive to prosperity 
     <lb/>and the public weal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I hold that economically and 
     <lb/>
     geographically, the conditions that led up to the 
     <lb/>
     1933 drama are not now substantially different. 
     <lb/>
     We are for the moment enjoying only a tem<lb break="no"/>porary prosperity, the impact of a war boom, and 
     <lb/>
     a recession must inevitably come. Already there 
     <lb/>
     are clouds on the horizon, and it may well be that 
     <lb/>
     in the not far distant future, our then finance 
     <lb/>
     minister will be off and away to ring the doorbell 
     <lb/>
     of some foreign capitalist, tipping his hat, with, 
     <lb/>
     "I would like a loan if you do not mind!" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gentlemen, I am not a pessimist. I believe in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, in her great fisheries. I have faith 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundlanders; but faith is not enough. All 
     <lb/>
     the faith in the world will not enable that fisher<lb break="no"/>man who sailed in my schooner this past summer 
 

            <cb/>
    

     to pay his account and buy for a family of five out 
     <lb/>
     of the $300 seasonal earnings that was his in 
     <lb/>
     1947. All the faith in the world will not give him 
     <lb/>
     a position when there is no work to be had. Yes, 
     <lb/>
     that family allowance would give him a lot of 
     <lb/>
     faith and greater hopes.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there is a destiny in store for our beloved 
     <lb/>
     island, a greater destiny than some of us perhaps 
     <lb/>
     realise, a destiny that will be of our own making, 
     <lb/>
     if we as a people choose wisely and well. Yes, sir, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has a date with tomorrow; and in 
     <lb/>
     concluding I would repeat with some minor alter<lb break="no"/>ations, and with an apology to the immortal poet, 
     <lb/>
     a quotation from Longfellow's "Ship of State": 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Thou too sail on, O Ship of State, 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>Thy countrymen, with all their fears,

     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I support wholeheartedly the idea 
     <lb/>
     of putting both forms on the ballot paper, but I 
     <lb/>
     cannot support the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> It is not my intention to detain this 
     <lb/>
     Convention at any length this afternoon, and I rise 
     <lb/>
     purely for the purpose of making my position 
     <lb/>
     upon this resolution perfectly clear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After a somewhat hectic and not altogether 
     <lb/>
     creditable period of existence comprising some 
     <lb/>
     16 months, we have reached the final and most 
     <lb/>
     important stage in the life of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     Within the next few days we shall decide what 
     <lb/>
     forms of government we shall recommend to the 
     <lb/>
     British government to be submitted to our people 
     <lb/>
     at a referendum. The first of two resolutions upon 
     <lb/>
     this subject is before us now and, if I am to judge 
     <lb/>
     by many of the speeches made upon the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion thus far — and indeed by the resolution itself 
     <lb/>
     — the conviction is forced upon me that the 
     <lb/>
     intention wilfully to ignore our plain duty as set 
     <lb/>
     out in the terms of reference is as strong as ever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Even before the Convention election in 1946, 
     <lb/>
     at which we were sent here to discuss the matters 
     <lb/>
     set out in the Convention Act, I made it quite clear 
     <lb/>
     to this country that I regarded the Convention as 
     <lb/>
     a completely non-political body — non-political 
     <lb/>
     in the party sense, at any rate. Of course we had 


            <pb n="1312" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1312.jpg"/>

     to deal with political matters, but obviously and 
     <lb/>
     clearly and beyond all doubt, it was outside our 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction to deal with them as partisans. It was 
     <lb/>
     not our business to advocate or oppose any form 
     <lb/>
     of government. Our duty, the whole purpose of 
     <lb/>
     our existence was simple and plain. It was to 
     <lb/>
     recommend to the British government forms of 
     <lb/>
     government to be submitted to the people at a 
     <lb/>
     referendum. Nothing more and nothing less. Ob<lb break="no"/>viously that task was to select and recommend 
     <lb/>
     such forms of government as might be suitable to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country. It was the British 
     <lb/>
     government's inability to carry out this task that 
     <lb/>
     brought this Convention into existence. We were 
     <lb/>
     to do what they, 2,000 miles away, could not do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Because of our closer associations with, and 
     <lb/>
     presumably greater knowledge of our own 
     <lb/>
     people — and remember care was taken to see 
     <lb/>
     that all sections of the country were represented 
     <lb/>
     — because of these associations, we should be 
     <lb/>
     able to judge more clearly not what the people 
     <lb/>
     actually wanted — that was for them to say — 
     <lb/>
     but what they <hi rendition="simple:italic">might</hi> want, what might be suitable 
     <lb/>
     to them. Our own personal predilections and 
     <lb/>
     prejudices, our own party loyalties and an<lb break="no"/>tagonisms, our own political beliefs and faiths 
     <lb/>
     were all entirely outside the scope of that purpose 
     <lb/>
     and should never have been pemtitted to enter in. 
     <lb/>
     Indeed, if we had adhered strictly to our plain 
     <lb/>
     duty, we would have completed our task, made 
     <lb/>
     our recommendations, and up to the dissolution 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention not one Newfoundlander need 
     <lb/>
     have known what particular form of government 
     <lb/>
     was favoured by any individual member of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. We are not here to express our 
     <lb/>
     political views or to advocate any form of 
     <lb/>
     government, but simply to study calmly, not as 
     <lb/>
     party hacks, what in our opinion might be 
     <lb/>
     suitable to the people of Newfoundland, and to 
     <lb/>
     recommend to the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom that the people of Newfoundland be 
     <lb/>
     given an opportunity to say which form might be 
     <lb/>
     suitable to them. They, the people, would choose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Unfortunately it became plain from the outset 
     <lb/>
     that the Convention was to be the scene of a 
     <lb/>
     struggle of ideologies instead of one concerned 
     <lb/>
     for the wishes of the people, a political bat<lb break="no"/>tleground instead of a forum of calm investiga<lb break="no"/>tion. Indeed, at one stage of the proceedings there 
     <lb/>
     were plain indications that would shut out all but 
     <lb/>
     one form of government, do away with the 


            <cb/>
        

     referendum altogether; and it is fortunate indeed 
     <lb/>
     that the British government was far-sighted 
     <lb/>
     enough to retain the last word in their own hands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I come to this resolution. The cloven 
     <lb/>
     hoof of partisanship is apparent in its very word<lb break="no"/>ing. It does not recommend that Commission 
     <lb/>
     government and responsible government or 
     <lb/>
     either of them be submitted to the people — I 
     <lb/>
     repeat, it does not recommend that either Com<lb break="no"/>mission or responsible government be submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the people. What it does do is to set these two 
     <lb/>
     forms in a class by themselves, and it asks the 
     <lb/>
     people to declare their preference as between the 
     <lb/>
     two. If it passes, and I am quite sure it will, 
     <lb/>
     because it has the support of the responsible 
     <lb/>
     government group which constitutes two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention, if it passes it is plain that any 
     <lb/>
     other form of government is excluded. I want to 
     <lb/>
     repeat that, sir. If this resolution passes in its 
     <lb/>
     present form it is plain that any other form of 
     <lb/>
     government is excluded. If I vote for this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion I cannot consistently vote for a resolution to 
     <lb/>
     place any other form of government upon the 
     <lb/>
     ballot paper, for I have already chosen to demand 
     <lb/>
     that the people shall make a choice between these 
     <lb/>
     two, and I can't now consistently add a third. I 
     <lb/>
     have asked that there be a showdown between 
     <lb/>
     these two forms of government, and a third and 
     <lb/>
     a fourth form of government has no place in that 
     <lb/>
     showdown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Assuming that the resolution itself has passed, 
     <lb/>
     and that Mr. Smallwood's resolution to place the 
     <lb/>
     question of confederation upon the ballot paper 
     <lb/>
     also passes, and that some other member of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention proposes a resolution that repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government be also placed upon the 
     <lb/>
     ballot paper and that passes, now what position 
     <lb/>
     are we in? Isn't it an absurdity? The first thing 
     <lb/>
     that we recommend is that we have a showdown 
     <lb/>
     between responsible government and Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government, and the winner of that duel is 
     <lb/>
     then to take up the cudgels with the other two. 
     <lb/>
     Obviously the position is an absurd one, and no 
     <lb/>
     man who votes for this resolution can, in consis<lb break="no"/>tency, vote to place any other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the ballot paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, I would point out that our duty is to 
     <lb/>
     recommend forms of government to be submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the people. Nowhere in the Convention Act do 
     <lb/>
     I find anything authorising us to make recom<lb break="no"/>mendations to keep any form of government off 


            <pb n="1313" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1313.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1313</fw>
          

     the ballot paper, and this resolution is clearly in 
     <lb/>
     that category. It is obviously restricted. You can 
     <lb/>
     only have two in an alternative, and this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion is alternative in its character. "Choose ye", 
     <lb/>
     this resolution says, "between this form and that 
     <lb/>
     form." To read it in any other way would be, of 
     <lb/>
     course, completely senseless. Is it not an at<lb break="no"/>tempted interference with the prerogative of the 
     <lb/>
     British government to determine what shall and 
     <lb/>
     what shall not be put on the ballot paper? Ob<lb break="no"/>viously if there is to be a duel, a showdown 
     <lb/>
     between two forms, that is a recommendation that 
     <lb/>
     no others be submitted. It is only within the power 
     <lb/>
     of the British government to say that no others 
     <lb/>
     shall be admitted. It is not within our province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I draw these matters, sir, to your attention. 
     <lb/>
     They are for your consideration. They are your 
     <lb/>
     responsibility and not mine. For my part I am here 
     <lb/>
     to vote for those forms which I think should be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the people, and to refuse to vote for 
     <lb/>
     those forms which I consider should not be so 
     <lb/>
     submitted; but I have no right whatever, under the 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act, to ask the British government to 
     <lb/>
     keep any form off the ballot paper, either directly 
     <lb/>
     or inferentially, and that is the effect of this 
     <lb/>
     resolution. As to the forms of government for 
     <lb/>
     which I shall vote, the form which I shall support 
     <lb/>
     at the referendum, that is an entirely different 
     <lb/>
     question. I am not bound to disclose my political 
     <lb/>
     views to this Convention, or to anybody unless I 
     <lb/>
     so desire, and I shall not do so this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have only to say in conclusion that I favour 
     <lb/>
     the submission of both Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and responsible government to the people, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not favour a resolution which attempts to 
     <lb/>
     exclude everything but these two; and that is what 
     <lb/>
     this resolution does attempt to do. I consider that 
     <lb/>
     it is framed, not to put the two forms it mentions 
     <lb/>
     upon the ballot paper, so much as it is to keep all 
     <lb/>
     others off. I shall vote against the resolution, sir. 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to this 
     <lb/>motion, so ably proposed by Mr. Gordon Higgins 
     <lb/>K.C., and also very admirably seconded by Mr. 
     <lb/>Reuben Vardy. I might say, sir, at the outset, that 
     <lb/>I agree wholeheartedly with this motion made 
     <lb/>and I shall attempt to prove in a few moments 
     <lb/>why I believe it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are one or two things I would like to 
     <lb/>
     mention, and the first is that I have been very 
     <lb/>
     greatly impressed by the spirit of the debate on 
     <lb/>
     this motion and secondly, very greatly impressed 
   

            <cb/>
     

     by the quality of the various speeches which have 
     <lb/>
     been delivered. There is just one thing I want to 
     <lb/>
     say in connection with the remarks made by my 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. Keough, yesterday I believe. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Keough apparently wishes to establish himself 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Newell as the two people, alone of all 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, whose wish and desire and hope 
     <lb/>
     is for three square meals a day. So far as I can 
     <lb/>
     gather they are convinced that the other 42 or 43 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention don't give a tinker's 
     <lb/>
     cuss as to what happens to the man on the bill of 
     <lb/>
     Cape St. George. Both Mr. Keough and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell are workers in the co-operative move<lb break="no"/>ment, and I therefore cannot understand either of 
     <lb/>
     them thinking that nobody else in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion cares for what they term the underdog. He 
     <lb/>
     said yesterday, and I quote as nearly as I can, that 
     <lb/>
     "If the fisherman or the poor farther or the poor 
     <lb/>
     whatnot in this country could obtain his three 
     <lb/>
     square meals a day, little did he worry as to the 
     <lb/>
     man at the seat of government getting away with 
     <lb/>
     a draft." Now that is a very false philosophy, and 
     <lb/>
     I am surprised that any man who is supposed to 
     <lb/>
     be a leader in a co-operative movement should 
     <lb/>
     ever express it. "If you can get your three square 
     <lb/>
     meals all right, don't worry about the fellows who 
     <lb/>
     are ruling over you." That is the opinion ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by Mr. Keough, and Mr. Keough is a 
     <lb/>
     friend of mine, and I sincerely hope he made a 
     <lb/>
     mistake and said something he did not intend to 
     <lb/>
     say. It is an absolutely false philosophy that you 
     <lb/>
     are going to make dumb, driven cattle of our 
     <lb/>
     people, or any other people. Is that all you want, 
     <lb/>
     to be fed and left alone like animals? I sincerely 
     <lb/>
     hope not, and I hope Mr. Keough and Mr. Newell 
     <lb/>
     will tell the people that in addition to being fed 
     <lb/>
     three square meals a day, and a mug-up at night, 
     <lb/>
     in addition to that they will teach our voters to 
     <lb/>
     think, and that they have to take an interest in the 
     <lb/>
     men that they send to rule over them. I hope they 
     <lb/>
     will not forget that... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I had planned and had set out to prove 
     <lb/>
     the very thing, the very statement which has just 
     <lb/>
     been read by my friend Mr. Bradley. Some of the 
     <lb/>
     things which Mr. Bradley said I do not agree with, 
     <lb/>
     but I shall endeavour to prove that Mr. Bradley is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely correct, and that is that once having 
     <lb/>
     recommended these two forms of government, to 
     <lb/>
     do any other would be <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi>, and I shall 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to prove it. First, I am going to speak 
     <lb/>
     from a text — not scripture — and I want to quote 
  

            <pb n="1314" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1314.jpg"/>

     one or two things, I am quoting from the editorial 
     <lb/>
     in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi> of 17 February, 1934. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I can't permit you to quote from 
     <lb/>a newspaper. You can summarise it, but you can't 
     <lb/>quote from the newspaper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Well, this is the way it goes, some<lb break="no"/>thing like this, since you won't allow me to look 
     <lb/>
     at the newspaper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is not a question of that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I have the newspaper here, very 
     <lb/>
     carefully preserved in mothballs. Some papers 
     <lb/>
     smell better if they are preserved in mothballs. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I simply stated that you can't 
     <lb/>quote from newspapers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> This is taken from the editorial, 
     <lb/>
     which says, "Newfoundland received from His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty a pledge which will be faithfully adhered 
     <lb/>
     to. It will receive back its constitution, and its 
     <lb/>
     place among the dominions when it proves itself 
     <lb/>
     equal to the responsibility which such status re<lb break="no"/>quires." I quote you that, and I shall refer to it 
     <lb/>
     again in a minute. I shall quote also from the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> of the British House of Commons, 2 
     <lb/>
     December, 1943. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Would you mind giving me the 
     <lb/>
     date again? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Certainly, 2 December, 1943. At 
     <lb/>
     that time the Undersecretary of State for the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions made this statement: "The arrange<lb break="no"/>ments made in 1933 included a pledge by His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government that as soon as the 
     <lb/>
     island's difficulties had been overcome and the 
     <lb/>
     country was again self-supporting responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, on request of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, would be restored. Our whole policy 
     <lb/>
     is governed by this understanding." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I quote you these two things, and I don't call 
     <lb/>
     it my scripture, but you might call it that if you 
     <lb/>
     wish. I quoted first from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi> 
     <lb/>
     to show the opinion which the people in this 
     <lb/>
     country must have held in February, 1934. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure that's quite plain to all of you. The editor was 
     <lb/>
     expressing the opinion not only of himself, but of 
     <lb/>
     the whole country, that Newfoundland had 
     <lb/>
     received a pledge from the British government 
     <lb/>
     that it would receive back its place amongst the 
     <lb/>
     dominions when it proved itself equal to the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility. And I quoted also Mr. Emrys- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Evans, Undersecretary of State for the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions in 1943. Evidently the opinion which 
     <lb/>
     our people had in 1934 was also the opinion held 
   

            <cb/>
  

     by the British government in 1943. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I wish to make another statement of my 
     <lb/>
     own, which I shall endeavour to prove...that if 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins had included in his motion any more 
     <lb/>
     forms than the two which he has or possibly one 
     <lb/>
     of them slightly amended, then he would have 
     <lb/>
     made the Convention Act <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> of the Let<lb break="no"/>ters Patent 1933-34. That is the statement which 
     <lb/>
     I hope to prove and that is why I said I agree 
     <lb/>
     wholeheartedly with Mr. Bradley when he made 
     <lb/>
     that statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Do I understand your position is 
     <lb/>
     that had the motion been enlarged on by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins by including another form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or an amended form of government, then 
     <lb/>
     the National Convention Act would be <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra 
     <lb/>
     vires</hi>? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, if he had included three forms, 
     <lb/>
     or four forms, then I say he would have made the 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> of the Letters Patent 
     <lb/>
     of 1933-34. Now I have the Consolidated 
     <lb/>
     Statutes. There are four volumes, but I have only 
     <lb/>
     brought in one, because I find there the Letters 
     <lb/>
     Patent from 1832 down to 1905 and 1917, includ<lb break="no"/>ing 1832, and 1855 and also 1876, and I take it 
     <lb/>
     that these Letters Patent were our constitution. I 
     <lb/>
     take it that around these Letters Patent are 
     <lb/>
     wrapped our very laws. These Letters Patent 
     <lb/>
     themselves gave our past legislators the authority 
     <lb/>
     to create these acts, every one of them. Not one 
     <lb/>
     of them could have been made unless there had 
     <lb/>
     been the Letters Patent to give the legislator 
     <lb/>
     authority, or the Governor authority to sign these 
     <lb/>
     acts. Whether you agree with me or not, that is 
     <lb/>
     definitely my opinion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, 1933. Up to that time the Letters 
     <lb/>
     Patent 1876 to 1905 were actually the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of this country. In 1934 these were 
     <lb/>
     suspended, and we had the Letters Patent 1934 in 
     <lb/>
     their place. I take it therefore as self-evident that 
     <lb/>
     all acts of law or otherwise that have been made 
     <lb/>
     by the Commission of Government since that 
     <lb/>
     time are made under and by virtue of the Letters 
     <lb/>
     Patent, 1934. I want, sir, your opinion on that. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is correct. I think the effect 
     <lb/>of the Letters Patent of 1934 was to suspend our 
     <lb/>free political institutions under the several acts to 
     <lb/>which you have drawn our attention. I think that's 
     <lb/>a very safe and inescapable conclusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> All our laws since are based on 
     <lb/>
     these Letters Patent? 
     <lb/>

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Definitely. 
     <lb/>
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Now I have here the Letters Patent 
     <lb/>of 1934, and I want to read a section. You see just 
     <lb/>what authority was given relative to this par<lb break="no"/>ticular matter, or at least what was intended by 
     <lb/>His Majesty King George V. He issued his Let<lb break="no"/>ters Patent to this country in 1934, and in them he 
     <lb/>made certain statements and if the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment does not live up to these Letters Patent, then 
     <lb/>even my loyalty will get a rude shaking:

            <p>This is the Amulree Report, sir. Let us see what

     Now, if that is not plain to everybody there 
     <lb/>
     must be something wrong with everybody, or 
     <lb/>
     with me. Therefore this was the position. I have

     quoted the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi>, I have quoted Mr.

     Emrys-Evans, I have quoted the Letters Patent,

     and I have quoted from Lord Amulree's report, 
     <lb/>
     and all these documents indicate just one thing, 
     <lb/>
     that our constitution was suspended in 1933, and 
     <lb/>
     a new form of government put into being until 
     <lb/>
     such time as this country again became self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting, and then, <hi rendition="simple:italic">and then</hi>, whenever thereafter

            <p>
     Mr. Emrys-Evans said something else on that

     same date, 3 December, 1943, and it is important,

     very important. He said this:

            <p>Their position is, therefore, "You have now Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, should you wish to

     <lb/>Mr. Higgins could have arranged his motion in 
     <lb/>such a way that we could put on the ballot paper 
     <lb/>responsible government or some amended form 
     <lb/>of Commission of Government, or he could do it

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I was just going to quote that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not wish to disturb your 
     <lb/>
     argument — you are giving me considerable to 
     <lb/>
     think about. What I would like to know is what 
     <lb/>
     connection there is with any legislation outside 
     <lb/>
     the Act — what jurisdiction it would have under 
     <lb/>
     section 3? How are forms of government limited 
     <lb/>
     within section 3, bearing in mind the expression 
     <lb/>
     employed is "to make recommendations on pos<lb break="no"/>sible forms of future government?" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You can have responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment back, or some measure of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> How do you delimit the expres<lb break="no"/>sion "possible forms" — why not 62 or 52? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It is not stated by law; it is in the 
     <lb/>
     Letters Patent.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. I will have to construe your 
     <lb/>
     remarks in the light of the act constituting the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention. What they do outside is of 
     <lb/>
     no concern to me. My only duty will be to con<lb break="no"/>cern myself with the interpretation of the Nation<lb break="no"/>al Convention Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. My point of 
     <lb/>
     order is that every word uttered by Mr. Hollett to 
     <lb/>
     this moment is <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> under the Act. He is not 
     <lb/>
     entitled to argue at all in this matter, except upon 
     <lb/>
     the basis of the National Convention Act which 
     <lb/>
     is the only authority we have in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I rule now as a matter of law, 
     <lb/>and from which any member is entitled to seek a 
     <lb/>declaratory judgement in the Supreme Court if he 
     <lb/>likes that this Convention has absolutely no right, 
     <lb/>no jurisdiction, no power to review the Letters 
     <lb/>Patent. The legislation passed by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government does not come within the 
     <lb/>purview of this Act. By accepting election and 
     <lb/>serving under the National Convention Act you 
     <lb/>are precluded and estopped by your conduct from 
     <lb/>raising anything outside the Act. What you are 
     <lb/>entitled to think or do as private citizens, quite 
     <lb/>obviously no limit can be placed upon that... I 
     <lb/>rule definitely that this Convention has absolute<lb break="no"/>ly no jurisdiction whatever to review in any 
     <lb/>sense, shape or form any legislation outside the 
     <lb/>scope of the National Convention Act; and it is 
     <lb/>outside the National Convention Act unless and 
   

            <cb/>
       

     until it is incorporated by reference into the Act. 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I hope someone is taking account of 
     <lb/>the time. When I set out to speak I told you I was 
     <lb/>about to try and prove that if Mr. Higgins' motion 
     <lb/>had contained any more than two forms of 
     <lb/>government, then the Convention Act would 
     <lb/>have been <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> to the Letters Patent, 1934. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is no connection between 
     <lb/>the two. I am not concerned with your interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion of the Letters Patent of 1934, I have nothing 
     <lb/>to do with it. I am concerned with the carrying 
     <lb/>out of the Convention Act. Anything else is com<lb break="no"/>pletely irrelevant to my purpose. You are not 
     <lb/>going to review the Letters Patent, and as far as I 
     <lb/>am concerned you are not going to review the 
     <lb/>conduct of the British Parliament. What you 
     <lb/>choose to do outside this chamber, there is no 
     <lb/>limit to your views, you are free to express them 
     <lb/>as a private citizen. I would remind members that 
     <lb/>there is a limit under section 3 to what you will 
     <lb/>review here... Anything else is completely ir<lb break="no"/>relevant, illegal, invalid and it is <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> to the 
     <lb/>section to which I refer.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am not asking for your interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion of the section.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not want to be cut off, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not want to be spoken to sarcastically when 
     <lb/>
     I am making a ruling on a point of law. Your only 
     <lb/>
     redress is to seek a declaratory judgement, and 
     <lb/>
     unless and until you obtain a declaratory judge<lb break="no"/>ment reversing my opinion, I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     brook any argument.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I cannot even mention the Letters

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I told you, sir, if you will bear with

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I rule that the point of order was

     well taken; you are dealing with matters that are

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I take it that it would be of concern 
     <lb/>
     to consider whether I, as a member of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, can do something which is repugnant to

     the law under which we live. The Convention Act

     is in existence by reason of, and only by reason

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As far as I am concerned the

     Letters Patent which were proclaimed effective 
     <lb/>
     February 1934, suspending our free political in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. That is the position in a nutshell. What 
     <lb/>
     I will be able to think and what I will be able to 
     <lb/>
     do after next Friday, and the very limited things 
     <lb/>
     I am permitted to do right now, I want to assure 
     <lb/>
     you will be two different propositions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What was the point of order? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The point of order was that your 
     <lb/>
     references to the Letters Patent 1934 was <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra 
     <lb/>
     vires</hi> to the National Convention Act. On that 
     <lb/>
     point I ruled that the point was well taken. We 
     <lb/>
     have no jurisdiction to deal with it at all. Whether 
     <lb/>
     there has been a breach of good faith by the 
     <lb/>
     imperial government is a matter upon which I am 
     <lb/>
     not permitted to make any comment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not make that statement. I 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that if Mr. Higgins had included 
     <lb/>
     another form in addition to the two, into that 
     <lb/>
     motion, I could not find myself for a moment 
     <lb/>
     voting for it, simply because if he had done so he 
     <lb/>
     would be doing something which was repugnant 
     <lb/>
     to the law under which we live, that is the Letters 
     <lb/>
     Patent of 1933. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not concerned with the 
     <lb/>
     Letters Patent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It is a question of the law under 
     <lb/>
     which we live.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have to construe the validity in 
     <lb/>
     the light of the Convention Act. I do not propose 
     <lb/>
     to concern myself with anything else. I am not on 
     <lb/>
     an originating summons reviewing any legisla<lb break="no"/>tion other than the National Convention Act, that 
     <lb/>
     is the only thing. The validity or otherwise of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins' motion in its present or other form has 
     <lb/>
     to be construed in that light, and it stands or falls 
     <lb/>
     in the light of the interpretation to be placed upon 
     <lb/>
     the National Convention Act and nothing else. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I think some people in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion are deliberately misunderstanding me. I am 
     <lb/>not trying to talk out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not know whether that 
     <lb/>
     remark is intended for me or not. The ruling 
     <lb/>
     which I gave is a matter to which I have given 
     <lb/>
     serious thought since I was in constitutional law, 
     <lb/>
     since 1933. Therefore I am going to discharge my 
     <lb/>
     duty, and members will have to discharge their 
     <lb/>
     duties under section 3 of the Act, whether they 
     <lb/>
     like it or not. It is too late now to say your are 
     <lb/>
     dissatisfied about it. I did not pass the Act. I take 
     <lb/>
     no responsibility for it. Your duties here and mine 
 

            <cb/>
        

     are regulated and determined by the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act, not the Amulree Report, not the 
     <lb/>
     Letters Patent, not anything else. Here it is. Here 
     <lb/>
     is what we are operating under. The validity or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise of what goes on here has to be deter<lb break="no"/>mined in the light of this Act alone, nothing else 
     <lb/>
     but.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I want you to understand I was not 
     <lb/>
     speaking contraminded to your judgement or 
     <lb/>
     decision. I shall say nothing more than I want to 
     <lb/>
     make my position clear. The position which I 
     <lb/>
     took in the first instance was that if Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     had included another form of government in ad<lb break="no"/>dition to the ones he has there in his motion, that 
     <lb/>
     I should have had to vote against it simply be<lb break="no"/>cause I think it would have been repugnant to the 
     <lb/>
     law of the land. I was endeavouring to do that, 
     <lb/>
     and in order to do that I am not allowed to quote 
     <lb/>
     the law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not like your terminology. 
     <lb/>
     You are misconstruing something I have said and 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to have it. My position is that you 
     <lb/>
     have no right to review the Letters Patent or any 
     <lb/>
     other piece of legislation under this Act. You can 
     <lb/>
     vote how you like and as you see fit, but you 
     <lb/>
     cannot come in here and attempt to put a con<lb break="no"/>struction on section 3 of the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     Act, under which Mr. Higgins' motion was 
     <lb/>
     tabled, by reference to legislation which has ab<lb break="no"/>solutely no bearing on the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I want you to understand me. As I 
     <lb/>
     said before, I have every respect and admiration 
     <lb/>
     for your judgement. I was about to say that I did 
     <lb/>
     refer to the National Convention Act in the first 
     <lb/>
     instance. The National Convention Act is an act 
     <lb/>
     enacted under our law, further than that I shall not 
     <lb/>
     go. How many minutes have I now, sir? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have taken some of your time 
     <lb/>
     which I felt I had to do to rule on the order of 
     <lb/>
     business before the Chair. I think under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances you ought to be allowed an extension 
     <lb/>
     of 15 minutes.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I want no extension of time. Section

     3 of the Convention Act says it shall be the duty

     recommendations to His Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     in Great Britain as to suitable forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment for Newfoundland. That is as near as I can 
     <lb/>
     go to it without referring to the Act. Now, sir, 
     <lb/>
     forms of government may mean very little, they 
     <lb/>
     may mean a whole lot. But I feel that a proper 
     <lb/>
     approach to this problem can best be made if we 
     <lb/>
     keep in our mind's eye a picture of the growth of 
     <lb/>
     political theory down through the past years, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly the picture as presented to us from 
     <lb/>
     the time of James I by such philosophic writers 
     <lb/>
     as Thomas Hobbes, Rousseau, Edmund Burke 
     <lb/>
     and John Stuart Mill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Time does not permit of a prolonged disserta<lb break="no"/>tion upon how men, by a slow process, arrived at 
     <lb/>
     the point of thinking in terms of democracy as we 
     <lb/>
     know it today. But briefly let us refresh our minds 
     <lb/>
     with regard to certain essential points. James I of 
     <lb/>
     England, like the Tudors before him, believed in 
     <lb/>
     the divine right of kings; in other words, the right 
     <lb/>
     to govern and regulate the actions of mankind 
     <lb/>
     was a right divinely bestowed. The Tudor 
     <lb/>
     monarchs claimed this divine right of supremacy 
     <lb/>
     over the lives of their fellow men, and so did 
     <lb/>
     James I, but unlike the previous kings he at<lb break="no"/>tempted to justify this claim to sovereignty by an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the will of God as revealed in the 
     <lb/>
     Scripture, and as manifested in the order of na<lb break="no"/>ture. The conclusions he arrives at are summed 
     <lb/>
     up at the end of his book, <hi rendition="simple:italic">The True Law of Free 
     <lb/>
     Monarchies</hi>, 1598. These are his words: "The 
     <lb/>
     King is overlord of the whole land. In the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment (which is nothing else but the Head Court 
     <lb/>
     of the King and his vassals) the laws are but 
     <lb/>
     craved by his subjects." You will remember how 
     <lb/>
     in trying to defend this philosophy one Stuart 
     <lb/>
     king lost his head, and another was deposed and 
     <lb/>
     banished. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The idea was growing amongst men that an 
     <lb/>
     elected parliament was more than a mere craver 
     <lb/>
     of laws — they were the cravers of the laws and 
     <lb/>
     framers of statutes as expressed by the will of the 
     <lb/>
     people. Thomas Hobbes in his book <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leviathan</hi> 
     <lb/>
     said — whereas James claimed sovereignty from 
     <lb/>
     God, Hobbes goes a step further towards present- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     day thinking. He saw clearly that the divine right 
     <lb/>
     doctrine was a bankrupt trouble-maker, but he 
     <lb/>
     saw equally clearly that some person or persons 
     <lb/>
     not only do claim sovereignty, but must do so if 
     <lb/>
     society is not to disintegrate. However, he argues, 
     <lb/>
     sovereign power must be absolute. There must be 


            <cb/>
    

     a common power vested in one man, or one 
     <lb/>
     assembly of men, by all the people. All men, he 
     <lb/>
     says, must submit their will to this absolute will 
     <lb/>
     of one man or assembly of men, and their judge<lb break="no"/>ment to his judgement. Although he favours ab<lb break="no"/>solute power, a mortal god so to speak, he admits 
     <lb/>
     that the people from whom such power comes 
     <lb/>
     ought to reserve certain rights in case the 
     <lb/>
     sovereign authority or government should over<lb break="no"/>reach itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     John Locke, who tried to defend the revolu<lb break="no"/>tion in England of 1688, rests his defence on the 
     <lb/>
     grounds that government depends upon the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the people. "There is", he says, "a contract 
     <lb/>
     between the government and the people. If the 
     <lb/>
     government violates this contract, revolution is 
     <lb/>
     justified." Both Locke and Rousseau — Locke in 
     <lb/>
     his book <hi rendition="simple:italic">Two Treatises of Government</hi> and Rous<lb break="no"/>seau in his <hi rendition="simple:italic">Social Contract</hi> — claimed that an 
     <lb/>
     ideal government for any people is one which 
     <lb/>
     permits self-government by the people, and that 
     <lb/>
     true self-government is the imposition by each 
     <lb/>
     individual on himself of rules and limitations 
     <lb/>
     demanded by him of all others. The evolution of 
     <lb/>
     self-government, however, was slow. It took the 
     <lb/>
     American Revolution of 1775 and the French 
     <lb/>
     Revolution of 1789, as well as the teachings of 
     <lb/>
     Tom Paine and Jeremy Bentham, to instil into 
     <lb/>
     men's minds the idea of liberal, social and par<lb break="no"/>liamentary reform. These latter writers argued 
     <lb/>
     that customs, laws, institutions and constitutions 
     <lb/>
     could be evaluated in terms of one standard only, 
     <lb/>
     and that is the greatest happiness of the greatest 
     <lb/>
     number. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Burke, who wrote about the same time, was 
     <lb/>
     most conservative, and held that the people 
     <lb/>
     should draw on the experience and wisdom of the 
     <lb/>
     most intelligent and most honest in the com<lb break="no"/>munity. It remained, however, for John Stuart 
     <lb/>
     Mill in 1861, in his considerations on repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government, to outline clearly that 
     <lb/>
     political theory which most men in democratic 
     <lb/>
     countries believe in today. The form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment for any country, he argues, is open in some 
     <lb/>
     degree to choice. By what test shall we make our 
     <lb/>
     choice? The test, says Mill, is twofold. First, to 
     <lb/>
     what extent does a proposed form of government 
     <lb/>
     make for the moral and intellectual development 
     <lb/>
     of the people? Secondly, to what extent does it 
     <lb/>
     make use of the moral and intellectual resources 
     <lb/>
     at its command? On these grounds, he says, the 


            <pb n="1319" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1319.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1319</fw>
        

     ideal form of government would be a complete 
     <lb/>
     democracy. But a complete democracy is not 
     <lb/>
     practicable. The device of government by elected 
     <lb/>
     representatives is, however. as close as a modern 
     <lb/>
     state can come to straight democracy. What, he 
     <lb/>
     says, are the distinctive characteristics of the 
     <lb/>
     form of government best fitted to promote the 
     <lb/>
     interest of any given people? One of the first 
     <lb/>
     conditions on which good government depends 
     <lb/>
     is found in the qualities of the human beings 
     <lb/>
     composing the society over which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is exercised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The first question in respect to any political 
     <lb/>
     institution is how far it tends to foster in the 
     <lb/>
     members of the community various desirable 
     <lb/>
     qualities, moral and intellectual. The government 
     <lb/>
     which does this the best has every likelihood of 
     <lb/>
     being the best in all other respects, since it is on 
     <lb/>
     these qualities, so far as they exist in the people, 
     <lb/>
     that all possibility of goodness in the practical 
     <lb/>
     operation of the government depends. The other 
     <lb/>
     constituent element of the merit of a government 
     <lb/>
     is the degree in which it is adapted to take ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of the amount of good qualities which 
     <lb/>
     may at any time exist, and make them instrumen<lb break="no"/>tal to the right purposes. The superiority of 
     <lb/>
     popular government rests upon two principles. 
     <lb/>
     The first is that the rights and interests of any 
     <lb/>
     person are only secure when the person interested 
     <lb/>
     is himself able and disposed to stand up for them. 
     <lb/>
     The second is that the general prosperity attains 
     <lb/>
     a greater height and is more widely enjoyed in 
     <lb/>
     proportion to the amount and varieties of the 
     <lb/>
     personal energies enlisted in promoting it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Human beings are only secure from evil at the 
     <lb/>
     hands of others in proportion as they have been 
     <lb/>
     and are self-protecting; and they only achieve a 
     <lb/>
     high degree of success in their struggle with 
     <lb/>
     nature in proportion as they are self-dependent, 
     <lb/>
     relying on what they themselves can do, either 
     <lb/>
     separately or in concert, rather than on what 
     <lb/>
     others do for them. "If", says Mill, "we consider 
     <lb/>
     the influence of a form of government upon char<lb break="no"/>acter, we shall find the superiority of popular 
     <lb/>
     government over every other still more divided 
     <lb/>
     and indisputable. The question really depends on 
     <lb/>
     another and more fundamental one, namely, 
     <lb/>
     which of two common types of character, for the 
     <lb/>
     general good of humanity, it is the most desirable 
     <lb/>
     should predominate, the active or the passive 
     <lb/>
     type; that which struggles against evils or that 
   

            <cb/>
        

     which endures them; that which bends to cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances or that which endeavours to make 
     <lb/>
     circumstances bend to itself." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, are we Newfoundlanders of the passive 
     <lb/>
     type of character? It would seem so. "For", as 
     <lb/>
     Mill says, "there can be no doubt that the passive 
     <lb/>
     type of character is favoured by the government 
     <lb/>
     of one or a few (such as seven men appointed by 
     <lb/>
     one man 2,000 miles away — Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government); whilst the active self-helping type 
     <lb/>
     by a government of the many." I am not in accord 
     <lb/>
     with the idea of government by commission, by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominions Office, andI think every man here 
     <lb/>
     will agree with me on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Irresponsible rulers (i.e. irresponsible to the 
     <lb/>
     people) need the quiescence of the ruled more 
     <lb/>
     than they need any activity but that which they 
     <lb/>
     can compel. The only government that can freely 
     <lb/>
     satisfy all exigencies of the social state is one in 
     <lb/>
     which the people participate. Any participation 
     <lb/>
     in government, even in the smallest function, is 
     <lb/>
     useful. And I want to indicate there, what part in 
     <lb/>
     the government today do our people share? What 
     <lb/>
     part do they take in the government of this 
     <lb/>
     country? None whatsoever! Absolutely none! 
     <lb/>
     We are all like the man to whom Mr. Keough 
     <lb/>
     referred yesterday: we do not care who sits in the 
     <lb/>
     seat of government as long as we get three square 
     <lb/>
     meals a day. Think that over and ask yourselves, 
     <lb/>
     do we or do we not want to be ruled by Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government? But participation by the 
     <lb/>
     people in government should everywhere he as 
     <lb/>
     great as the general degree of improvement in the 
     <lb/>
     community will allow; and nothing less can be 
     <lb/>
     more desirable than the admission of all the 
     <lb/>
     people to a share in the sovereign power of the 
     <lb/>
     state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In a commonwealth, however, says Mill, "ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding a single small town, [all cannot] par<lb break="no"/>ticipate personally in any but some minor 
     <lb/>
     portions of the public business, it follows that the 
     <lb/>
     ideal type of a perfect government must be rep<lb break="no"/>resentative." That is to say, that the whole people, 
     <lb/>
     or some numerous portion of them exercise 
     <lb/>
     through deputies periodically elected by themsel<lb break="no"/>ves the ultimate controlling power. Now, repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government must fulfill three 
     <lb/>
     fundamental conditions: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     (1) That the people should be willing to

            <p>When, sir, people have not sufficient value and 
     <lb/>attachment to a representative constitution they 
     <lb/>have no chance whatever of retaining it. Repre<lb break="no"/>sentative institutions necessarily depend for per<lb break="no"/>manence on the readiness of the people to fight 
     <lb/>for them in case they are in danger. When 
     <lb/>nobody, or only a small fraction, feels a degree 
     <lb/>of interest in the affairs of the country necessary 
     <lb/>to the formation of the public opinion, the elec<lb break="no"/>tors will seldom make any use of the right of 
     <lb/>suffrage but to serve their own private interests 
     <lb/>or the interests of the locality, or by some one of 
     <lb/>them with whom they are connected as adherents 
     <lb/>or dependents. The smaller class who, in this state 
     <lb/>of public opinion, gain the command of the rep<lb break="no"/>resentative body, for the most part use it solely as 
     <lb/>a means of seeking their own fortunes. Repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government cannot permanently exist 
     <lb/>when you find such conditions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     I submit, Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what 
     <lb/>
     happened to Newfoundland in the years past. We 
     <lb/>
     were passive. We did not want to govern oursel<lb break="no"/>ves. We elected men and sent them to the House 
     <lb/>
     of Assembly and promptly forgot them for four 
     <lb/>
     years. And another crowd came along and said, 
     <lb/>
     "What about electing me?" And they elected 
     <lb/>
     them, to forget them again. You have to get 
     <lb/>
     people talking politics, and fighting over it if 
     <lb/>
     necessary, and until then we are not fit for respon<lb break="no"/>sible government or Commission government, or 
     <lb/>
     any other kind of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Can we, as a people in this Newfoundland that 
     <lb/>
     was ours, fulfil these fundamental conditions, or 
     <lb/>
     have we in order to advance in civilisation some 
     <lb/>
     lessons to learn, some habits not yet acquired, to 
     <lb/>
     the acquiring of which representative govern<lb break="no"/>ment is likely to be an impediment? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now if we admit that a representative govern<lb break="no"/>ment responsible to the people is the best form of 
     <lb/>
     government, it would be wise to ask ourselves 
     <lb/>
     what actual functions shall be directly and per<lb break="no"/>sonally discharged by the elected members. First 
     <lb/>
     and foremost. it is understood that the people 
     <lb/>
     have given to the elected body the control of 
     <lb/>
     everything for their common good. Now, there is 
     <lb/>
     a radical distinction between controlling the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of government and actually doing it. There 
    

            <cb/>
         

     are many things which the elected body cannot 
     <lb/>
     do well of itself, but it ought to take the best 
     <lb/>
     means for having it well done by others. In the 
     <lb/>
     first place bodies ought not to administer, though 
     <lb/>
     they can deliberate. The popular assembly is also 
     <lb/>
     not fitted to dictate in detail to those who have 
     <lb/>
     charge of administration. Every branch of public 
     <lb/>
     administration is a skilled business. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Legislation too must be framed by minds 
     <lb/>
     trained to the task through long and labourious 
     <lb/>
     study. The job of the representative is not that of 
     <lb/>
     doing the work, but of causing it to be done, of 
     <lb/>
     determining to whom or to what sort of people it 
     <lb/>
     shall be confided, and giving or withholding the 
     <lb/>
     country's sanction to it when performed. The 
     <lb/>
     whole function then of an elected assembly is to 
     <lb/>
     watch and control the government; to throw the 
     <lb/>
     light of publicity on its acts (something like the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, you know 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen!). Now we want a government and 
     <lb/>
     people prating like I am today, throwing the light 
     <lb/>
     of publicity on all the acts of government — not 
     <lb/>
     seven men sitting down at Government House or 
     <lb/>
     some other place, and making laws and publish<lb break="no"/>ing them without the people having the chance to 
     <lb/>
     know anything at all about them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Representative assemblies are often Charged 
     <lb/>
     with being places of mere talking. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     this Mill says, "I know not how a representative 
     <lb/>
     assembly can more usefully employ itself than in 
     <lb/>
     talk." When the subject of talk is the great public 
     <lb/>
     interest of the country, and every sentence of it 
     <lb/>
     represents the opinion either of some important 
     <lb/>
     body of persons in the country or of an individual 
     <lb/>
     in whom some such body have reposed their 
     <lb/>
     confidence. A place where every interest and 
     <lb/>
     shade of opinion in the country can have its cause 
     <lb/>
     even passionately pleaded in the face of the 
     <lb/>
     government and of all other interests and 
     <lb/>
     opinions, can compel them to listen, and either 
     <lb/>
     comply or state clearly why they do not, is in 
     <lb/>
     itself, if it answered no other purpose, one of the 
     <lb/>
     most important political institutions than can 
     <lb/>
     exist anywhere, and one of the foremost benefits 
     <lb/>
     of free government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such talk and free discussion coupled with 
     <lb/>
     skilled legislation and administration is of the 
     <lb/>
     essence of good government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I had considerable other things 
     <lb/>
     here, and I had to cut some of it out on account 
     <lb/>
     of the time. Now, what about us at this moment? 


            <pb n="1321" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1321.jpg"/>

     At this juncture I take it we are at the parting of 
     <lb/>
     the ways in this country. Our people have the 
     <lb/>
     power and the authority, or will have in May, to 
     <lb/>
     select a government of their own choosing, and 
     <lb/>
     it is most important that they give their every 
     <lb/>
     consideration to which of the two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, or more if they are submitted, which 
     <lb/>
     will best serve their interests, and to which we 
     <lb/>
     can be most loyal. I am of the confirmed opinion 
     <lb/>
     that an elected government, responsible to the 
     <lb/>
     people, is the best form of government which this 
     <lb/>
     or any other country can achieve, and I hope and 
     <lb/>
     trust that when our people come to make up their 
     <lb/>
     minds they will also consider that too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I might say that I am against Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. One thing about us, we have a bar<lb break="no"/>gaining power today, and we must use it. We can 
     <lb/>
     produce fish, ores and wood products. There will 
     <lb/>
     always be a world demand for these products. 
     <lb/>
     Our job is to sell, and to the highest bidder. If we 
     <lb/>
     have other tangible or intangible assets, such as 
     <lb/>
     a strategic position, let us sell that too, and to the 
     <lb/>
     highest bidder compatible with the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country. We have got to face facts, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. We have just fought one war, and 
     <lb/>
     anybody can see that we are likely to have to fight 
     <lb/>
     another war sometime; how soon we do not 
     <lb/>
     know, but we have been told day in and day out 
     <lb/>
     that we occupy a strategic position, and it is as 
     <lb/>
     well for us to be realistic. People who live in 
     <lb/>
     strategic positions run the risk of dying a sudden 
     <lb/>
     death, especially in these days of atomic fission. 
     <lb/>
     We know our position in the Atlantic Ocean, and 
     <lb/>
     it is just as well for us to be realistic and face these 
     <lb/>
     facts. Our people are going to live in a strategic 
     <lb/>
     position. All right, let us elect a government and 
     <lb/>
     get for the people who are doing enough to live 
     <lb/>
     in this country, the best possible living that there 
     <lb/>
     is in it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, once upon a time we were 
     <lb/>
     proud to call ourselves the cornerstone of Empire. 
     <lb/>
     I wonder now, cannot we visualise a prouder 
     <lb/>
     place in the new world structure to be? Cannot 
     <lb/>
     we aspire to be the keystone in the arch of 
     <lb/>
     freedom and friendliness between Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     United States and the western democracies of 
     <lb/>
     Europe? We can only become this keystone if we 
     <lb/>
     recover and retain our independence, and en<lb break="no"/>deavour to exploit our resources without let or 
     <lb/>
     hindrance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will leave out a lot of this here. I am a bit 
   

            <cb/>
         

     upset at the moment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was referring to the Labrador. We are told 
     <lb/>
     that we have vast potential timber wealth there. 
     <lb/>
     What are we going to do about it? There's one 
     <lb/>
     thing about it, if we do not keep control of it 
     <lb/>
     ourselves it will do us no benefit whatsoever. 
     <lb/>
     Recently I read in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Atlantic Reporter</hi> in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, which has just been issued a few days 
     <lb/>
     ago, under the heading of "Iron and Lumber for 
     <lb/>
     Export": "The new discoveries of iron ore in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and Labrador promise the largest source 
     <lb/>
     of this vital raw material since the discovery of 
     <lb/>
     the Mesabi deposits in Minnesota. Preliminary 
     <lb/>
     explorations of this ore body have gone far 
     <lb/>
     enough to invite both Canadian and United States 
     <lb/>
     governmental and industrial interest. The United 
     <lb/>
     States needs Canadian ore desperately, and the 
     <lb/>
     new mines open up challenging opportunities for 
     <lb/>
     investment of United States capital." I ask you to 
     <lb/>
     apply that statement to Newfoundland — New<lb break="no"/>foundland ore and Newfoundland timber that's 
     <lb/>
     there on the Labrador. Let us ask ourselves, can 
     <lb/>
     we recommend any other form of government 
     <lb/>
     than one of the two in the motion of Mr. Higgins? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The United States of America, sir, needs all 
     <lb/>
     the timber she can get, and needs it badly. I ask 
     <lb/>
     you again to think of the potential market for fish 
     <lb/>
     and fish products in the United States. We have 
     <lb/>
     the fish, and we have the men to catch it, and our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries should be the great concern of all New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. By them the great majority of our 
     <lb/>
     people must live, and here let us shout from the 
     <lb/>
     housetops the praises due to the Fisheries Board 
     <lb/>
     under the able chairmanship of Mr. Ray Gushue, 
     <lb/>
     and those enterprising firms in St. John's and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere in the country for their initiative in 
     <lb/>
     regard to marketing, and their faith in the fresh 
     <lb/>
     fish business. Take a walk over to the Southside 
     <lb/>
     and have a look at Job Bros. plant, and see one of 
     <lb/>
     the finest on the Atlantic seaboard. It is the only 
     <lb/>
     one I have seen, but there are many others in the 
     <lb/>
     country. Think on these things and again, I ask 
     <lb/>
     you, what other form can we vote for except one 
     <lb/>
     of the two in the motion? Come with me to Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook and Grand Falls, or go with Mr. Fudge to 
     <lb/>
     Curling and Mr. Jackman to Bell Island, or go to 
     <lb/>
     Gander and Harmon Field, and back to Fort Pep<lb break="no"/>perrell by way of Argentia, and count the New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders as they toil, and the men who will 
     <lb/>
     make good money at the seal fishery. Let us think 
     <lb/>
     on these things.

<p>
     Come back with me now to the year 1855. 
     <lb/>
     Well, you know your history. Two hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand people, and no industry except fish and 
     <lb/>
     sealing. No railway, few schools, but withal a few 
     <lb/>
     gallant gentlemen wrestling, by force almost, 
     <lb/>
     from Great Britain the right of self-government. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I ask you, could these men see the 
     <lb/>
     frenzied efforts of some men in this House for the 
     <lb/>
     past few months, would they not cry out in scorn, 
     <lb/>
     "Oh ye of little faith"? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yes, there can be only one form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment for this country, and that is self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment. For 15 years we have been politically dead. 
     <lb/>
     Men and women of 35 and under have never 
     <lb/>
     voted and it is for these I worry. They not only 
     <lb/>
     have not had political experience, but their minds 
     <lb/>
     have been poisoned by vicious stories. Was it 
     <lb/>
     done deliberately, I wonder? Their votes now 
     <lb/>
     will decide the issue. Will they snap out of their 
     <lb/>
     political apathy and jump into the breach and 
     <lb/>
     hold fast to their heritage, or will they allow 
     <lb/>
     themselves to be hoodwinked and lose it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Never before in the history of this country was 
     <lb/>
     there such a chance for us to sell our products to 
     <lb/>
     a nation who can afford to buy them — I mean 
     <lb/>
     the United States of America. All history is tied 
     <lb/>
     up with economic strings. The destinies of 
     <lb/>
     peoples depend on what they have for sale and to 
     <lb/>
     whom they sell it, and I think an American dollar 
     <lb/>
     is still on a par with a Canadian dollar. Are we to 
     <lb/>
     get that American dollar, or must it go elsewhere? 
     <lb/>
     There is only one way we can get that American 
     <lb/>
     dollar, and that is by demanding by popular vote 
     <lb/>
     the return to our former status, by adopting the 
     <lb/>
     Statute of Westminster, and thereafter by doing 
     <lb/>
     business with people who will treat us fairly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I think I have about used up the time I had. 
     <lb/>
     Is it completely gone? 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You have four minutes, to be 
     <lb/>exact. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I just want to say this, sir, that if 
     <lb/>there is any misunderstanding between you and 
  

            <cb/>
   

     me, I apologise. I was doing what I deemed to be 
     <lb/>
     in the best interests of this assembly and the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, and I still make this asser<lb break="no"/>tion, that I agree wholeheartedly with the state<lb break="no"/>ment made by Mr. Bradley, that if we pass this 
     <lb/>
     resolution we can recommend nothing else. 
     <lb/>
     That's my opinion, and I explained why. Mind 
     <lb/>
     now, I am in favour of passing this. I do not agree 
     <lb/>
     with Commission government — I think we 
     <lb/>
     should have our former status, and I appeal to you 
     <lb/>
     men to go out and tell the people that their only 
     <lb/>
     hope in the future is to get back their former 
     <lb/>
     status, and thereafter to see to it that the men that 
     <lb/>
     they elect and send to this assembly shall spend 
     <lb/>
     their time in the interest of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, and not in doing something which does 
     <lb/>
     not apply to the people. Sir, I am going to quote 
     <lb/>
     just two or three words from Robert Burns. It's 
     <lb/>
     Burns Night tomorrow. Burns was a common 
     <lb/>
     man like the rest of us here in this assembly, but 
     <lb/>
     he was a great man, and loved his country as I 
     <lb/>
     hope every one of you gentlemen loves yours. 
     <lb/>
     And with apologies to the spirit of Burns, and 
     <lb/>
     with the changing of but one word in his brief 
     <lb/>
     stanza, I say:<ref target="#fn_04">*</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Chairman, all thinking people 
     <lb/>
     in this country will agree that the time has come 
     <lb/>
     when we should arouse ourselves to a sense of 
     <lb/>
     our real responsibilities, and unite in a deter<lb break="no"/>mined effort to steer our ship of state, storm-

     beaten though she may be, on the right course to 
     <lb/>
     safe harbour; to make sure that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     comes into her own, and that she should take her 
     <lb/>

     loving sections of the world to which her loyalty, 
     <lb/>
     fine principles of justice, and fair play entitled 
     <lb/>
     her. I feel that the newly elected government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland should be different from the old 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. Its members should be 
     <lb/>
     limited to the lowest minimum. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     see the introduction of new social legislation, 
     <lb/>
     which would improve the standard of living for

     our toilers on the deep, as well as our forests and 
     <lb/>
     our mines. I would like to see a scheme whereby 
     <lb/>
     our fishermen would become shareholders in the 
     <lb/>
     enterprise which through their efforts and long 
     <lb/>
     toil they had elected to build. This scheme is very 
     <lb/>
     much a reality in other countries, and is proving 
     <lb/>
     very successful. I have no hesitation in saying 
     <lb/>
     that the development in our fisheries, our mines 
     <lb/>
     and our forests, over the period of the next 20 
     <lb/>
     years, will exceed our wildest imaginations. Let 
     <lb/>
     us go forward unafraid, for a greater New<lb break="no"/>foundland is here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, our position now is the same 
     <lb/>
     as it was in 1932. So I think that the great un<lb break="no"/>solved problem of Newfoundland is the 
     <lb/>
     economic problem — that of surveying, measur<lb break="no"/>ing and developing our natural resources, and of 
     <lb/>
     re-organising our existing industries. The differ<lb break="no"/>ence is that now I know that if that problem is to 
     <lb/>
     be solved, it will be solved only by a government 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland elected by the people.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the royal commission came here in the 
     <lb/>
     19305 we expected a full and ungrudging recog<lb break="no"/>nition of the statesmanlike governments in office 
     <lb/>
     from 1931 to 1933 — recognition of their 
     <lb/>
     patriotic and really effective efforts to reorganise 
     <lb/>
     and finance our governmental machine, recogni<lb break="no"/>tion of the magnificent new spirit, new order, and 
     <lb/>
     the change of heart of the government. In New<lb break="no"/>foundland today not a dozen men would not 
     <lb/>
     disagree with this statement, that with the system 
     <lb/>
     of treasury control, the public debt converted to 
     <lb/>
     a lower rate of interest that would save $2 million 
     <lb/>
     a year, and the same degree of financial assis<lb break="no"/>tance which the Commission of Government had 
     <lb/>
     actually received, Newfoundland now would be 
     <lb/>
     in no sense or degree worse off than she is after 
     <lb/>
     rule by the Commission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Who speaks for Newfoundland today? 
     <lb/>
     Nobody speaks for Newfoundland. Nobody has 
     <lb/>
     the right, nobody has been authorised. In the 
     <lb/>
     absence of a House of Assembly or an opposition, 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland people are left voiceless. Any<lb break="no"/>thing could be put over on them, anything, turn<lb break="no"/>ing our country into an international settlement 
     <lb/>
     like Shanghai, or making another Hawaii of us. 
     <lb/>
     That is why the people must be organised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1934 we made a mistake in surrendering our 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, but may I say we made 
     <lb/>
     a great mistake once before, in November - <lb/> December, 1933. That was when the whole idea 
 

            <cb/>
      

     of suppressing self-govemment and substituting 
     <lb/>
     Commission government was flung at us. We did 
     <lb/>
     not dicker, we did not attempt to better it, we did 
     <lb/>
     not demand modifications. No, we took it all 
     <lb/>
     down, hook, line and sinker, and we appointed a 
     <lb/>
     deputation to go across to interview the British 
     <lb/>
     government — to plead for softening the 
     <lb/>
     proposals? No, we simply dotted the i's and 
     <lb/>
     crossed the t's. Let us not make that mistake 
     <lb/>
     again. We can get back responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     all we have to do is insist on it.... Let us all agree 
     <lb/>
     that this form of Commission government must 
     <lb/>
     be stopped. Does it automatically resolve our 
     <lb/>
     problems to scrap this system? What shall we 
     <lb/>
     have to replace this present form? Responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, you say. Yes, responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but only in the sense that the government 
     <lb/>
     is responsible to a parliament elected by the 
     <lb/>
     people. The principle of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     is right. It is sound. No other form of government 
     <lb/>
     is right, or can succeed, but we are unworthy if 
     <lb/>
     we fool ourselves into the belief that the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of this sound British and democratic principle 
     <lb/>
     will automatically solve our problems. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p>Responsible government is the normal thing 
     <lb/>in the British Empire. It is practised in the United 
     <lb/>Kingdom, in Northern Ireland and in Eire, and in 
     <lb/>Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and 
     <lb/>Canada. Under responsible government the 
     <lb/>government executives are responsible to parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. Parliament is elected by the people, and the 
     <lb/>government can hold office only as long as it 
     <lb/>commands the confidence of parliament. Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment itself, having been elected by the people, 
     <lb/>and having to answer to the people again when 
     <lb/>the term is up, is necessarily responsible to the 
     <lb/>public. That is the glory of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment; but it also possesses some dangers. Is it 
     <lb/>possible to set up a system that will prevent the 
     <lb/>evils of 1920 - 1934, or at least the more serious 
     <lb/>of those evils? Let us not make the mistake of 
     <lb/>attributing to responsible government the many 
     <lb/>evils and weaknesses which in fact are the results 
     <lb/>of other causes altogether. But having guarded 
     <lb/>against making that mistake we may yet honestly 
     <lb/>recognise the dangers that do lie in the practice 
     <lb/>of responsible government — recognising them 
     <lb/>so as to start preventing them, or cataloguing 
     <lb/>them, or classifying them, and then devising 
     <lb/>ways and means of heading them off. We have 
     <lb/>two great sources of knowledge in our effort to 


            <pb n="1324" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1324.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1324</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     safeguard ourselves against repetition of the evils 
     <lb/>
     we knew before: our own experience, and the 
     <lb/>
     experience of numerous other countries who 
     <lb/>
     have practised responsible government.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, while Mr. Higgins was speak<lb break="no"/>ing here a few days ago, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     criticised his remarks as being taken from Mr.

     MacKay's book on Newfoundland, without 
     <lb/>
     giving Mr. MacKay credit for it. I now have to 
     <lb/>
     confess to Newfoundland that the words of this 
     <lb/>
     address are those of one of our prominent public 
     <lb/>
     men, which I copied and repeated today. They 
     <lb/>
     were uttered by Mr. Smallwood himself, and I 
     <lb/>
     merely repeat them, use them, and give my sup<lb break="no"/>port to Mr. Higgins' motion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROBE2">Mr. Roberts</persName> Mr. Chairman, in rising to speak 
     <lb/>
     to the motion before the Chair, I wish to say I will 
     <lb/>
     vote for the two forms of government, namely 
     <lb/>
     responsible and Commission, to be placed on the 
     <lb/>
     ballot paper. Briefly I will endeavour to give you 
     <lb/>
     my reasons for so doing, by showing the merits 
     <lb/>
     or demerits of each form 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Responsible government is the ideal for the 
     <lb/>
     people of any country to strive for. I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders are doing just that? I am sure 
     <lb/>
     they are not, otherwise there would not be so 
     <lb/>
     much talk of other forms of government, or, as 
     <lb/>
     we find all over the country, an indifference to 
     <lb/>
     any form. Probably there is a reason for all this 
     <lb/>
     confusion. It seems strange, does it not, when we 
     <lb/>
     see the peoples of many countries today, large 
     <lb/>
     and small — and the European countries espe<lb break="no"/>cially, devastated by war, famine and disease, 
     <lb/>
     their natural resources — striving to the point of 
     <lb/>
     bloodshed to drive foreigners out so as to govern 
     <lb/>
     themselves; while we in Newfoundland with 
     <lb/>
     balanced budgets, a surplus, our resources barely 
     <lb/>
     scratched, seem afraid to govern ourselves, or too 
     <lb/>
     indifferent to bother what happens to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It must seem peculiar to the peoples of other 
     <lb/>
     countries, but it may not be so hard for us to 
     <lb/>
     understand the situation when we review our past 
     <lb/>
     political history, and think of what happened to 
     <lb/>
     us after almost a 100 years of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. With all due respect to our politicians, 
     <lb/>
     some of whom were great men, there must have 
     <lb/>
     been too many amongst them who did not have 
     <lb/>
     the best interests of the country at heart, other<lb break="no"/>wise we would not have landed in the mess we 
 

            <cb/>
        

     did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the country became self-supporting, 
     <lb/>
     and it might seem that we are today, England was 
     <lb/>
     to restore to us responsible government. She did 
     <lb/>
     not do so, and consequently the mother of parlia<lb break="no"/>ments has been called by some people everything 
     <lb/>
     but a lady. But after 14 years of Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, to whom is she to pass back the 
     <lb/>
     reins of power? To the people who relinquished 
     <lb/>
     it? Where are they today? You can almost count 
     <lb/>
     on the fingers of one hand the men of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment who are left, or who would care to take 
     <lb/>
     control. Well, it may not be nice to say, but 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless it is a fact that the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country would think long and hard before trusting 
     <lb/>
     their destiny into those hands again, although, as 
     <lb/>
     I say, there may be some good men amongst 
     <lb/>
     them. Well then, who next? Probably the Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Government League we have heard of, con<lb break="no"/>sisting of good influential citizens of this city, 
     <lb/>
     businessmen and lawyers. Proper men, one 
     <lb/>
     would think, to run the affairs of this country, but 
     <lb/>
     the argument against these, especially in the out<lb break="no"/>ports, is the age-old prejudice of merchant versus 
     <lb/>
     fisherman, St. John's versus the outports. Why 
     <lb/>
     should St. John's run the outports? Very narrow 
     <lb/>
     views, and I wish I could say they don't exist, but 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately they do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If that is the case, someone would suggest the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention, a body of men elected from 
     <lb/>
     every district, a cross-section of many trades and 
     <lb/>
     professions. Surely these must be the men we 
     <lb/>
     have been wanting for years. But what do you 
     <lb/>
     hear from all parts of the country, from all classes 
     <lb/>
     of people? We have been termed wranglers, 
     <lb/>
     wasters of public time and monies, incapables 
     <lb/>
     etc., and people hold up their hands in horror at 
     <lb/>
     the thought of trusting the affairs of this country 
     <lb/>
     to our incapable hands. How often have I heard 
     <lb/>
     the expression, until I am ashamed to say that I 
     <lb/>
     am a member of the Convention (although we 
     <lb/>
     don't deserve it), "If these are the sort of men we 
     <lb/>
     are likely to get to govern us, God help the 
     <lb/>
     country in a very few years." So the thought has 
     <lb/>
     been continually in my mind — how, after 14 or 
     <lb/>
     15 years, could England give us back responsible 
     <lb/>
     government? Who is to take it back? The ques<lb break="no"/>tion has never been answered by the people who 
     <lb/>
     advocate it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Still, if we wish to govern ourselves, we must 
     <lb/>
     have Newfoundlanders, and we must find the 


            <pb n="1325" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1325.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1325</fw>
         

     men, sooner or later; and if good men do not come 
     <lb/>
     forward, then incapables will. It's a New<lb break="no"/>foundland problem to find good men. Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers go to other countries and do well, become 
     <lb/>
     clannish, and in war they are very loyal, but at 
     <lb/>
     home we are suspicious of our governments and 
     <lb/>
     one another, very divided in our opinions. Lord 
     <lb/>
     Ammon, of the British Goodwill Mission, who 
     <lb/>
     visited here some few years ago said, "If I talk to 
     <lb/>
     five Newfoundlanders I get five different 
     <lb/>
     opinions. How can I tell the British Parliament 
     <lb/>
     what Newfoundlanders want? They do not know 
     <lb/>
     themselves." The British Parliament knows the 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs out here, and regardless of what 
     <lb/>
     people might thing, I am of the opinion they are 
     <lb/>
     doing the right thing not to give us back respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. They will let us decide for 
     <lb/>
     ourselves at the referendum, and then if the 
     <lb/>
     majority should wantresponsible government we 
     <lb/>
     will get it. I have yet to be convinced that England 
     <lb/>
     will force us into any form of government, al<lb break="no"/>though we have given her plenty of provocation 
     <lb/>
     to do so. Throwing ourselves on her mercy in the 
     <lb/>
     1930s after admitting we could not govern our<lb break="no"/>selves, she had every right then to attach us to 
     <lb/>
     Canada or any other country, on any terms. In<lb break="no"/>stead, she tried to build up our economy and to 
     <lb/>
     give us another chance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The time has arrived We have the resources, 
     <lb/>
     but have we the men with the courage to face the 
     <lb/>
     future on our own, remembering our mistakes, 
     <lb/>
     taking note of our failures, so as to apply a 
     <lb/>
     remedy? The men who will handle our affairs 
     <lb/>
     will need plenty of courage and brains. They will 
     <lb/>
     also need to be thick-skinned and hard, to keep in 
     <lb/>
     check graft, waste, dishonesty, the needless 
     <lb/>
     spending of huge sums of money on party 
     <lb/>
     politics, always keeping in mind the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country, instead of their own selfish inter<lb break="no"/>ests. The leader will do very little if his party and 
     <lb/>
     the people are not satisfied to be led in the right 
     <lb/>
     direction. I want the people to note the quality of 
     <lb/>
     the men who will be putting themselves forward 
     <lb/>
     with the expectation of governing this country, 
     <lb/>
     and to demand nothing but the best; also to think 
     <lb/>
     of our huge government expenditures of today, 
     <lb/>
     our isolation, our backwardness, and think long 
     <lb/>
     and well before marking a ballot for a return to 
     <lb/>
     the responsibilities of self-government. It's no 
     <lb/>
     small thing we are about to tackle. We had an 
     <lb/>
     experiment before and failed. Will we do better 


            <cb/>


     another time? That's a question a lot of people 
     <lb/>
     would like to have answered. Will they trust the 
     <lb/>
     younger generation of today, even with the huge 
     <lb/>
     revenues we have? Time will tell. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After throwing in the sponge and admitting we 
     <lb/>
     could not govern ourselves, England set up a 
     <lb/>
     government by commission, a dictatorial govern<lb break="no"/>ment. But after the fiasco we made of our affairs 
     <lb/>
     we needed a bit of dictatorship, and it has been 
     <lb/>
     good for us in many ways. It's not the ideal thing 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland, and it was never intended to 
     <lb/>
     last any longer than necessary. They have made 
     <lb/>
     mistakes, and will continue to make them as long 
     <lb/>
     as they are in power, and in this respect they can 
     <lb/>
     be excused, as all governments make mistakes. 
     <lb/>
     The main thing is to see they are not repeated. But 
     <lb/>
     they have done a great deal of good, which fact 
     <lb/>
     cannot be denied by the ardent supporters of any 
     <lb/>
     other system of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The first seven years of their rule were the 
     <lb/>
     seven lean years — there was no corn in Egypt, 
     <lb/>
     and very little in any other country. What could 
     <lb/>
     any government do during these years to better 
     <lb/>
     the living conditions of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people? Many schemes were tried, many millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars from the pockets of the British taxpayer 
     <lb/>
     were spewed out to keep our people alive. Many 
     <lb/>
     of the schemes failed, as was to be expected, but 
     <lb/>
     some were good and are functioning today. Then, 
     <lb/>
     after the seven lean years, came the seven fat 
     <lb/>
     years, brought about by a war which devastated 
     <lb/>
     untold millions of lives and property in other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the world. Their loss was our gain: money 
     <lb/>
     poured so fast that the government could not 
     <lb/>
     spend it. We created a surplus; we became to all 
     <lb/>
     intents and purposes self-supporting. But just as 
     <lb/>
     the people needed not seven years of plenty, but 
     <lb/>
     twice that time to get back on their feet from the 
     <lb/>
     poverty of the depression, so does the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, which required not seven years, but I 
     <lb/>
     should say 20 years to give us the social services 
     <lb/>
     we require. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     $40 million of a revenue will not buy as much 
     <lb/>
     today as $20 million ten years ago, when we 
     <lb/>
     consider the rate of government pay then and 
     <lb/>
     now, and also the price of commodities. A cot<lb break="no"/>tage hospital, for instance, which cost $20,000 to 
     <lb/>
     build ten years ago, will cost $65,000 today. But 
     <lb/>
     there is one thing about all this spending, we can 
     <lb/>
     look around the country and see something for it. 
     <lb/>
     Ask the people of any district where they have 
 

            <pb n="1326" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1326.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1326</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
      

     cottage hospitals and district nurses, new high<lb break="no"/>roads linking smaller and larger settlements 
     <lb/>
     together, bringing them in touch with new 
     <lb/>
     markets, inducing tourists to come into the 
     <lb/>
     country, bringing in new money. The introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of the co-operative societies is enabling the 
     <lb/>
     working man to get every cent possible for the 
     <lb/>
     products of his toil. The setting up of our very 
     <lb/>
     capable Fisheries Board, with newer methods, is 
     <lb/>
     raising the standard of our fish products, thereby 
     <lb/>
     assuring to our fishermen higher prices. There are 
     <lb/>
     other things I could mention, but these are suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to warrant people voting for Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government. But I want to warn our New<lb break="no"/>foundland people that vast government expendi<lb break="no"/>tures have been built up to give us all these 
     <lb/>
     services, and while revenues continue to keep up 
     <lb/>
     these expenditures can be maintained, but if they 
     <lb/>
     fall, which we have every sound reason to believe 
     <lb/>
     they will, since a level of government expendi<lb break="no"/>ture once reached has a tendency to stay put, our 
     <lb/>
     surplus will soon melt away, and then where are 
     <lb/>
     we? Down and out again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We had England to come to our aid in the 
     <lb/>
     1930s, and pour millions into the country. 
     <lb/>
     England will not be in any position to help us for 
     <lb/>
     some years to come, she needs millions and bil<lb break="no"/>lions poured into her. What help we can expect 
     <lb/>
     from her will be negligible, if any. She will do 
     <lb/>
     what she can, but it's my opinion she expects us 
     <lb/>
     to go our own way and bid Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government farewell. Personally, I do not feel 
     <lb/>
     that the future of Newfoundland has anything to 
     <lb/>
     gain by the retention of Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but I am in duty bound to vote that it be 
     <lb/>
     placed on the ballot paper.

     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Mr. Chairman, since the hour is late, 
     <lb/>
     before I make my few simple remarks I would

     suggest that the Convention recess until 8 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, and I would like all the

     members who intend speaking to the motion to

     please do so, because eventually, before the mo<lb break="no"/>tion is put, I will have to call on Mr. Higgins, the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     people whom I represent and for myself as well, 
     <lb/>
     I wish to make a few brief comments on the 
     <lb/>
     motion before the Chair. This motion is to the 
     <lb/>
     effect that in the forthcoming plebiscite, the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland be asked whether they 
     <lb/>
     want as their future form of government either 
     <lb/>
     the responsible government which they lost in 
     <lb/>
     1933, or a continuation of the present form of 
     <lb/>
     Commission government. Now although I may 
     <lb/>
     support this motion recommending that these two 
     <lb/>
     forms of government be placed on a ballot, that 
     <lb/>
     must not be taken to mean that I think these two 
     <lb/>
     forms are equally good, and that whichever form 
     <lb/>
     our people choose we will be just as well off with 
     <lb/>
     one as we would be with the other. Not at all. I 
     <lb/>
     mean anything but that. I have long ago come to 
     <lb/>
     my own conclusions as to what is the best form 
     <lb/>
     of government to recommend to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, and further, sir, I am prepared to give 
     <lb/>
     sound reasons for my decision. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In my opinion there should be no need for any 
     <lb/>
     election at all over this matter. It should be simply 
     <lb/>
     a matter of giving back to this country something 
     <lb/>
     that was taken from her in 1933. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to criticise the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, for I sincerely believe that the 
     <lb/>
     Commission has done a certain amount of good 
     <lb/>
     in the country, but I am prepared, as I have been 
     <lb/>
     for the past ten years, to try and see both sides and 
     <lb/>
     give credit where credit is due. The Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government, as I said before, has done a 
     <lb/>
     considerable amount of good but I want you to 
     <lb/>
     bear in mind that those who I hear so often 
     <lb/>
     condemning and accusing the old politicians of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday were the very people who made it 
     <lb/>
     possible, who provided the machinery whereby 
     <lb/>
     those people could raise $40 million revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot overlook the fact that Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government — I am more or less inclined to 
     <lb/>
     criticise the form, rather than the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission — grossly ignored my comrades of 
     <lb/>
     the Great War Veterans' Association some years

     ago. They were looking for adjustments to heal 
     <lb/>
     their wounds and ease their dependents, and they 
     <lb/>
     were forced to apply to the general public of the 
     <lb/>
     country who, I am proud to state, so ably came 
     <lb/>
     forward and insisted that their rights be recog<lb break="no"/>nised. Labour is not being so badly treated with 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government, especially those 
     <lb/>
     who grew up and were strong enough to handle 
     <lb/>
     them. There are many places where the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion might have done better, where the Labour 
     <lb/>
     Relations Office might have done much better. 
     <lb/>
     We find today the cost of living, as you all know, 
     <lb/>
     is terrific. But in spite of that we find men who 
     <lb/>
     were expected to work one day for $4 and the next 
     <lb/>
     day for nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have heard some things referred to in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the town councils, and I agree with 
     <lb/>
     the principle of town councils, provided they are 
     <lb/>
     not a burden to our people. I have in many cases 
     <lb/>
     heard old men, very wealthy and well able to 
     <lb/>
     afford it say, "Oh yes, we must have a town 
     <lb/>
     council — it's going to cost me $3-400 but never<lb break="no"/>theless we should have it." But Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     that is not the same story. It did not cost them 
     <lb/>
     $3-400, it cost the people, unfortunately. The 
     <lb/>
     Commission made no provision whereby he or 
     <lb/>
     she could not pass it on to the poor man. I deplore 
     <lb/>
     that system of legislation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Getting back to the old politicians, I wish to 
     <lb/>
     be fair in this matter, and I am not trying to prove 
     <lb/>
     that all our public men were angels — just as the 
     <lb/>
     public men of any other country are not, and were 
     <lb/>
     not angels. In every phase of human action you 
     <lb/>
     will find the black sheep, but is it fair to condemn 
     <lb/>
     all the apostles because there was a Judas? Is it 
     <lb/>
     fair to condemn a whole nation because they have 
     <lb/>
     convicts in their goals? Must we condemn 
     <lb/>
     humanity because all were not perfect? Yet that 
     <lb/>
     is just what they try to do with us. I would suggest 
     <lb/>
     to the commission which was sent over here to 
     <lb/>
     make an inquiry, that they should search the 
     <lb/>
     Scriptures, and they might find something 
     <lb/>
     suitable. They would find, if they took the 
     <lb/>
     trouble, that it is not fair to talk about the mote in 
     <lb/>
     their neighbours' eye, until they have plucked the 
     <lb/>
     beam out of their own. If our old politicians were 
     <lb/>
     the evil persons they say, then why was it that 
     <lb/>
     when they came here as a Commission they took 
     <lb/>
     into their ranks three of these old politicians? If 
     <lb/>
     they are correct in what they state, by this very 
     <lb/>
     act they condemn themselves. I hold no brief for 
 

            <cb/>
        

     the government of Newfoundlanders who gave 
     <lb/>
     away responsible government in 1933, but in 
     <lb/>
     fairness I do not hesitate to give it as my belief 
     <lb/>
     that if they had not been assured that responsible 
     <lb/>
     government would be restored to this country 
     <lb/>
     upon her becoming self-supporting, then they 
     <lb/>
     would never have voted as they did. Is this not 
     <lb/>
     proof, absolute proof, that when they condemned 
     <lb/>
     our politicians they were lying, and knew they 
     <lb/>
     were lying? People don't swallow their vomit 
     <lb/>
     unless they have to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In heaven's name, when we discuss the past 
     <lb/>
     history of our country let us try to be fair, and not 
     <lb/>
     blind our eyes to the truth, I knew personally 
     <lb/>
     many of the so-called old politicians, and in 90 
     <lb/>
     percent of the cases I found them men who had 
     <lb/>
     given much more to the country than they ever 
     <lb/>
     got from it. They sacrificed their business, their 
     <lb/>
     time and their money to serve the public. I know 
     <lb/>
     many who had to neglect their business to attend 
     <lb/>
     to their public duties, and as a result lost their 
     <lb/>
     business. How often have we heard the sad story 
     <lb/>
     of public men, who after having given a lifetime 
     <lb/>
     to public service, died in near poverty? There 
     <lb/>
     were public men who made money, but they were 
     <lb/>
     men who would have made money anyhow — 
     <lb/>
     they were merchants, like the Hon. Mr. Job and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman and Mr. Crosbie, but just because 
     <lb/>
     they were politicians, envy said that they were 
     <lb/>
     grafters. Why, the best proof of it is the refusal of 
     <lb/>
     so many ambitious men to enter politics. They 
     <lb/>
     know that if they enter public life they will have 
     <lb/>
     to make too big a sacrifice in time and money, 
     <lb/>
     which they could have been devoting to their own 
     <lb/>
     business. Forget it I say, this talk about this 
     <lb/>
     country meeting the disaster of 1933 because of 
     <lb/>
     bad politicians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But apart from this altogether, let us remember 
     <lb/>
     that our task is not to deal with the past, but with 
     <lb/>
     the future. We have to look ahead, not behind. So 
     <lb/>
     then let us take stock of where we stand today and 
     <lb/>
     where we may hope to advance in the future. We 
     <lb/>
     have come a long way since 1933. Things have 
     <lb/>
     changed for us in such a way that we need never 
     <lb/>
     fear going back to the depths from which we have 
     <lb/>
     risen. Newfoundlanders today are in an era of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, and it is much more than an unnatural 
     <lb/>
     post-war boom. It is, on the contrary, an era in 
     <lb/>
     which primary producers of goods have come 
     <lb/>
     into their own. The prosperous countries today 
     <lb/>
     are those countries which have natural resources

     at their disposal, and have the ability and initia<lb break="no"/>tive to develop them. This country of ours is a 
     <lb/>
     producing country, and if we continue to produce 
     <lb/>
     to the best possible extent, we too can take our 
     <lb/>
     place with the progressive nations of the world. 
     <lb/>
     In our forest industries we see just such a program 
     <lb/>
     of activity working out. Our pulp and paper mills 
     <lb/>
     are being extended, and a similar state of affairs 
     <lb/>
     exists in our fishing industry — newer methods 
     <lb/>
     of catching and marketing are being introduced. 
     <lb/>
     From our industries we are in the happy position 
     <lb/>
     of being able to produce enough dollars to pay 
     <lb/>
     for all necessary imports, and consequently our 
     <lb/>
     standard of living has reached a peak never 
     <lb/>
     known before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Other countries, including Canada, are unable 
     <lb/>
     to obtain dollars, but with us the position is the 
     <lb/>
     opposite. For this reason we can be regarded as 
     <lb/>
     one of the most fortunate countries in the world. 
     <lb/>
     I have said nothing about our agriculture, or our 
     <lb/>
     tourist possibilities, but these two sources of in<lb break="no"/>come are ready for greater development. It is my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the day is not far away when we will 
     <lb/>
     be able to produce sufficient to make us inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of foreign markets. As for the tourist 
     <lb/>
     traffic, we know what this means to countries 
     <lb/>
     such as Canada which have no greater — if as 
     <lb/>
     great — attractions as are to be found in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Under a government of our people I 
     <lb/>
     see the possibilities of developing all these sour<lb break="no"/>ces of income. Are we to be so foolish as to 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice all these things for the doubtful 
     <lb/>
     prospects which may or may not be ours under 
     <lb/>
     any strange form of government, so to speak? If 
     <lb/>
     you had a business, would you be satisfied to 
     <lb/>
     hand it over to some stranger to run for you? 
     <lb/>
     Would you feel that he could run it better than 
     <lb/>
     you could? Do you think he would take a greater 
     <lb/>
     interest in you and your family than you would 
     <lb/>
     yourself? Of course you would not, you would 
     <lb/>
     turn your back in contempt on any such offer. Yet 
     <lb/>
     is that not just what we are being asked to do 
     <lb/>
     today? Are you going to fall for it? I am sure you 
     <lb/>
     are not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, in asking the people to support 
     <lb/>
     the actions of those of us who are seeking self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government, I do so in the conviction that I am 
     <lb/>
     acting in the best interests of our people. I am a 
     <lb/>
     born Newfoundlander with a stake in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I have a home and a family which it is 
     <lb/>
     my solemn duty to safeguard. Their best interests 


            <cb/>
   

     are mine. Do you think I would support any form 
     <lb/>
     of government which I thought for a minute 
     <lb/>
     would not be best for them? Why should I support 
     <lb/>
     self-government, except for the reason that I was 
     <lb/>
     convinced it was best? As founder and president 
     <lb/>
     of a large union in Newfoundland, I have many 
     <lb/>
     obligations to contend with. It is my sworn duty 
     <lb/>
     to fight for the interest of every man in that union, 
     <lb/>
     and every working man in this country. Do you 
     <lb/>
     think that I am going to support a cause which I 
     <lb/>
     think is not in the best interests of the families of 
     <lb/>
     these union members? It would be absolutely 
     <lb/>
     senseless. And I say further, that if self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment is best for my union, then it is best for all 
     <lb/>
     other unions. After all self-government is, I 
     <lb/>
     believe, the very essence of labour organisations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think that it was unfortunate that the motion 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair is not so worded as to give me 
     <lb/>
     and other delegates an opportunity of comparing 
     <lb/>
     the benefits of responsible government with 
     <lb/>
     other forms of government. Mr. Chairman, it is 
     <lb/>
     generally recognised these days that New<lb break="no"/>foundland is at a crossroads. For good or ill we 
     <lb/>
     who are living today have the great responsibility 
     <lb/>
     of deciding on what road our country will travel. 
     <lb/>
     I say therefore, that it is the duty of this house and 
     <lb/>
     indeed the duty of every Newfoundlander listen<lb break="no"/>ing to my voice, to do his part to enlighten his 
     <lb/>
     fellow men, to assist those who are not fully 
     <lb/>
     informed on the real situation to see the light. We 
     <lb/>
     lost our government in 1933 because the people 
     <lb/>
     were kept in the dark. Let us see that it does not 
     <lb/>
     happen again. We have now a chance to rectify 
     <lb/>
     our past mistakes, but this time there will be no 
     <lb/>
     chance to undo our action. This time it will be for 
     <lb/>
     keeps. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Reviewing this whole matter, there is one 
     <lb/>
     feature which we must not overlook, and it is this: 
     <lb/>
     if in the future it should ever become necessary 
     <lb/>
     for us to unite with any other country (which I 
     <lb/>
     trust will never happen), then is it not necessary 
     <lb/>
     for us to have a free hand to make whatever deal 
     <lb/>
     we wish? For myself, if such a time ever came, I 
     <lb/>
     think it would be most advisable that we be able, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, to discuss matters with the United 
     <lb/>
     States of America. Do we want to shut ourselves 
     <lb/>
     off from such a position? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, if the people of our country had 
     <lb/>
     been sufficiently informed on this matter, there 
     <lb/>
     would be no need of me or anybody else making 
     <lb/>
     speeches. But as it is we must, every one of us 
  

            <pb n="1329" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1329.jpg"/>

     who has the interests of Newfoundland at heart, 
     <lb/>
     leave no stone unturned to show our people, the 
     <lb/>
     people who sent us here and are depending on us, 
     <lb/>
     the light, the truth. I know something of the 
     <lb/>
     common people of this country. I know that you 
     <lb/>
     can come along with a fairy tale and fool them 
     <lb/>
     for a while, but I also know that you can't fool 
     <lb/>
     them long. Soon their keen minds see through the 
     <lb/>
     sham. Soon they see the story behind the story, 
     <lb/>
     and when they do, they act quickly and with 
     <lb/>
     decision. Today Iceland is getting the sum of $13 
     <lb/>
     million under the Marshall Plan — what is New<lb break="no"/>foundland getting? Who is there to look out for 
     <lb/>
     her interests? Will we ever get anything? Will we 
     <lb/>
     ever get back the money shipped to England? 
     <lb/>
     How different things would be if we had had a 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundlanders! Yes, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, I say a labour government would do no harm. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I could go on in this way, 
     <lb/>
     giving you facts and reasons as to why there is 
     <lb/>
     and can only be the one proper form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this country, but I think I have said 
     <lb/>
     enough to satisfy the mind of every real New<lb break="no"/>foundlander. If I have helped to do this in any 
     <lb/>
     small way, then I think I have done my duty to 
     <lb/>
     my country and the people whose interests I am 
     <lb/>
     here to safeguard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, soon we shall leave this cham<lb break="no"/>ber to return to our respective homes, and it is not 
     <lb/>
     likely ever we shall all meet together again. To 
     <lb/>
     you, sir, and all present, I trust that at the end of 
     <lb/>
     life's disappointing road we shall be found ready 
     <lb/>
     and worthy of entering into that holy chamber 
     <lb/>
     where there is no need for divisions and where 
     <lb/>
     the "ayes" have it forever. Thank you, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I move we rise until 8 o'clock.

            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think at this time, as the cham<lb break="no"/>ber is very hot, we should rise. It is ten to six, so

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Before the debate proceeds, I 
     <lb/>
     rise to ask your direction. In view of the state<lb break="no"/>ments made this afternoon by Mr. Bradley, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to know from you what the position is 
     <lb/>
     under the terms of the National Convention Act 
     <lb/>
     and the rules of the Convention, with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the motion that is on the order paper in my name 
     <lb/>
     should the present motion before the Chair be 
     <lb/>
     adopted. What I mean is this. The present motion 
     <lb/>
     in its present form may or may not be adopted. 
     <lb/>
     Assuming that it is adopted, does that mean that 
  

            <cb/>
         

     my motion proposing another form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment be submitted to the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government — recommended to them for sub<lb break="no"/>mission to the Newfoundland people in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum — will not then be received by the 
     <lb/>
     Chair and debated and voted on, or any other 
     <lb/>
     form of government? Does it mean that all mem<lb break="no"/>bers who vote for it cannot then vote for, or 
     <lb/>
     propose any other form of government to be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the people? Or if any of us do not 
     <lb/>
     vote, are we then free to consider any other form? 
     <lb/>
     Does this motion exclude consideration and 
     <lb/>
     recommendation of any other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment? I would like your ruling on that, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point is this: whether or 
     <lb/>
     not the present motion, if adopted, would exclude 
     <lb/>
     discussion on your motion of which I have notice, 
     <lb/>
     or discussion on any other form of government 
     <lb/>
     of which I may receive notice. Does the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of this motion mean the exclusion of discussion 
     <lb/>
     on your motion, is that your point? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, and is Mr. Higgins' mo<lb break="no"/>tion in its present form <hi rendition="simple:italic">intra vires</hi> or <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> 
     <lb/>
     of the National Convention Act? Is it a good 
     <lb/>
     motion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It has been passed by the Chair<lb break="no"/>man.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, it has not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You allowed me to put it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have not put it yet. It has to be 
     <lb/>
     proposed from the Chair before it is put. I will 
     <lb/>
     have to try to resolve this problem, which is of a 
     <lb/>
     twofold nature under standing orders 24 and 39. 
     <lb/>
     Rule 24 provides, "No member may speak to any 
     <lb/>
     question after it has been put by the Chairman and 
     <lb/>
     the voices have been given in the affirmative or 
     <lb/>
     negative thereon." And in that connection, Sir 
     <lb/>
     Erskine May, pages 418-19: "No member may 
     <lb/>
     speak to any question after the same has been 
     <lb/>
     fully put by the Speaker; and a question is fully 
     <lb/>
     put when he has taken the voices of both the 
     <lb/>
     'ayes' and the 'nos'." Now, if the present motion 
     <lb/>
     or resolution is either carried or negatived, it 
     <lb/>
     precludes thereafter any discussion on Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government or responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     Once it is disposed of one way or the other, it is 
     <lb/>
     over and done with and that is the end of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next thing, arising out of the remarks of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley and of Mr. Hollett, is to determine 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the adoption of this motion would 
     <lb/>
     exclude discussion on your motion, or on any 
  

            <pb n="1330" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1330.jpg"/>

     other motion covering any other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. In that connection, before I come to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the form of the motion itself, rule 39 says, 
     <lb/>
     "In discharging its duties to make recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions to His Majesty's Government in the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom as to the possible forms of future govern<lb break="no"/>ment to be put before the people at a National 
     <lb/>
     Referendum, the Convention shall include in its 
     <lb/>
     report to the Secretary of State for Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Affairs the opinion of each several member of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention as to the form of government which 
     <lb/>
     in his opinion should be put before the people, 
     <lb/>
     together with any preference which he may 
     <lb/>
     choose to express as between one form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment and another." The rule therefore requires 
     <lb/>
     the Convention to express or record the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of each and every member of the Convention as 
     <lb/>
     to the form or forms of government which in his 
     <lb/>
     opinion should be put before the people; and 
     <lb/>
     secondly, shall also record any preference which 
     <lb/>
     he may choose to express (he does not <hi rendition="simple:italic">have</hi> to) 
     <lb/>
     as between one form of government and another. 
     <lb/>
     In other words, this rule requires the Convention 
     <lb/>
     to record the opinion of each and every member 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention on the form or forms of 
     <lb/>
     government which he thinks should be included 
     <lb/>
     in the referendum. Now the question is whether 
     <lb/>
     or not the motion in its present form prevents the 
     <lb/>
     very thing that rule 39 requires to be done. That 
     <lb/>
     is to say, could any member or members express 
     <lb/>
     their opinions upon any forms of government 
     <lb/>
     other than the two referred to in the motion? I do 
     <lb/>
     not know how you feel about this, Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>
     but I feel the motion quite definitely confines the 
     <lb/>
     Convention to recommending the two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government covered by your motion, and these 
     <lb/>
     two forms only. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I do not think so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Frankly, I am not too sure on 
     <lb/>
     that point, because if it did, it would be <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> 
     <lb/>
     to rule 39 — if you confined discussion to these 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government only.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It has not done so, so far. It certain<lb break="no"/>ly has not confined discussion on the motion that

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The question I am concerned

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the motion does, I do not think

     I can accept it. I must accept the motion on

     Commission of Government and responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. I must do that. But I will not accept 
     <lb/>
     it to the exclusion of any other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in view of rule 39 which says "the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of each member on <hi rendition="simple:italic">any form</hi>" — as I see it, it may 
     <lb/>
     be union with Soviet Russia or anything else — 
     <lb/>
     if he chooses to express his opinions, then it is the 
     <lb/>
     duty of the Convention to record his opinion 
     <lb/>
     together with any preference he might have as 
     <lb/>
     against other forms of government, and the form 
     <lb/>
     or forms recommended by him.

     <lb/>
     mere rule of procedure adopted when we started 
     <lb/>
     business in this House, it has nothing to do with 
     <lb/>
     section 3. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It has everything to do with it. 
     <lb/>
     Section 3 lays upon us the duty of section 4,

     which says we "shall make rules and by-laws 
     <lb/>
     governing our own procedure and they shall not

     here to guide us on forms of government, and 
     <lb/>
     since he is not here I think it is up to us to make 
     <lb/>
     up our own minds what to do. I would not be a

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Not only is the point which you 
     <lb/>
     have taken, one which is well taken — I want to 
     <lb/>
     point out to this Convention again what perhaps 
     <lb/>
    I did not succeed in explaining very clearly this 
     <lb/>afternoon — but this resolution of Mr. Higgins is 
     <lb/>one which definitely asks the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to choose one of two forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, no other is mentioned. Now, if that 
     <lb/>resolution is adopted, obviously the question 
     <lb/>which is to be put to the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>is, "Which of these two do you choose?" That is 
     <lb/>the question. That is the recommendation which 
     <lb/>will go to the Dominions Office, and if the 
  

    
            <pb n="1331" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1331.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1331</fw>
          

     Dominions Office is to implement that resolution 
     <lb/>
     which we pass in that form, then they must put 
     <lb/>
     that question to the people of Newfoundland: 
     <lb/>
     "Which of these two forms do you choose?" 
     <lb/>
     Now, having voted by a majority to ask the 
     <lb/>
     British government to ask the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland that question, how can we in common 
     <lb/>
     sense introduce a third? If we were to adopt 
     <lb/>
     another resolution to bring in a third form of 
     <lb/>
     government, then we destroy the original motion 
     <lb/>
     which has been carried. It is a complete negation 
     <lb/>
     of the motion which we carried first. How can we 
     <lb/>
     ask them to choose between two and then place 
     <lb/>
     a third on the ballot paper? It is completely sense<lb break="no"/>less. Not only is that so, but the effect of the 
     <lb/>
     passage of such a resolution would be in fact to 
     <lb/>
     confine the decision of this Convention to two 
     <lb/>
     forms, and we could not add another without first 
     <lb/>
     rescinding the first resolution. Here we have a 
     <lb/>
     resolution adopted by this Convention to place 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government as alternatives before 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country. How can you add a 
     <lb/>
     third, without rescinding a prior resolution? It is 
     <lb/>
     a complete negation of the prior resolution. In 
     <lb/>
     order for Mr. Smallwood's motion to be in order, 
     <lb/>
     we would have to rescind Mr. Higgins' resolution 
     <lb/>
     if we adopted it. I made the second point in 
     <lb/>
     connection with our duty under the Convention 
     <lb/>
     Act to recommend (and if I misquote will some<lb break="no"/>one please correct me) to the Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     or the British government forms of government 
     <lb/>
     to be submitted to the people of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Am I correct there?

     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> It gives no right to the Convention 
     <lb/>
     that we shall submit thus and such forms of 
     <lb/>
     government to put before the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland; it gives us authority to recommend 
     <lb/>
     certain forms to be submitted, it gives no 
     <lb/>
     authority to say thus and such shall <hi rendition="simple:italic">not</hi> be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people of Newfoundland, and the 
     <lb/>
     effect of this resolution is clearly to exclude the 
     <lb/>
     laying of any other form of government before 
     <lb/>
     the people. It is wholly within the province of the 
     <lb/>
     British government itself to say what shall not be 
     <lb/>
     set before the people of Newfoundland at the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. They have authority to throw out any 
     <lb/>
     recommendation that we may make. We have no

     authority whatsoever to make a negative recom<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     mendation, none. There can be found no such 
     <lb/>
     power in the Convention Act. There are the plain 
     <lb/>
     words: "to recommend forms of government to 
     <lb/>
     be submitted", not to recommend that any par<lb break="no"/>ticular forms they dislike shall not be submitted. 
     <lb/>
     That is a matter for the British government, not 
     <lb/>
     for us.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I agree with Mr. Bradley, but being 
     <lb/>
     a layman and not a lawyer, whatI want to know 
     <lb/>
     is why we discussed this resolution for four or 
     <lb/>
     five days, and at this point this question arises? 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It was raised this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I can give Mr. Crosbie some light 
     <lb/>on that. Possibly I am at fault. As you know, for 
     <lb/>the last two months I have not been in the pink of 
     <lb/>condition. When Mr. Higgins made his first 
     <lb/>resolution, or gave notice of motion before the 
     <lb/>Christmas vacation, I had read the resolution and 
     <lb/>was frankly of the opinion that it was entirely 
     <lb/>outside our province and should not be received. 
     <lb/>When I returned, some eight or ten days late, after 
     <lb/>the Christmas vacation, I was informed that Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins had withdrawn his motion and substi<lb break="no"/>tuted another one which was, in effect, to place 
     <lb/>Commission government and responsible 
     <lb/>government upon the ballot. With that resolution, 
     <lb/>in substance, I was in complete accord. I did not 
     <lb/>bother my head any further about it. I did not even 
     <lb/>bother to read the resolution. Yesterday after<lb break="no"/>noon I was sitting here at my desk and the order 
     <lb/>paper was here, and quite by accident I picked it 
     <lb/>up and read it. As soon as I read it I saw where, 
     <lb/>in my opinion, it was completely outside our 
     <lb/>jurisdiction to receive any such resolution or vote 
     <lb/>on it. I drew it to the attention of this house at the 
     <lb/>earliest possible date. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I agree with Mr. Bradley's ex<lb break="no"/>planation. From my point of view, we are 45 men 
     <lb/>
     here, and I do not think any one of us wants to 
     <lb/>
     railroad anything through. If there is, I do not 
     <lb/>
     want to be a party to it. I know that one or two 
     <lb/>
     members are sick, but the members present can 
     <lb/>
     settle this thing between ourselves. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     anyone here is trying to block any form of 
     <lb/>
     government. After all, as I said, we had a political 
     <lb/>
     economist — he was over there where Mr. House 
     <lb/>
     is now sitting — he stayed here a week or ten days 
     <lb/>
     and we have not seen him since. I am not a 
     <lb/>
     lawyer, but to me it is just plain ordinary sense 
     <lb/>
     for us to settle this discussion. I think we can 
     <lb/>
     settle the question and go on.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will make my position clear. 
     <lb/>
     What I do tonight and what I do the week after 
     <lb/>
     next are two entirely different things, but certain 
     <lb/>
     it is I am not going to run the risk of excluding 
     <lb/>
     discussion on any form of government which 
     <lb/>
     may be desired by any member of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. It has been suggested to me here in effect 
     <lb/>
     that these rules are relatively unimportant. I say 
     <lb/>
     they are of the utmost importance for this reason: 
     <lb/>
     they were made pursuant to section 4 of the Act. 
     <lb/>
     The Act says, "No rules shall be amended, altered 
     <lb/>
     or repealed except by two-thirds vote of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Convention." Therefore I will have to 
     <lb/>
     enforce it. Every man shall be free to express his 
     <lb/>
     own opinion on forms of government. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     it never occurred to me that this motion was 
     <lb/>
     designed to cut off discussion of the other form 
     <lb/>
     of government of which I have notice on the order 
     <lb/>
     paper. I am going to take the only position I can. 
     <lb/>
     That is, the motion will have to be amended. But 
     <lb/>
     I want to resolve any doubt, and there appears to 
     <lb/>
     be grave doubt, and if it is correct that this motion 
     <lb/>
     if carried would preclude discussion on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's motion, I think that ambiguity and 
     <lb/>
     doubt has to be resolved. I will accept the motion 
     <lb/>
     covering responsible government and Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government, but not to the exclusion of the 
     <lb/>
     form of government next on the order paper, of 
     <lb/>
     which I have notice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Do I understand you to say, with 
     <lb/>
     any other form added it would be accepted by 
     <lb/>
     you? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The minimum would have to be 
     <lb/>
     two forms.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You said if another form was 
     <lb/>
     added to it, you would accept it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> If it was amended in that form. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I suggested you would include 
     <lb/>another form of government. Now it is said you 
     <lb/>included that form to the exclusion of the other 
     <lb/>one on the order paper, which is something which 
     <lb/>never occurred to me until three o'clock this 
     <lb/>afternoon. It was you, Mr. Hollett and Mr. Brad<lb break="no"/>ley, who called my attention to it. Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>contends this is designed to exclude the discus<lb break="no"/>sion on the form of government on the next order 
     <lb/>paper. That being so, I am in a very dangerous 
     <lb/>position here.

     put any other form of government I did not ap<lb break="no"/>prove of in that motion. But to exclude any other 
     <lb/>
     form of government from future debate is not and 
     <lb/>
     was not intended by me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> If you will permit me, sir, I think 
     <lb/>
     the whole matter can be simply resolved. Per<lb break="no"/>sonally, I think the whole procedure, while not 
     <lb/>
     exactly wrong, was not as neat as it might have 
     <lb/>
     been. My own view is, the proper way to deal 
     <lb/>
     with each of these forms is to take them singly; 
     <lb/>
     after all, our duty is to decide as to what forms 
     <lb/>
     might be suitable to the people of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The Chairman would not take them 
     <lb/>singly; it was not acceptable in that form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I could rule out your motion, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins, for six reasons — every recital in 
     <lb/>
     that motion was something over which the House 
     <lb/>
     has no jurisdiction. Your motion in its original 
     <lb/>
     form was to put one form of government on to the 
     <lb/>
     exclusion of all others.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I endeavoured to meet the objec<lb break="no"/>tion by putting two forms on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I think each form could have been 
     <lb/>
     taken separately and dealt with in a manner that 
     <lb/>
     would not have been in any way exclusive. If we 
     <lb/>
     had a resolution for instance that Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government be placed on the ballot paper, that 
     <lb/>
     would have been adopted and that would not 
     <lb/>
     exclude anything else. It would be dealing with 
     <lb/>
     one form — we would say, "Yes, that is one form 
     <lb/>
     which ought to be submitted to the people, we 
     <lb/>
     will put that on." Then we take responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, we discuss that and we come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion, "Yes, that is also a form which shall 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the people." We are then finished 
     <lb/>
     with that. Then we take any other form we want 
     <lb/>
     to consider and discuss that, we may decide to put 
     <lb/>
     it on or not as the case may be — each should 
     <lb/>
     have been taken separately. That was not done. 
     <lb/>
     What was done in the first instance was this 
     <lb/>
     resolution was introduced to place one form on 
     <lb/>
     the ballot paper, and reading that resolution ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the concepts of the English language, 
     <lb/>
     it was to the exclusion of all others. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am satisfied about that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> That you properly rejected. We 
     <lb/>
     have now a resolution with two forms to the

     exclusion of all others. There is no difference in 
     <lb/>
     principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I see your point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> My suggestion is that if Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins has no intention of excluding discussion on 
     <lb/>
     other forms...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I can assure you he has not.

      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Whether it was designed intention<lb break="no"/>ally or not, I cannot say. I can not see into Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins' mind any more than into his digestion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You saw into it this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> My suggestion to Mr. Higgins is 
     <lb/>this, that he alter it to read "That Commission 
     <lb/>government and responsible government be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people at the referendum." That 
     <lb/>would cover the whole thing and it would leave 
     <lb/>the field free for any other forms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In view of that fact, can we not 
     <lb/>
     get out of this difficult situation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> As seconder of Mr. Higgins' mo<lb break="no"/>tion, I do not see, frankly, there is anything there 
     <lb/>
     from which we should withdraw. I have been 
     <lb/>
     looking at it from all angles. I would like to ask, 
     <lb/>
     what would be the position if Mr. Higgins' mo<lb break="no"/>tion recommended responsible government and 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada, and left out Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Same thing. It would be equally 
     <lb/>
     objectionable.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I wonder would you have taken the 
     <lb/>
     same objection?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Yes, definitely so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Frankly, I was worried. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley brought it to my attention first and then 
     <lb/>
     he was followed by Mr. Hollett. In view of the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, it appears now that if I accepted 
     <lb/>
     the motion it would be cutting off any discussion 
     <lb/>
     on the next motion, I would have to rule under 
     <lb/>
     order 34 that you could not deal with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's motion. I do not want to be put in 
     <lb/>
     that position. I am not going to be put in that 
     <lb/>
     position.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Do I take it that if I change this

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> If I might interject a word. We met

     in private session and decided all this. I do not

     think there was any intention in Mr. Higgins' 
     <lb/>
     motion to preclude any other form of government 
     <lb/>
     whatever. As a matter of fact, we decided at the 
     <lb/>
     private meeting we were going to end this tonight 
     <lb/>
     and the other one was going to start right away. 
     <lb/>
     You cannot say that there was any scheming or 
     <lb/>
     any skulduggery intended. I am quite behind the 
     <lb/>
     idea that we should discuss other forms, and I

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> Mr. Chairman, at long last we find 
     <lb/>
     ourselves approaching the end, and soon our 
     <lb/>
     deliberations here will conclude to await the ver<lb break="no"/>dict of history. I support the resolution moved by 
     <lb/>
     my learned friend, Mr. Higgins, and in doing so 
     <lb/>
     will briefly comment on the two forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment embodied in that resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First of all, I believe in responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I know it must be right in principle, and I 
     <lb/>
     believe it can be made to work in practice. It is 
     <lb/>
     now, and always has been the goal of civilised 
     <lb/>
     humanity. All down through the ages, men have 
     <lb/>
     struggled to achieve and maintain their indepen<lb break="no"/>dence. Twice in our time we have seen the 
     <lb/>
     freedom-loving nations of the world wage inter<lb break="no"/>necine war in defence of the very principles em<lb break="no"/>bodied in responsible government, and it is not 
     <lb/>
     necessary for me to remind you that New<lb break="no"/>foundland acquitted herself nobly and well on 
     <lb/>
     both occasions. Therefore, gentlemen, the innate 
     <lb/>
     desire for self-government finds its roots in the 
     <lb/>
     natural aspirations of the human mind toward 
     <lb/>
     independence. The Burmese have it. The Hindus 
     <lb/>
     and Moslems of India have it. The largely il<lb break="no"/>literate coloured folk of Jamaica have it. Surely 
     <lb/>
     it must also lurk in the souls of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, who first won autonomy when 
     <lb/>
     the population was less than 100,000 and the 
    

            <cb/>
          

     annual revenue around $500,000, as Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     reminded us on Monday. Gentlemen, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion responsible government is the proper 
     <lb/>
     course for an independent people to take. That 
     <lb/>
     does not mean cutting ourselves adrift from the 
     <lb/>
     world, as some of you would have us believe. 0n 
     <lb/>
     the contrary, it affords us greater opportunity, it 
     <lb/>
     gives us a free hand to conclude arrangements 
     <lb/>
     with any country, should the opportunity present 
     <lb/>
     itself. And to those who desire a closer relation<lb break="no"/>ship with the United States, it must be evident that 
     <lb/>
     responsible government is the only means of 
     <lb/>
     attaining that end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, thousands of young New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, on whom will shortly be placed the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of determining our future form of 
     <lb/>
     government, like myself have no personal recol<lb break="no"/>lection of responsible government in this 
     <lb/>
     country. For I will remind you that nobody in this 
     <lb/>
     country under 35 years of age ever had the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of marking a ballot to determine the 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the affairs of their country. And that 
     <lb/>
     is why so many are inclined to accept as true the 
     <lb/>
     hearsay that corrupt and incompetent govern<lb break="no"/>ments caused the financial debacle of the early 
     <lb/>
     thirties. They do not realise that it was mainly due 
     <lb/>
     to the condition of the time brought about by 
     <lb/>
     external circumstances over which our govern<lb break="no"/>ment had no control. The entire world was 
     <lb/>
     plunged into the direst depression it had ever 
     <lb/>
     known, Britain herself went through the gravest 
     <lb/>
     financial crisis in her history, and millions went 
     <lb/>
     on the unemployment rolls in Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     United States. Confusion reigned everywhere, 
     <lb/>
     people lost faith in everything and governments 
     <lb/>
     became the principal scapegoats, and thus were 
     <lb/>
     sown the seeds that today bear fruit in the unjust 
     <lb/>
     condemnation of responsible government. Let 
     <lb/>
     me remind the apostles of Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government that when it assumed power on that 
     <lb/>
     bleak February day in 1934, with all its ingenuity 
     <lb/>
     and skill in the art of tax extraction, it could find 
     <lb/>
     nothing better for our people than six cents a day 
     <lb/>
     dole for five long years, and an annual deficit — 
     <lb/>
     which, by the way, they did not have to worry 
     <lb/>
     about. This should prove beyond reasonable 
     <lb/>
     doubt that there was more wrong at that time than 
     <lb/>
     the form of government. It is evident that the 
     <lb/>
     change to Commission did nothing to improve 
     <lb/>
     our condition until the beginning of the war, 
     <lb/>
     when demand for our products coupled with our

     strategic importance gave the country revenues 
     <lb/>
     undreamed of before, and are we going to thank 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government for this? Surely, no 
     <lb/>
     right thinking person would. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Hear! Hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I contend, gentlemen, that if we had 
     <lb/>
     had responsible government during this boom 
     <lb/>
     period we would be in a far better position than 
     <lb/>
     we are today. Any body of Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     would have had the interests of this country more 
     <lb/>
     at heart, and would have made the most of the 
     <lb/>
     many opportunities which offered to further the 
     <lb/>
     interests of their native land. But what happened? 
     <lb/>
     This dictatorial Commission played Santa Claus 
     <lb/>
     to all and sundry with utter disregard for the 
     <lb/>
     people's future welfare. They have collected un<lb break="no"/>dreamed of revenues, and in the last two or three 
     <lb/>
     years in particular they have gone to great pains 
     <lb/>
     to spend every last cent and if possible to create 
     <lb/>
     a deficit. In my opinion, any government with the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the country at heart should have cur<lb break="no"/>tailed expenditures at this time and built up a 
     <lb/>
     greater surplus, in order to adequately tide us over 
     <lb/>
     the recession period through which the world is 
     <lb/>
     bound to pass during the transition from a war to 
     <lb/>
     peace economy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, there is but one sane course 
     <lb/>
     open to the people of this country, and that is to 
     <lb/>
     become masters in their own house by returning 
     <lb/>
     to responsible government. Then, and not till 
     <lb/>
     then, will they be free to give expression to their 
     <lb/>
     beliefs without fear of outside interference. We 
     <lb/>
     all know that governments in the past were not 
     <lb/>
     perfect. No government is, but gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     democracy reveals the virtues of the people as 
     <lb/>
     well as their vices, and it is because their virtues 
     <lb/>
     are greater than their vices that democracy has 
     <lb/>
     become the form of government to which the 
     <lb/>
     most progressive nations of the world adhere. 
     <lb/>
     Surely, we can do nothing but honour the 
     <lb/>
     memory of those great Newfoundlanders who 
     <lb/>
     nearly a century ago won for this country the right 
     <lb/>
     of self-determination. They realised and ap<lb break="no"/>preciated the freedom of democracy; will not we, 
     <lb/>
     in this our hour of trial, prove that we too are 
     <lb/>
     equal to the task and will sustain them in their 
     <lb/>
     historic decision to be free? We know the errors 
     <lb/>
     of the past, and would undoubtedly profit by 
     <lb/>
     them, and I contend that under a responsible 
     <lb/>
     government set up along the lines suggested by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman in his masterly address, we could 


            <cb/>
       

     have nothing to fear. We have the men, let us give 
     <lb/>
     them a chance to prove their worth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These, Mr. Chairman, are briefly my views on 
     <lb/>
     the matter of forms of government, or at least on 
     <lb/>
     the forms within the compass of this resolution. 
     <lb/>
     They have been my views for a long time, sir, 
     <lb/>
     long before I heard of this Convention, and as this 
     <lb/>
     Convention draws to its inevitable end, I feel a 
     <lb/>
     sense of satisfaction in the fact that during our 
     <lb/>
     deliberations I have found nothing to cause me to 
     <lb/>
     change my views, but on the contrary, I have 
     <lb/>
     found much to confirm and substantiate them. 
     <lb/>
     Among many things which tended to strengthen 
     <lb/>
     my belief were the findings of the several com<lb break="no"/>mittees, the statements of the many prominent 
     <lb/>
     men I had the privilege of meeting and the hope<lb break="no"/>ful and optimistic attitude of the majority of my 
     <lb/>
     fellow delegates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I want to draw the attention of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention to the fact that the cost of living 
     <lb/>
     has been increasing in all North American 
     <lb/>
     countries at a very high rate. Newfoundland has 
     <lb/>
     not been exempt in this respect. However, I want 
     <lb/>
     to draw to your attention the fact that recently the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Civil Service Association have 
     <lb/>
     been negotiating with the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government with regard to obtaining an increase 
     <lb/>
     in their salaries to cope with this advance in the 
     <lb/>
     high cost of living. Their request has been prac<lb break="no"/>tically ignored by the Commission. Do you think, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, that such an action can be termed 
     <lb/>
     fair or honest, particularly in view of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     less than two years ago the Newfoundland mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Commission had their own salaries 
     <lb/>
     increased by $2,000 per year, or an increase of 
     <lb/>
     25%, whilst at the same time the salary of the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman of the Commission has been increased 
     <lb/>
     by nearly 40%? Another point in respect to this 
     <lb/>
     matter is the fact that the British members of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission receive a sustenance allowance of 
     <lb/>
     around $4,000 a year annually, and other British 
     <lb/>
     civil servants receive preferential treatment with 
     <lb/>
     regard to subsistence allowances. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I consider such treatment of our own New<lb break="no"/>foundland officials nothing short of scandalous, 
     <lb/>
     and whilst I appreciate that many of the civil 
     <lb/>
     servants receive substantial salaries, I also know 
     <lb/>
     that the great majority of them are receiving 
     <lb/>
     hardly sufficient to keep body and soul together. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said, sir, that I had fixed ideas of the matter 
     <lb/>
     of governments prior to my coming to this Con<lb break="no"/>

     vention, and on that score, gentlemen, I may be 
     <lb/>
     accused of not possessing that doubtful asset, an 
     <lb/>
     open mind. Be that as it may. I am content in the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge that I had the courage of my convic<lb break="no"/>tions and publicly made known my views well in 
     <lb/>
     advance of the Convention election. Every per<lb break="no"/>son in my district who did me the honour of 
     <lb/>
     voting for me, did so with the full knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     my intentions and desires. I therefore feel that my 
     <lb/>
     decision in this matter is not wholly personal, 
     <lb/>
     selfish or unsupported. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Mr. Chairman, I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     make a long speech on the two forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment now under fire in this House. First because 
     <lb/>
     we are not here to make any decisions, and 
     <lb/>
     secondly because the decision that is to be made 
     <lb/>
     will be made, so we are told in the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act, by the electorate of this country 
     <lb/>
     at a national referendum. I am supporting the 
     <lb/>
     motion now before the Chair... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not voting to try and force any one form 
     <lb/>
     of government on the people. I personally realise 
     <lb/>
     my responsibility. What can we do, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man? The National Convention Act tells us that 
     <lb/>
     we have to make recommendations to the British 
     <lb/>
     government. We have to recommend what forms 
     <lb/>
     of government will be submitted to our people for 
     <lb/>
     the referendum. This motion is now doing just 
     <lb/>
     that. I am in favour of supporting this resolution 
     <lb/>
     as it is now, so that the people may have a chance 
     <lb/>
     to decide the form of government they think best, 
     <lb/>
     and I am happy to leave the choice of our future 
     <lb/>
     government in the hands of our people. I am glad 
     <lb/>
     that we, as a National Convention, are not asked 
     <lb/>
     to make the final decision on such an important 
     <lb/>
     question. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to be 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood in this thing. I will be voting to 
     <lb/>
     recommend that these two forms of government 
     <lb/>
     should be submitted to our people for their 
     <lb/>
     choice. I am not now called upon to vote for any 
     <lb/>
     one form of government, but when the referen<lb break="no"/>dum is held, and I have to cast my vote like all 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the people, I will certainly give it some 
     <lb/>
     deep thought before I vote for either responsible 
     <lb/>
     or Commission government. Both myself and the 
     <lb/>
     people have seen quite a lot of both kinds of 
     <lb/>
     government, and I would certainly never vote for 
     <lb/>
     either of them if I had a chance to vote for 
     <lb/>
     something better. There is one thing I am sure 
     <lb/>
     about, and it is this, that our people certainly want 
     <lb/>
     something better than we have had under respon<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>
        
     sible government and in fact under Commission 
     <lb/>
     government as well. Our people have long 
     <lb/>
     memories, they remember what things were like 
     <lb/>
     under the dying days of responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     and also under Commission of Government for 
     <lb/>
     the first six or seven years until the war started, 
     <lb/>
     and our prosperity improved considerably, 
     <lb/>
     through the war. They still remember, and what 
     <lb/>
     they want now is some form of government that 
     <lb/>
     would give them a better chance to live than any 
     <lb/>
     we have yet had. We have been told a lot about 
     <lb/>
     the Amulree royal commission and about Letters 
     <lb/>
     Patent, and all that sort of thing. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     our people do not worry their heads about such 
     <lb/>
     things. All that is now past, and our people are 
     <lb/>
     not worried about legal documents made years 
     <lb/>
     and years ago. They have more important and 
     <lb/>
     personal matters to worry about. Their hope is 
     <lb/>
     that they will be able to get three square meals a 
     <lb/>
     day for themselves and their families, and a dollar 
     <lb/>
     in their pockets when they want it. What our 
     <lb/>
     people are worried about is how they are going 
     <lb/>
     to get a form of government that will give them 
     <lb/>
     a better chance to live. They are worried about 
     <lb/>
     what is going to happen when world depression 
     <lb/>
     comes back again. They are worried what is 
     <lb/>
     going to happen to them should the price of fish 
     <lb/>
     take another fall in price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suppose, Mr. Chairman, that every member 
     <lb/>
     has made up his mind by now what form of 
     <lb/>
     government he likes, and what form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment he thinks would be best for the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country, and so have I, but that has nothing 
     <lb/>
     to do with the motion before us today. We are 
     <lb/>
     asked to say what form of government we favour. 
     <lb/>
     The motion does not say that no other form of 
     <lb/>
     government cannot or should not be submitted to 
     <lb/>
     the people, but that these two forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be submitted to the people. Some of 
     <lb/>
     the people who will be called upon to make their 
     <lb/>
     decision at the national referendum will be the 
     <lb/>
     sons and daughters of fathers and mothers who 
     <lb/>
     had to exist, through no fault of their own, on dole 
     <lb/>
     through the dying days of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and for six or seven years after the present 
     <lb/>
     form of government was borne into the country. 
     <lb/>
     Some of the people who will be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     vote are men now who were boys then, and were 
     <lb/>
     at that time suffering under the burden of poverty 
     <lb/>
     through no fault of their own in most cases, and 
     <lb/>
     who were compelled to live in some cases with

     nothing on their backs but an oat sack, with their 
     <lb/>
     head up through the bottom and their arms out 
     <lb/>
     through the sides. There will be mothers who will 
     <lb/>
     be asked to make their decision, who will remem<lb break="no"/>ber that under responsible government and Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government for some years, there was 
     <lb/>
     nothing but the one garment on their backs, and 
     <lb/>
     that, sir, was made out of flour sacks. They are 
     <lb/>
     not unmindful of the fact, sir, that under the forms 
     <lb/>
     of government they have had, they have suffered 
     <lb/>
     untold agony and poverty. Some who will be 
     <lb/>
     given the privilege to vote will be the sons and 
     <lb/>
     daughters of fathers and mothers who have 
     <lb/>
     passed out of this life through poverty and want 
     <lb/>
     — mothers who had nothing on their backs but a 
     <lb/>
     daughter's apron for a singlet and a boat sail for 
     <lb/>
     an eiderdown. Men and women today who were 
     <lb/>
     boys and girls a few years ago, will remember and 
     <lb/>
     can picture their mothers mixing flour with water 
     <lb/>
     only, and crusting it on the top of a stove without 
     <lb/>
     fat, and sitting down to eat it with nothing but 
     <lb/>
     warm water, that to keep body and soul together. 
     <lb/>
     One thing we are certain of, sir, and that is that a 
     <lb/>
     great majority of the 80,000 sons and daughters, 
     <lb/>
     mothers and fathers, who were compelled 
     <lb/>
     through no fault of their own to live on $21.60 
     <lb/>
     per year per person, $1.80 per month or six cents 
     <lb/>
     per day per person, they, sir, are some of the men 
     <lb/>
     and women who will decide at the national 
     <lb/>
     referendum what form of government they think 
     <lb/>
     best suited for their country and ourselves.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I can well remember the time 
     <lb/>
     that the members elected under responsible 
     <lb/>
     government were given a permit to carry a re<lb break="no"/>volver to protect their lives right here in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's. I can still picture the gang on Duckworth 
     <lb/>
     Street with a 40-foot pole trying to break into a 
     <lb/>
     public building. I can still picture this very build<lb break="no"/>ing that we are in tonight with the windows 
     <lb/>
     broken out, and the only exit for the men to get

     out of the chamber was to go down those winding 
     <lb/>
     stairs in the comer and pass out through the 
     <lb/>
     broken window — in some cases, sir, disguised, 
     <lb/>
     so that they would not be recognised by the gang 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEN3">Mr. Spencer</persName> Mr. Chairman, in rising to speak 
     <lb/>on the motion of Mr. Higgins now before the 
     <lb/>Chair, let me say at the outset that I intend to 
     <lb/>support the motion, but it does not necessarily 
     <lb/>follow that I think either of the forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment now before the House the best form for this 
     <lb/>country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

  
            <p>
     I do not think responsible government, as it 
     <lb/>
     existed prior to 1934, would be the best form for 
     <lb/>
     this country. First, because I do not see how 
     <lb/>
     320,000 people scattered over 150,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles of territory can be expected to raise revenue 
     <lb/>
     enough to give them the public and social ser<lb break="no"/>vices they need and will demand, and still allow 
     <lb/>
     them enough to attain the standard of living en<lb break="no"/>joyed by the peoples of the North American 
     <lb/>
     continent. And secondly, if we return to self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government, we shall still have to raise the bulk 
     <lb/>
     of our revenue by the system of indirect taxation, 
     <lb/>
     which to me is unsound and unfair. Thirdly, with 
     <lb/>
     our small population, I fail to see how we can 
     <lb/>
     expect to have any large internal industries. Let 
     <lb/>
     me explain what I mean. When I worked on the 
     <lb/>
     Agriculture Committee of this Convention, we 
     <lb/>
     took up with the departmental heads concerned 
     <lb/>
     the question of fertilisers. We inquired if it was 
     <lb/>
     possible to manufacture fertilisers in this country 
     <lb/>
     cheaper than we could import them; we were 
     <lb/>
     informed that most of the ingredients would have 
     <lb/>
     to be imported, but that the real drawback to their 
     <lb/>
     manufacture in this country was the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     amount of fertilisers consumed in this country 
     <lb/>
     was not large enough to warrant their manufac<lb break="no"/>ture on such a scale as would make it profitable. 
     <lb/>
     Also the Mining Committee advises us that we 
     <lb/>
     have on the west coast all the ingredients that go 
     <lb/>
     into the making of cement in close proximity to 
     <lb/>
     each other, and the only reason I can see why we 
     <lb/>
     do not have a cement manufacturing plant is 
     <lb/>
     because the comparatively small amount of ce<lb break="no"/>ment that would be consumed in the country 
     <lb/>
     yearly would not be great enough to allow it to 
     <lb/>
     be worked profitably, Neither do I consider the

     present form of government the best for this 
     <lb/>
     country, because it means taxation without rep<lb break="no"/>resentation. I will say that the present form of 
     <lb/>
     government, since it came into power, has done 
     <lb/>
     much to build up the public and social services. 
     <lb/>
     They have greatly increased public health ser<lb break="no"/>vices, new roads, schools and an improved 
     <lb/>
     marketing system for our fishery products, but I 
     <lb/>
     also remember that they have during the past six 
     <lb/>
     or seven years been helped greatly by the highest 
     <lb/>
     revenues in our history, which were due almost 
     <lb/>
     wholly to the effects of the war and to the high 
     <lb/>
     cost of imported goods. How long these condi<lb break="no"/>tions will continue is anybody's guess. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You may ask why, if I do not consider either 
     <lb/>
     of these forms the best for us, do I support the 
     <lb/>
     motion that they be placed before the people for 
     <lb/>
     their choice, and my answer is that we were sent 
     <lb/>
     here to recommend suitable forms and not to 
     <lb/>
     decide them. I know that there are many people 
     <lb/>
     who do think that one of these forms would be 
     <lb/>
     best, and I think it is our duty to see, as far as it 
     <lb/>
     lies in our power, that they are given the chance 
     <lb/>
     to vote for the government of their choice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> Mr. Chairman, we have here a 
     <lb/>
     resolution introduced by Mr. Higgins, covering 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country in the forthcoming referen<lb break="no"/>dum. It will be the duty of all of us tonight to 
     <lb/>
     register our vote as to whether we are in favour 
     <lb/>
     of it or not. I want to say that I am in favour of it 
     <lb/>
     and that I shall vote for it, because I feel that it is 
     <lb/>
     the only logical thing for me to do. The chief 
     <lb/>
     reason why I vote for it is that for the past 16 
     <lb/>
     months this Convention has been studying the 
     <lb/>
     financial and economic position of this country, 
     <lb/>
     and has come to the conclusion that we are again 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting. The reason why we are self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting has been stated over and over again, and 
     <lb/>
     the conclusions of all the reports presented to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention have pointed to that fact. In view of 
     <lb/>
      all the circumstances, and because I believe in the 
     <lb/>
     resolution, I feel duty bound to support it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As for the forms of government dealt with in 
     <lb/>
     this resolution, I will make my comments as brief 
     <lb/>
     as possible. The ground has been very ably 
     <lb/>
     covered by previous speakers. Personally, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I believe in the restoration of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. I believe that the greatest good 
     <lb/>
     for the greatest number can be achieved by the 
     <lb/>
     immediate restoration of that form of govern<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>
ment. Our principal industries are today in a 
     <lb/>
     better condition than they ever were in our his<lb break="no"/>tory. Our fisheries, which are and always will be 
     <lb/>
     the backbone of our economy, have made enor<lb break="no"/>mous strides in the last few years. They have 
     <lb/>
     become more diversified, more modern in some 
     <lb/>
     respects; we have a better system of marketing, 
     <lb/>
     and we are producing a better product as a result 
     <lb/>
     of proper inspection. Indications point to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the future for our fisheries can and will be, 
     <lb/>
     under the proper administration, put on a sounder 
     <lb/>
     basis than it ever was before. What I mean by 
     <lb/>
     "proper administration" is that if we can only get 
     <lb/>
     the chance to use the great bargaining power that 
     <lb/>
     is ours. Our forest industries have grown to a 
     <lb/>
     considerable degree and are still growing. Mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars are now being spent on the expan<lb break="no"/>sion of existing paper mills, and it is not 
     <lb/>
     improbable that in the near future another such 
     <lb/>
     industry will be started meaning more employ<lb break="no"/>ment for our people. Our mining industry is in a 
     <lb/>
     flourishing condition with every prospect for it to 
     <lb/>
     continue so in the future, with the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     future mineral development. Agriculture shows 
     <lb/>
     great promise. We are, Mr. Chairman, in a more 
     <lb/>
     favourable position than we ever were in our 
     <lb/>
     history; and our position can be made much better 
     <lb/>
     by taking advantage of the tremendous bargain<lb break="no"/>ing power that is ours, due to our strategic posi<lb break="no"/>tion which has been stressed so often inside this 
     <lb/>
     Convention and out. We can only reap the full 
     <lb/>
     advantage of this by an immediate return to self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government. It has been ours for the asking for a 
     <lb/>
     long time now, and nothing has been done about 
     <lb/>
     it, and nothing will ever be done about it until the 
     <lb/>
     people take over the management of their own 
     <lb/>
     affairs. We should take advantage of it by starting 
     <lb/>
     negotiations with our good friend the United 
     <lb/>
     States of America, and by getting closer to that 
     <lb/>
     country economically, especially with regard to 
     <lb/>
     our fishery products. So much has already been 
     <lb/>
     said about this matter that it is unnecessary for 
     <lb/>
     me to elaborate. The same applies to the potential 
     <lb/>
     mineral and forest wealth of Labrador. Here we 
     <lb/>
     have something which can be of tremendous 
     <lb/>
     benefit to us if handled properly, and it has not 
     <lb/>
     been handled properly up to the present. I think 
     <lb/>
     the Mining Committee, of which I was a member, 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that fact. It is my opinion that we will 
     <lb/>
     never reap the full benefits until we get our own 
     <lb/>
     government. The quicker we can get that govern<lb break="no"/>

     ment the better, if we are to get anything 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile out of the great wealth of Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of all the circumstances, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, all that is necessary now is for us to take 
     <lb/>
     over the management of our own affairs, and I 
     <lb/>
     feel sure that we have the men capable of doing 
     <lb/>
     the job and doing it well. The argument that if we 
     <lb/>
     get responsible government back it would mean 
     <lb/>
     an almost immediate recession to where we were 
     <lb/>
     in 1933, and that we would again be on our knees 
     <lb/>
     to the mother country in a few years, is one to 
     <lb/>
     which I cannot subscribe in view of our present 
     <lb/>
     position, and how that position can be improved 
     <lb/>
     under the proper administration. It is the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of a defeatist and does not smack of the true 
     <lb/>
     blood and guts of the Newfoundlander. We have 
     <lb/>
     the resources, we have the bargaining power, and 
     <lb/>
     above all, we have the men — men of vision and 
     <lb/>
     courage, capable of taking this country through 
     <lb/>
     whatever the future may hold in store for us. All 
     <lb/>
     we need are courage and faith in ourselves, and I 
     <lb/>
     think our people have them in abundance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as Commission of Government is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I do not think it can do for us what we can 
     <lb/>
     do for ourselves. It was never meant for any 
     <lb/>
     freedom-loving people, and it will always remain 
     <lb/>
     a black chapter in our history. Admittedly it has 
     <lb/>
     done a lot of good for this country — I will not 
     <lb/>
     deny that, but in my opinion its sins of omission 
     <lb/>
     are very great, too great to be allowed to continue, 
     <lb/>
     because they are still continuing. Sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     good reasons have been put forward why the 
     <lb/>
     present form of administration should not be 
     <lb/>
     continued, and it will be only labouring the point 
     <lb/>
     if I deal with it any further. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What I have stated with regard to the two 
     <lb/>
     forms of government dealt with in this resolution 
     <lb/>
     are strictly my own views, and are perhaps not 
     <lb/>
     likely to be shared by many people. Therefore, in 
     <lb/>
     fairness to them, I am going to vote for these two 
     <lb/>
     forms of government to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people, and for them to make their own decision. 
     <lb/>
     I feel sure that we shall be leaving the decision in 
     <lb/>
     safe hands. It gives me much pleasure, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, to support the resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, in 
     <lb/>
     rising to offer my support to the motion now 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair, may I at the same time register 
     <lb/>
     my regret that its straightforward implication 
     <lb/>
     could not have been adopted some 20 months 
     <lb/>
     ago. However, this Convention, despite its 
    

            <cb/>
       

     shortcomings, has served to enlighten many, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly us of the younger generation, whose 
     <lb/>
     privilege as so-called free people has been to 
     <lb/>
     fight, but never to vote. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not shame that I as one of this younger 
     <lb/>
     generation feel when reviewing the institution of 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, but a sense of mild 
     <lb/>
     impatience mingled perhaps with disgust, that 
     <lb/>
     our leaders at that time were unable to find a 
     <lb/>
     solution that preserved independence, as did 
     <lb/>
     practically all other world governments who 
     <lb/>
     were under no less burden or stress. As one of the 
     <lb/>
     thousands who in those dark days was privileged 
     <lb/>
     in being only a child, I still ask, was default at that 
     <lb/>
     time, under similar circumstances, merely the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of the great? We paid with the loss of 
     <lb/>
     our independence for a type of honour that our 
     <lb/>
     illustrious neighbours did not hesitate in forego<lb break="no"/>ing. Experience is something which cannot be 
     <lb/>
     bought with dollars, nor at all times with honour; 
     <lb/>
     but must be paid for in suffering, either mental, 
     <lb/>
     physical or spiritual. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Looking back over the past 20 months with a 
     <lb/>
     mind unwarped as far as personal politics and 
     <lb/>
     egotistical greed are concerned, I think I can 
     <lb/>
     safely say that this Newfoundland in her short 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary history of, all told, less than a 
     <lb/>
     century has suffered no more bitterly from mis<lb break="no"/>takes and pitfalls than most countries have done. 
     <lb/>
     We have been, and in spite of drastic improve<lb break="no"/>ments still are a pioneering people and country, 
     <lb/>
     who unlike older nations are able truly to say that 
     <lb/>
     our resources are only now being tapped. Let any 
     <lb/>
     government we may elect benefit from the his<lb break="no"/>tory and mistakes of her predecessors, and not 
     <lb/>
     lurch into the future with a sense of frustration 
     <lb/>
     and inferiority on account of what has gone 
     <lb/>
     before. We have been told directly by the past 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner for Finance, the Hon. Mr. Wild, 
     <lb/>
     that we are a self-supporting country. I will ac<lb break="no"/>cept that statement from an expert, and will 
     <lb/>
     wrangle with no rough estimates or so-called 
     <lb/>
     guess budgets of amateurs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Fish, paper and iron ore — these are com<lb break="no"/>modities for which the whole world is hungry, but 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately at present only dollar areas are in a 
     <lb/>
     position to purchase to our advantage. Facing fact 
     <lb/>
     again, Canada does not need our fish. America 
     <lb/>
     does. We need commodities which are obtainable 
     <lb/>
     in either of these countries. Is it common sense to 
     <lb/>
     pay in precious dollars to Canada for what our 
  

            <pb n="1340" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1340.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1340</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     own natural products can purchase in the USA? 
     <lb/>
     We <hi rendition="simple:italic">can</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">must</hi> reach some trade agreement 
     <lb/>
     with the United States, whose economy may well 
     <lb/>
     merge with our own, and to my mind the only 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory channel through which this may be 
     <lb/>
     done is by a representative Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government, as free to negotiate for New<lb break="no"/>foundland and her people as the United States 
     <lb/>
     government is for hers. Let us meet on equal 
     <lb/>
     terms and not as paupers or poor neighbours. It is 
     <lb/>
     up to us as a people to choose our market for our 
     <lb/>
     coveted iron ore and paper, and not to beg it as 
     <lb/>
     someone else's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since the suspension of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, Newfoundland, from being an island on the 
     <lb/>
     edge of the world, has become a station in the 
     <lb/>
     centre of the world. In peace time this strategic 
     <lb/>
     position is an enviable circumstance and in war 
     <lb/>
     time it will be likely to involve an inevitable peril, 
     <lb/>
     and hence it is imperative to the interest of North 
     <lb/>
     America that all military bases now here shall 
     <lb/>
     remain a permanent feature. Here may I mention 
     <lb/>
     that the disgusting lower rates of pay for New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders working on their own leased soil, 
     <lb/>
     are as revolting to me as the colour bar is else<lb break="no"/>where. If and when Newfoundland is returned to 
     <lb/>
     its own administration, I am certain this state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs will be rectified. Finally, may I here ex<lb break="no"/>press the belief that a vigourous opposition in the 
     <lb/>
     government of any country is essential to true 
     <lb/>
     democracy. Without the impetus afforded by 
     <lb/>
     such opposition, not only do leaders lapse into a 
     <lb/>
     state of dictatorial lethargy, but the voice of the 
     <lb/>
     minority, and hence the people, fails to be heard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, the easiest 
     <lb/>
     road is not always the best and the shortest in the 
     <lb/>
     long run. Throughout the past 20 months I have 
     <lb/>
     borne in mind this quotation: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice, 
     <lb/>
     Take each man's censure, but reserve thy 
     <lb/>
     judgement! 
     <lb/>
     </p></quote>

            <p>The time has arrived to pronounce that judgement 
     <lb/>and I have done so. We are offered, even as was 
     <lb/>Bunyan's Pilgrim, a road with many turnings and 
     <lb/>flanked on either side with deep chasms. With the 
     <lb/>same faith in God, and with zeal and courage on 
     <lb/>our own part, let us not travel backward on 
     <lb/>crutches, nor remain stagnant, but forward on our 
     <lb/>own two feet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> Mr. Chairman, this resolution is 
     <lb/>one that asks us to recommend two forms of 
     

            <cb/>
        

     government to be submitted to our people in the 
     <lb/>
     forthcoming referendum. The two forms are 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government. It makes no difference to us here 
     <lb/>
     what form of government we favour ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     or what form we prefer. That has nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with this resolution. We can favour either one of 
     <lb/>
     these two forms of government, and still vote for 
     <lb/>
     this motion to place the two of them before the 
     <lb/>
     people. Or we can favour neither the one nor the 
     <lb/>
     other, and still be in favour of submitting both of 
     <lb/>
     them to the people for their decision. I do not see, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, how we can vote against the mo<lb break="no"/>tion. It is not as though we were called upon to 
     <lb/>
     express our own personal wishes, or our own 
     <lb/>
     personal likes and dislikes in the matter. We are 
     <lb/>
     only called upon to vote in favour of submitting 
     <lb/>
     these two forms of government to the people, and 
     <lb/>
     I suppose the motion will receive the unanimous 
     <lb/>
     support of the whole Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We tried responsible government before. In 
     <lb/>
     fact we had it for 80 years, and where did it land 
     <lb/>
     us? Our people know where it landed them — it 
     <lb/>
     landed them on the dole, it landed them on six 
     <lb/>
     cents a day. All I can say about responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, Mr. Chairman, is "once bitten, 
     <lb/>
     twice shy". Responsible government, sir, landed 
     <lb/>
     our people on six cents a day, and Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government kept them on six cents a day. We 
     <lb/>
     must not forget that fact... We had the six cent 
     <lb/>
     dole for three years before Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government came, but we also had it long after 
     <lb/>
     Commission came. In fact, we had the six cents 
     <lb/>
     dole for six years after the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government came. We must not forget, sir, that 
     <lb/>
     six years after Commission came, we still had 
     <lb/>
     40-50,000 of our unfortunate people on the dole. 
     <lb/>
     They were still on the dole right up to the out<lb break="no"/>break of the war, and in fact for some time after 
     <lb/>
     the war broke out. It was not until the war was on 
     <lb/>
     for almost two whole years that the dole began to 
     <lb/>
     disappear, when Canadian and American money 
     <lb/>
     began to pour in here to build the bases. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     People who do not like the thought of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government often tell us that we had the 
     <lb/>
     dole under responsible government. It is true we 
     <lb/>
     did, but it is just as true that we had it under 
     <lb/>
     Commission as well. With my own eyes, sir, I 
     <lb/>
     have seen the Commission government refuse 
     <lb/>
     dole to a whole settlement because their time was 
     <lb/>
     not quite up — they still had a few days to go

     before the next month's ration came due. The 
     <lb/>
     Commission government made them wait, and 
     <lb/>
     with my own eyes I saw hungry men, women and 
     <lb/>
     children go off over the hills picking blueberries 
     <lb/>
     to make a few cents to keep themselves alive. 
     <lb/>
     That was under Commission government. I have 
     <lb/>
     seen the Commission government send our 
     <lb/>
     police force out with baton in one hand and a gun 
     <lb/>
     in the other, against hungry men. Those are un<lb break="no"/>pleasant memories that our people will not soon 
     <lb/>
     forget. Oh no, it was not only under responsible 
     <lb/>
     government that we had the six cents dole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going to vote in favour of placing these 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government before our people, but 
     <lb/>
     that does not say that I am going to vote myself 
     <lb/>
     for either one of them when the referendum is 
     <lb/>
     held. So far as I am concerned, I want something 
     <lb/>
     better for our country. I want a form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment that will give our people a break. I want a 
     <lb/>
     form of government that will give our people 
     <lb/>
     something better than dole when the long-ex<lb break="no"/>pected world depression hits us again. I am not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to say in this present debate what form 
     <lb/>
     of government I do want, but I will get that 
     <lb/>
     chance a little later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> I do not want to make a speech. 
     <lb/>
     I stand to support the motion made by Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins that both Commission of Government and 
     <lb/>
     responsible government be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people in the referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> While we have been debating this 
     <lb/>
     resolution this last three or four days, I think 
     <lb/>
     everything has been said that could be said. We 
     <lb/>
     are getting on to the end of the debate, and I do 
     <lb/>
     not want to tire people with tedious repetition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am sure all the people in the country know 
     <lb/>
     by this time all about the responsible government 
     <lb/>
     that we had previous to Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They also know now that under this form 
     <lb/>
     of government we have to find money to the tune 
     <lb/>
     of $40 million, and that from 80,000 working 
     <lb/>
     people, 10,000 of whom are on the dole already. 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin, in his plea for responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, figures he can run the country on $25 
     <lb/>
     million. I do not know where he is going to lop 
     <lb/>
     off $15 million. Somebody will have to want. 
     <lb/>
     Instead of lopping off $15 million, by the looks 
     <lb/>
     of things now, he will have to add a little some<lb break="no"/>thing to the $40 million we will have to find in 
     <lb/>
     order to keep the people alive. All that has been 
     <lb/>
     gone over time and time again. Whatever we may 


            <cb/>
       

     prefer ourselves when it comes to forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, we have no alternative but to recom<lb break="no"/>mend that these two forms be placed before the 
     <lb/>
     people in the referendum. I refer to the two forms 
     <lb/>
     mentioned in the motion proposed by Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins — responsible government and Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government. This is particularly true of re<lb break="no"/>sponsible government, and I will tell you why. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever else may be or may not be submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the people, responsible government has to be 
     <lb/>
     submitted, for it is part of the bond, so to speak, 
     <lb/>
     that was made years ago.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> We all know that the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government made the statement 13 or 
     <lb/>
     14 years ago, that once Newfoundland became 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting again they would restore respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, if our people requested it. That 
     <lb/>
     is a big "if". I have never had any doubt that the 
     <lb/>
     British government would honour their pledge. 
     <lb/>
     Some people have made out that they had some 
     <lb/>
     doubts on this point, or they pretended to have 
     <lb/>
     doubts. But there has never been any doubt 
     <lb/>
     whatever that the mother country would honour 
     <lb/>
     her pledge to us. In fact, that is one of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     why Britain is holding the referendum. We 
     <lb/>
     should remember, Mr. Chairman, that it is not this 
     <lb/>
     Convention or even the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that is holding the referendum, but the 
     <lb/>
     British government. One of the reasons why 
     <lb/>
     Britain is holding the referendum is to give our 
     <lb/>
     people the chance to vote for it if they want to. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think the people will vote for responsible 
     <lb/>
     government — they have had plenty of it before 
     <lb/>
     and they know what to expect. But the point is 
     <lb/>
     that they can if they wish to, and the referendum 
     <lb/>
     is the method that has been arranged to enable 
     <lb/>
     them to do it. My belief is that even if this 
     <lb/>
     Convention did not recommend responsible 
     <lb/>
     government the British government would put it 
     <lb/>
     on the ballot. They made us a promise ... and as 
     <lb/>
     Britain always keeps her promises, I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that responsible government will be on the 
     <lb/>
     ballot, even if this Convention votes against put<lb break="no"/>ting it on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am strongly in favour of putting Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government on the ballot also. I am not saying 
     <lb/>
     that I am strongly in favour of Commission, but 
     <lb/>
     only that it should be put on the ballot. I am trying 
     <lb/>
     to be fair and reasonable to our people, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. It is not because I am opposed to

     responsible government and Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government that I should try to keep them from 
     <lb/>
     the people, or try to keep them off the ballot. Even 
     <lb/>
     if I intend to vote against those two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government in the referendum, I consider it to be 
     <lb/>
     my duty to vote in favour of putting them both 
     <lb/>
     before the people for their decision. I am sure the 
     <lb/>
     people will be the deciding factor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know that in this present debate I am not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to discuss confederation, and I am not 
     <lb/>
     going to discuss it. If I were allowed to discuss it, 
     <lb/>
     I would say that I strongly advocate putting con<lb break="no"/>federation on the ballot as well.

     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Excuse me, sir. We will have a 
     <lb/>
     crack at that later, and I will get a chance to

     <lb/>
     submitting both these forms to the people, not 
     <lb/>
     because I favour them but because I know that it 
     <lb/>
     is my duty to place both of them before the people 
     <lb/>
     for their decision. The other will come later. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I rise to support the motion before 
     <lb/>you. I am heartily behind putting these two forms 
     <lb/>on the ballot paper to form part of the choice in 
     <lb/>the coming referendum. In doing so I want to say 
     <lb/>I am not able to support either one of these 
     <lb/>choices from my own point of view. I do not feel 
     <lb/>that I could support a return to responsible 
     <lb/>government, and I do not feel that Commission 
     <lb/>of Government should continue any longer in this 
     <lb/>country than it already has. There are many, 
     <lb/>many reasons I could give to back those state<lb break="no"/>ments up, but the time is short and the arguments 
     <lb/>against responsible government have been 
     <lb/>repeated here so often, I do not want to go over 
     <lb/>them again. They have been very impressive, 
     <lb/>some of them; they impressed me and I am sure 
     <lb/>they impressed the people of this country. I may 
     <lb/>also say that some of the arguments in favour of 
     <lb/>the return of responsible government have been 
     <lb/>impressive. That is, theoretically they are correct 
     <lb/>and they impress us, but they fall down when they 
     <lb/>are tested. I do not think they could be practically 
     <lb/>applied to this small country with our system of 
     <lb/>taxation, and for the reasons which have been 
     <lb/>gone over so often in this Convention. I am 
     <lb/>wholeheartedly in favour of having political 
     <lb/>freedom for our people. I would not think of 
     <lb/>voting for anything in the referendum if it did not 
     <lb/>involve political freedom. I am all for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to take a few minutes to say how 


            <cb/>
        

     I feel about the return to responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     The very thought of it puts fear into my bones, to 
     <lb/>
     think of this country going back to responsible 
     <lb/>
     government again... These are no idle words. I 
     <lb/>
     have a reason to fear the consequences of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government coming back, for whether 
     <lb/>
     rightly or wrongly, I have associated the political 
     <lb/>
     set-up of this country with the economic condi<lb break="no"/>tions we have had. I know that the one may not 
     <lb/>
     be wholly responsible for the other, but there has 
     <lb/>
     been very close connection between the two. It is 
     <lb/>
     generally agreed that for the majority of our 
     <lb/>
     people life has been a terrific struggle all down 
     <lb/>
     through the years, and I was caught up in that 
     <lb/>
     struggle myself in my youth. My father was one 
     <lb/>
     of the primary producers and he suffered tremen<lb break="no"/>dously as one of them. I had a struggle in my early 
     <lb/>
     days, my earliest recollections are those of 
     <lb/>
     hardship and privation. It is a long story and one 
     <lb/>
     which I am not going to trouble you with. I do 
     <lb/>
     recall the early struggles and also the struggles to 
     <lb/>
     get an education... I know the struggle my 
     <lb/>
     parents had to find a school for me to go to. After 
     <lb/>
     I grew up, through my chosen profession I 
     <lb/>
     worked and came in close contact with men and 
     <lb/>
     women, families, who were having the same kind 
     <lb/>
     of struggle to get along. Then for the past 15 
     <lb/>
     years, as you know, I worked in our northern 
     <lb/>
     dependency and I was up against the same strug<lb break="no"/>gle among the people of that country. Apart from 
     <lb/>
     a few places such as Northwest River and 
     <lb/>
     Cartwright, the struggle was terrific and I shared 
     <lb/>
     it with them intimately. Mr. Harrington a few 
     <lb/>
     days ago told of us of the days he worked as a 
     <lb/>
     civil servant in the Department of Public Health 
     <lb/>
     and Welfare. He told us that day after day he sat 
     <lb/>
     before his desk reading letters from different 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country telling tragic stories of priva<lb break="no"/>tion and struggle. During those years I was in the 
     <lb/>
     field, and I was actually in the homes from which 
     <lb/>
     those letters came. Knowing Mr. Harrington as I 
     <lb/>
     do, he must have been moved with compassion 
     <lb/>
     as he read those letters. I am sure that Mr. Har<lb break="no"/>rington will agree that it is one thing to sit before 
     <lb/>
     a desk in a nice comfortable room, having had 
     <lb/>
     one square meal or two square meals, and to read 
     <lb/>
     these letters; it is another thing to be in the field, 
     <lb/>
     making contacts, going into the homes of these 
     <lb/>
     people and seeing their bare cupboards and hear<lb break="no"/>ing the cries of children, cries of hunger, cries that 
     <lb/>
     never leave you once you have heard them. They 
 

            <pb n="1343" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1343.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1343</fw>
   

     are different from any other cries of children. And 
     <lb/>
     having gone through that experience, having had 
     <lb/>
     contact with it, I make the statement that I fear 
     <lb/>
     the return of responsible government, fear it 
     <lb/>
     might bring back those conditions again. I said it 
     <lb/>
     is no idle expression of mine when I say that. 
     <lb/>
     People will say to me, "It does not have to happen 
     <lb/>
     again", "It may never happen again." Well, all I 
     <lb/>
     have to say is that it may happen again and I do 
     <lb/>
     not want to take a chance on it. We have no 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that it will not happen again. It probab<lb break="no"/>ly will, and I do not want to make the blunder of 
     <lb/>
     having responsible government by my giving any 
     <lb/>
     support to it. It is happening already, and 13,000 
     <lb/>
     people are on the dole in this country and in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador.... I have no doubt but the long and 
     <lb/>
     hungry month of March will add other thousands 
     <lb/>
     to the long list on the dole. There are indications 
     <lb/>
     of hard times coming to this country. As I sit in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention within these sheltered walls, sur<lb break="no"/>rounded by the conveniences and comforts of city 
     <lb/>
     life which I have enjoyed for the past 16 months, 
     <lb/>
     I find I am not as keenly sensitive of what is going 
     <lb/>
     on in this country and in Labrador, I am not as 
     <lb/>
     sensitive as perhaps I might be. But the doors of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention will not close very long before I 
     <lb/>
     will be smack up against that kind of thing again. 
     <lb/>
     And, sir, if it has to come; if I have to face it again 
     <lb/>
     and go through it, in my work, I do not want to 
     <lb/>
     have to say to myself that I should not have given 
     <lb/>
     support to the kind of government under which 
     <lb/>
     this kind of thing exists. Let us try something else. 
     <lb/>
     There is another way out, to my mind. I feel I 
     <lb/>
     cannot conscientiously support return of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government to this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as Commission of Government is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I am not going to vote for it. I am not 
     <lb/>
     going to support it unless there is no other alter<lb break="no"/>native given to me. If the Convention leaves me 
     <lb/>
     and the people with no alternative, I think it will 
     <lb/>
     have failed miserably. I do not think it will... I 
     <lb/>
     notice that our government at the present time has 
     <lb/>
     been receiving a very severe thrashing during the 
     <lb/>
     past 16 months, beginning from the very early 
     <lb/>
     days. It has been a left to the jaw and a right to 
     <lb/>
     the jaw and some of the punches have been under 
     <lb/>
     the belt. I want to go on record again as saying I 
     <lb/>
     am not going to be a part of all the punches given 
     <lb/>
     to Commission of Government and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office that have been given in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, unfairly I think. We have a right to 
 

            <cb/>
        

     criticise, many reasons to criticise them, but we 
     <lb/>
     have no reason to go to the extremes we have 
     <lb/>
     gone, and whoever has done it, I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     be a part of it. I think the darkest peak of this 
     <lb/>
     National Convention has not been the verbal 
     <lb/>
     battles we have had, or the small talk we have 
     <lb/>
     engaged in, but the charges of dishonesty, and the 
     <lb/>
     attacks upon the British government and Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government and the Dominions Of<lb break="no"/>fice that have been made — shameful changes, I 
     <lb/>
     think. That is going to be perhaps the only con<lb break="no"/>demnation that is going to be brought down in 
     <lb/>
     history upon us and our work in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Commission of Government has been 
     <lb/>
     described as a caretaker government. It has been 
     <lb/>
     that, and the time has come when we can take care 
     <lb/>
     of ourselves. The time has come for the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government to go and when it goes, it will 
     <lb/>
     go with my blessing. I would like to pay tribute 
     <lb/>
     to the Commission for what it has done. I am not 
     <lb/>
     unmindful of the blunders it has made. 
     <lb/>
     Thousands and thousands of dollars it has spent 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, to no avail to this country. I am not 
     <lb/>
     unmindful to its drawbacks. But I am not unmind<lb break="no"/>ful of what it has done for the Eskimos in the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador trading project. They had a big problem 
     <lb/>
     on their hands. About 1,000 Eskimos were scat<lb break="no"/>tered among the islands, no means of making a 
     <lb/>
     living; lots of fish, but they had no means of 
     <lb/>
     catching it. Now after a few years of Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government, many of these Eskimos have the 
     <lb/>
     means whereby they can make an honest living, 
     <lb/>
     and when the time comes to adopt a form of 
     <lb/>
     government to take over control, will have a great 
     <lb/>
     foundation to work upon, especially in northern 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. A great future is in store for them under 
     <lb/>
     a proper form of government. I shudder to think 
     <lb/>
     what would have happened if it had not been for 
     <lb/>
     the interference of Commission government on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of these primitive races of Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The time has come when we must dispense 
     <lb/>
     with this Commission of Government and make 
     <lb/>
     our choice. They go with my blessing, and I am 
     <lb/>
     pleased to be able to support the motion before 
     <lb/>
     the Chair to give the people of this country of ours 
     <lb/>
     these two forms of government as a part of their 
     <lb/>
     choice in the coming referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I had prepared some remarks to 
     <lb/>
     follow out this line of argument on the motion, 
     <lb/>
     but after we came back this evening Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     altered his motion. Personally, I would not want 
   

            <pb n="1344" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1344.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1344</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
      

     anything to be included in a motion which might 
     <lb/>
     preclude the possibility of placing other forms of 
     <lb/>
     government on the ballot, because while I am 
     <lb/>
     perfectly in favour of placing the matter of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government on the ballot, I believe 
     <lb/>
     — in fact, I know — there are people who want 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity of voting on another form. I do 
     <lb/>
     not want to take up the time of this House — there 
     <lb/>
     may be others who want to speak, and I know Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins will wind up the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would, however, like to speak about a few 
     <lb/>
     matters. I could discuss the quality of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. I could relate the fate of some of the 
     <lb/>
     people who gave their time and energy and 
     <lb/>
     thought to the government of the country. And 
     <lb/>
     here I would like to say it is the noblest thing a 
     <lb/>
     man can do, to offer his services to his country 
     <lb/>
     and to work in the country's interest and in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the people. It may be a thankless job, 
     <lb/>
     people may have to face many unpleasant cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, and such has been the history of 
     <lb/>
     people who have taken upon themselves these 
     <lb/>
     responsibilities. Nevertheless, they have ac<lb break="no"/>cepted these duties and no doubt they have the 
     <lb/>
     recompense and reward that comes from duties 
     <lb/>
     well performed. "Responsible government 
     <lb/>
     would be restored <hi rendition="simple:italic">at the request</hi>...." I have 
     <lb/>
     wondered many times just how the British 
     <lb/>
     government would ascertain the voice of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland and just how it was 
     <lb/>
     proposed that the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should make their request known to the British 
     <lb/>
     government. Evidently, sir, the setting up of this 
     <lb/>
     National Convention, and its recommendations, 
     <lb/>
     will give the people an opportunity to vote on the 
     <lb/>
     forms of government submitted to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In building wisely there is one thing which is 
     <lb/>
     most essential and indispensible, and that is that 
     <lb/>
     a start be made on a solid foundation. To my 
     <lb/>
     mind, responsible government as it existed 
     <lb/>
     before 1934 did not make itself indispensible. I 
     <lb/>
     do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of 
     <lb/>
     the present or past governments. It is not my 
     <lb/>
     intention at this late hour to praise, criticise or 
     <lb/>
     defend governments.... "By their fruits, ye shall 
     <lb/>
     know them."

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If any member wishes to speak 
     <lb/>
     on the motion and has not done so, he had better 
     <lb/>
     do so now, or forever hold his peace. Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     is about to deliver his coup de grace.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would like to say at the outset, in 


            <cb/>
   

     case there may be a contrary opinion ... with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the motion, that the form I had original<lb break="no"/>ly on the order paper was for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     conforming as closely as possible to the wording 
     <lb/>
     of the legislation under which we relinquished 
     <lb/>
     our former government in 1933. That was the 
     <lb/>
     only purpose behind it I want to make that quite 
     <lb/>
     clear beyond any doubt, beyond any suggestion 
     <lb/>
     such as was made here this afternoon, when it was 
     <lb/>
     stated that the verbiage of the motion showed the 
     <lb/>
     cloven hoof of partisanship. As far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, anybody who wants to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     motion was rigged in such a way as to prevent 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention from recommending 
     <lb/>
     other forms, any person who wishes to believe that 
     <lb/>
     can go to the residence usually associated with 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman of the cloven hoof. I say that in 
     <lb/>
     deference to myself, because as you are aware, at 
     <lb/>
     our private session on Friday last, it was placed 
     <lb/>
     beyond doubt that both these motions would be 
     <lb/>
     debated — the one under my name on the order 
     <lb/>
     paper, and the one under Mr. Smallwood's name. 
     <lb/>
     Time was allotted and agreed to, and there can be 
     <lb/>
     no doubt in anybody's mind who was present at 
     <lb/>
     the meeting that that is so. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Which is why I did not worry 
     <lb/>about the form of the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, in 
     <lb/>my opinion, whatever forms of government this 
     <lb/>Convention recommends to the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>to be placed on the ballot paper at the forthcom<lb break="no"/>ing referendum, the United Kingdom govern<lb break="no"/>ment will place only two forms on the ballot and 
     <lb/>these are the two forms envisaged in the motion 
     <lb/>you have before you tonight. I say that because 
     <lb/>of my respect for British jurisprudence and 
     <lb/>British justice. And British justice demands that 
     <lb/>the United Kingdom government carry out its 
     <lb/>pledge that appears throughout the legislation, 
     <lb/>and throughout the report on which that legisla<lb break="no"/>tion was based back in 1933. Because of that, I 
     <lb/>say that no matter what forms of government this 
     <lb/>Convention recommends, that with that well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>known justice of Britain, and the British people, 
     <lb/>the United Kingdom government will be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to put before the people of this country 
     <lb/>only two forms of government and these are the 
     <lb/>two forms you will vote on tonight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You have had a very scholarly presentation 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon from Mr. Hollett on the various 
     <lb/>
     pieces of legislation leading up to the formation 
  

            <pb n="1345" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-22_Page_1345.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1345</fw>
         

     of this Convention. And the other day Mr. Har<lb break="no"/>rington gave a similar presentation to you. I am 
     <lb/>
     quite certain you are all fully aware that there is 
     <lb/>
     a pledge, spoken on behalf of the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment by the Secretary of State for Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Affairs at that time, Mr. Emrys-Evans, who in 
     <lb/>
     words retailed to you by Mr. Hollett (and I have 
     <lb/>
     not the form in front of me) to the best of my 
     <lb/>
     knowledge said, "The whole policy of the British 
     <lb/>
     government is centered around that pledge." And 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion "the machinery" mentioned by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Emrys-Evans must have been and could only 
     <lb/>
     have been this National Convention — the 
     <lb/>
     machinery which the British government was 
     <lb/>
     going to set up to enable the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     to make their choice if they wanted responsible 
     <lb/>
     government returned or not. There can be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt whatsoever, Mr. Chairman, in your mind, 
     <lb/>
     as a lawyer, or in my learned friend Mr. Bradley's 
     <lb/>
     mind, as a lawyer, and in your gentlemen's 
     <lb/>
     minds, who by this time are practically sea 
     <lb/>
     lawyers, that this is correct. That legislation, 
     <lb/>
     thank God, is our magna carta. Had that statement 
     <lb/>
     not been made, had that legislation not been in 
     <lb/>
     the form it was in, then truly we might have been 
     <lb/>
     in a tough spot in Newfoundland. That is our 
     <lb/>
     charter of liberty, that when we are self-support<lb break="no"/>ing we can demand back again our own free 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not intend at this late hour to go over again 
     <lb/>
     all the reasons so very carefully detailed by mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this Convention. I congratulate the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this Convention for the very fine 
     <lb/>
     presentations that have given us in the past few 
     <lb/>
     days of the reasons why they were going to 
     <lb/>
     recommend that these forms of government be 
     <lb/>
     put on the ballot paper. At the same time, while 
     <lb/>
     it appears to be apparent that this motion is going 
     <lb/>
     to pass unanimously, it would appear the only 
     <lb/>
     member who spoke against it, as far as I could 
     <lb/>
     ascertain, was my learned friend Mr. Bradley, 
     <lb/>
     and with the substitution of the new motion I take 
     <lb/>
     it that that meets with his approval. His basic 
     <lb/>
     objection appeared to be the form of the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot help drawing the Convention's atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the inconsistency of some members here 
     <lb/>
     who stated they are going to vote for this motion 
     <lb/>
     recommending two forms of government — 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government— and who at the same time, whilst 
     <lb/>
     making the recommendation, state they do not 
    

            <cb/>
        

     believe in either form. It is rather an extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     thing that, gentlemen, to have 16 or 18 members 
     <lb/>
     making up their minds how they are going to 
     <lb/>
     advise their fellow-countrymen to do something 
     <lb/>
     they themselves would not do. Truly, "inconsis<lb break="no"/>tency, thou art a jewel." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now as I said, it appears that a great majority 
     <lb/>
     are going to support this motion and it would also 
     <lb/>
     appear that on the preference vote a great 
     <lb/>
     majority are going to state their preference for 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. To those others of you, 
     <lb/>
     those who whilst voting for the motion are not 
     <lb/>
     particularly inclined to express their preference 
     <lb/>
     — to those I particularly address myself, to con<lb break="no"/>vince you why you must support this motion and 
     <lb/>
     express your preference for responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I say that because the second last speaker, 
     <lb/>
     Rev. Mr. Burry, in giving his reasons against 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, talked about the fear 
     <lb/>
     that was in his bones, and I want to take the fear 
     <lb/>
     out of Rev. Burry's bones, and out of all the bones 
     <lb/>
     of all the members who have any hesitancy about 
     <lb/>
     expressing preference for the only form of 
     <lb/>
     government we should recommend. The best 
     <lb/>
     way I can do that is to quote to you the words of 
     <lb/>
     the high prophet himself, Mr. Smallwood. These 
     <lb/>
     words are entirely Mr. Smallwood's and I hope 
     <lb/>
     he will understand that in quoting him I have 
     <lb/>
     every reason to congratulate him on the excellent 
     <lb/>
     verbiage, and the complete way he put the case 
     <lb/>
     for those who are backing responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I want to play back the record. The voice 
     <lb/>
     is that of Mr. Higgins, the words are those of J. 
     <lb/>
     R. Smallwood: 
     <lb/>

     have great timber reserves on our Labrador 
     <lb/>
     territory and in Newfoundland — enough to 
     <lb/>
     supply two or three more great newsprint 
     <lb/>
     paper-mills, or artificial silk or cellulose

     story to say that we have, at Bell Island, the 
     <lb/>
     world's largest iron-ore reserves, which will 
     <lb/>
     become increasingly valuable as the Lake

     <lb/>
     United States are scouring the island in an 
     <lb/>
     organised beginning at measurement and

     survey. Expert opinion inclines strongly to 
     <lb/>
     the belief that it is the mineral resources of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, rather than its forest wealth, that 
     <lb/>
     will make our vast dependency, so much 
     <lb/>

     wealth in the years to come.

     We have the resources to make us one of

     the greatest small nations of the earth. 
     <lb/>
     Sportsmen and seekers of the quaint and un<lb break="no"/>usual in countries have begun to discover 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in the past half dozen years. 
     <lb/>
     Jealously they keep their knowledge to them<lb break="no"/>selves, lest others too learn their secret and 
     <lb/>
     come. Capitalists will discover our vast 
     <lb/>
     heritage of natural wealth, and their capital 
     <lb/>
     will pour in upon Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador to exploit these resources, make 
     <lb/>
     great profits for themselves, and bring endur<lb break="no"/>ing prosperity to Newfoundlanders. We were 
     <lb/>
     on the trembling edge of a breath-taking 
     <lb/>
     mineral boom just as the world depression 
     <lb/>
     plunged capitalists into the depths of pes<lb break="no"/>simism and passivity. We depended a little 
     <lb/>
     too much upon the enterprise and "push" of 
     <lb/>
     pioneering capitalists of the outside world to 
     <lb/>
     develop our mineral resources. Now we have 
     <lb/>
     set ourselves, by the help of these groups of 
     <lb/>
     officially directed geological survey parties, 
     <lb/>
     to the task of learning what we used formerly 
     <lb/>
     to leave it to the others to learn; the actual 
     <lb/>
     facts about our mineral wealth. Soon we shall

     Two or three new industries! It sounds 
     <lb/>
     easy, and it ought to be easy. We have the 
     <lb/>
     resources: the existence of the great Harms<lb break="no"/>worth newsprint paper mill at Grand Falls 
     <lb/>
     and of the even greater International Power 
     <lb/>
     and Paper Company newsprint paper mill on 
     <lb/>
     the Humber prove that papermaking in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is not only possible, but 
     <lb/>
     capable of more economical production than 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere this side of the Atlantic Ocean. 
     <lb/>
     The existence of the two great mines operat<lb break="no"/>ing at Bell Island and Buchans proves that 
     <lb/>
     mining can be successfully and profitably 
     <lb/>
     conducted in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In a book which I wrote in 1932 I ventured 
     <lb/>
     to make several prophecies about New<lb break="no"/>foundland. One of these had to do with air 
     <lb/>
     travel to and from the colony. That particular 
     <lb/>
     prophecy is at this moment so near to fulfil<lb break="no"/>ment (I refer, of course, to the great Imperial 
     <lb/>Airways transatlantic airline now being ar<lb break="no"/>ranged, with Cobb's Camp, Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>as the great connecting link) that I make this 
     <lb/>further prophecy with greater assurance than 
     <lb/>that with which those others were made — 
     <lb/>namely, Newfoundland, within the next half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>dozen years, will have blossomed forth as a 
     <lb/>mining country whose importance will chal<lb break="no"/>lenge the attention of the world. We shall be 
     <lb/>the third largest producer of newsprint paper 
     <lb/>in the world. We shall not have an unem<lb break="no"/>ployed man, but will need new immigrants. 
     <lb/>Our fisheries will have been completely 
     <lb/>transformed and made vastly more important 
     <lb/>and profitable by the introduction of consid<lb break="no"/>erable sums of new capital. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     In other words, our country's onward 
     <lb/>
     march to industrial importance and pros<lb break="no"/>perity, interrupted by the economic deluge 
     <lb/>
     which settled upon us and the world in 1929 
     <lb/>
     and 1930, will be resumed with increased

     tempo and brightened by more knowledge

     than ever.

            </p>

            <p>
     I am not one of those who consider that 
     <lb/>
     the particular form of government at any 
     <lb/>
     given time makes much difference of a fun<lb break="no"/>damental nature in the process I have here 
     <lb/>
     sought to indicate. Newfoundland has known 
     <lb/>
     many forms of government. We were ruled 
     <lb/>
     by ignorant, illiterate "fishing admirals" 
     <lb/>
     from the decks of visiting fishing schooners; 
     <lb/>
     by itinerant governors who were sent here for 
     <lb/>
     a few months each summer; by a much abler 
     <lb/>
     class of naval governors who used to remain 
     <lb/>
     throughout the year; by a form of repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government; then by a form of 
     <lb/>
     government which was a formless amal<lb break="no"/>gamation of representative and responsible 
     <lb/>
     government; by full responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     Now it is government by Commission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Governments come and governments go, 
     <lb/>
     but the people live on forever, their ex<lb break="no"/>perience becoming ever more enriched by 
     <lb/>
     vicissitudes, failures and successes. The 
     <lb/>
     natural resources remain. Governments are 
     <lb/>
     artificial and superficial things at best. It is 
     <lb/>
     the genius of a people that counts. What will 
     <lb/>
     make Newfoundland great and prosperous is 
     <lb/>
     not this or that government, this or that form 
     <lb/>
     of government; but rather than uncon<lb break="no"/>querable, invincible, dogged courage and 
     <lb/>
     spirit so eloquently typified by Basil Gotto's 
     <lb/>
     bronze statue in Bowring Park of "The Fight 
     <lb/>
     ing Newfoundlander." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This government or that may indeed, by 
     <lb/>
     its policies and work, help or hinder the slow, 
     <lb/>
     upward march of the people whom it has 
     <lb/>
     been set to govern. That is about the limit of 
     <lb/>
     its power. Its function at best is that of accou<lb break="no"/>cheur. It is the people who count; they and 
     <lb/>
     their inherent qualities of mind and heart.

     they had a distinct preference for one of the two

     forms of government contained in the motion. 
     <lb/>
     That was definite. But before they were prepared

     to support the motion, they wanted an assurance 
     <lb/>
     from me that they should have the opportunity of

     <lb/>
     my duty to do that. Surely, if I do it twice I cannot 
     <lb/>
     be criticised. If I postpone doing it now, and some 
     <lb/>
     members do not get the opportunity of expressing 
     <lb/>
     their preference, I might be open to fair criticism 
     <lb/>
     for not doing it now. If your preference is for the

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, before proceeding 
     <lb/>
     with the orders of the day, I would like to draw 
     <lb/>
     your attention, and the attention of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, to my question asked on January 9, and I will 
     <lb/>
     read it again: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioner for Finance and/or the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, (1) in the event 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland becoming a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, what would happen to the deposits 
     <lb/>
     now in the Newfoundland Savings Bank? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) Would the Newfoundland Savings 
     <lb/>
     Bank continue as at present, and would the 
     <lb/>
     depositors continue to receive the same rate 
     <lb/>
     of interest on their deposits as they now 
     <lb/>
     receive? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That question was put on January 9, that is 14 
     <lb/>
     days ago. No reply has been received at all. The 
     <lb/>
     other day we were told indirectly by Mr. Carew 
     <lb/>
     that the thing had been passed on to the High 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner for Canada. That is probably four 
     <lb/>
     or five days ago, and there is no reply yet. In View 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that we are going to discuss Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's motion I feel that we are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     that reply not after it is all over, but during the 
     <lb/>
     discussion, because it is a very important matter. 
     <lb/>
     There's $20 million down there belonging to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, small deposits most of 
     <lb/>
     it, and we are entitled to have that question 
     <lb/>
     answered. It has been there two weeks, and no 
     <lb/>
     reply has been received. There is no excuse, none 
     <lb/>
     whatever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Further, I also asked a question on January 13, 
     <lb/>
     11 days ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency the Governor in Commission 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain from His Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     in the United Kingdom the following infor<lb break="no"/>mation: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If in the referendum proposed to be held 
     <lb/>
     in the spring of 1948 for the selection by the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland of a future form of 
     <lb/>
     government, such referendum will be 
     <lb/>
     decided by and such future form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be selected on the basis of: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) The form of government on the ballot 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     which received at least 51% of the total votes 
     <lb/>
     Cast. 
     <lb/>
     (b) The form of government on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     which received a majority of the total votes 
     <lb/>
     cast. 
     <lb/>
     (c) The form of government on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     which received a greater number of votes 
     <lb/>
     than any other individual form of govem- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment on the ballot. 
     <lb/>
     That question has been there now 11 days. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I understand, Maj or Cashin, that 
     <lb/>the reply to that question will be received this 
     <lb/>afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Thanks very much. Now with re<lb break="no"/>spect to the Savings Bank one, what about that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> All I can say is there has been 
     <lb/>no indifference or inertia. Every time it has been 
     <lb/>drawn to our attention it has been taken up, and 
     <lb/>it has been forwarded to the High Commissioner 
     <lb/>for Canada, with the request that he should 
     <lb/>telegraph the question to Canada, and ask for an 
     <lb/>immediate reply. I don't know whether that has 
     <lb/>been done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The last time I brought that up was 
     <lb/>Monday, and Captain Warren said he got in touch 
     <lb/>with Mr. Carew, and he got in touch with the High 
     <lb/>Commissioner and all that has been done. What 
     <lb/>is the position supposing we don't get a reply? 
     <lb/>Are we to continue discussing the matter when 
     <lb/>we don't know what is going to happen to $20 
     <lb/>million belonging to our people? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> All I can say is that we will go 
     <lb/>back again. We can only try. Captain Warren, can 
     <lb/>you go back this afternoon and say that this reply 
     <lb/>is urgent? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I suppose this House will close this 
     <lb/>afternoon until Monday, and I think we should 
     <lb/>have a reply then. Is it possible for us to get a 
     <lb/>definite answer as to whether a reply can be had 
     <lb/>on Monday? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Will you please get in touch 
     <lb/>with them, Captain Warren, and will you please 
     <lb/>be good enough to put it up to them that way, so 
     <lb/>that we can know where we are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think the Convention and the 
     <lb/>country are entitled to it. 
     <lb/>
