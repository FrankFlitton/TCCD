     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is quite a tall order to ask 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada to do, to give you the 
     <lb/>
     taxation in every municipality in Canada. If you 
     <lb/>
     were to ask the provincial governments of the 
     <lb/>
     nine provinces you would get it; after all, it is no 
     <lb/>
     concern of the federal government what taxes are 
     <lb/>
     collected by some little town council. That con<lb break="no"/>cerns the provinces, not the federal government. 
     <lb/>
     Frankly, they don't know.

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> No, fairly simple, it is only to ask the 
     <lb/>
     government of each of the provinces. I think it is 
     <lb/>
     very easy. I think it is something that we should 
     <lb/>
     have in the light of what we have got ahead of us. 
     <lb/>
     I think this has more bearing on what we have got 
     <lb/>
     to do that anything else, when you have to show 
     <lb/>our people what form of government they have 
     <lb/>got to go to. Remember we are breaking a new

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, yesterday we 
     <lb/>
     had got as far as clause 7 dealing with what would 
     <lb/>
     happen to the public debt. I do not know if the 
     <lb/>
     House wants to continue debating that clause or 
     <lb/>
     if it is ready to move on to clause 8. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I understood from Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     yesterday that we were going to defer this finan<lb break="no"/>cial section and go on with the others; that we 
     <lb/>
     could leave the financial end until we wound up. 
     <lb/>
     The financial thing is the main thing. There have 
     <lb/>
     been a lot of questions asked to which we have 
     <lb/>
     not yet received replies, and I imagine it is going 
     <lb/>
     to take time. I would suggest to Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     that we defer from there up to the end of section 
     <lb/>
     14. All that is financial. We could go on from 
     <lb/>
     there to representation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I sympathise with the point 
     <lb/>
     made by Major Cashin that the debate on these 


            <cb/>
   

     clauses under the general heading of Financial 
     <lb/>
     Arrangements — clauses 7 to 14 inclusive — 
     <lb/>
     might be deferred until replies have been 
     <lb/>
     received to the various questions tabled, but I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if it would not be as well to go as rapidly 
     <lb/>
     as possible through these clauses so that they 
     <lb/>
     would be a matter of record. As far as any clause 
     <lb/>
     dealt with up until now, the house can revert to 
     <lb/>
     them and so with these particular clauses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am inclined to agree the debate 
     <lb/>
     should be deferred; perhaps it might not properly 
     <lb/>
     be disposed of by virtue of the fact that there may 
     <lb/>
     be some questions arising out of the clauses. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> This is the most important matter in 
     <lb/>these terms — the financial section. I suggest a 
     <lb/>small committee of the House be appointed to 
     <lb/>go into it thoroughly to see where the whole thing 
     <lb/>fits. The public wants to know all about it; how

     it affects the country.... The whole thing has to be 
     <lb/>
     thrashed out. The financial clauses are the most 
     <lb/>
     important matter and I am confident we should 
     <lb/>
     not rush them. I have been trying to get further 
     <lb/>
     information on them and until such time as I get 
     <lb/>
     the information, I will not talk on them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the reading is deferred, that 
     <lb/>
     might result in members being deprived of the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of asking questions.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> If we read them now, and no mem<lb break="no"/>ber asks questions, we are not passing them, so

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I do not mind them being read now, 
     <lb/>
     but the whole thing has to be summed up by 
     <lb/>
     members in the House before we are finished, to 
     <lb/>
     see what side of the ledger we are going to come 
     <lb/>
     out on if we go into confederation. Anyone who 
     <lb/>
     thinks we can do this in a few days is all out.

    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Which is why the only argument 
     <lb/>against reading them is that it may be unneces<lb break="no"/>sary; while on the other hand the reading or even 
     <lb/>a brief explanation might suggest to members 
     <lb/>questions which might perhaps otherwise escape 
     <lb/>them, and then when the time came to debate the 
     <lb/>whole thing, perhaps they would not be in as good 
     <lb/>a position as they would be if their attention had 
     <lb/>been drawn to them by brief explanation. Apart 
     <lb/>from that fact, I am in agreement with your 
     <lb/>suggestion, Major Cashin, that the debate as such 
     <lb/>should be deferred until the required information 
     <lb/>is forthcoming.... I am prepared to rule that in the 
     <lb/>event of your deciding to defer the debate, not 
     <lb/>only on these section, but on other sections, it will 
     <lb/>be your right to revert back to other sections. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I want you to understand I am not 
     <lb/>trying to hold it up; but the matter is so important, 
     <lb/>that I think all these questions, particularly with 
     <lb/>regard to banks, the national debt of Canada, the 
     <lb/>CNR and the Trans-Canada Airways, should be 
     <lb/>forthcoming now.... This is supposed to be a 
     <lb/>partnership which we are to go into on equal basis 
     <lb/>in proportion to our assets. In order to do that, we 
     <lb/>have to know the assets of the other side of the 
     <lb/>picture, which are not here in these terms. The 
     <lb/>assets of Newfoundland only are here.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I appreciate the point Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin is making. I agree with him completely 
     <lb/>
     that there is information on this section which 
     <lb/>
     members will need to have in their possession 
     <lb/>
     when they debate these particular terms, and 
  

            <cb/>
      

     possibly debate the whole picture. But I think he 
     <lb/>
     will agree, it might save time if we read these 
     <lb/>
     sections, as it might suggest questions to be 
     <lb/>
     asked. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You can take notice of questions as 
     <lb/>
     we go along.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am a bit worried about the 
     <lb/>
     questions. The government is in Ottawa and if as 
     <lb/>
     they occur to us, we give notice of question, and 
     <lb/>
     the question has to go through the formality of 
     <lb/>
     passing the Information Committee, then be for<lb break="no"/>warded to the local government and then probab<lb break="no"/>ly to the Canadian High Commissioner, and by 
     <lb/>
     him to Ottawa, by the time we get back final 
     <lb/>
     replies ... with that in mind, it might expedite 
     <lb/>
     matters if members who have questions would 
     <lb/>
     please get them in as early as possible so they can 
     <lb/>
     be forwarded as quickly as possible and have the 
     <lb/>
     replies back in lots of time to help in the debate. 
     <lb/>
      </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Before Mr. Smallwood proceeds, 
     <lb/>there are a few questions I would like to ask him 
     <lb/>and to which the people of the country would like 
     <lb/>to know the answers. I have to take you back to 
     <lb/>unemployment insurance. I wonder if Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood could tell me what obligations, if any, 
     <lb/>the unemployed are placed under in the getting 
     <lb/>of this insurance? I have heard that the un<lb break="no"/>employed man must appear in person to get the 
     <lb/>insurance. However, if he appears in person and 
     <lb/>there is a job available in any particular part of 
     <lb/>the nine provinces, he is obliged to accept that 
     <lb/>position, regardless of what the rate of wages may 
     <lb/>be. Should he refuse to accept that, he automat<lb break="no"/>ically relieves himself of any unemployment 
     <lb/>benefit.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The position is that before a 
     <lb/>
     man can get the insurance, which is his by right, 
     <lb/>
     having paid into the fund, he must first be un<lb break="no"/>employed. He must be in a condition to work, 
     <lb/>
     physically, and, thirdly, he must accept a job 
     <lb/>
     offered by the Insurance Commission which is 
     <lb/>
     suitable work. A painter offered work as a clerk 
     <lb/>
     or offered a job as a watchman, is not suitable 
     <lb/>
     work. Secondly, he must be willing to move. A 
     <lb/>
     logger must be willing to go to the lumberwoods 
     <lb/>
     where the work is. If he is living in Green Bay, 
     <lb/>
     he cannot say the job offered in Bay of Islands or 
     <lb/>
     Badger is too far away. He cannot take that stand, 
     <lb/>
     if the job is reasonably suitable to him, in a place 
     <lb/>
     reasonably near, not too far away. The idea that 
     <lb/>
     an unemployed man in Newfoundland, if offered 
 

            <pb n="869" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-27_Page_0869.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">869</fw>
        

     a job in British Columbia, must go or forfeit his 
     <lb/>
     insurance benefit, is a wrong idea. That is not the 
     <lb/>
     case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I take it for granted that if a man is 
     <lb/>
     sick and unable to appear in person at the un<lb break="no"/>employment office, he is out of luck as far as 
     <lb/>
     getting his unemployment insurance is con<lb break="no"/>cerned? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The Unemployment Insurance 
     <lb/>
     Commission has a good many offices — a couple 
     <lb/>
     of hundred or more opening up in various parts 
     <lb/>
     of Canada — but not every worker becoming 
     <lb/>
     unemployed is near one of those offices. In New<lb break="no"/>foundland, suppose they opened two, one in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's and one in Corner Brook. A man in For<lb break="no"/>tune Bay or Green Bay cannot be expected to 
     <lb/>
     come personally to St. John's or Corner Brook; 
     <lb/>
     but he must report that he is employable, able and 
     <lb/>
     willing to work. Forms are provided for that 
     <lb/>
     purpose. An unemployed man cannot be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to travel from St. Anthony to St. John's or 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's to St. Anthony, that would be too 
     <lb/>
     utterly foolish.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I would suggest, if at all possible, to 
     <lb/>
     have produced one or two forms which an un<lb break="no"/>employed person has to fill in — let us see what 
     <lb/>
     obligations there are. Let us see if there is not 
     <lb/>
     something in what I have referred to. Further<lb break="no"/>more, if the logger in Corner Brook is un<lb break="no"/>employed and he is seeking his insurance, and he 
     <lb/>
     has to go to Prince Edward Island or North Syd<lb break="no"/>ney to work on a farm, I am of the opinion, should 
     <lb/>
     he refuse, he would not get unemployment 
     <lb/>
     benefits. When we get the form, we will see 
     <lb/>
     exactly what the obligations are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will do better than that. I will 
     <lb/>
     put a question to the Government of Canada who 
     <lb/>
     will put it to the Unemployment Insurance Com<lb break="no"/>mission on these points. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I am aware that there are quite a 
     <lb/>
     number of unemployed throughout Canada at this 
     <lb/>
     very moment — I have figures here, which I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied are correct, that there are 114,828 un<lb break="no"/>employed. Some of those, I am informed, are not 
     <lb/>
     getting unemployment insurance. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     why. It may be because of the fact that they 
     <lb/>
     refused to take employment elsewhere. I am also 
     <lb/>
     in possession of information which says that 
     <lb/>
     2,906 Polish veterans were brought into 
     <lb/>
     Canada...their contract is for two years, they are 
     <lb/>
     hired at the rate of $45 a month. I do not think 
   

            <cb/>
          

     that would suit a logger from Corner Brook or 
     <lb/>
     Point Leamington or anywhere else — to have to 
     <lb/>
     take employment on the farms for $45 a month 
     <lb/>
     and found. One more item, I wonder if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood made any inquiries as to what taxes 
     <lb/>
     or licence fee the fishermen would have to pay 
     <lb/>
     by way of trap berths? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In the matter of charging fees 
     <lb/>
     or licenses for setting various traps and other 
     <lb/>
     kinds of fishing gear, ... it is the provinces who 
     <lb/>
     set the amount; it is then gazetted by the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Department of Canada. If Mr. Fudge wants it, I 
     <lb/>
     have it for the Province of Quebec, Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     the actual fees charged. If Newfoundland were a 
     <lb/>
     province, if any fees were charged for placing 
     <lb/>
     fishing gear in the water, that would be a matter 
     <lb/>
     entirely for the province.... The whole matter of 
     <lb/>
     regulating berths is entirely provincial; and is 
     <lb/>
     done on the word of the local provincial 
     <lb/>
     authorities, and is then gazetted by the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Fisheries.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Could we not raise these questions 
     <lb/>
     at the particular time? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> This is a very important matter. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to tell the fisherman, if we had con<lb break="no"/>federation, if it is good or bad. I may be fishing 
     <lb/>
     next month myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think you are properly entitled 
     <lb/>
     to put your questions.... It is proposed that the 
     <lb/>
     debate on 7 to 14 be deferred. That should not be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as closure as far as members are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, to re-opening questions on preceding sec<lb break="no"/>tions. As I have already ruled, you are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     raise the questions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> There are a number of men within 
     <lb/>
     the hearing of my voice who may have to pay 50 
     <lb/>
     cents per capita whilst fishing. I take it that 
     <lb/>
     whatever the province collects by way of taxes is 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of raising sufficient money to run 
     <lb/>
     the province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The Newfoundland Hotel has cost 
     <lb/>
     the country somewhere around $450,000. In ad<lb break="no"/>dition, it has lost money since. Same thing applies 
     <lb/>
     to Canada. In Ottawa, they have the Chateau 
     <lb/>
     Laurier, that hotel has cost enough to buy out 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in losses over the last number of 
     <lb/>
     years. But they have to have it. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     public wharves, in Canada today they have a 
     <lb/>
     Harbour Commission. Take Halifax or the City 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal, all those places are operated under 
  

            <pb n="870" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-27_Page_0870.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">870</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
         

     what is called a Harbour Commission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Harbour Board. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They own the docks and they 
     <lb/>
     charge fees for the docking, so much a ton for 
     <lb/>
     docking, so much for space, so much for freight, 
     <lb/>
     etc. The first thing we would find is that Harvey 
     <lb/>
     and Company's premises, Furness Withy, all 
     <lb/>
     Water Street premises would be taken over by the 
     <lb/>
     Harbour Board. Mind you, there is something to 
     <lb/>
     it. I have been trying to think this thing out for 
     <lb/>
     some time — whether a harbour board would be 
     <lb/>
     better to handle the freight in this city. Because 
     <lb/>
     today there are only two or three places where 
     <lb/>
     you can land stuff. They have a combine. I submit 
     <lb/>
     that it is an idea that might be constructively 
     <lb/>
     thought out. I believe that if we became united 
     <lb/>
     with Canada efforts would be made to establish 
     <lb/>
     a harbour board where shipping comes in — St. 
     <lb/>
     John's, Corner Brook, etc., and it would be a 
     <lb/>
     corporation run on its own. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next thing on the list is military property. 
     <lb/>
     Does that include the bases in Argentia? I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it does. It does cover St. John's West, and 
     <lb/>
     Bay Bulls. Public dredges — we have only one 
     <lb/>
     which is 35 years old. Customs House, post of<lb break="no"/>fices, all these public buildings, in my opinion, if 
     <lb/>
     we had to start all new, including the railway and 
     <lb/>
     the whole works, you could not replace them 
     <lb/>
     under $110 million or $120 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is more than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is being taken over for $62.5 
     <lb/>
     million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not think the question of the 
     <lb/>
     value to be placed on them is important if you are 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the Economic Report, where they 
     <lb/>
     evaluated the assets of the country; you could fix 
     <lb/>
     your values on that. If you are not satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     that report, you have to find some other means to 
     <lb/>
     arrive at it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I appreciate what Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     has said. I would like to say something about the 
     <lb/>
     National Harbours Board. I feel as he does, that 
     <lb/>
     something ought to be done about the harbour of 
     <lb/>
     St. John's to put it in a position of efficient service 
     <lb/>
     to the trade and public of the country. It is only a 
     <lb/>
     hope that the National Harbours Board of Canada 
     <lb/>
     would take over St. John's harbour and make it 
     <lb/>
     one of the modern, efficient harbours on the 
     <lb/>
     North Atlantic seaboard of America. I hope they 
     <lb/>
     would make Corner Brook a national harbour. 
     <lb/>
     We raised the matter. We tabled a question on 


            <cb/>
         

     that in Ottawa. The National Harbours Board 
     <lb/>
     administers, I think, 16 harbours in Canada.... 
     <lb/>
     The Canadian Government has spent ... many 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars on the vast terminals, 
     <lb/>
     elaborate piers etc. in the port of Halifax. I hope 
     <lb/>
     the National Harbours Board would take over the 
     <lb/>
     port of St. John's. That is not something to fear; 
     <lb/>
     it is something to welcome. Let us say these 
     <lb/>
     services in clause 8 would be taken over by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. An earlier clause says 
     <lb/>
     they would take over and operate all these ser<lb break="no"/>vices and pay the costs of operating them. If they 
     <lb/>
     take them over and pay the cost of running them, 
     <lb/>
     naturally they have to own them. That is the usual 
     <lb/>
     practice. If the provincial government operates 
     <lb/>
     certain services on its own, then that government 
     <lb/>
     owns those things; if the federal government 
     <lb/>
     operates such services, they own them. If they 
     <lb/>
     take over the Railway, the ownership is in their 
     <lb/>
     own hands, in the name of the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Same thing with Gander. But if they are 
     <lb/>
     worth $2 million or $120 million, does that mean 
     <lb/>
     that Canada is getting that value? If they take the 
     <lb/>
     Railway over and it is worth $73 million, is it $73 
     <lb/>
     million better off?.... Is Newfoundland $1-2 mil<lb break="no"/>lion better off because as a province it has not to 
     <lb/>
     pay the operating loss on the Railway in the 
     <lb/>
     future as we have done since 1920 or 1923? I am 
     <lb/>
     sure Major Cashin will appreciate these points. 
     <lb/>
     All right, they are worth $120 million, from the 
     <lb/>
     standpoint of running them at a loss. One of the 
     <lb/>
     worries we have had is the loss on Gander airport; 
     <lb/>
     as a province, that loss will not have to come out 
     <lb/>
     of the provincial treasury. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I asked a question; I do not know 
     <lb/>
     if I am going to get an answer.

     approached the thing is all wrong. For example, 
     <lb/>
     the operating deficits on the Railway have been 
     <lb/>
     met by the government exchequer. Assuming, for 
     <lb/>
     argument's sake, that the operating deficit for the 
     <lb/>
     year would be $1 million, everybody blandly 
     <lb/>
     assumes that it cost the country $1 million. We 
     <lb/>
     must bear in mind the fact that the Railway is the 
     <lb/>
     largest employer of labour. And remember, on 
     <lb/>
     every article of foodstuffs and clothing, every 
     <lb/>
     Railway employee is indirectly, if not directly, 
     <lb/>
     paying revenue to the government. He pays his 
     <lb/>
     income tax. So that when we come to consider 
     <lb/>
     what the government raises in return it might 
     <lb/>
     well be that the contribution they make to the tax

     That seems to be fairly clear. We have a 
     <lb/>
     surplus of so much at the date on which we 
     <lb/>
     become a province, if we become a province, and 
     <lb/>
     all the surplus would belong to Newfoundland; 
     <lb/>
     but it would have to be divided into two parts. 
     <lb/>
     The first part would be one-third of that amount. 
     <lb/>
     That one-third would be earmarked to be used by 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government for ordinary purposes.

     The other two-thirds would be for the use of the 
     <lb/>
     province for developmental purposes.... There 
     <lb/>
     are two other points about that — one is that the 
     <lb/>
     one-third, for eight years after we became a 
     <lb/>
     province, would have to be put in trust or it could 
     <lb/>
     be put on deposit with the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     drawing interest. And there is this point — the 
     <lb/>
     whole amount of the dollar surplus, and the ster<lb break="no"/>ling surplus if we can get it turned into dollars, 
     <lb/>
     can be placed on deposit with the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada for as long as we wish to leave it there, 
     <lb/>
     up to ten years. That must begin within one year 
     <lb/>
     after becoming a province; while there the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government would draw interest at the 
     <lb/>
     rate of 2 5/8% per year. One other point only needs 
     <lb/>
     to be drawn to your attention. No part of the 
     <lb/>
     surplus can be used to subsidise production or 
     <lb/>
     sale of Newfoundland products in unfair com<lb break="no"/>petition with similar products of other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     That does not prevent the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland from helping industry by such means 
     <lb/>
     as development loans on reasonable conditions 
     <lb/>
     or by the ordinary provincial administrative ser<lb break="no"/>vices; it must not be a direct subsidy on similar 
     <lb/>
     products sold in competition with other provin<lb break="no"/>ces.

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Naturally, the question of the surplus 
     <lb/>
     did come up when the delegation was discussing 
     <lb/>
     these questions with Canada. I wonder if the 
     <lb/>
     delegation could tell us why any restrictions at all 
     <lb/>
     should have been put on the use of our surplus by 
     <lb/>
     the province, if we did become a province?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The practice in the case of 
     <lb/>
     every province that joined the Canadian union 
     <lb/>
     was for the federal government to take over a 
     <lb/>
     certain share of the province's public debt and its 
     <lb/>
     the accumulated cash surplus and assets. In our 
     <lb/>
     case they have not done that; they have left the 
     <lb/>
     surplus untouched. They could, on all the prece<lb break="no"/>dents established by all other provinces, take over 
     <lb/>
     the cash surplus in an amount corresponding in 
     <lb/>
     principal to the amount of the debt taken over. 
     <lb/>
     They have not done that. They said they did not 
     <lb/>
     want to do so. In fact, they know that if we were 
     <lb/>
     to lose our surplus the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would not consider confederation. So the surplus 
     <lb/>
     is left intact to us; but one-third of it is earmarked 
     <lb/>
     — not for them, but for us, for the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     purposes of provincial government for the first 
     <lb/>
     eight years. There is to be a whole review and 
     <lb/>
     reassessment of the position within the eight 
  

            <cb/>
          

     years. In the eight years, one-third of the surplus 
     <lb/>
     is ours, but we must use it only in a certain way, 
     <lb/>
     for ordinary purposes, road building, if you like, 
     <lb/>
     or building hospitals; any purpose which we wish 
     <lb/>
     to spend it on. The other two-thirds is for 
     <lb/>
     developmental purposes. Subsection (2): Canada 
     <lb/>
     will pay to the Province of Newfoundland the 
     <lb/>
     following statutory subsidies: 
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
     (2) $1,100,000 annually, in lieu of the 
     <lb/>

     subsidies provided by statute from time to 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     That means only that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would pay to Newfoundland $180,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year and also 80 cents a head of all our popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and that would increase as our population 
     <lb/>
     and scale of grants increased. And, secondly, 
     <lb/>
     would pay to our government $ 1.1 million a year; 
     <lb/>
     and that is to take the place of certain statutory 
     <lb/>
     awards made to the Maritime Provinces. These 
     <lb/>
     statutory awards, as you undoubtedly know, are 
     <lb/>
     the Duncan-White award made to the three 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces in 1927. Nova Scotia, I think, 
     <lb/>
     got $1 .3 million; New Brunswick, $900,000; and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island $300,000, I think, a year — 
     <lb/>
     according to the population of the province. 
     <lb/>
     These particular subsidies are perpetual: 
     <lb/>
     $180,000 a year and 80 cents a head of the

     population — $1,300,000 — these would have to

     be paid to the Government of Newfoundland

     forth in Annex III).

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Annex III is a most complicated and difficult 
     <lb/>
     thing to read, let alone understand. I am quite 
     <lb/>
     certain that not one in 100,000 hearing the intri<lb break="no"/>cate mass of figures showing how the tax agree<lb break="no"/>ment payments are computed will understand it. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps the Convention would be satisfied if I did 
     <lb/>
     not read it. If that were agreeable, I would explain 
     <lb/>
     the general principles of the tax agreement. The 
     <lb/>
     position is this: the Government of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     permitted under the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     to raise its revenue by almost any kind of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion; but the provinces are limited to direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion to raise revenue. Most of the provinces up to 
     <lb/>
     1941 had their own provincial income tax. In fact, 
     <lb/>
     some town councils in some provinces had their 
     <lb/>
     own municipal income taxes. Up to the outbreak 
     <lb/>
     of the war, you would find, in some cases, three 
     <lb/>
     income taxes — one collected by your own town 
     <lb/>
     council, one collected by the government of your 
     <lb/>
     province, and the income tax collected by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada... When the war broke 
     <lb/>
     out, the cost of the Canadian effort had to be 
     <lb/>
     borne by the federal government, not by the 
     <lb/>
     governments of the towns or provinces. They 
     <lb/>
     knew that it was going to be a very expensive 
     <lb/>
     proposition to fight that war. I think Canada 
     <lb/>
     raised nearly half the money by taxes. The taxes 
     <lb/>
     were very high. They raised a little over half by 
     <lb/>
     borrowing from the peoples. As the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada was going to pay the cost of the war, 
     <lb/>
     it went to the various provinces and said to them, 
     <lb/>
     "You are not going to have to pay the cost; we 
     <lb/>
     are going to pay the cost and we will make an 
     <lb/>
     agreement with you for the period of the war." 
     <lb/>
     They called in the premiers of the nine provinces 
     <lb/>
     and they said, "We will pay you a fixed amount 
     <lb/>
     every year as long as the war lasts, the average 
     <lb/>
     amounts you collected for three years before the 
     <lb/>
     war broke out. We will pay it as long as the war 
     <lb/>
     lasts and a year after. In return, you must stop 
     <lb/>
     collecting corporation taxes, death duties and 
     <lb/>
     income taxes during the war and while the agree<lb break="no"/>ment is in force." The provinces agreed. Begin<lb break="no"/>ning 1941 the only income tax collected in 
     <lb/>
     Canada was collected by the federal government, 
     <lb/>
     none by the provinces... The war came to an end, 
     <lb/>
     and the people of Canada were rather fond of the 
     <lb/>
     idea of paying one income tax. True, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government had the monopoly; they 
 

            <pb n="875" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-27_Page_0875.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>  <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>  <fw type="num">875</fw>
        

     drove the income tax and the corporation taxes 
     <lb/>
     up very high; they got the money out of the 
     <lb/>
     people. But they have reduced them three times 
     <lb/>
     since the war. Just after the war ended they called 
     <lb/>
     the nine provinces together and said, "This war<lb break="no"/>time agreement will soon be coming to an end; 
     <lb/>
     you will have the right to put on provincial in<lb break="no"/>come tax again." The provinces did not want to 
     <lb/>
     go back to the old system. The federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment said, "We propose that this arrangement, 
     <lb/>
     made during the war, we will make that for time 
     <lb/>
     of peace. We will be the only government who 
     <lb/>
     will collect income tax and death duties. In 
     <lb/>
     return, if you will lease to us the right to collect 
     <lb/>
     these taxes, we will pay you a fixed amount." 
     <lb/>
     They worked out the basis, haggling over it; 
     <lb/>
     various premiers were trying to get the best deal 
     <lb/>
     possible for their industrial provinces. Seven of 
     <lb/>
     the nine provinces made that agreement with the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They offer us in these terms the same agree<lb break="no"/>ment, only a little bit different. The agreement 
     <lb/>
     with the seven provinces expires in 1952. They 
     <lb/>
     say to us, "You can have it ... on the same terms 
     <lb/>
     to 1952; and if you like, you can have it to 1957. 
     <lb/>
     You have to decide within six months. After you 
     <lb/>
     become a province, your government would have 
     <lb/>
     to make up its mind whether it will sign the tax 
     <lb/>
     agreementuntil 1952 or until 1957. You will have 
     <lb/>
     to make your choice. But if you decide to make 
     <lb/>
     it up to 1957, and the agreement with the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces expires in 1952 and if they negotiate a 
     <lb/>
     new agreement, a better one, more preferable to 
     <lb/>
     them, you will not be entitled to any improve<lb break="no"/>ments they may get starting 1952, you would not 
     <lb/>
     get that until your agreement expired in 1957." 
     <lb/>
     So Newfoundland, if it became a province, would 
     <lb/>
     have to make up its mind within six months, 
     <lb/>
     whether to sign the tax agreement until 1952 and 
     <lb/>
     take a chance on getting a better deal in 1952, 
     <lb/>
     together with the other provinces. The danger of 
     <lb/>
     signing up to 1957 would be that if 1952 rolled 
     <lb/>
     around and the other nine provinces had 
     <lb/>
     negotiated a better deal, a better tax agreement, 
     <lb/>
     then the province might have to wait until 1957 
     <lb/>
     before it could get these additional advantages 
     <lb/>
     and benefits the others had got starting 1952. 
     <lb/>
     Personally, it is only a matter of opinion, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think there is any danger that if the other provin<lb break="no"/>ces in 1952 did get a better tax agreement, the 
     <lb/>
     better agreement would be kept back from New<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
foundland. If were to decide within six months, 
     <lb/>
     if we did become a province, I would take my 
     <lb/>
     chance on signing up to 1952, feeling there will 
     <lb/>
     be a better tax agreement negotiated by the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces in 1952. There may be some questions 
     <lb/>
     on this section and there may be some to be 
     <lb/>
     directed to the Government of Canada.

     <lb/>Canada, if he approves of our signing a tax agree<lb break="no"/>ment with Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would be in favour, if we 
     <lb/>became a province, of signing a tax agreement for 
     <lb/>this reason — that it is unthinkable that there 
     <lb/>should be two income taxes in Newfoundland, or 
     <lb/>that there should be two corporation taxes, or two 
     <lb/>death duties taxes or inheritance taxes. There is 
     <lb/>room for only one. If we refused to make that tax 
     <lb/>agreement, Canada would collect her income tax 
     <lb/>in Canada just the same, and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>would be forced to have its own provincial in<lb break="no"/>come, corporation and inheritance taxes; which 
     <lb/>would be two such taxes on the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and that would be something too 
     <lb/>heavy for the people to bear. It may be asked why 
     <lb/>Ontario and Quebec did not make the agree<lb break="no"/>ment... The reason is that those provinces had a 
     <lb/>tremendous backlog of money accumulated, so 
     <lb/>for a year they would quite easily finance them<lb break="no"/>selves without this income tax; they could spend 
     <lb/>their backlog. For reasons of their own they have 
     <lb/>not signed it and they can go on for a year. They 
     <lb/>do not need to put on provincial income tax. But 
     <lb/>the moment they come to impose that on top of 
     <lb/>the other taxes, the governments of Colonel Drew 
     <lb/>and Duplessis would be wiped out. No one wants 
     <lb/>to pay two income taxes. If Newfoundland be<lb break="no"/>came a province, i would say let us have that

     the provinces these grants from the federal

     treasury, and you will not get, with respect to 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, that careful supervision which 
     <lb/>
     would be exercised if the provinces themsel<lb break="no"/>ves were obliged to raise the money in the

     <lb/>
     vicious system, and that is the reason why the 
     <lb/>
     present administration has been seeking to 
     <lb/>
     put an end to a system that grew up at a time 
     <lb/>
     when the country was in the throes of war or 
     <lb/>
     had to meet a post-war situation — a system 
     <lb/>
     which, had it been pemiitted to develop, 
     <lb/>
     would have become thoroughly destructive 
     <lb/>
     of anything in the shape of economy, with

     When on a previous occasion we were 
     <lb/>
     discussing this matter of grants from one 
     <lb/>
     treasury to another, I said I thought it was an 
     <lb/>
     unsound principle; in fact, I think I used the 
     <lb/>
     expression that it was a vicious principle to 
     <lb/>
     have one body raise the taxes and another 
     <lb/>
     body spend the people's money thus raised.

     There is none. That is the extent of the 
     <lb/>
    statement I made. I was referring to a prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of financing, speaking simply in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to what is sound and what is unsound in 
     <lb/>financing. Anyone interested in financing, 
     <lb/>whether of a municipality, a province, a 
     <lb/>dominion, an empire, or a league of nations, 
     <lb/>will, I think, admit it is unwise, an unsound, 
     <lb/>a wrong principle for one body to have to do 
     <lb/>with raising the taxes and another to be con<lb break="no"/>cerned with the spending of the money so 
     <lb/>raised, that other body not having to account

     The only other authority I have is from a very 
     <lb/>
     celebrated Canadian: "It is a completely false 
     <lb/>
     principle that one government should impose 
     <lb/>
     taxes and another government spend the revenue 
     <lb/>
     therefrom. This will always lead to ex<lb break="no"/>travagance." That is a quotation from Sir Wilfred

     not going to attempt to defend the Prime Minister

     — if he needed any defence against the crime of

     Newfoundland cannot afford to pay income tax 
     <lb/>
     to two governments. It can afford to pay it to only 
     <lb/>
     one. I would he in favour, as were the other seven

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     are firmly in favour of having one government

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I read something on the dominion- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     provincial meeting. I got two clear impressions. 
     <lb/>
     One has not been mentioned here at all, the 
     <lb/>
     question of principle. That is, many people in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, including well-known people in public 
     <lb/>
     life there, felt that by these tax agreements, and 
     <lb/>
     by allowing the central government to control the 
     <lb/>
     finances to a greater extent, you would be 
     <lb/>
     destroying the whole basis of federal government 
     <lb/>
     and create a unitarian state. That is what they 
     <lb/>
     disagreed with. I believe Mr. King felt the same 
     <lb/>
     way some years ago. Another thing I noticed was 
     <lb/>
     this; whenever Mr. King was present at that meet<lb break="no"/>ing he was careful to say very little. These were 
     <lb/>
     two different impressions. The question of prin<lb break="no"/>ciple we ought to consider, for the simple reason 
     <lb/>
     that if you put any more control into the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the federal government, then you are going to get 
     <lb/>
     more dictation from the central government, and 
     <lb/>
     your province is governed by remote control 
     <lb/>
     rather than if you kept more control in your 
     <lb/>
     province itself. I believe very firmly, if you are 
     <lb/>
     going to develop a country, no matter how small, 
     <lb/>
     it has to be done by the people themselves, as 
     <lb/>
     close as you can get to the people — build it up 
     <lb/>
     from the small unions like local councils. When 
     <lb/>
     you get finances centralised in one government a 
     <lb/>
     long distance away, it makes it more expensive 
     <lb/>
     on the taxpayer. That came to my mind when Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood referred to the possibility of losing 
     <lb/>
     some of our services. I do not think it is likely that

     our services such as wharves and bridges will be 
     <lb/>
     cut down. Those things should be done close to 
     <lb/>
     home. On the question of the principle, both 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and Ontario, representative of two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of the people, felt it was a question of destroying 
     <lb/>
     the federal union and creating a unitary state; not 
     <lb/>
     now, but a little later on when the taxes are 
     <lb/>
     extended.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Butt has touched loosely 
     <lb/>
     on a philosophical question which is receiving a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of debate in Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States; that is, on the alleged trend towards 
     <lb/>
     centralisation. He is overlooking something. The 
     <lb/>
     royal commission which lasted three years, and 
     <lb/>
     which scoured Canada from one end to the other 
     <lb/>
     holding hundreds of hearings, went into the 
     <lb/>
     whole question of dominion-provincial relations. 
     <lb/>
     One of the members was Mr. MacKay, editor of 
     <lb/>
     a book which each member has, a book to which 
     <lb/>
     contributions were written by a number of 
     <lb/>
     people. That Rowell-Sirois Commission inves<lb break="no"/>tigated the whole story. Wilfred Eggleston was 
     <lb/>
     one of the members of that commission It was a 
     <lb/>
     most complete, most exhaustive examination of 
     <lb/>
     the country. Three thundering volumes, which 
     <lb/>
     perhaps Mr. Butt consulted. That commission 
     <lb/>
     recommended very strongly the very idea which 
     <lb/>
     was put into effect in part in the wartime tax 
     <lb/>
     agreement, and which has been put into effect in 
     <lb/>
     part by this tax agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I might remind you, sir, that this dominion- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     provincial conference which was held beginning 
     <lb/>
     in August 1945, again in January 1946 and again 
     <lb/>
     in June 1946, three great sessions, was called so 
     <lb/>
     that the federal government could submit to the 
     <lb/>
     nine provinces not merely a tax agreement but a 
     <lb/>
     whole sweeping series of reforms aimed at help<lb break="no"/>ing the population of Canada generally, regard<lb break="no"/>less of what province they might happen to live 
     <lb/>
     in. One was that old age pensions should be made 
     <lb/>
     universal at the age of 65, regardless of their 
     <lb/>
     means. A national health programme, calling for 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $300 million to be distributed 
     <lb/>
     among the provinces, and especially for the 
     <lb/>
     provinces needing it — it was for hospitals, 
     <lb/>
     clinics, all kinds of activities for public health. A 
     <lb/>
     whole series of proposals — the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to have a fund of half a billion dollars, 
     <lb/>
     and a billion to be made available to the different 
     <lb/>
     provinces if things began to slip — that would be 
     <lb/>
     given, not when things were good, but to hold it 
  

            <cb/>
        

     in reserve when things got bad. That dominion- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     provincial conference was not a success. They 
     <lb/>
     put it on the shelf. They have never abandoned it. 
     <lb/>
     They put into effect one feature, the tax agree<lb break="no"/>ment. 1 have read all the sessions — a great 
     <lb/>
     volume from which Mr. Higgins quoted yester<lb break="no"/>day. Mr. Duplessis and Colonel Drew in that 
     <lb/>
     conference harped upon the increasing tendency 
     <lb/>
     towards centralisation in Canada. In studying 
     <lb/>
     Canadian history, we should not only look at the 
     <lb/>
     things said by Messrs. Duplessis and Drew, both 
     <lb/>
     of whom are at bitter personal enmity with the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada, which they have the 
     <lb/>
     right to be, and as Mr. Butt noted, they said there 
     <lb/>
     was an increasing tendency towards centralisa<lb break="no"/>tion. The Government of Canada does not lay 
     <lb/>
     down a pattern for others to follow.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Point of order. I wonder if we are

     The first is clear enough. Special grant of $3.5

     million a year for the first three years; after that 
     <lb/>
     dropping by 10% each year. I would ask you to 
     <lb/>
     note why that grant is offered. It is in order to 
     <lb/>
     facilitate the adjustment of Newfoundland to the 
     <lb/>

     what the financial consequences would be to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in adjusting herself to the status

            <p>It is fairly clear, Newfoundland would be entitled

     They get $6,000 a year, paid by the Government

     House of Commons there would be seven mem<lb break="no"/>bers. These are not appointed. They are elected 
     <lb/>
     by the people and for that purpose Newfoundland

     Conservative, and if at least one man elected from

     <lb/>
     a member of the cabinet. If the Government of

     Canada happened to be Liberal, and there was 
     <lb/>
     one elected Liberal from Newfoundland, he 
     <lb/>
     would be a member of the cabinet. It is an under<lb break="no"/>stood thing, it is not in the bond. As New<lb break="no"/>foundland is such an important fishing country,

     the most important fishing country in the

            <p>
     There is not much to explain on that. The first 
     <lb/>
     one is that Canada would operate a steamship 
     <lb/>
     service between North Sydney and Port-aux- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Basques, with suitable provision for the carriage 
     <lb/>
     of motor vehicles; but that would not be done 
     <lb/>
     until the road between Corner Brook and Port- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     aux-Basques is completed. What is in mind — 
     <lb/>
     what you want is a ferry on which a car which 
     <lb/>
     started, say, in Texas or in any part of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     could drive along the road, drive to North Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, drive on to the motor ferry, land in Port-aux- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Basques.... The other point is clear, the railway 
     <lb/>
     rates would be regulated by the Board of 
     <lb/>
     Transport Commissioners. It is made clear in 3(a) 
     <lb/>
     that traffic moving back and forth across the Gulf 
     <lb/>
     ... will be treated as a railway. The Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Freight Rates Act passed in 1927 and in force 
     <lb/>
     ever since was to this effect, that freight hauled 
     <lb/>
     anywhere within the region is hauled at the 
     <lb/>
     regular rate, but the government pays 20% of the 
     <lb/>
     freight rate; the man who ships it or receives it 
     <lb/>
     pays 80%. By making Newfoundland part of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime region, any freight put aboard 
     <lb/>
     anywhere in Newfoundland, shipped to 
     <lb/>
     anywhere in Canada would be shipped at a 
     <lb/>
     reduction of 20% in the freight rates. In the same 
     <lb/>
     way, any freight that originated anywhere in the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime region on the mainland of Canada... 
     <lb/>
     coming to Newfoundland by rail would be hauled 
     <lb/>
     at a reduction of 20% in the freight rate. There is 
     <lb/>
     another act, an act under which feeds, animal and 
     <lb/>
     poultry feeds shipped to the extremities of 
     <lb/>
     Canada... are free of charge, no freight charges 
     <lb/>
     on any amount, from Fort William or Port Arthur 
     <lb/>
     all the way down to Halifax or St. John. If New<lb break="no"/>foundland became a province, feeds for animal 
     <lb/>
     and poultry would be hauled here without 
     <lb/>
     costing one cent for freight, which is a very 
     <lb/>
     important item in any Consideration of livestock 
     <lb/>
     or poultry raising. I do not know if there is 
     <lb/>
     anything else I can add.

     <lb/>
     Railways took over the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     after it became bankrupt. The Canadian National 
     <lb/>
     is the largest publicly-owned railway; the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific is the largest privately-owned, 
     <lb/>
     running on its own. Just prior to the war the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific were in such difficulties that 
     <lb/>
     they had to go to the government which had to 
     <lb/>
     guarantee them a loan. They started paying back 
     <lb/>
     interest on common stock. Today it is practically 
     <lb/>
     as bad as ours. With regard to our rolling stock, 
     <lb/>
     we have information that the Railway spent $1 
     <lb/>
     million in converting our locomotives from coal 
     <lb/>
     to oil. If Canada takes over, they will be taking 
     <lb/>
     over locomotives in first class condition.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> This proportional increase of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It does not apply to steamship and 
     <lb/>
     most of our traffic out of the Dominion is by boat 
     <lb/>
     — boat from Halifax — and it would not apply

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I believe that is the case.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Would you explain a little further. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It begins at Levis, just below 
     <lb/>the City of Quebec — all east of that is the 
     <lb/>Maritime region; it takes in roughly half of 
     <lb/>Quebec and all of Nova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That act was passed to keep the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Coal Company afloat, without which 
     <lb/>
     they would not have been able to get the coal to 
     <lb/>
     the market. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> In theory it looks to be a fine act; 
     <lb/>
     but in practice, as most of our haulage is by boat, 
     <lb/>
     it is not of any real value to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I put this to you: many people 
     <lb/>
     in this country are convinced, and many people 
     <lb/>
     in this chamber are convinced that New<lb break="no"/>foundland should and will perhaps become an 
     <lb/>
     important livestock country. Newfoundland, sir, 
     <lb/>
     will never be, and can never be an important 
     <lb/>
     livestock country until feeds are made as cheap 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland as they are in the mainland of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Mr. Crosbie has started this gigantic 
     <lb/>
     herring meal plant in Bay of Islands. I believe 
     <lb/>
     other firms are making herring meal or other fish 
     <lb/>
     meal. There is not a market for it in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, so I understand. But what is to prevent 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Crosbie and some other progressive firms 
     <lb/>
     from starting a feed mill, if you can bring in feeds 
     <lb/>
     free all the way from the prairie provinces to 
     <lb/>
     Corner Brook without costing anything for 
     <lb/>
     freight — why not a feed mill in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     ...? You have at one blow destroyed the obstacle, 
     <lb/>
     or half the obstacle, to a livestock industry. The 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Freight Rates Act could be the means 
     <lb/>
     of our becoming an important livestock country.

     What is to prevent all kinds of other products 
     <lb/>
     coming into Newfoundland from the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     region of Canada? Look at the figures in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book, there are figures showing the actual 
     <lb/>
     tonnages of Newfoundland products shipped to 
     <lb/>
     Canada west of the Maritime region; huge quan<lb break="no"/>tities. What is to prevent some of them going to 
     <lb/>
     rail all the way, with a 20% reduction. Finally, 
     <lb/>
     this point was put to us by Mr. St. Laurent at a 
     <lb/>
     plenary session when we asked him did it apply 
     <lb/>
     to steamships, as a lot of our stock comes and 
     <lb/>
     goes out by water, and this 20% reduction on 
     <lb/>
     stock coming in and going out by rail would not 
     <lb/>
     help us much. He said, "Surely the railway 
     <lb/>
     operating between the mainland of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would have to be cut in its rates 
     <lb/>
     by the competition it might have from steamers. 
     <lb/>
     Would your steamers not have to cut their rates 
     <lb/>
     by reason of competition from the railway?" 
     <lb/>
     You would have two means — rail and water, one 
     <lb/>
     is competing with the other; then the trade of the 
     <lb/>
     country would thrive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> On this point about the feeds 
     <lb/>
     originating in the west — I do not think they haul 
     <lb/>
     grain into Fort William or Port Arthur for noth<lb break="no"/>ing. The grain that comes from there, comes by 
     <lb/>
     water. Rail haul is much more expensive than 
     <lb/>
     waterhaul. That was why they gave that 20% 
     <lb/>
     reduction; they cannot compete with waterhaul. 
     <lb/>
     That is one point. Waterhaul is much cheaper 
     <lb/>
     than rail — 50% cheaper.
