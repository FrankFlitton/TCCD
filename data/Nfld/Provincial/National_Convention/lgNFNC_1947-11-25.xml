 <!--<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not follow you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He wants to know what is the 
     <lb/>
     exact relation of the figures set forth on page 30 
     <lb/>
     under the caption or heading "Sick Mariners' 
     <lb/>
     Dues by Province" and giving a list of provinces. 
     <lb/>
     This is supposed to be a public service provided 
     <lb/>
     by Canada. Mr. Harrington directs our attention 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that on page 30, immediately opposite 
     <lb/>
     the various provinces listed, there are various 
     <lb/>
     figures; he wants to know in what way these 
     <lb/>
     figures relate to or are tied up with the providing 
     <lb/>
     of public services by the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is easily explained.... That 
     <lb/>is revenue received by the federal government in 
     <lb/>these provinces by that scheme; and expenditure 
     <lb/>made by the federal government in those provin<lb break="no"/>ces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman Just before recess I put a question 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Smallwood regarding the personnel of 
     <lb/>
     sanatoria. I did that for a certain reason. I do not 
     <lb/>
     want Mr. Smallwood to put false hopes in the 
     <lb/>
     hearts of those suffering from TB, because there 
     <lb/>
     is a real problem we are up against regarding 
     <lb/>
     personnel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> To which he has already replied. 
     <lb/>
     He does realise it, but that will be a matter for the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government to worry about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I think Mr. Smallwood will confirm 
     <lb/>
     that that statement was nothing more than con<lb break="no"/>jecture on his part. There may or may not be 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     sanatoria erected. I think we must stick to this 
     <lb/>
     document as nearly as possible — to the written 
     <lb/>
     word we have before us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite agree. If we concern our<lb break="no"/>selves with the contents of this document instead 
     <lb/>
     of wandering, it would be better. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> This is not my previous conception of 
     <lb/>
     what the sick mariners' service was intended to 
     <lb/>
     be. I thought the service was intended to take care 
     <lb/>
     of people who should become sick while, say, out 
     <lb/>
     on the Banks ... but not to take care of long-term 
     <lb/>
     illnesses such as TB. That would be open to 
     <lb/>
     tremendous abuse. Suppose I was unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     enough to believe I had some serious illness 
     <lb/>
     while at home. There is no earthly reason, if I 
     <lb/>
     could stand on my feet, why I could not get 
     <lb/>
     myself signed on as a cookee, and in that way get 
     <lb/>
     myself into a hospital free, although I could jolly 
     <lb/>
     well afford to pay for hospitalisation. I would like 
     <lb/>
     to think about this and get something more 
     <lb/>
     precise on the matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is your right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I think it is rather late in the evening 
     <lb/>
     to start a new section like assistance in housing. 
     <lb/>
     I therefore move that the committee rise, report 
     <lb/>
     progress and ask leave to sit again tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>[The committee rose and reported progress. 
     <lb/>Various items on the order paper were deferred, 
     <lb/>and the Convention adjourned.]

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is the number of vessels 
     <lb/>
     owned by the government under all headings. 
     <lb/>
     They segregated those not owned by the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Railway from those that are owned; 
     <lb/>
     they only deal with those owned by the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> The ownership of those would be 
     <lb/>
     vested in Newfoundland. What would be the 
     <lb/>
     position of a federallyuoperated boat and a 
     <lb/>
     provinciallycperated boat in competition to the 
     <lb/>
     other?.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It would be the same as exists 
     <lb/>
     today. In Newfoundland we have ships in the 
     <lb/>
     foreign and local trade not owned by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment in any sense of the word, competing with 
     <lb/>
     ships that are so owned. In Canada there is the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government merchant marine, there 
     <lb/>
     are privately owned ships, and I daresay there are 
     <lb/>
     provincially owned ships. Various things could 
     <lb/>
     be done. Maybe the Canadian merchant marine 
     <lb/>
     could be asked to operate them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I am concerned about this. These 
     <lb/>
     are now operating. What would happen then to 
     <lb/>
     the vessels operating in competition between the 
     <lb/>
     federal and the provincial government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I cannot be expected to say, if 
     <lb/>
     we became a province, what that government 
     <lb/>
     should do with its own property. That would be 
     <lb/>
     its problem to solve in its own way.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Have you any guarantee that these 
     <lb/>
     ships would belong to the province — anything 
     <lb/>
     to go on? Do you know whether they would 
     <lb/>
     remain with the province or whether they would 
  

<cb/>

     be taken over by the federal government? These 
     <lb/>
     cost the government quite a bit and they are 
     <lb/>
     worth a lot. In fact they are one of the best assets 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government could have. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood I suggest the members might 
     <lb/>
     help me out in this — apparently the list of ships 
     <lb/>
     is not reproduced in this volume. Is no one 
     <lb/>
     present who can say anything definitely about 
     <lb/>
     these l9 vessels? Has the Railway got 19 vessels 
     <lb/>
     including the Clarenville boats? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Nineteen would include Claren<lb break="no"/>ville boats. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Since we are considering clause 5, it 
     <lb/>
     says, "At the union, or as soon as practicable 
     <lb/>
     thereafter, the following services will be taken 
     <lb/>
     over by Canada and become subject to the juris— 
     <lb/>
     diction of Parliament." I think Mr. Smallwood in 
     <lb/>
     his interpretation has to be governed by this Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book. It says further, "Newfoundland to be 
     <lb/>
     relieved of the public costs incurred in respect to 
     <lb/>
     each service after it is taken over". We will be 
     <lb/>
     relieved only in pan of these public costs. We will 
     <lb/>
     be contributing to the taxes collected by the 
     <lb/>
     federal government, we will bear a proportion of 
     <lb/>
     this cost. A fair interpretation would be that the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland provincial government would be 
     <lb/>
     relieved of the cost, but Newfoundland as a 
     <lb/>
     people will pay a proportionate share of the cost 
     <lb/>
     into the federal government... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Miller is right. There is not 
     <lb/>
     much need for concern over the wording of the 
     <lb/>
     clause. Incidentally, I hate to jump from one 
     <lb/>
     subject to another, but in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Hotel, since 1932 it has lost 
     <lb/>
     $162,000 to date on operating costs. I have that

     note entered here in my own writing.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The Natural Resources own

     some. Some boats owned or operated by the

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Apparently, according to this, the

            <p><persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Just one question comes to 
     <lb/>mind. Clause 5, section (1), "the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Railway, including steamship and other marine 
     <lb/>services." That is official. That is in the proposed 
     <lb/>arrangements. In Volume 2, page 69,<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> reference 
     <lb/>is made to the condition of the property of the 
     <lb/>railway and steamship services. The second para<lb break="no"/>graph should have been read in connection with 
     <lb/>the rehabilitation that is likely to have to take 
     <lb/>place in connection with the railway and steam<lb break="no"/>ship service. That is provisional. That is not 
     <lb/>guaranteed. They presume certain works would 
     <lb/>have to be done. There is no guarantee they will 
     <lb/>be done, once we become a province. Was this 
     <lb/>memorandum prepared by the Government of 
     <lb/>Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is a memorandum 
     <lb/>prepared for the cabinet of Canada by the railway 
     <lb/>and steamship officials of that government, the 
     <lb/>President of the Clarke Steamship Company, and 
     <lb/>the Vice-President of the Canadian National 
     <lb/>Railways. They prepared it. If the Canadian 
     <lb/>government were to offer, in this document, to 
     <lb/>take over the railway and steamship service, they 
     <lb/>wanted to have some idea of what they would be 
     <lb/>taking over, and whether it had been making 
     <lb/>money or losing it; what condition it is in; how 
     <lb/>much money would likely have to be spent to put 
     <lb/>it in good condition, if it is not in good condition. 
     <lb/>They asked their authorities, railway experts, to 
     <lb/>prepare a memorandum; in the next ten years, $10 
     <lb/>million would have to be spent to put the railway 
     <lb/>system in good condition. The rails would need 
     <lb/>to be renewed, ballast renewed, embankments 
     <lb/>and cuts widened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is for re-railing?

     <lb/>It would appear that the rails would need to

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is $7 million covering

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. "It may be hazarded that 
     <lb/>
     the cost of rehabilitating rolling stock over a 
     <lb/>
     ten-year period would be of the order of $7 mil<lb break="no"/>lion." That is $17 million the railway expects it 
     <lb/>
     would need to spend. Commander Edwards, 
     <lb/>
     Deputy Minister of Transport, who was one of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government committee, met with 
     <lb/>
     us on this railway question. He has been in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and knows our railway system. He is 
     <lb/>
     an expert railway man. This memorandum is 
     <lb/>
     based on the data we brought up to them; some 
     <lb/>
     of it we got afterwards, at their request; and also 
     <lb/>
     of their own knowledge. They have a fairly good 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the railways of other countries.... 
     <lb/>
     This memorandum, as Mr. Harrington says, is not 
     <lb/>
     an undertaking, it is not a bond; it is not in the 
     <lb/>
     terms. The Canadian government has been in<lb break="no"/>formed by their own experts that $17 million 
     <lb/>
     would have to be spent to make it shipshape over 
     <lb/>
     a period of years. I would draw Mr. Harrington's 
     <lb/>
     attention to the fact that freight rates would 
     <lb/>
     presumably be reduced; express rates would 
     <lb/>
     presumably be reduced; passenger rates would 
     <lb/>
     presumably be reduced. That is the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     railway experts of Canada. They assume that if 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada takes over the system, 
     <lb/>
     and makes it part and parcel of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     National Railways, naturally they will have the 
     <lb/>
     same freight, same passenger, same express rates 
     <lb/>
     as in Canada. Mr. Harrington is right, it is not 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed. Personally I have no doubt about it; 
     <lb/>
     still, it is not so stated in the terms.

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> When Mr. Smallwood was talking

     The standard Canadian classification and

     if the benefits of the Maritime Freight Rates

     these two in combination would define max<lb break="no"/>imum rates. The resulting rate structure

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am familiar with the first 
     <lb/>
     point. I attended meetings of the Board of 
     <lb/>
     Transport Commissioners. Some friends of 
     <lb/>
     yours, Mr. Chairman, were participating as coun<lb break="no"/>sel for the various provinces they represented. 
     <lb/>
     One morning Mr. Higgins, Mr. Bradley and 
     <lb/>
     myself went up and attended the hearings of the 
     <lb/>
     railways who are applying to have their freight 
     <lb/>
     rates increased. They are applying to the Board 
     <lb/>
     for 30% increase 'across the board' as they call 
     <lb/>
     it. I attended day after day. It was never done. I 
     <lb/>
     am not saying it could not be done. All over North 
     <lb/>
     America the railways are trying to get the freight 
   

            <cb/>
          

     rates up. They are all claiming they are losing 
     <lb/>
     money. On the other point, there is not a sugges<lb break="no"/>tion, not a hint of the abolition of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Freight Rates Act. There has been 20% reduction 
     <lb/>
     on freight rates in the Maritime region, which is 
     <lb/>
     east of Lévis; but there has never been the 
     <lb/>
     slightest hint or suggestion of the abolition of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Freight Rates Act. Mr. Hickman is 
     <lb/>
     right, they have been trying to get an increase in 
     <lb/>
     freight rates. But the Maritime Freight Rates Act 
     <lb/>
     is there; it is a statutory act. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> It has been on the carpet for some 
     <lb/>time and I note from the papers that the question 
     <lb/>is up again of a 30% increase, and it specifically 
     <lb/>mentioned also the cancellation of the subsidy to 
     <lb/>the Maritimes. I do not know if that means the 
     <lb/>cancellation of the Maritime Freight Rates Act. 
     <lb/>This came up for decision since Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>was in Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now I know what he is refer<lb break="no"/>ring to. The Maritime Freight Rates Act is one 
     <lb/>thing; that is statutory. What Mr. Hickman is 
     <lb/>referring to is the subsidy paid on grains. There 
     <lb/>are two subsidies. All feeds, all animal and 
     <lb/>poultry feed grains from the Prairie provinces 
     <lb/>going into the Pacific coast and Atlantic coast are 
     <lb/>hauled freight-free.... I do not want to anticipate 
     <lb/>it; but when it comes, that is to be applied to

     <lb/>has been something else. During the war the

     <lb/>subsidy of so much a bushel and the subsidy was 
     <lb/>to encourage them to grow the things that the 
     <lb/>government wanted to be grown during the war. 
     <lb/>They have now taken that off. But as to the 
     <lb/>hauling of it down through the Maritimes, it is 
     <lb/>hauled freight-free. Mr. Hickman is referring to 
     <lb/>the taking off of the subsidy given the Prairie

     proposed terms, the sub-section dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Hotel was then introduced by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, who stated that the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment would take over the operation of this hotel 
     <lb/>
     if such was desired by the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Mr. Smallwood said that the CNR 
     <lb/>
     operated a chain of hotels, and in the event of 
     <lb/>
     union it would be possible, perhaps advisable, 
     <lb/>
     that the Newfoundland Hotel would be acquired 
     <lb/>
     by that company. Mr. Bailey expressed the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that this was the best reason for con<lb break="no"/>federation which he had heard so far</hi>.

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">The sub-section dealing with Posts and 
     <lb/>
     Telegraphs was brought up for discussion. These 
     <lb/>
     services, though considered as two separate ser<lb break="no"/>vices in Canada, would be taken over as a single 
     <lb/>
     service if Newfoundland entered confederation</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">A question was raised whether the federal 
     <lb/>
     government would continue to employ the New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders in the service at the time of union. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood stated that the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment was duty bound to employ in the public 
     <lb/>
     services of a province, citizens of that province. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fogwill wondered if the persons now 
     <lb/>
     employed by Posts and Telegraphs would be 
     <lb/>
     required to qualify for jobs according to stand<lb break="no"/>ards set by the federal government: if the 
     <lb/>
     qualifications required were higher than those in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, would it mean that persons now 
     <lb/>
     employed, who failed to meet these qualifica<lb break="no"/>tions, would be discharged? Mr. Smallwood felt 
     <lb/>
     certain that if persons were unqualified for their 
     <lb/>
     jobs, every opportunity would be given to those 
     <lb/>
     employees to qualify</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mr. Fogwill wanted to know why revenue from 
     <lb/>
     Posts and Telegraphs estimated by Canada was 
     <lb/>
     $1 million below the amount estimated for the 
     <lb/>
     1947-48 period by the present government. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood stated that in the event of union this 
     <lb/>
     service would be taken over by the federal 
     <lb/>
     government. Postage rates would be lower and 
     <lb/>
     wages would be increased, hence the difference 
     <lb/>
     in the two estimates. He went on to say that 
     <lb/>
     during the period 1920 to 1940, Posts and 
     <lb/>
     Telegraphs in Newfoundland averaged a yearly 
     <lb/>
     deficit of $500,000</hi>.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It may be a fair inference from 
     <lb/>
     a purely legal standpoint. But to me it is not a fair 
     <lb/>
     or realistic inference at all; the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada in taking over these services will give us 
     <lb/>
     much better service, but as for a guarantee, no, 
     <lb/>
     there is no guarantee. That is a matter of what has 
     <lb/>
     been said and of what we believe. I believe, 
     <lb/>
     personally, that they will give us a little better 
     <lb/>
     service. I wish Mr. Higgins were here. He was 
     <lb/>
     one of the three delegates who were at the meet<lb break="no"/>ing. When the meeting ended we were chatting 
     <lb/>
     around in groups with the railway experts, espe<lb break="no"/>cially Commander Edwards. The Deputy Mini<lb break="no"/>ster of Transport said, "If and when 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland comes into confederation, what 
     <lb/>
     do you think would become of the railway? What 
     <lb/>
     do you think, Captain, do you think they will do 
     <lb/>
     something for the railway, put it in good shape?" 
     <lb/>
     He said, "What else? Either that, or we will have 
     <lb/>
     a railway hanging on us, dragging on us, a burden 
     <lb/>
     on us." ....He said, "If you ever come in with us, 
     <lb/>
     you will have the best railway you ever had." But 
     <lb/>
     there is no guarantee of it in the Grey Book. No 
     <lb/>
     guarantee about the railway and the steamship 
     <lb/>
     services. No guarantee they would not even shut 
     <lb/>
     them down. If anyone prefers to think that, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot stop them. I do not believe that. On the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, I believe the services the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canadian would take over would be operated 
     <lb/>
     more efficiently and with better service to the

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> A very strong point, to my mind — 
     <lb/>
     I did not want to bring it up, but Mr. Miller 
     <lb/>
     brought it forward. For 40 years I have travelled, 
     <lb/>
     now and again, between North Sydney and Truro. 
     <lb/>
     If we are going to have that class of railroad under 
     <lb/>
     confederation, I do not think it is going to suit 
     <lb/>
     us.... The people up there have been fighting to 
     <lb/>
     get a bridge across the Gut of Canso since 1910. 
     <lb/>
     Anyone who has travelled over that railway, 
     <lb/>
     especially if you are coming east, would think 
     <lb/>
     there are square wheels under the track. I will not 
     <lb/>
     say anything about the cars. It is apparent that it 
     <lb/>
     is worse today than it was back in 1911 and 1912. 
     <lb/>
     If that is the type of railroad we are going to get, 
     <lb/>
     I think we should hold on to the one we have. It 
     <lb/>
     is not going to be good enough. I am sure there 
     <lb/>
     was nothing in this country that was worse.... We 
     <lb/>
     have the Grey Book and the Black Books and 
     <lb/>
     other books, but there is no guarantee. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to see their John Hancocks there before I 
     <lb/>
     marked my "x" for confederation. I have been 
     <lb/>
     doubtful about this all the time. Since Mr. Miller 
     <lb/>
     brought it up, I would bring it to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the members here.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have travelled on the railway 
     <lb/>
     line to which Mr. Bailey refers, quite recently — 


            <cb/>
          

    
     a couple or three months before, going to Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     The whole delegation travelled across New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Having crossed the Gulf and landed 
     <lb/>
     at North Sydney we were all awake to watch that 
     <lb/>
     railway. We left 8 o'clock in the morning. We 
     <lb/>
     were travelling in the day. Everyone was watch<lb break="no"/>ing the railway, sizing it up, getting the feel of it. 
     <lb/>
     I, for one, will say now that the worst railway 
     <lb/>
     across Canada is that railway, but it is better than 
     <lb/>
     our cross-country railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is your opinion. The best 
     <lb/>
     way is for all of us to travel over the railway and 
     <lb/>
     see for ourselves. Every man can then make up 
     <lb/>
     his own mind. Now, let Captain Bailey go a little 
     <lb/>
     bit further, let him go down and take a look at the 
     <lb/>
     kind of service the Government of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     providing for tiny Prince Edward Island, 2,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles in size, with a population of 
     <lb/>
     95,000.... When that Island joined the union as a 
     <lb/>
     province, the terms contained a clause saying the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada would maintain a ferry 
     <lb/>
     service between the mainland and Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island. I wonder if Captain Bailey has any 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the monumental sum of money that 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada has spent to keep that 
     <lb/>
     promise. In 1917 the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     spent $1 million to build a ferryboat to connect 
     <lb/>
     that province. In 1927 they built another one 
     <lb/>
     which cost $2 million. Remember, our <hi rendition="simple:italic">Caribou</hi><ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     cost $500,000 in 1925.... In 1947 the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada spent $5 million to provide a new ferry 
     <lb/>
     and in addition they spent $6 million to improve 
     <lb/>
     the terminals at each end of her run.... In addition 
     <lb/>
     to that, they found when they took over Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, that they had a narrow gauge 
     <lb/>
     railway. They took over that railway. What did 
     <lb/>
     they do to that railway? They made it a broad 
     <lb/>
     gauge. I remember the first time I ever visited 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, the broad gauge railway 
     <lb/>
     ran only half-way across the Island, up to Char<lb break="no"/>lottetown; then the rest of the distance was nar<lb break="no"/>row gauge. The Government of Canada spent $11 
     <lb/>
     million in that little province in 1947. They have 
     <lb/>
     no political influence, they count very little... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Point of order. I think we should 
     <lb/>confine our remarks to the report, not to what 
     <lb/>happened to Prince Edward Island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is not a good point of order. 
     <lb/>
     But in order to save time, I will pass that.

     spend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Point of order. What is Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood now quoting from? Have you that 
     <lb/>
     contract and could we see it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is in the BNA Act, the terms 
     <lb/>
     offered to Prince Edward Island, what would 
     <lb/>
     happen if she became a province. You will find 
     <lb/>
     it says nothing about how much they would spend 
     <lb/>
     to maintain that ferry service; nothing more than 
     <lb/>
     just a simple clause saying they would maintain 
     <lb/>
     a continuous ferry service winter and summer 
     <lb/>
     from the mainland... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I want the whole terms offered to 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It would be a simple thing to

     have it copied and mimeographed.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> That would suit me fine. These

     terms to us do not say they will maintain an

     efficient service between the mainland and the 
     <lb/>
     island. They do not contract to do any such thing. 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You will find, in the terms of<lb break="no"/>fered by Canada, that they have covered that very 
     <lb/>point. They have gone further than any clause 
     <lb/>offered Prince Edward Island in 1873. What they 
     <lb/>have done in our case is, they have offered to 
     <lb/>provide and maintain a service for the con<lb break="no"/>veyance of motor vehicles; it will be a type of 
     <lb/>ferry that will take motor cars, where they will 
     <lb/>not be dumped into the hold with a winch. In

            <cb/>
         

     that it a point of order. I am attempting to deal 
     <lb/>
     with a point. I was challenged to produce the

     clause offered to Prince Edward Island. I am 
     <lb/>
     pointing out a similar clause, only a better one, 
     <lb/>
     offered us in 1947. Perhaps in dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     clause we have come to a clause which has not 
     <lb/>
     been dealt with, but I have done that at Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Crosbie's request.

            <p>

     <lb/>was only this year that they got it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would not Mr. Reddy call a $2

     million ferry service in 1927 a good ferry ser<lb break="no"/>vice? In the last 50 years and longer, since 1873, 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada has spent scores of 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars to give them a decent service. 
     <lb/>
     And now Mr. Reddy says they waited until 1947. 
     <lb/>
     He is completely wrong.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> The Prince Edward Island people, 
     <lb/>
     like ourselves, are on an island. They have been 
     <lb/>
     paying freight rates over a number of years to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railway and also when it was 
     <lb/>
     a private service. They were paying for service 
     <lb/>
     they did not get. I can assure you that whatever 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island got, they got it through 
     <lb/>
     fighting hard. I have been in their parliament. I 
     <lb/>
     was talking to their men. I have seen their ferries 
     <lb/>
     going out and the conditions they worked under. 
     <lb/>
     I am glad they got the service. They deserved it. 
     <lb/>
     After all, as they pointed out, they have to ship 
     <lb/>
     out a lot of potatoes and other vegetables. They 
     <lb/>
     had a very hard fight. If they had the old type of 
     <lb/>
     service today, it would turn people against con<lb break="no"/>federation. They did not get it before. A $2 mil<lb break="no"/>lion vessel on that strait was not good enough for 
     <lb/>
     the job she had to do, especially a sea-train. I have 
     <lb/>
     been on a couple of them. The cost of construc<lb break="no"/>tion of the vessel was way above the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     class of vessel. They also had to bring along an 
     <lb/>
     icebreaker with it. They did not get any $2 million 
     <lb/>
     vessel in 1927, and very little in 1917.

     15. The Department of Fisheries has 
     <lb/>
     legislative jurisdiction over all the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. In the administrative field the 
     <lb/>
     Department has administrative authority 
     <lb/>
     over the public fisheries of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces and British Columbia, where for 
     <lb/>
     administrative purposes the Eastern and 
     <lb/>
     Western Fisheries Divisions are established. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     16. The Eastern Division is in charge of 
     <lb/>
     aChief Supervisor of Fisheries and is divided 
     <lb/>
     into three regions; Nova Scotia, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, each 
     <lb/>
     of which is in charge of a Regional Super<lb break="no"/>visor of Fisheries. Each region is divided into 
     <lb/>
     units as follows: Nova Scotia, 8; New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, 5; and Prince Edward Island, 2. 
     <lb/>
     Each unit is in charge of a. Senior Inspector, 
     <lb/>
     and according to the intensity and importance 
     <lb/>
     of the fisheries of each unit a number of 
     <lb/>
     Junior Inspectors are employed. In many 
     <lb/>
     units part time fishery guardians or wardens 
     <lb/>
     are employed for protective purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     17. Protection of the Eastern sea fisheries 
     <lb/>
     is maintained by six coastal patrol boats 
     <lb/>
     owned by the Department and 13 boats 
     <lb/>
     chartered for seasonal operation. The Depart<lb break="no"/>ment also operates a fisheries protection 
     <lb/>
     cruiser. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     18. The Fish Culture Branch provides a 
     <lb/>
     field service which operates 30 hatcheries, 6 
     <lb/>
     rearing stations and 6 salmon-retaining 
     <lb/>
     ponds in the Eastern Division The object of 
     <lb/>
     this work is to maintain and increase fish 
     <lb/>
     stocks. Conservation is also achieved by 
     <lb/>
     regulatory action. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     19. The Fisheries Research Board carries 
     <lb/>
     out investigations of practical and economic 
     <lb/>
     problems connected with marine and fresh 
     <lb/>
     water fisheries. It cooperates with other 
     <lb/>branches of the Department in providing ad<lb break="no"/>vice and instruction to the fishing undustry<lb/>regarding the most efficient methods of fish


            <cb/>

         
handling and processing. Adult education in<lb/>this connection is carried out at several<lb/>centres.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>20. The Board operates 7 scientific sta<lb break="no"/>tions, 4 of which are located in Eastern<lb/>Canada. The latter are the Atlantic Biological<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     Station at St. Andrews, NB (with a sub-sta<lb break="no"/>tion at Ellerslie, PEI), the Fisheries Ex<lb break="no"/>perimental Stations at Halifax and Grand 
     <lb/>
     River, PO, and the Atlantic Salmon Investi<lb break="no"/>gation Station. There is a trained staff of 
     <lb/>
     scientists at each station and a number of 
     <lb/>
     non-scientific personnel are also employed. 
     <lb/>
     The Board is associated with other scientific 
     <lb/>
     committees such as the Joint Canadian Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on Oceanography and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Committee on Food Preservation. The Board 
     <lb/>
     is also responsible for the direction and ex<lb break="no"/>ecution of the work of the Atlantic Herring 
     <lb/>
     Investigation Committee. This Committee 
     <lb/>
     was created in 1944 as a result of negotiations 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland and with the Provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island and Quebec. The Committee is 
     <lb/>
     carrying out an intensive investigation of the 
     <lb/>
     herring industry of the Atlantic Coast. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Province of Quebec is the only 
     <lb/>province administering its own sea fisheries. 
     <lb/>Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Al<lb break="no"/>berta also have administrative responsibility 
     <lb/>for their own fisheries but the Federal 
     <lb/>Department co-operates to the fullest extent 
     <lb/>with the Fisheries Administrative Services of 
     <lb/>these provinces, as well as of the province of 
     <lb/>Quebec. The province of Nova Scotia has a 
     <lb/>fisheries division which works in close co<lb break="no"/>operation with the Federal authorities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Fisheries Prices Support Act was 
     <lb/>
     passed in 1944 and proclaimed in July, 1947, 
     <lb/>
     the Board under the Act then being named by 
     <lb/>
     the Government. The Act covers the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     products of Canada as a whole, and if New<lb break="no"/>foundland were part of Canada, would apply 
     <lb/>
     there as elsewhere in the Dominion. In the 
     <lb/>
     event of Newfoundland entering Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, the Federal Government would wish to 
     <lb/>
     reconsider the present membership of the 
     <lb/>
     Prices Support Board, with a view to having 
     <lb/>
     proper Newfoundland representation on the 
     <lb/>
     Board itself. Likewise the Board, which has 
     <lb/>
     named three Advisory Committees (one rep<lb break="no"/>resenting the west coast fishery, one the in<lb break="no"/>land, and one the Quebec and Maritime 
     <lb/>
     fishery) would probably wish to add to its 
     <lb/>
     advisory groups representatives of New<lb break="no"/>foundland fishermen, producers and ex<lb break="no"/>porters, or if the people preferred to have the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Fisheries Board act in an ad<lb break="no"/>visory capacity on Newfoundland fishery 
     <lb/>
     matters.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Act outlines the powers of the Board 
     <lb/>
     (section 9). It will be noted that these powers 
     <lb/>
     are mainly those powers are mainly those of 
     <lb/>
     buying and selling fisheries products, either 
     <lb/>
     directly by the Board itself or through agents, 
     <lb/>
     and the powers of paying deficiency pay<lb break="no"/>ments. There is nothing in the Act to prevent 
     <lb/>
     the Support Board from naming the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Fisheries Board or any of the 
     <lb/>
     Co-operative marketing groups in New<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
     foundland as its agents for the handling, that 
     <lb/>
     is buying and/or selling Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     fisheries products. In short, there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     in the present Canadian Act that would 
     <lb/>
     necessarily interfere with the present or<lb break="no"/>ganization and methods of operation of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fish trade, and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Prices Support Board would, no doubt, wish 
     <lb/>
     to take advantage of all existing machinery 
     <lb/>
     that could readily be used to complement its 
     <lb/>
     operations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prices Support Board, it should be 
     <lb/>
    noted, has no "wartime" powers such as were 
     <lb/>held by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. 
     <lb/>It cannot define prices as was done during 
     <lb/>wartime. It can influence prices mainly 
     <lb/>"through buying and selling, or through 
     <lb/>deficiency payments and it has no powers of 
     <lb/>allocation and no powers of directing the 
     <lb/>marketing of individuals or groups except 
     <lb/>when such persons are acting as the agents of 
     <lb/>the Board itself and handling the particular 
     <lb/>products being bought and sold by the Board 
     <lb/>itself. The Board can, of course, make its 
     <lb/>purchases and sales subject to certain stand<lb break="no"/>ards of grading.

            <p>
     ....We had a meeting with the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     authorities who explained to us fairly thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     the idea of the Fisheries Prices Support Board. If 
     <lb/>
     the price of fish begins to slip, especially in 
     <lb/>
     foreign markets, the Board may step in and by 
     <lb/>
     buying a quantity of fish help to keep the price 
     <lb/>
     from sinking. A very striking example of the way 
     <lb/>
     that works happened while we were in Ottawa. It 
     <lb/>
     was not fish — but the same principle is used — 
     <lb/>
     it was the apple crop of the Annapolis Valley in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. They had a crop worth some $10 
     <lb/>
     million; ... Britain was buying the apples. Sud<lb break="no"/>denly Britain said it could not afford the dollars; 
     <lb/>
     they thought they could use the dollars on some<lb break="no"/>thing more necessary. They cancelled their order. 
     <lb/>
     The Canadian government stepped in and bought 
     <lb/>
     the entire crop and gave them away for relief 
     <lb/>
     in Greece and Italy and sent so many to Britain 
     <lb/>
     as a gift, to help out the apple growers of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. This Fisheries Board is supposed to 
     <lb/>
     operate in something the same way....

     present Canadian act that would necessarily in<lb break="no"/>terfere with the present organisation and methods 
     <lb/>
     of operation of the Newfoundland fish trade." I 
     <lb/>
     say that because, while I have had nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with fish for many years now, I feel convinced 
     <lb/>
     that our system here in Newfoundland has been 
     <lb/>
     better than the Canadian system of marketing. To 
     <lb/>
     bear that out, there was a delegation this summer 
     <lb/>
     from Nova Scotia to endeavour to find out the 
     <lb/>
     basis of our set-up so that they could set one up 
     <lb/>
     in Canada. Since then we have gone further; we 
     <lb/>
     have now the Codfish Exporters Limited,<ref target="#fn_13">[1]</ref> or 
     <lb/>
     some such name, and instead of various groups 
     <lb/>
     or committees, we have now one marketing or<lb break="no"/>ganisation. I am glad to see there can be no 
     <lb/>
     interference with Newfoundland. We may derive 
     <lb/>
     benefits! We are away ahead of them so far. And 
     <lb/>
     as long as it cannot be interfered with, that is 
     <lb/>
     something in our favour.

     <lb/>with it, I may be fishing at the time, but whoever 
     <lb/>has to do with the negotiating of it will have to be 
     <lb/>very careful with our fisheries. I refer here again 
     <lb/>to British Columbia. On the coast of Vancouver 
     <lb/>Island in 1935 certain capitalistic concerns got 
     <lb/>control from the Canadian government. I was not 
     <lb/>able to get the whole story; but I found out that 
     <lb/>these trapmen had gotten control of the waters 
     <lb/>within the three mile limit and all the handline 
     <lb/>fishermen were not allowed inside it. I was told 
     <lb/>that RCMP were patrolling the coast. We have 
     <lb/>full control over our fisheries, something I 
     <lb/>believe we always had. I know something of the 
     <lb/>rows between the trawlers and the handline men. 
     <lb/>I was told how the trawlers had to get outside the 
     <lb/>three mile limit and stay outside. Some of them 
     <lb/>had been trawling since 1905-06. Should the 
     <lb/>people vote for confederation, I want them to 
     <lb/>keep this in mind. There should be a clause 
     <lb/>whereby the federal government will not be able 
     <lb/>to lease any part of our waters to the detriment of 
     <lb/>the fishermen. I want our people, in negotiating 
     <lb/>for Newfoundland, whatever they do, not to turn 
     <lb/>our fisheries over to remote control. We want to 
     <lb/>see that the rights we have always fought for are

     you will understand why I wanted to read the two

     together. I think this, above anything else in this 
     <lb/>
     country of ours, is long overdue, especially a 
     <lb/>
     hydrographic survey. The others, I am not going 
     <lb/>
     to touch on; they are outside my jurisdiction. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, I know very little about them. If you notice, 
     <lb/>
     when you pick up a chart of this country, it refers 
     <lb/>
     back to Captain Cook. He is a long time dead. I 
     <lb/>
     must say he did a wonderful job. But I think it is 
     <lb/>
     time someone else did a job. It is long overdue. 
     <lb/>
     There is many a mother and wife whose husband 
     <lb/>
     did not come home, because nobody was inter<lb break="no"/>ested in what was under the vessel's bottom. 
     <lb/>
     Sometimes the only way to find a depth of water 
     <lb/>
     is to have a wire dragging between two ships with 
     <lb/>
     floats on them. This is long overdue and whether 
     <lb/>
     we have responsible government, commission 
     <lb/>
     government or confederation, the first job is to 
     <lb/>
     get this survey of our coast and Labrador coasts. 
     <lb/>
     The Labrador coast is in the worst condition of 
     <lb/>
     any part of the world. It is a crying shame, espe<lb break="no"/>cially in a maritime country.... Take the Funks — 
     <lb/>
     nobody knows the fishing ground around the 
     <lb/>
     Funks. I had hopes of bringing this up before, but

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have a great deal of sympathy

     for what Mr. Bailey says. As a matter of interest, 
     <lb/>
     I took occasion when in Ottawa to go down to the 
     <lb/>
     office where this work is done, and talked with 
     <lb/>
     the men in charge — the men who would be in 
     <lb/>
     charge of the mapping and charting of the coast 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador. As 
     <lb/>
     professional men, they were looking forward 
     <lb/>
     with interest to the charting of the coast of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Labrador. But let us be quite ac<lb break="no"/>curate about this. The British Admiralty has 
     <lb/>
     brought Captain Cook's charts up to date; we are 
     <lb/>
     not as far back, in coastal charts. We are a little 
     <lb/>
     more modem than that. But I agree they are

     lacking, and need to be brought up to date.

     It is ladled in there. Last year I think they spent

     to be ashamed of along the line of beacons and 
     <lb/>
     buoys and lighthouses, considering what the

     this country most of the time since Commission

     that. I do not remember offhand what this present

     government has spent on lighthouses in the last 
     <lb/>
     few years; but on marine works generally they 
     <lb/>
     have spent immense amounts — breakwaters and 
     <lb/>
     harbour improvements made in the last four or 
     <lb/>
     five years, it is a striking amount. I cannot answer 
     <lb/>
     for lighthouses. I do not know if any or many have 
     <lb/>
     been built or improved. What they did spend, 
     <lb/>
     they spent during the last two or three years. 
     <lb/>
     Before the war they did not have it to spend. If 
     <lb/>
     the amounts spent each year by the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada in the Maritime provinces on these 
     <lb/>
     things can be taken as an example, I think we 
     <lb/>
     could figure on something over $1 million on 
     <lb/>
     marine works to be spent in Newfoundland for a 
     <lb/>
     good many years. We have today something like 
     <lb/>
     300 public wharves. We have public launchways, 
     <lb/>
     public slipways, I think we have between 150 and 
     <lb/>
     200. Many of them have been swept away or gone 
     <lb/>
     into a bad state of disrepair. There will have to be

     — that is, the Broadcasting Corporation of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I do not know if there is anything in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Books. The Broadcasting Corporation

     of Newfoundland would become part of the

     <lb/>
     remain in many ways what it is today; and so far 
     <lb/>
     as being a Newfoundland station, it would remain 
     <lb/>
     entirely what it is today. The main difference 
     <lb/>
     would be that the employees would be federal, 
     <lb/>
     paid by the CBC, and stations of the Corporation

     would carry the Canada news roundup, Canadian

     <lb/>
     Members who have been following the modern

     that is. Mr. Duplessis in Quebec wanted to start

     a provincial government station, the federal

     government stepped on it, would not allow it. 
     <lb/>
     They could not allow one, if they did not allow

     another. They adopted that categorical policy.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We have one Central District 
     <lb/>
     Court; we have not a county court. If and when 
     <lb/>
     they are established, the judges in them would be 
     <lb/>
     paid by the Government of Canada. Now, the 
     <lb/>
     constituting of the county courts is left to the 
     <lb/>
     province. The province constitutes the county 
     <lb/>
     courts; divides the county into as many districts 
     <lb/>
     as it desires, and provides for the creation of a 
     <lb/>
     county court, but it is the federal government 
     <lb/>
     which appoints the judges and pays their salaries. 
     <lb/>
     It is not much use for the provinces to create 
     <lb/>
     county courts unless they know the federal 
     <lb/>
     government will fill the courts with judges and 
     <lb/>
     pay their salaries. I pointed out how many 
     <lb/>
     magistrates we had in Newfoundland and sug<lb break="no"/>gested, jokingly, that we could have every 
     <lb/>
     magistrate we now have in a magistrate's district; 
     <lb/>
     we could then create a county court and leave it 
     <lb/>
     to the federal government to provide magistrates 
     <lb/>
     by appointing them as county court judges. There 
     <lb/>
     was a laugh. They said, "You can not go the 
     <lb/>
     whole hog." On the basis of other provinces, we 
     <lb/>
     would be entitled to six or eight or ten county 
     <lb/>
     court judges, therefore that many county courts. 
     <lb/>
     Their salaries, allowances and pensions would be 
     <lb/>
     paid by the Government of Canada, if and when

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Are Grand Falls and Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     included in district courts? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. We have only one district 
     <lb/>
     court as such — the Central District Court in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's. All other district courts are magistrates 
     <lb/>
     courts. To illustrate what I mean, take Judge 
     <lb/>
     Browne, he occupies a unique position in the 
     <lb/>
     sense that when he sits on criminal matters, he 
     <lb/>
     sits as a magistrate of the St. John's Magistrate's 
     <lb/>
     Court. In any civil claims, in the case of debt or 
     <lb/>
     liquidation, demanding up to $200, then he sits 
     <lb/>
     as judge of the Central District Court. That does 
     <lb/>
     not apply to any other magistrate. As opposed to 
     <lb/>
     that, the county court system is a midway position 
     <lb/>
     between the magistrate system and our Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court. For example, in the Magistrate's Court or 
     <lb/>
     in the Central District Court of St. John's, for that 
     <lb/>
     matter, if your claim exceeds $200, it automat<lb break="no"/>ically must go into the Supreme Court. Were we 
     <lb/>
     to have the county court system, the county court 
     <lb/>
     would have jurisdiction in the case of debt and 
   

            <cb/>
           

     liquidation up to $1,000. In the case of criminal 
     <lb/>
     matters, they would be able to try certain offen<lb break="no"/>ces, other than capital offences such as murder, 
     <lb/>
     treason, etc., by a system of speedy trial.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> It is not clear to me who would pay 
     <lb/>
     the salaries of judges in Corner Brook and Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls and other places in Newfoundland. In many 
     <lb/>
     places, magistrates are not solicitors or barristers. 
     <lb/>
     Would they be removed from their jobs and

     replaced by barristers and solicitors?

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You had better qualify that. 
     <lb/>
     There are certain magistrates who are lawyers; 
     <lb/>
     even then to become a county judge, you must 
     <lb/>
     have ten years practice. The magistrate may be a

     legally trained man, but he would not be able to 
     <lb/>
     comply with the other requirements — namely 
     <lb/>
     10 years practice before the bar. Put it this way; 
     <lb/>
     if he is not a lawyer or legally trained man, he is 
     <lb/>
     out. Even if he is, unless he happens to have ten 
     <lb/>
     years experience he cannot qualify for a county 
     <lb/>
     or superior court appointment. Were any sections 
     <lb/>
     which are now administered by magistrate courts 
     <lb/>
     re-constituted into county courts, and the 
     <lb/>
     magistrate could not comply with the two re<lb break="no"/>quirements, I assume they would be automat<lb break="no"/>ically out and have to be replaced by some person 
     <lb/>
     who could comply with the statutory require<lb break="no"/>ments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think what would likely hap<lb break="no"/>pen is this: we now have courts of justice, these 
     <lb/>
     courts are mainly magistrates courts around the 
     <lb/>
     island. Some of them are occupied by magistrates 
     <lb/>
     who happen to be lawyers. The tendency on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the provincial governments is to have as 
     <lb/>
     many county courts as possible, because the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government would not have to pay 
     <lb/>
     their salaries. They would try to push as many as 
     <lb/>
     possible on to the federal government. What 
     <lb/>
     would happen is, in certain districts where they 
     <lb/>
     have lawyers as magistrates, they would be con<lb break="no"/>stituted county courts; or if no lawyer, then the 
     <lb/>
     magistrate would be shifted to a district which 
     <lb/>
     would still be a magistrate's district and a lawyer 
     <lb/>
     put in his place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> For all practical reasons, Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls, Corner Brook and Bell Island would un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly follow the practice employed in the 
     <lb/>
     Maritimes. As I know it, and I have been a 
     <lb/>
     member of that bar for 14 years, these would 
 

            <cb/>
       

     become county courts.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I am not satisfied. Who pays the 
     <lb/>
     salaries of these other magistrates? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> It would be a charge on the 
     <lb/>
     province? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The province pays the salaries 
     <lb/>
     of all magistrates who are not federal judges or 
     <lb/>
     magistrates. The federal government pays all 
     <lb/>
     county court judges. Naturally they would try to 
     <lb/>
     have as many federal judges as possible and as 
     <lb/>
     few provincial judges as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The answer to Mr. Crosbie's 
     <lb/>
     question is that magistrates would be paid by the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government.
