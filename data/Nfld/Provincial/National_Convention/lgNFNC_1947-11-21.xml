<!-- GL, 2017-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     Mr. Hollett I did not ask them. I was not in touch 
     <lb/>
     with them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I am well aware that there will 
     <lb/>
     be an effort made, in fact Mr. Penney practically 
     <lb/>
     made it, to indicate that because the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec — one of the nine provinces — has 65 
     <lb/>
     members in the House of Commons out of 245, 
     <lb/>
     Quebec controls Canada; therefore if Quebec 
     <lb/>
     wants Labrador she will get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Penney I said nothing like that. I said the 
     <lb/>
     province controls the Liberal party at Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman What I understood him to say 
     <lb/>was that the Liberal party supplied the balance of 
     <lb/>power. Quebec held the balance of power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Penney That is what I said and I do not want 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood to put it in a different light. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood On that point, the suggestion is 
     <lb/>
     being made, that the members elected from 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ... would somehow or other persuade or 
     <lb/>
     force the Parliament of Canada, which has 245 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     members in it, to force Newfoundland to give 
     <lb/>
     Labrador to Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman That fear has been expressed. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood The answer to that is this: I 
     <lb/>admit there may be a revolution. Quebec may 
     <lb/>raise an army and march into Labrador and be an 
     <lb/>army of occupation and say to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>province, "Get us out if you can". They might do 
     <lb/>that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Penney They might do it in a peaceful way. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood They might do it in an illegal 
     <lb/>way. They might — I do not suggest that will 
     <lb/>happen. How can they do it in a peaceful way? 
     <lb/>They have to bring into Parliament an act to 
     <lb/>change the boundaries of the Province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The committee rose and reported progress. The 
     <lb/>
     other items on the order paper were deferred, and 
     <lb/>
     the Convention adjourned]

     Dear Sir:

            <p>
     I refer to our telephone conversation of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday with reference to the request that I 
     <lb/>
     should appear before the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion sitting in committee of the whole to 
     <lb/>
     answer questions relating to the tariff agree<lb break="no"/>ments recently concluded at Geneva. I have 
     <lb/>
     referred this request to my Commissioner, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           

     who instructed me to point out that a com<lb break="no"/>prehensive statement of the agreements in<lb break="no"/>sofar as they affect Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     recently issued by the government. In these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances the government would not be 
     <lb/>
     willing for me to appear before the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. If members desire further information 
     <lb/>
     about the agreement, and submit questions in 
     <lb/>
     writing, duly endorsed by the Information

     answers provided I may properly do so.

     I have to point out that it will not be

     possible to answer questions relating to the

     few remarks because I think we must all agree 
     <lb/>
     that we are not making very good progress under 
     <lb/>
     our present method of handling things. Yesterday 
     <lb/>
     the progress was distinctly poor, and it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me it will continue to be very poor unless some

            <cb/>
         
     better method of tackling the report is adopted. 
     <lb/>
     There are too many interruptions, and too much 
     <lb/>
     time is wasted on technicalities. I suggest that 
     <lb/>
     better progress would be made if Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     would make a simple, clear statement as to his 
     <lb/>
     interpretation of the Ottawa proposals as em<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
     Arrangements for the Entry of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     into Confederation",<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> with reference to the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books when absolutely necessary to clarify his 
     <lb/>
     statement. When he has finished this statement, I 
     <lb/>
     would recommend very strongly that Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     be asked, if he will, to reply, and after he had 
     <lb/>
     finished, any members who wish to do so will be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to state their views. There can be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that those who favour confederation, of 
     <lb/>
     whom there are many thousands in this country, 
     <lb/>
     as well as many others who are on the fence as 
     <lb/>
     regards any form of government, are anxious to 
     <lb/>
     get a clear understanding of the meaning of these 
     <lb/>
     interesting documents, and it will be a long time 
     <lb/>
     before they will understand the position if we are 
     <lb/>
     to continue the disjointed style of debate which 
     <lb/>
     took place in this chamber yesterday.... I cannot 
     <lb/>
     help thinking that this will facilitate progress, and 
     <lb/>
     I make the suggestion for what it is worth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Thank you very much, Mr. Job. 
     <lb/>
     Without in any way wishing to place any respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities upon Mr. Hollett, I might say that other<lb break="no"/>wise I think your suggestion is very welcome and 
     <lb/>
     very sound. The progress made last evening was 
     <lb/>
     terrible to say the least, and I feel that Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     should address himself to me as to how he feels, 
     <lb/>
     about assuming the responsibilities contained in 
     <lb/>
     your suggestion....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I think I should speak right away 
     <lb/>
     before I become involved in the thing. Let me say 
     <lb/>
     that I would refuse to undertake such an arduous 
     <lb/>
     task as to reply in one address to the multi<lb break="no"/>tudinous things that our friend from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre is going to raise on this issue. Not only do 
     <lb/>
     I fail to see how the debate last night was so 
     <lb/>
     terrible, but I cannot agree with anybody who 
     <lb/>
     would state that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> These things have been brought to 
     <lb/>
     us from Canada, and unless we examine them 
     <lb/>
     step by step we are not going to get this thing 
     <lb/>
     across as Mr. Smallwood wants it. For me, or 
     <lb/>
     even Mr. Smallwood, to get up and in one long- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     winded speech to try and tell our people what we 
     <lb/>
     think of these terms of confederation, I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     we are not getting to the people; and that is 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           

     definitely, as Mr. Smallwood has intimated, his 
     <lb/>
     whole and sole desire, to get the people ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with these terms. I have heard long 
     <lb/>
     speeches before, and unfortunately I have made 
     <lb/>
     one or two myself and I know they are not the 
     <lb/>
     right approach to any matter. Human beings can 
     <lb/>
     only grasp one or two, or three or four points at a 
     <lb/>
     time to absorb them properly. Therefore to at<lb break="no"/>tempt to analyse these two Black Books and these 
     <lb/>
     terms from Mackenzie King in one, or two, or 
     <lb/>
     three long-winded speeches, I am afraid I don't 
     <lb/>
     agree with the idea. If the progress has not been 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory we should devise a better case, but I 
     <lb/>
     would refuse to take on the burden of proof, if 
     <lb/>
     you like, that Mr. Smallwood is wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite understand that it is a 
     <lb/>
     very difficult and arduous responsibility, but in 
     <lb/>
     fairness to Mr. Job I think I should correct a 
     <lb/>
     misapprehension. As I understand Mr. Job's 
     <lb/>
     proposal he is not suggesting that you should 
     <lb/>
     reply to Mr. Smallwood in one speech. What he 
     <lb/>
     is saying is that the section would be read, that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood would give his interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     it as briefly as possible, only referring to the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books as it becomes necessary, and then at 
     <lb/>
     the end you, if you so care, could reply. That 
     <lb/>
     means you would have the right to reply to every 
     <lb/>
     interpretation that Mr. Smallwood may place on 
     <lb/>
     every section of the report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> As I understood it Mr. Job meant 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Smallwood would go through the whole 
     <lb/>
     "shebang", and then I would give a reply, but you 
     <lb/>
     say it should be section by section. That's a 
     <lb/>
     different thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I did mean that Mr. Smallwood would 
     <lb/>
     give a general impression of the whole thing first, 
     <lb/>
     and then Mr. Hollett would reply in a general 
     <lb/>
     way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All one clause? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Well, no. I have no objection. I would 
     <lb/>
     not say one clause. I would take more than one 
     <lb/>
     clause. We wasted hours on two clauses that I 
     <lb/>
     don't think there is anything in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> There's only 23 there, you know. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I still think the public would like to hear 
     <lb/>what the whole thing means in a general way. 
     <lb/>Then after Mr. Hollett replies in a general way, 
     <lb/>you get down to the details, and anyone can come 
     <lb/>in. I know it's got to be discussed in detail. There 
     <lb/>are a tremendous number of points. When Mr.

     Smallwood is going through it people can take a 
     <lb/>
     note of the points they are going to raise and 
     <lb/>
     attack them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, I agree. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I appreciate Mr. Job's main 
     <lb/>
     point, namely that the people are entitled to a 
     <lb/>
     complete accounting of this document, entitled to 
     <lb/>
     understand it; and I appreciate and know that for 
     <lb/>
     months past that has been Mr. Job's viewpoint. 
     <lb/>
     The difficulty, however, with his main sugges<lb break="no"/>tion, is two-fold. First it presupposes that I am 
     <lb/>
     able to take this Grey Book, in the light of the two 
     <lb/>
     Black Books, and give a running description, all 
     <lb/>
     in one piece, of what confederation would mean 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland. If Mr. Job is agreeable that I 
     <lb/>
     should carry out what it has been rumoured I was 
     <lb/>
     going to do — speak for three weeks — I am quite 
     <lb/>
     agreeable to do it if the Convention wishes ... and 
     <lb/>
     if my voice will hold out that long. I am sure my 
     <lb/>
     mind will, but I doubt if, at the end of the three 
     <lb/>
     weeks, the public would know very much more 
     <lb/>
     about confederation than they would at the begin<lb break="no"/>ning. Then I have the further doubt that, having 
     <lb/>
     done that, Mr. Hollett, or any other one man, 
     <lb/>
     would be in a position to take that whole three 
     <lb/>
     weeks' speech and in another three weeks dis<lb break="no"/>pose of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....Mr. Job's suggestion, as I un<lb break="no"/>derstand it sir, is that you should first make a 
     <lb/>
     general statement, that would take you an hour, 
     <lb/>
     or an hour and a half, giving only the highlights 
     <lb/>
     if you will, and then proceed... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I can't do it. I can only do it by 
     <lb/>
     taking it clause by clause. The length of time that 
     <lb/>
     will be used by any one clause is entirely a matter 
     <lb/>
     for the Convention. It depends on how many 
     <lb/>
     members wish to ask questions I will not occupy 
     <lb/>
     very much time on a clause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you feel that it can only be 
     <lb/>
     dealt with clause by clause, then I suggest to 
     <lb/>
     members that Mr. Job's recommendation is still 
     <lb/>
     a very sound one, in the sense that you take the 
     <lb/>
     clause, read it if you will, give your interpretation 
     <lb/>
     of it as briefly and as simply as possible 
     <lb/>
     whereupon you will resume your seat and mem<lb break="no"/>bers can address you on any questions arising out 
     <lb/>
     of the clause under discussion. I still think that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Job's recommendation is calculated to help 
     <lb/>
     things along. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Isn't that what we were doing? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, there was some confusion 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     about it last night. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> If I may be permitted to speak, I 
     <lb/>
     disagree very much with Mr. Job's suggestion. 
     <lb/>
     We have this report here, sir. Whether last night 
     <lb/>
     was a good night for some and a bad night for 
     <lb/>
     others it is a matter of indifference. There will be 
     <lb/>
     good nights and bad nights for both parties in this 
     <lb/>
     I guess, but we have it here and I base my dis<lb break="no"/>agreement on this: we represent Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     district by district. No one here represents New<lb break="no"/>foundland as a whole, not even Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     on this matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> It is on that basis that I think it would 
     <lb/>
     be something that we would regret later if we 
     <lb/>
     restricted the rights of individual members to 
     <lb/>
     question. I think also that the first construction 
     <lb/>
     put on any section of this or any clause of this 
     <lb/>
     document going out over the air, if not corrected, 
     <lb/>
     if there is a mistake in it, will make a lasting 
     <lb/>
     impression; and I feel that if Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     statements go unchallenged the people will ac<lb break="no"/>cept them as such, but if there is something in his 
     <lb/>
     statement which may be cleared up, I think right 
     <lb/>
     there and then is the time to do it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am inclined to agree with you. 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I maintain that that will destroy the 
     <lb/>whole idea of committee of the whole. The com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole is not for long-winded 
     <lb/>speeches at all, even though we might have to 
     <lb/>make them during the discussion; it is only by 
     <lb/>question and answer and cross-fire that you can 
     <lb/>get this across to our people. I think it would be 
     <lb/>a mistake, as Mr. Miller points out. There are 44 
     <lb/>members here, and we all have an equal right to 
     <lb/>question Mr. Smallwood, and anybody else. With 
     <lb/>all due respect to Mr. Job, and I thank him for the 
     <lb/>compliment he has paid me, I would not accept 
     <lb/>that under any conditions, and I think we 
     <lb/>proceeded beautifully last night, and I think we 
     <lb/>got somewhere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> In the early part of this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     when reports were brought in here, we took and 
     <lb/>
     read them section by section, and had a discus<lb break="no"/>sion on each section as we went along.... It did 
     <lb/>
     seem to me that we got the meat out of these 
     <lb/>
     things. We only departed from that procedure in 
     <lb/>
     the last two reports presented here, and these 
     <lb/>
     were read <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi> at first, and then discussed by 
     <lb/>
     sections that had no reference to each other, and 
     <lb/>
     I leave it to you whether we got the meat out of

     those or whether we beat the meat out of them. I 
     <lb/>
     suggest the original procedure be followed 
     <lb/>
     again.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not saying there is anything 
     <lb/>
     wrong with the methods last night, but we did not 
     <lb/>
     progress very far. We disposed of two clauses. 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, excuse me, I must 
     <lb/>take exception to that. There are only about four 
     <lb/>or five who questioned Mr. Smallwood last night, 
     <lb/>therefore we must proceed and ask questions 
     <lb/>which will bring out to our people the answers 
     <lb/>that we believe should be given. Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>with all due credit to him, answers as well as any 
     <lb/>man could answer. Whether they have one cause 
     <lb/>or not does not matter, they were the truth. If 
     <lb/>anyone said in this house that last night was 
     <lb/>wasted then they must blame myself, Mr. Miller, 
     <lb/>Mr. Penney, and Mr. Higgins.

     way — they do publish monthly some inadequate

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In Canada they get this: at the

     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
           

     and all cereals, and root crops are in prospect. 
     <lb/>
     That figure changes depending on the crop con<lb break="no"/>ditions, and they have a magnificent statistical 
     <lb/>
     service, so that every farmer in Canada knows

     from week to week, and it is broadcast throughout

     the nation, province by province, and section by

     <lb/>
     production is likely to be from the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     the season until the harvest is all over. Further<lb break="no"/>more, every farmer is informed on the radio what

     are the prevailing wholesale prices for every type

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, that is a very impor<lb break="no"/>tant factor in Canada, which is a farming country.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is perhaps because that 
     <lb/>
     farm has broken the market... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why did Mr. Smallwood bring up 
     <lb/>
     whether they had broken the price or not? What 
     <lb/>
     has it to do with his explanation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He is drawing a comparison, at 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett's request, between the so-called or

     alleged service to Newfoundland, and that which 
     <lb/>
     might be made in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It is the importance of getting this 
     <lb/>
     across to the people. Mr. Smallwood deliberately 
     <lb/>
     gets up and says that the experimental farm has 
     <lb/>
     broken the price, and they are selling turnips at 
     <lb/>
     $3 a barrel. I answered that by telling our people 
     <lb/>
     that a man who has no connection with the ex<lb break="no"/>perimental farm whatever, who has a farm over

     I want the people to know is that the experimental

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The answer is that the reason

     that man sold them for $2.50 is because the price

     began at $5-$6 a barrel, and the farm sold under

     to 20%, but it's about the last word in absurdity 
     <lb/>
     to compare the public services of the little island 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland with the Dominion of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     with its 12 million people. The public services of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are such as Newfoundland could not

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That we have not got here. And to say 
     <lb/>
     it is absurd to compare the services provided by

     the Newfoundland government is not fair at all. 
     <lb/>
     In comparison with those in Canada I think ours 
     <lb/>
     are very good in relation to our size, our impor<lb break="no"/>tance and the importance of the industries, and 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the size of the organisation of 
     <lb/>
     Canada.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Under the heading of Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture, first of all I will name the things that Canada

     provides for her people and then see whether or

     not Newfoundland provides it for her people. 
     <lb/>
     That is what Mr. Butt wants me to do. Agricul<lb break="no"/>tural Science Service — no; Economic Research

     — no; Experimental Farm Service — half yes

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have got at least a small arm<lb break="no"/>ful of evidence on that. If you want to go through 
     <lb/>
     it I am quite willing, but we will be here till next 
     <lb/>
     spring.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Don't you know what scientific ser<lb break="no"/>vices they provide?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of course I do. We were driven 
     <lb/>
     to an experimental farm of 350 acres just at the 
     <lb/>
     edge of Ottawa, the headquarters demonstration 
     <lb/>
     farm. They have them scattered all over the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, experimental stations, health of 
     <lb/>
     animal stations...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Don't they do that here too?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of course not. I have raised 
     <lb/>
     something like 3,000 pigs, and you are going to 
     <lb/>
     tell me I don't know. We have one veterinarian, 
     <lb/>
     and he is not a field man, he is in administration. 
     <lb/>
     Are we going to say that that provides scientific 
     <lb/>
     knowledge as to the prevention of disease? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> There's some away training now. We 
     <lb/>
     have only one for the reason that we could not get

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not discussing the reasons,

     I am discussing what Canada has got as compared

     with ours.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I dare say you will find the proportion 
     <lb/>
     in Canada just the same.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Maybe and maybe not. Let's

     <lb/>
     Fisheries. Canada provides a coastal patrol ser<lb break="no"/>vice, fish hatcheries and a Fisheries Research

     <lb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well I must say Maggoty Cove, 
     <lb/>
     it has been Maggoty Cove for 400 years, and it 
     <lb/>
     will always be that. We may change New<lb break="no"/><cb/>foundland into a province, but it will always be

     Labour. Assistance in settling labour disputes

     <lb/>
     Financial aid to the provinces for vocational

     training. We have vocational training for 
     <lb/>
     veterans, but for no one else.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, handicrafts a few weeks 
     <lb/>
     ago, but no vocational training in civilian life. 
     <lb/>
     The government has told us that when the 
     <lb/>
     veterans' rehabilitation vocational training 
     <lb/>
     scheme is completed they are going to turn the 
     <lb/>
     building over for civilian vocational training, but 
     <lb/>
     up to now we have not got it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Employment offices — yes, we have that. 
     <lb/>
     Unemployment insurance — no, we have not got 
     <lb/>
     that. Newfoundland does not provide unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment insurance. Provision of life annuities — no. 
     <lb/>
     Statistical service — no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now to come to Mines and Resources. Lands, 
     <lb/>
     parks and forests. Now it is perfectly true that we 
     <lb/>
     have a Forestry Division. That Division does not 
     <lb/>
     provide any national parks. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mines and Geology (topographical and geo<lb break="no"/>logical surveys). We have it. It's an insult to the 
     <lb/>
     country, and it's an insult to the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government that they have not pushed the 
     <lb/>
     geological and topographical and hydrographical 
     <lb/>
     surveys more than they have done. A country 
     <lb/>
     that's crying out to be surveyed, the government 
     <lb/>
     has only puttered around. The Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would provide that.

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
     Indian Affairs Division — we have no such 
     <lb/>
     thing in Newfoundland. (Laughter from Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett) There happen to be 300 Indians in Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     and many more Eskimos, and I will remind him 
     <lb/>
     that in Canada, for the purpose of administration, 
     <lb/>
     Indians and Eskimos are all treated as Indians for 
     <lb/>
     purely legal reasons. We have many hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     them. Mr. Bay Boy may not feel like laughing 
     <lb/>
     when I say that the Government of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land has no such division or department for the 
     <lb/>
     welfare of the Indians or Eskimos, of whom there 
     <lb/>
     are many hundreds in Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not laugh. Now that you have 
     <lb/>
     got that off your chest.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I apologise, but I do not 
     <lb/>
     apologise to the member who laughed, whoever 
     <lb/>
     it may have been. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Is it true that we look upon our 
     <lb/>
     Indians as not being citizens? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Any Indian in Canada can 
     <lb/>
     apply for citizenship. Many prefer not to because 
     <lb/>
     they get more benefits by not being citizens. In 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland we never even allowed them to be 
     <lb/>
     citizens. Until this National Convention we never 
     <lb/>
     even gave them a vote. All we gave them was a 
     <lb/>
     bit of dole. Let me pass on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will pass National Defence, because ob<lb break="no"/>viously we have not got an army, or a navy, or an 
     <lb/>
     airforce. National Health and Welfare. Treatment 
     <lb/>
     of sick and injured mariners. We may treat them 
     <lb/>
     as citizens, but we have no particular scheme for 
     <lb/>
     treating sick and injured mariners in New<lb break="no"/>foundland as in Canada. We will find out more 
     <lb/>
     about that as we go through these discussions. 
     <lb/>
     Food and Drug Standards — we have that. Public 
     <lb/>
     Health Engineering — I don't think we have 
     <lb/>
     much of that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> It is only a big word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh no, it's more than a big 
     <lb/>
     word. Public health engineering means this: a 
     <lb/>
     government department that goes into a city or a 
     <lb/>
     farm area, or a fishing area, and plans out the 
     <lb/>
     actual engineering problems involved in control<lb break="no"/>ling public health, and to prevent all infectious 
     <lb/>
     and contagious disease. It is a matter of placing 
     <lb/>
     central water supply in places that need it, dis<lb break="no"/>posal of sewage, and general public engineering 
     <lb/>
     in matters of public health. We have no such 
     <lb/>
     department in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That's the point I am trying to make 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         

     all the time. We have no such department, but it 
     <lb/>
     can be done and it is done by the government in 
     <lb/>
     various departments. According to the standards 
     <lb/>
     we have reached in this country we have practi<lb break="no"/>cally all the things you have mentioned, but they 
     <lb/>
     have not got those names, because you have got 
     <lb/>
     the very extra big names to handle; but it's the 
     <lb/>
     same service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will watch that. I will tell you 
     <lb/>
     the service and we will see if the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government does for the Newfoundland people 
     <lb/>
     what the Canadian government does for the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people. I will not say whether they have 
     <lb/>
     got a department, or a division, or a board, or a 
     <lb/>
     committee; we will just take the function. It is the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada that does it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Public Health Engineering. Venereal Disease 
     <lb/>
     Control — yes, we have a limited amount of that 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. Child and Maternal Hygiene 
     <lb/>
     — yes, we have some of that. Industrial Health 
     <lb/>
     — we have none of that. Nutrition Service — and 
     <lb/>
     thereby hangs a tale. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> On that point of industrial health. Is 
     <lb/>
     not that matter being taken care of by the com<lb break="no"/>panies concerned? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In part. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> The Buchans Mining Company 
     <lb/>
     regularly inspect their mines and workers get 
     <lb/>
     time off when the doctor suggests it from the 
     <lb/>
     public health angle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am glad Mr. Miller raised that 
     <lb/>
     point. I, for one Newfoundlander, am not satis<lb break="no"/>fied to leave the health of the workers in bakeries, 
     <lb/>
     mills, and mines and other industrial undertak<lb break="no"/>ings in the hands of the owners of these plants. 
     <lb/>
     Some owners take their responsibility seriously 
     <lb/>
     and do fairly good work. But if it could safely be 
     <lb/>
     left to the employers in Newfoundland to look 
     <lb/>
     after the health of their employees, it could also 
     <lb/>
     be left to the employers of Great Britain and the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and you would not have any public 
     <lb/>
     department in any country protecting the health 
     <lb/>
     of the workers in them. We have not got any 
     <lb/>
     public department of industrial health. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I can assure you that the health of 
     <lb/>
     our workmen in the mill or outside, in Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook, is taken care of by that particular com<lb break="no"/>pany far better than in Sydney. I have seen some 
     <lb/>
     of their dumps over there, and around Montreal 
     <lb/>

     too, so I think we are very well fixed on that part. 
     <lb/></p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, all that work done 
     <lb/>by the various countries, isn't it done under the 
     <lb/>agency of the Public Health and Welfare Act? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It ought to be.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> It is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is not. Could someone tell me 
     <lb/>
     how many inspectors of the Department of Public 
     <lb/>
     Health and Welfare in the month of October, 
     <lb/>
     visited the factories of St. John's, and saw how 
     <lb/>
     many toilets, rest-rooms and safety devices were 
     <lb/>
     provided?... I go further now. If Mr. Jackman 
     <lb/>
     were here, I would ask him to tell me what 
     <lb/>
     inspection has been made of the mines at Bell 
     <lb/>
     Island under the Mines Regulation Act. I would 
     <lb/>
     ask Mr. Hollett, who represents Grand Falls, in<lb break="no"/>cluding Buchans, to tell me what government 
     <lb/>
     inspector has gone down in the mines under the 
     <lb/>
     Mines Regulations Act to inspect the mines. We 
     <lb/>
     have no such inspectors in Newfoundland. We 
     <lb/>
     have a dead act. There is no enforcement of 
     <lb/>
     industrial health. Except insofar as a few individ<lb break="no"/>ual employers, such as the AND Company, the 
     <lb/>
     Buchans Mining Company, and Bowaters and a 
     <lb/>
     few here in town, except for these the health and 
     <lb/>
     the industrial conditions of employees, and the 
     <lb/>
     health conditions of employees, are completely 
     <lb/>
     ignored. Now let me go on. I must insist on 
     <lb/>
     replying to Mr. Butt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> How long is your answer going to 
     <lb/>
     take? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I warned Mr. Butt that it would 
     <lb/>
     take a little time. I said I would have to read all 
     <lb/>
     through it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I must say that Mr. Butt has 
     <lb/>
     provoked the situation when he asked for a com<lb break="no"/>parison of the public services of two nations. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> May I say one word? When a ques<lb break="no"/>tion is asked Mr. Smallwood, and he apparently 
     <lb/>gets into difficulty, is it the right technique for 
     <lb/>him to reply by asking you another question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is what he has been doing for 
     <lb/>
     the past five minutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, he is comparing the public 
     <lb/>
     services which obtain in Canada as against those 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. Frankly I do not know whether 
     <lb/>
     all this reply is justified or not, because I know 
     <lb/>
     nothing about the public services of this country. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> ...I can't give information about all the 
     <lb/>various departments of government; but I worked 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
            

     for the government for many years, and I know 
     <lb/>
     that in relation to our development we have prac<lb break="no"/>tically all the services that Mr. Smallwood read 
     <lb/>
     from this list this afternoon. That's the point, and 
     <lb/>
     I don't want it to go over the air that Canada will 
     <lb/>
     find this, that, and the other thing, and that we are 
     <lb/>
     not doing it for ourselves. When he says we are 
     <lb/>
     only doing about 20% of this I just don't believe 
     <lb/>
     it, after 18 years working for the government. We 
     <lb/>
     have public health inspectors and everything 
     <lb/>
     else. I know we have a Public Health Act, and 
     <lb/>
     from time to time they say "We are going to 
     <lb/>
     enforce this", and they do so. We have meat 
     <lb/>
     inspection and all sorts of things. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Does Mr. Butt happen to be 
     <lb/>
     aware that there is absolutely no control over the 
     <lb/>
     inspection of slaughtered animals for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of preventing sales of diseased meat in this 
     <lb/>
     country— one of the most scandalous, dangerous 
     <lb/>
     things in any so-called civilised country. The 
     <lb/>
     public would be shocked if they knew the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which the Government of Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     failing completely to protect public health in the 
     <lb/>
     inspection of locally killed meat (pork and beef), 
     <lb/>
     and I would face any butcher or livestock grower 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland to prove my point. I know what 
     <lb/>
     I am talking about. Now I won't delay the House. 
     <lb/>
     I will give Mr. Butt his point, I will keep him a 
     <lb/>
     bit ahead. If he wants to content himself to 
     <lb/>
     believe that even proportionately the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland provides public services 
     <lb/>
     to the people of Newfoundland as Canada does 
     <lb/>
     for her people, he is entirely welcome to believe 
     <lb/>
     it. If he thinks for a moment that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will believe it, then he is welcome 
     <lb/>
     to his belief. I say now that if he has been in the 
     <lb/>
     government civil service for 18 years, for almost 
     <lb/>
     twice 18 years I have made a very close study of 
     <lb/>
     public and governmental affairs in this country, 
     <lb/>
     and I have travelled throughout the length and 
     <lb/>
     breadth of this island, and I know what the public 
     <lb/>
     services are in Newfoundland. I know what the 
     <lb/>
     government does for the people, few know it 
     <lb/>
     better, and anyone who is going to set out to 
     <lb/>
     persuade me that the Government of Canada does 
     <lb/>
     not provide far better and far more public services 
     <lb/>
     for its people than our government does for ours 
     <lb/>
     is tackling a job that is going to take him a long 
     <lb/>
     time to accomplish.

            <p>Family allowances are the name given to pay<lb break="no"/>ments of money made each month to the children

     <lb/>month, a cheque for $5 up to the age of six years. 
     <lb/>Over the age of six and under ten it is $6 a month 
     <lb/>for every child. Over ten and under 13 it is $7 a 
     <lb/>month for every child. Where there are five

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> This is not brief enough. It is 
     <lb/>
     going to take more than a quarter of an hour to

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have been accused 
     <lb/>
     of trying to run this Convention. I asked Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood to be brief. He has been 25 minutes 
     <lb/>
     explaining one part of a clause. He has gone 
     <lb/>
     through two books and is now attempting to go

            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I represent the district of Labrador. 
     <lb/>Mr. Higgins represents a district in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Maybe mine is not as important a 
     <lb/>district but it is my contention that my district has 
     <lb/>a right to know the contents of these documents. 
     <lb/>Mr. Higgins has expressed himself to Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood on his explaining this thing more 
     <lb/>briefly. I would like to say that Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>should have considerable time — not taking too 
     <lb/>long. This is a very important thing to my district 
     <lb/>and I think Mr. Smallwood should have some 
     <lb/>time, even if it should take the whole afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I want to make another point. 
     <lb/>There is a lot of talk here about the deplorable 
     <lb/>condition of Canada; that she is bankrupt; down 
     <lb/>and out; poverty-stricken. Last year the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada ended up with a surplus of $360 
     <lb/>million. This year for the first five months she has 
     <lb/>had a surplus of $500 million. Why was it neces<lb break="no"/>sary for her to borrow $200-300 million? Be<lb break="no"/>cause she was poor? No! Canada today is 
     <lb/>extremely prosperous and because she is 
     <lb/>prosperous she has to borrow some American 
     <lb/>dollars. She is buying American goods at the rate 
     <lb/>of $2 billion a year.... She has not got enough 
     <lb/>dollars, why? Because she is shipping goods to 
     <lb/>Europe; she is shipping goods to Britain; keeping 
     <lb/>Britain alive.... Canada is shipping to all over 
     <lb/>Europe and Asia and she is not getting paid in 
     <lb/>American dollars. She is running short of 
     <lb/>American dollars.... Last year the Canadian 
     <lb/>government had a surplus of $360 million. Now 
     <lb/>we come to the guts of it. That is a good par<lb break="no"/>liamentary expression. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is quite expressive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It has been used in parliaments. 
     <lb/>
     I do not want to be mealy-mouthed. If, down in 
     <lb/>
     Adam's Cove in the District of Bay de Verde, 
     <lb/>
     there are 62 children under 16 years, and if $372 
     <lb/>
     a month is put into Adam's Cove amongst those 
     <lb/>
     62 children, the question is, will the parents of 
     <lb/>
     these 62 children in Adam's Cove have to pay 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
           

     any taxes? Will their parents have to pay $372 a 
     <lb/>
     month taxes? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Of course they will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They will? Let us take a look at 
     <lb/>
     it! If that is so, family allowances are no good.... 
     <lb/>
     If there are 270 children in Bay de Verde proper 
     <lb/>
     under 16 years, that is $1,620 a month. Will the 
     <lb/>
     parents have to give the government $1,620 so 
     <lb/>
     that the children can get $1,620? If so, family 
     <lb/>
     allowances are no good.... If the parents have to 
     <lb/>
     pay it themselves so that the children can have it, 
     <lb/>
     then family allowances would be no good; they 
     <lb/>
     would be only paying it to themselves. We could 
     <lb/>
     have family allowances and no confederation.... 
     <lb/>
     All very fine to say family allowances cost $250 
     <lb/>
     million a year. You can take that $250 million and 
     <lb/>
     divide it by 12.5 million population; but that is 
     <lb/>
     not the way. I will put it another way. There are 
     <lb/>
     nine provinces in Canada. Every one has its own 
     <lb/>
     government, but one government on top of all, 
     <lb/>
     the federal government at Ottawa. Does the 
     <lb/>
     federal government say, "In the coming fiscal 
     <lb/>
     year in our budget we are going to spend $1.75 
     <lb/>
     billion — now there are nine provinces, divide 
     <lb/>
     that into $1.75 billion. That is so much"? That 
     <lb/>
     would be stupid. They are not stupid. They do not 
     <lb/>
     collect their revenue in equal amounts from every 
     <lb/>
     province.... The Province of Ontario pays to the 
     <lb/>
     federal government nearly half of all the revenue. 
     <lb/>
     Throw Quebec in with it, throw in British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia, those are the three rich provinces. Quebec 
     <lb/>
     has an area vastly bigger than Ontario in size; has 
     <lb/>
     vast water-powers; vast timber resources and 
     <lb/>
     great mills, mines and factories, and steel mills 
     <lb/>
     — a vast industrial province. In British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     there is a vast agricultural province — paradise, 
     <lb/>
     the Garden of Eden of this world. No country on 
     <lb/>
     the face of the earth can compare with British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not even Texas. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> How long is it since you have been 
     <lb/>
     there?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have never been there. I have 
     <lb/>
     only read about it, read descriptions of it as I have 
     <lb/>
     of very many parts of the world. Between the 
     <lb/>
     three of them, do you know how much they give 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada? 89 cents out of every 
     <lb/>
     dollar the Government of Canada collects! Write 
     <lb/>
     that down, Mr. Hollett; and you, too, Mr. Butt. 
     <lb/>
     That is the whole point of my argument 89% of

     the revenue of the Government of Canada comes 
     <lb/>
     from the great industries of these provinces... 
     <lb/> </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> If you have three provinces con<lb break="no"/>tributing as largely as 89%, we must then suppose 
     <lb/>the other provinces are very poor provinces; they 
     <lb/>have not really progressed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not progressed as much as 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia. They have not got the natural 
     <lb/>
     resources; they are not as prosperous as those 
     <lb/>
     three provinces, that is right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> One other point, with regard to your 
     <lb/>
     references to Canada's surpluses... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will not be drawn on that at 
     <lb/>
     the moment. I will come back to it. We will finish 
     <lb/>
     this other point, this 89%. If my memory is right 
     <lb/>
     the population of Quebec, Ontario and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia put together comes to 69% of the 
     <lb/>
     population of all Canada. Mr. Hollett said it was 
     <lb/>
     75%. Let us call it 75%; 75% of the population 
     <lb/>
     should pay 75% of the taxes; but they pay 89%. 
     <lb/>
     What does that mean? That means that the other 
     <lb/>
     six provinces, the Maritimes and the three 
     <lb/>
     prairie provinces between them pay 11% only of 
     <lb/>
     the revenue of the Government of Canada: 11% 
     <lb/>
     from six and 89% from three. Why is that? Be<lb break="no"/>cause of the kind of taxation that the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada collects. Most of it is corporation tax 
     <lb/>
     on big companies and corporations, and income 
     <lb/>
     tax. That is where she gets the bulk of her revenue 
     <lb/>
     — by taxing the people who have the money to 
     <lb/>
     pay. Now what would it mean if we were to 
     <lb/>
     become a province? There would be three rich 
     <lb/>
     provinces and seven not so rich. Suppose a large 
     <lb/>
     firm were to start nine branches.... A year passes 
     <lb/>
     on and they get the balance sheet of each branch. 
     <lb/>
     They find the only branches that made money 
     <lb/>
     were the ones at Grand Falls, Buchans and 
     <lb/>
     Corner Brook. The other six are losing money. 
     <lb/>
     They might let them run on for another year.... 
     <lb/>
     Those six branches have lost money, but the three 
     <lb/>
     branches made money. What do they do, if they 
     <lb/>
     are businessmen? They close down the six 
     <lb/>
     branches. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is what would happen to this 
     <lb/>
     province. It would be shutdown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am coming to that. They close 
     <lb/>
     down the six branches which are not paying, 
     <lb/>
     why? Because they are a business concern. They 
     <lb/>
     are not in business for fun ... they are interested 
     <lb/>
     in the balance sheets. Canada has nine provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Do they close down the provinces that do not 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         

     pay? The Province of Nova Scotia gets more 
     <lb/>
     from the federal government than it pays that 
     <lb/>
     government.... Six provinces take more money 
     <lb/>
     from the government than they give for taxa<lb break="no"/>tion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would remind you that 3,000 
     <lb/>
     workers had to migrate from the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces to Ontario and Quebec. Is not that 
     <lb/>
     closing it down? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would to God the men in For<lb break="no"/>tune Bay could go to other places and find work, 
     <lb/>
     or the men in St. Brendan's who are down and 
     <lb/>
     out because they cannot sell their squid, if they 
     <lb/>
     could go to another part of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     find work! If the men in Nova Scotia could not 
     <lb/>
     find work there, was it not a grand thing that they 
     <lb/>
     could move a little farther on and find work? 
     <lb/>
     What is wrong with that?.... I hope you, sir, and 
     <lb/>
     the members, will not be too hard on me, that you 
     <lb/>
     will not condemn me too harshly; I am enthusias<lb break="no"/>tic about this confederation. I may be wrong. My 
     <lb/>
     mind may be muddled. I may be just a poor 
     <lb/>
     visionary who imagines all these things. I am 
     <lb/>
     sincere. If I get carried away, if I roar and bawl, 
     <lb/>
     excuse me if I bawl too much. My feelings do 
     <lb/>
     sometimes overcome me, and I apologise to the 
     <lb/>
     House. I had my mind made up not to allow 
     <lb/>
     anyone to get me worked up this evening; I was 
     <lb/>
     going to act quietly and dignified but I forgot.

  <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Smallwood made reference to

     men in Buchans from St. Brendan's who are 
     <lb/>
     working in the mines there, and as a result of the 
     <lb/>
     statement made by Mr. Smallwood the other day, 
     <lb/>
     I hold in my hand a telegram from five men of St. 
     <lb/>
     Brendan's working in the mines at Buchans deep<lb break="no"/>ly resenting the insinuations made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood against the town of St. Brendan's, 
     <lb/>
     and they ask me to acquaint this House of their 
     <lb/>
     resentment. I am not going to read this telegram, 
     <lb/>
     sir, because you ruled no telegram or letter shall

     be read, and I challenge Mr. Smallwood to read 
     <lb/>
     it to the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will read it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You are not allowed. This telegram 
     <lb/>
     is signed by five hard-working fishermen of St. 
     <lb/>
     Brendan's who are now working in the mines 
     <lb/>
     there and earning their living. I say we have 
     <lb/>
     places to which men can go if they are not too 
     <lb/>
     lazy to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Shame! Scandalous, shameful 
     <lb/>
     statement. We have thousands of men in New<lb break="no"/>foundland who would give half their arm for a 
     <lb/>
     job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is that a point of order? Sit down! I 
     <lb/>
     do not want you to bring up St. Brendan's again. 
     <lb/>
     I am representing men from St. Brendan's in 
     <lb/>
     Buchans who are disgusted with the statement 
     <lb/>
     you made the other day. You read that telegram 
     <lb/>
     and you will not sleep this night. That is all I want 
     <lb/>
     to say, except one other point. He says in this 
     <lb/>
     baby bonus they do not tax the poor; they take it 
     <lb/>
     out of the rich. I would like to ask Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, who make the rich rich? Is it not the 
     <lb/>
     miners down in the mines in Buchans? Is it not 
     <lb/>
     the fisherman on the Labrador? Is it not the men 
     <lb/>
     who fell the trees? Are not these the men who 
     <lb/>
     make rich men rich? If you increase taxation to a 
     <lb/>
     certain point, beyond saturation point, you are 
     <lb/>
     making the poor man a darn sight poorer. That is 
     <lb/>
     what you are trying to ram down into our throats, 
     <lb/>
     that false doctrine, Mr. Smallwood. I move the 
     <lb/>
     adjournment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I move the adjournment, but 
     <lb/>
     first I would say in reply to Mr. Hollett that the 
     <lb/>
     rich are made by the poor, and family allowances 
     <lb/>
     are the method of getting some of it back from 
     <lb/>
     the pockets of the rich into the pockets of the poor 
     <lb/>
     again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before we adjourn and whilst on 
     <lb/>
     the matter which Mr. Hollett brought up, we had 
     <lb/>
     a frenzied oration from Mr. Smallwood about St. 
     <lb/>
     Brendan's the other day. I believe actually while 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood was reading that letter, a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman was coming to town from St. 
     <lb/>
     Brendan's  having made a purchase of squid down 
     <lb/>
     there; he paid on account of the squid he pur<lb break="no"/>chased $4,500; he had not paid the full amount. I 
     <lb/>
     do not know if Mr. Smallwood was deliberately 
     <lb/>
     misleading, or whether Mrs. White was pulling 
     <lb/>
     his leg. Someone was in error. When you refused 
     <lb/>
     to allow him to read the letter, he then gave it as 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
           

     his own knowledge.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I distinctly recall ruling that we 
     <lb/>
     were not concerned with expressions of opinion

     outside the House, but if Mr. Smallwood or any 
     <lb/>
     other member was talking about some part of the 
     <lb/>
     country from his own actual knowledge of that 
     <lb/>
     part, it was perfectly competent for him to do it. 
     <lb/></p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Then he gave it as his own

     what you say yourself.

     him from saying, that I was deceiving the House, 
     <lb/>
     the letter I got was from Mrs. White, a lady whom 
     <lb/>
     I do not know. I just passed the information on 
     <lb/>
     from the letter to the House. I am happy to know 
     <lb/>
     they have sold their squid. I did not know until

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I did not know it. The squid was

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I move that the Convention 
     <lb/>
     resolve itself into a committee of the whole to 
     <lb/>
     further consider and discuss the proposals 
     <lb/>
     received on November 6th from the Right Hon. 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, we have come to the 
     <lb/>
     famous "diaper bonus" and I was surprised at the 
     <lb/>
     complacent attitude of Mr. Smallwood that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job would pay. As a layman, I was wondering 
     <lb/>
     how Mr. Job would pay, since when I am finished 
     <lb/>
     with this job I intend to go fishing, and to land 
     <lb/>
     and sell at Bonavista Cold Storage, of which, I 
     <lb/>
     am informed, Mr. Job and associates are the 
     <lb/>
     owners. Now, I am perplexed. Will Mr. Job for<lb break="no"/>get he has a "diaper bonus" to pay and give me 
     <lb/>
     the full value for the fish I'll land, or go in a dory 
     <lb/>
     and fish for the bonus himself, or will he, with 
     <lb/>
     that bonus in mind, take it out of me? I'm afraid 
     <lb/>
     he will. I have dragged up my family, and it looks 
     <lb/>
     like I've got to help bring up others. You have 
     <lb/>
     always got to pay it, even a young man today, 
     <lb/>
     when he gets up to the age of 40, with kids up to 
     <lb/>
     16; you go on paying the "diaper bonus" until you 
     <lb/>
     are 70, when you get the "whisker bonus". 
     <lb/>
     Another vicious circle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have been doing a little delving this past 
     <lb/>
     10-30 years into matters of taxation and I have 
     <lb/>
     some figures before me which I think should be 
     <lb/>
     brought before our people, for if this farce goes 
     <lb/>
     through and our people ever get tax-conscious, 
     <lb/>
     they will be in virtual revolt. Let us examine the 
     <lb/>
     happy Zion to which our confederate apostle is 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     leading us. The leader of this movement is paint<lb break="no"/>ing a picture that cannot but cheer the heart of 
     <lb/>
     every toiler in this island home of ours. I wish I 
     <lb/>
     could subscribe to it, but I must have used up all 
     <lb/>
     my optimism on the Economic Report. Why the 
     <lb/>
     pessimism? It's simply this: ever since I came 
     <lb/>
     into this Convention I have heard nothing but the 
     <lb/>
     hardships of our system of taxation, and I had 
     <lb/>
     really hoped that in the leap towards Zion that 
     <lb/>
     tough road would be smoothed over; but I am 
     <lb/>
     disappointed! First fixings first. I don't want to go 
     <lb/>
     meandering around from Quirpon to Grand Falls, 
     <lb/>
     so here it is. We heard a royal address about 
     <lb/>
     taking from the rich and giving to the poor. I'll 
     <lb/>
     say more about that later, for that's up my alley, 
     <lb/>
     but this before us unfortunately is not so, for I'm 
     <lb/>
     going to lump the two big social sums together, 
     <lb/>
     the "diaper bonus" and the "whisker bonus". 
     <lb/>
     They cost, together, $342 million. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Now in that grand Dominion they have a sales 
     <lb/>tax and I'll quote:2 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The sales tax hitherto has always been con<lb break="no"/>sidered as one of the most vicious forms of 
     <lb/>regional taxation. It hits every man, woman, 
     <lb/>child and babe in arms, totally regardless of 
     <lb/>income; but the federal government plans to 
     <lb/>collect $325 million in sales tax this year, 
     <lb/>against $298 million collected last year, for 
     <lb/>the major taxpayers in Canada are the poor 
     <lb/>people of Canada, not only in the income tax 
     <lb/>as the figures readily prove, but in the fact 
     <lb/>that 12 million people in Canada are sharing 
     <lb/>
