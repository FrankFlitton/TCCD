     Mr. Starkes That $4 — is that per trip or per 
     <lb/>
     month? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> That is for a trip. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Does the government compel you to 
     <lb/>
     have these men insured? Or is it voluntary? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> The government does not compel 
     <lb/>
     you, but under the act you are responsible for 
     <lb/>
     payment of $1,000 if anything happens to the 
     <lb/>
     men. For years all of our men have been insured. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> The bank fishermen only get $180. 
     <lb/>I consider their lot just as hazardous as seal 
     <lb/>fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Much more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Therefore I am alarmed at the small 
     <lb/>
     insurance of bank fishermen, compared to the 
     <lb/>
     sealers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I suggest we leave this report on 
     <lb/>
     insurance until we come to that section. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> ....The point strikes me that

     considering the fact that these ships cannot be

            <p>used for ordinary purposes, it might be possible<lb/>to employ them in the fresh frozen food business,<lb/>is that possible?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I do not think that a properly built 
     <lb/>
     sealing ship could be equipped to combine with 
     <lb/>
     insulation. Take the Beothic and Ungava — it 
     <lb/>
     was the serious competition and they could not 
     <lb/>
     compete, it cost so much more for insurance. We 
     <lb/>
     were paying insurance on an extra $200,000 all 
     <lb/>
     the time and competition was so keen, we found 
     <lb/>
     we had to lie them up. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> They were good cargo carriers.

     <lb/>the seal hunt? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Nothing definite. We are all waiting to 
     <lb/>
     see the results of the sealing survey.

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I was wondering if there is any 
     <lb/>fear of overfishing, or whether there is any sign 
     <lb/>of diminution of whales around the coast. I was 
     <lb/>also wondering whether there is any ambergris. 
     <lb/>which is used as a base for highly priced per<lb break="no"/>fumes, and if it is exported, and I was wondering 
     <lb/>if we could get any idea of the value.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> As far as we can learn there is no 
     <lb/>
     sign of the diminution of the whales, and they 
     <lb/>
     have got a scientist there the last few years. To 
     <lb/>
     my knowledge there has not been any ambergris.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is there a tendency towards a

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I would not be sure, but the quota 
     <lb/>
     has been filled this year.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is an international quota?

            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> There is an international agree<lb break="no"/>ment, which sets the number of whales that can

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Do you remember the number?

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> In the Antarctic it is 16,000.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> These figures on page 7 would 
     <lb/>
     seem to indicate that there is no shortage of 
     <lb/>
     whales. There is a steady increase.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> From 1940 to 1942 the Hawke's

     dollar industry, and he anticipates in the future it

     ton to $503, but I don't think that's a fair value. 
     <lb/>
     It's in connection with the British government 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi>, and on top of that I might say that 
     <lb/>
     Canada is mixed up with it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Great Britain gets her wheat from 
     <lb/>
     Canada for $1.50, so Canada and Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     got together and set the Norwegian price. They 
     <lb/>
     can still charge us $18 for flour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Could Mr. Crosbie tell us what 
     <lb/>
     happens to most of the whale oil produced in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland after it goes away, and why the 
     <lb/>
     thing that happens to it after it leaves does not 
     <lb/>
     happen here in Newfoundland. He knows what I 
     <lb/>
     mean. It goes to Canada does it not? What do they 
     <lb/>
     do with it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Prior to the war it all went to 
     <lb/>
     Europe. Only under wartime conditions has it 
     <lb/>
     gone to Canada. It goes to a plant where it is 
     <lb/>
     deodorised and hardened; some parts of it are 
     <lb/>
     used for eating, and some is sent back to New<lb break="no"/>foundland for margarine. In this country you 
     <lb/>
     can't establish a plant of this kind without a 
     <lb/>
     minimum of 5,000 tons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....How many tons would you 
     <lb/>
     get out of the whales we have here? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> About 3,000 tons.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Could you import some oil to 
     <lb/>
     make up the rest? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> No, but you can use seal oil and 
     <lb/>
     herring oil, but the last five years we have not had 
     <lb/>
     that much including all the oils. It looks brighter 
     <lb/>
     in the future, but I can't say for sure. I understand 
     <lb/>
     Lever Brothers may do it in the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I thought you were going to do

     it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> It costs too much money.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> All except the gunners, who are

     mostly Norwegians. There are two Smiths who

     Newfoundland. I think there were factories in ten

     different places around the island some years ago, 
     <lb/>
     and it was manufactured just the same as it is 
     <lb/>
     today.... There was between $500,000 and $1 
     <lb/>
     million invested in that industry, which was lost

     by the disappearance of the whales.

     am glad to see that the lobster industry is a big

     <lb/>
     The price is really marvelous.... We have good

     inspector will give us a license, and go to the

     <lb/>
     he goes off, and when he returns nobody has seen 
     <lb/>
     the lobster that has gone in those tins. It is not his 
     <lb/>
     fault, he is worked to death. If we could educate 
     <lb/>
     some of our teachers to assist in the inspection of 
     <lb/>
     lobster, salmon, herring, etc., during June, July 
     <lb/>
     and August I think it would be a good thing.

     Every other day you could have them come in and

     look over your factory and see that everything is

     all lobsters should be inspected right on the road

     before anybody buys them. For instance Jack

     Jones puts up 100 cases of lobsters and sends 
     <lb/>
     them to St. John's. When these are inspected ten 
     <lb/>
     cases are thrown out, and when this man gets his 
     <lb/>
     returns he is disappointed. The merchant is not to 
     <lb/>
     blame. When they are culled out in St. John's 
     <lb/>
     they feel that something has gone wrong. Last 
     <lb/>
     year we bought 500-800 cases of salmon and 
     <lb/>
     lobsters, and these were culled on our premises, 
     <lb/>
     and we sent the man his report back and his 
     <lb/>
     cheque. Five cases were spoiled and he got dis<lb break="no"/>appointed and hurt over it, but if these lobsters 
     <lb/>
     could be inspected right there on the premises and 
     <lb/>
     that man given a clean receipt there would be no

     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Yes, sir. In nine cases out of ten 
     <lb/>
     they come in to St. John's before any inspection 
     <lb/>
     is made, and they come from Green Bay or 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden, and when that man gets his final 
     <lb/>
     receipt perhaps ten cases were thrown out, and it 
     <lb/>
     creates a bad feeling between the buyer and the

     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, according to the

     figures given here it is very evident that these 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, particularly the lobster fishery and the 
     <lb/>
     salmon fishery, are very important fisheries to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and it is very interesting to note 
     <lb/>
     that the lobsters exported to Canada and United 
     <lb/>
     States amounted to over $650,000. We see also 
     <lb/>
     that the markets, Canada and the States together 
     <lb/>
     with the United Kingdom, for our salmon fishery 
     <lb/>
     exports is good, and in view of the high value of 
     <lb/>
     these fisheries to Newfoundland I think that some 
     <lb/>
     scientific investigation should be undertaken and 
     <lb/>
     continually pursued to see that we are not over<lb break="no"/>fishing these important fisheries. To my mind, 
     <lb/>
     there are no statistics in this report to back it up, 
     <lb/>
     but I rather think that the salmon fishery is a 
     <lb/>
     declining one, and I have often wondered what 
     <lb/>
     will be the future of the salmon fishery, and what 
     <lb/>
     are the causes of the serious decline in the catches 
     <lb/>
     of salmon particularly. Some people think that 
     <lb/>
     the increase in the number of seals the past few 
     <lb/>
     years has been probably brought about by the fact 
     <lb/>
     that these seals may be preying upon the salmon. 
     <lb/>
     I don't know. I believe the recommendation that 
     <lb/>
     some assistance be provided for Dr. Templeman 
     <lb/>
     in the biological department would be money 
     <lb/>
     well spent in investigating the decline of these 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, because they are very important

     fisheries. The lobster and salmon fisheries come 
     <lb/>
     to almost $2 million, and we should certainly be 
     <lb/>
     greatly interested to see that they are scientifical<lb break="no"/>ly fished and conservatively fished, and not over- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fished, so that by and by the salmon and lobsters 
     <lb/>
     will have to have a closed season to prevent their 
     <lb/>
     extinction.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> On that point I note that on the first 
     <lb/>
     page of the Appendix the total poundage of live 
     <lb/>
     lobsters to Canada and USA is approximately 2.5 
     <lb/>
     million pounds, and the total returns ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $650,000, and I think that works out 
     <lb/>
     to around 25 1/3 cents per pound as the declared 
     <lb/>
     value to the Customs. When I take what value is 
     <lb/>
     declared to the Customs, and the figure we have 
     <lb/>
     is 25 cents per pound on that basis given there, 
     <lb/>
     and then on page 57 of the report, which has not 
     <lb/>
     been read yet, in the section on co-operatives, you 
     <lb/>
     have the fact that they shipped 900,000 pounds 
     <lb/>
     and got a net proceeds of $300,000, and the price 
     <lb/>
     to the fishermen is given as an average of 32 cents 
     <lb/>
     per pound. Well, that would seem to further sub<lb break="no"/>stantiate the argument that this other figure is 
     <lb/>
     considerably too low, that actually it should be a 
     <lb/>
     good deal higher than that. I don't know if losses 
     <lb/>
     involved by the private companies were so much 
     <lb/>
     heavier than the losses of the co-operative, be<lb break="no"/>cause the figure of 32 cents per pound averaged 
     <lb/>
     by the fishermen in your co-operative take the 
     <lb/>
     losses into account.

     years ago, due to persistent agitation by fisher<lb break="no"/>men, an experiment was carried out in connection

     with IR. Dickson of Fortune, and large numbers 
     <lb/>
     were caught and freighted to Canada. The thing 
     <lb/>
     became uneconomical because it involved too 
     <lb/>
     much expense, but it did destroy much dogfish. 
     <lb/>
     It had to be abandoned although it did do much 
     <lb/>
     good. The Commission of Government agreed

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Won't you have to amend this

     now: "We are advised that the operators of one

     there is a plant in Burin, and that will be three.

     that white fishmeal is made from non-oily fish,

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> The number of sharks that go

     ashore is negligible. T here's not the quantity of

     fish to warrant it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We have lots of sharks in this

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> The Committee did not give a great

     <lb/>
     driven ashore, and by the time you have gotten 
     <lb/>
     around to processing them they are fairly putrid. 
     <lb/>
     Of course some are taken in the canning season 
     <lb/>
     over in Trinity bay, and they can be used. I

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think it was probably due to the state

     of the livers of the Committee because there is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely no way to make it up. It is clearly guess 
     <lb/>
     work. We simply took what we thought was a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable amount to allow for the decline. Many 
     <lb/>
     people think that we will have a considerable 
     <lb/>
     increase in volume, especially in such things as 
     <lb/>
     herring and canning and by products, and we 
     <lb/>
     thought we should put something in. If anyone 
     <lb/>
     can tell us how to get any other figures we will 
     <lb/>
     be glad. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will be glad to help you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job! Seriously, further back in your report here, 
     <lb/>
     dealing with codfish alone you said that the future 
     <lb/>
     value of exports might be $10 million, and to be 
     <lb/>
     on the safe side you had better put it at $8 million. 
     <lb/>
     Well, if you take the production last year, $34.5 
     <lb/>
     million, counting the million that was eaten here 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, you will find that nearly $17.5 
     <lb/>
     million of that was salt codfish alone, and you 
     <lb/>
     figure for the future $8 million, less than half. 
     <lb/>
     Incidentally in this total for last year, have you 
     <lb/>
     got the oils? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, $2.5 million for oils 
     <lb/>
     beginning a year or two from now. Surely oils are 
     <lb/>
     going to be worth a lot less than $2.5 million, 
     <lb/>
     unless the fall in price is more than made up by 
     <lb/>
     the increase in output? We might still have $2.5 
     <lb/>
     million worth to export in that case, but all 
     <lb/>
     through this long table making up $3.5 million, 
     <lb/>
     surely to goodness in the next three or four years 
     <lb/>
     there is going to be considerable decline in value 
     <lb/>
     of a great many items, even if there is an increase 
     <lb/>
     in the value of many others, and to make a total 
     <lb/>
     of $34.5 million and thenjust lop off $10 million 
     <lb/>
     and call it $24 million for the future is nothing 
     <lb/>
     more than a pious hope. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You will have to show us how to do it. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I would too, but if we 
     <lb/>can't do it how can we say whether we will be

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I don't know, there is an awful lot 
     <lb/>
     of hot air around here. I don't agree with Mr. Job. 
     <lb/>
     It was not a blind guess. I don't know if he knows 
     <lb/>
     how this $2.5 million was made up on oil. It was 
     <lb/>
     not until sometime in November or December 
     <lb/>
     that the large increase in oil came, so actually it 
     <lb/>
     would be nearer $5 million instead of $2.5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion — pretty near double, so actually that figure 
     <lb/>
     of $2.5 million is somewhere near double since 
     <lb/>
     November, and in some cases triple. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> We can only take the Customs' 
     <lb/>
     declared value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I am not criticising. I am trying to 
     <lb/>
     explain to Mr. Smallwood what the position is. I 
     <lb/>
     am not one of the critics, and I don't intend to be. 
     <lb/>
     Now with regards to the drop, where we estimate 
     <lb/>
     a drop in salt codfish around $8 million. As I said 
     <lb/>
     before, this country has one fish only, the codfish, 
     <lb/>
     and as soon as we forget that attitude the sooner 
     <lb/>
     the country will get on its feet. For one thing 
     <lb/>
     alone, these figures for 1947 will be closer to $4.5 
     <lb/>
     million rather than $2.5 million, that's for the 
     <lb/>
     same quantity, and you are going to get increased 
     <lb/>
     production over the next two or three years, and 
     <lb/>
     additional quantities of fishrneal that have not 
     <lb/>
     been exported before will take up a lot of the 
     <lb/>
     slack. You have those canning plants, last year it 
     <lb/>
     was somewhere in the vicinity of $8 million, and 
     <lb/>
     there is no reason why we can't export $2-3 
     <lb/>
     million worth of canned goods. I don't think this 
     <lb/>
     estimate is too far wrong. lfI were to make a little 
     <lb/>
     bet I might say that in the next few years it might 
     <lb/>
     be $40 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am glad to hear Mr. Crosbie 
     <lb/>
     express such optimism, but we have got to keep 
     <lb/>
     our feet on the ground, you have to admit that. 
     <lb/>
     Just come back to that table: haddock was 
     <lb/>
     $300,000 last year, lobsters $1 million, and sal<lb break="no"/>mon close to $1 million. Sealskins $500,000 last 
     <lb/>
     year, squid $136,000, and then you have a large 
     <lb/>
     number of other items, all at I imagine inflated, 
     <lb/>
     shortage prices. Now, say you are right, oil that 
     <lb/>
     was worth $2.5 million in 1946 in 1947 comes to 
     <lb/>
     be worth $4.5 or $5 million, and even in 1948 
 

            <cb/>
      

     let's say it is worth $5 million, surely by the end 
     <lb/>
     of 1948 the world shortage of oil would be won. 
     <lb/>
     There will be no shortage of oil two years from 
     <lb/>
     now. It is true you can be producing more by that 
     <lb/>
     time than you are now, but is it possible, unless 
     <lb/>
     you get into herring in a big way, to increase your 
     <lb/>
     output of oil and take up the falling prices? Even 
     <lb/>
     if it is worth $5 million now, will it be worth that 
     <lb/>
     two or three years from now? There must be a 
     <lb/>
     limit to the amount of salmon and lobster you can 
     <lb/>
     get. I am a tremendous believer in herring. 
     <lb/>
     Iceland, which we look upon as a codfish 
     <lb/>
     country, at the end of 1944 had 62 quick-freezing 
     <lb/>
     plants in operation costing $10 million. In l945 
     <lb/>
     they produced 200,000 tons of fish — how much 
     <lb/>
     of that was codfish? 3,000 tons out of the 214,000 
     <lb/>
     tons of all kinds of fish. We have not begun to 
     <lb/>
     think of herring. I agree with Mr. Crosbie. We 
     <lb/>
     must keep our feet on the ground. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> You are a great confederate, I 
     <lb/>
     believe? There is a magazine called the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fishing

     <lb/>
     Come"; if you read that, you might be optimistic 
     <lb/>
     about this country. I am not a magician. Lots of 
     <lb/>
     people cannot tell what is going to happen within 
     <lb/>
     the next five years. If the price comes down in 
     <lb/>
     thiscountry, it will come down in other countries. 
     <lb/>
     Within the next two years I expect to see $3 
     <lb/>
     million worth of herring oil. We agreed upon an 
     <lb/>
     annual expectancy of $25 million from our fish

     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadian Fisherman</hi> of January 1947, a review 
     <lb/>
     of the past and the future; it reads: "The past year 
     <lb/>
     has brought to an end an era of war-time 
     <lb/>
     prosperity and easy markets for the commercial 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. During the war there was a big demand 
     <lb/>
     for sea foods. After the cessation of hostilities, 
     <lb/>
     the demand continued to rehabilitate and feed the 
     <lb/>
     destitute people of Europe. From now on we will 
     <lb/>
     have to sell seafoods to countries now producing 
     <lb/>
     their own requirements: during 1947 through 
     <lb/>
     their lower standards of living. They are able to 
     <lb/>
     fish the same grounds as ourselves, transport their

     catch long distances for processing and then ship 
     <lb/>
     back again at a market price which we cannot

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> After listening to Mr. Smallwood I 
     <lb/>
     was wondering just how countries like Portugal, 
     <lb/>
     Spain and France can compete with us over here. 
     <lb/>
     I can see how it can be done. We have no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Crosbie says, a competitor in Norway as 
     <lb/>
     far as codfish is concerned. Iceland has never 
     <lb/>
     been a competitor. I cannot see how even Spain 
     <lb/>
     and Portugal are going to feed the people, let 
     <lb/>
     alone feed their own.... In 1909, 1907, 1908 and

     1911 we could buy more for a dollar than we do 
     <lb/>
     today. We should be concerned with what we will 
     <lb/>
     be able to buy with what we produce. Take the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman today, he is in one of the worst places 
     <lb/>
     he has ever been in in the history of the shore 
     <lb/>
     fishery. The men of my district, on the shore 
     <lb/>
     fishery, their average earnings are $325; out of 
     <lb/>
     that they had to come home and feed their 
     <lb/>
     families — flour $18 a barrel. How much better 
     <lb/>
     off they were if they caught 50 quintals in 1929, 
     <lb/>
     than the men who catch 50 quintals today. He was 
   
            <cb/>
   

     five times better off then. If the price of producing 
     <lb/>
     fish comes down, then let the prices come down. 
     <lb/>
     If it was not for the woods and land, you would 
     <lb/>
     have more men on the dole than in 1930. That is 
     <lb/>
     our shore fishermen.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I feel the Committee has made a 
     <lb/>
     fairly conservative estimate of what things to 
     <lb/>
     come are going to amount to as far as fish is 
     <lb/>
     concemed.... I admire Mr. Crosbie's optimism I 
     <lb/>
     feel quite sure that it will not go back more than 
     <lb/>
     half.... I cannot agree with Mr. Smallwood that 
     <lb/>
     the Committee overestimated on any false basis 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever.... Looking at the figures, I am sure 
     <lb/>
     the Committee which brought in this excellent 
     <lb/>
     report has not falsely estimated. Nobody can 
     <lb/>
     make an exact estimate. It must be tantamount to 
     <lb/>
     a guess, although I am sure it is not a guess. I 
     <lb/>
     entirely agree with the conclusions the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee has come to.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> On page 44 in connection with 
     <lb/>government expenditure on fisheries research, it 
     <lb/>shows for 1945-46 there was $12,000 less a 
     <lb/>refund from the Canadian treasury of $4,100, but 
     <lb/>in 1946-47 there is no refund of a similar nature. 
     <lb/>I was wondering if the convenor could tell us 
     <lb/>what the refund constituted?

     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> The figures for 1946-47 run only 
     <lb/>
     to the end of January. The government year goes

     to the end of March, and if there was a refund

     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> The Canadian government did not

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to call attention to 
     <lb/>the last paragraph on page 55: "Without seeking

     <lb/>that henceforth the Board should seek to exercise 
     <lb/>more supervision at the point of production to 
     <lb/>ensure better quality products." I think, Mr. 
     <lb/>Chairman, that at this point I would be justified 
     <lb/>in reading that letter from Lamaline, because it 
     <lb/>deals with the question of quality and standards 
     <lb/>and grades of fish, and it reads as follows....

     On hearing your broadcast over VONF, 
     <lb/>
     which we admire very much and listen to at 
     <lb/>
     every opportunity, I was asked by the people 
     <lb/>
     of Lamaline to write to you and ask you to 
     <lb/>
     ask the question at the Convention if anyone 
     <lb/>
     knows how much merchantable codfish is 
     <lb/>
     exported from Newfoundland. We sell
