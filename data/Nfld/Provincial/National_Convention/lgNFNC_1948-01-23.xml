     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, before proceeding

     with the orders of the day, I would like to draw 
     <lb/>
     your attention, and the attention of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, to my question asked on January 9, and I will 
     <lb/>
     read it again:

     I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioner for Finance and/or the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, (1) in the event 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland becoming a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, what would happen to the deposits 
     <lb/>
     now in the Newfoundland Savings Bank? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) Would the Newfoundland Savings 
     <lb/>
     Bank continue as at present, and would the 
     <lb/>
     depositors continue to receive the same rate 
     <lb/>
     of interest on their deposits as they now 
     <lb/>
     receive? 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>
     That question was put on January 9, that is 14 
     <lb/>
     days ago. No reply has been received at all. The 
     <lb/>
     other day we were told indirectly by Mr. Carew 
     <lb/>
     that the thing had been passed on to the High 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner for Canada. That is probably four 
     <lb/>
     or five days ago, and there is no reply yet. In View 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that we are going to discuss Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's motion I feel that we are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     that reply not after it is all over, but during the 
     <lb/>
     discussion, because it is a very important matter. 
     <lb/>
     There's $20 million down there belonging to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, small deposits most of 
     <lb/>
     it, and we are entitled to have that question 
     <lb/>
     answered. It has been there two weeks, and no 
     <lb/>
     reply has been received. There is no excuse, none 
     <lb/>
     whatever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Further, I also asked a question on January 13, 
     <lb/>
     11 days ago.

     I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency the Governor in Commission 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain from His Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     in the United Kingdom the following infor<lb break="no"/>mation: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If in the referendum proposed to be held 
     <lb/>
     in the spring of 1948 for the selection by the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland of a future form of 
     <lb/>
     government, such referendum will be 
     <lb/>
     decided by and such future form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be selected on the basis of: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) The form of government on the ballot 
    
            <cb/>
       

     which received at least 51% of the total votes 
     <lb/>
     Cast. 
     <lb/>
     (b) The form of government on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     which received a majority of the total votes 
     <lb/>
     cast. 
     <lb/>
     (c) The form of government on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     which received a greater number of votes 
     <lb/>
     than any other individual form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the ballot.

<p>
     That question has been there now 11 days. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I understand, Major Cashin, that 
     <lb/>the reply to that question will be received this 
     <lb/>afternoon.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Thanks very much. Now with re<lb break="no"/>spect to the Savings Bank one, what about that?

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> All I can say is there has been 
     <lb/>no indifference or inertia. Every time it has been

     <lb/>it has been forwarded to the High Commissioner 
     <lb/>for Canada, with the request that he should 
     <lb/>telegraph the question to Canada, and ask for an 
     <lb/>immediate reply. I don't know whether that has

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is a very important question 
     <lb/>
     of course, Major Cashin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to add my voice to 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin's on that point. I think after all the 
     <lb/>
     occasions on which Major Cashin has raised the 
     <lb/>
     matter of what would happen to the government 
     <lb/>
     Savings Bank under confederation, and who 
     <lb/>
     would control the amount of interest that might 
     <lb/>
     be paid on deposits, I now, more then he, am 
     <lb/>
     anxious that the question be answered. I know 
     <lb/>
     what the answer will be, but I want that answer 
     <lb/>
     brought in to settle the matter once and for all. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> He knows what the answer will be! 
     <lb/>That's nonsense! He does not know. I don't 
     <lb/>know, nobody knows.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I know. I was told in Ottawa.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, one moment, let's get your 
     <lb/>Black Book and look at it. There's no question in

            </p>

            <p>

            <p>

     If ever I had deep respect for the statesmanship 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain it is now as I stand to move this 
     <lb/>
     resolution, that we recommend confederation to 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the Newfoundland people in the 
     <lb/>
     forthcoming referendum. My respect for the 
     <lb/>
     statesmanship of Great Britain is boundless. Just 
     <lb/>
     consider, sir, what the British government could 
     <lb/>
     have done. They decided to allow the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people themselves to decide what 
     <lb/>
     form of government they would have for their 
     <lb/>
     country, and they decided to hold a referendum 
     <lb/>
     for that purpose. But they decided at the same 
     <lb/>
     time to ask the Newfoundland people to elect a 
     <lb/>
     National Convention to make recommendations 
     <lb/>
     as to what forms of government should be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people in that referendum. The 
     <lb/>
     British government could have arranged to leave 
     <lb/>
     it completely to this Convention as to what forms 
     <lb/>
     of government the people would vote on in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. If they had done that, then whatever 
     <lb/>
     a majority of the members here recommended 
     <lb/>
     would go on the ballot paper, and nothing else. 
     <lb/>
     The British government could have done that. 
     <lb/>
     They could have left it to a majority of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates of this Convention to decide what 
     <lb/>
     forms of government would be put before the 
     <lb/>
     people. In that case we know now what would 
     <lb/>
     have been recommended — responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment would have been recommended and noth<lb break="no"/>ing else, for as the whole country knows, the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the delegates here are in favour of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and nothing else. If the 
     <lb/>
     majority had their way our people would not be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to vote for anything but responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. Thank God this was not done. It is 
     <lb/>
     not up to a majority of this Convention to decide 
     <lb/>
     what our people shall vote on in the referendum 
     <lb/>
     this spring. The British government could have 


            <cb/>
      

     arranged it that way, but they did not. Thank God. 
     <lb/>
     The British government knew very well why. 
     <lb/>
     They know very well that a majority of members 
     <lb/>
     here in the Convention might represent a 
     <lb/>
     minority of the people. They knew that a minority 
     <lb/>
     here might well represent a great majority of the 
     <lb/>
     population of the country, so the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment very wisely kept to themselves the right to 
     <lb/>
     decide what should go on the ballot and what 
     <lb/>
     should not. In this way the democratic rights of 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland people have been preserved 
     <lb/>
     against usurpation, and I am very grateful to the 
     <lb/>
     British government for doing it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So I say to our Newfoundland people, I say to 
     <lb/>
     the many thousands of Newfoundlanders who 
     <lb/>
     want confederation with Canada, and I say to the 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention, that although the 
     <lb/>
     confederates in the Convention are out- num<lb break="no"/>bered almost two to one, although we are a 
     <lb/>
     minority in the Convention, our recommendation 
     <lb/>
     will be respected by the British government. 
     <lb/>
     There is no doubt about, confederation will be on 
     <lb/>
     the ballot paper in the referendum. Our people 
     <lb/>
     will get their chance to vote for confederation this 
     <lb/>
     spring. The many hundreds of people who have 
     <lb/>
     written or telegraphed or telephoned about this 
     <lb/>
     matter to me, can be of good cheer, for the British 
     <lb/>
     government will protect the democratic rights of 
     <lb/>
     our people against all attempts of a mere majority 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, the first stage of our great battle for the 
     <lb/>
     people is nearly over. It was a battle to get this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to adopt my resolution to send a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Canada to get the terms, but that 
     <lb/>
     battle was finally won. It was a battle to get this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to debate the terms, but that battle 
     <lb/>
     was won. Now we are entering the last stage of 
     <lb/>
     the first half of the battle. We are going to decide 
     <lb/>
     whether, as a Convention, we will recommend 
     <lb/>
     that confederation be put before the people in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum for their verdict. We may not get a 
     <lb/>
     complete victory in this present part of the battle. 
     <lb/>
     A majority of the members here will probably 
     <lb/>
     vote against my motion, but by this time the 
     <lb/>
     British government has a very good idea of how 
     <lb/>
     things stand in this country today. They are not 
     <lb/>
     going to be carried away by a vote of a mere 
     <lb/>
     majority of this Convention, because they know 
     <lb/>
     that 99 Newfoundlanders out of 100 want con<lb break="no"/>federation to be submitted to them after this Con<lb break="no"/>

     vention comes to an end. When this motion is 
     <lb/>
     voted on next Tuesday night, that will be the end 
     <lb/>
     of the first half of the battle. Then the second half 
     <lb/>
     will commence, after this Convention comes to 
     <lb/>
     an end. Then a great crusade of the people will 
     <lb/>
     commence, a great democratic people's crusade 
     <lb/>
     to bring the truth before the people, the truth that 
     <lb/>
     we have never had a fair opportunity of bringing 
     <lb/>
     before them concerning confederation. Then, sir, 
     <lb/>
     we will gladly and joyously call on the hundred 
     <lb/>
     and thousands of our people who have already 
     <lb/>
     volunteered their patriotic services to this great 
     <lb/>
     battle for freedom and economic security, for 
     <lb/>
     mark this well, this is not 1869. This time the 
     <lb/>
     people are going to know the truth. They are not 
     <lb/>
     going to be smothered with the lies and propagan<lb break="no"/>da of 1869. It was easy enough in 1869 to bluff 
     <lb/>
     the people with lies about their property being 
     <lb/>
     taxed, but this time the anticonfederates are not 
     <lb/>
     going to get away with it, not even if every 
     <lb/>
     millionaire, half-millionaire and quarter-mil<lb break="no"/>lionaire in the country rallies to the side of the 
     <lb/>
     anticonfederates. The day is gone when their 
     <lb/>
     money-bags will tell our people how to vote. That 
     <lb/>
     day is gone, and we live in a different age. Our 
     <lb/>
     people are no longer in the mood to bow down 
     <lb/>
     and almost worship a man just because he has 
     <lb/>
     managed somehow or other to make a great for<lb break="no"/>tune for himself. They no longer measure a man's 
     <lb/>
     patriotism or his loyal heart by the money he has 
     <lb/>
     in the bank. When we say we have a stake in the 
     <lb/>
     country we no longer mean how much money a 
     <lb/>
     man has, but how many children he has, what is 
     <lb/>
     the size of his family, what is his love for the 
     <lb/>
     country. When we talk of "men of substance" 
     <lb/>
     today, we include something more than money. 
     <lb/>
     Our people are on the march in their tens of 
     <lb/>
     thousands. They have formed great trade unions 
     <lb/>
     and co-operative societies, and cannot so easily 
     <lb/>
     be bluffed any more. They have learned a lot the 
     <lb/>
     past few years, and they ask questions, questions 
     <lb/>
     that they never dared to ask in the bad old days. 
     <lb/>
     They ask questions about our vicious system of 
     <lb/>
     taxation. They ask questions about the cruel and 
     <lb/>
     oppressive cost of living. They ask questions 
     <lb/>
     about a system of taxation and of government that 
     <lb/>
     has held them down and made it impossible for a 
     <lb/>
     working man to live decently and rear a family 
     <lb/>
     by his honest earnings. Yes, our people are in the 
     <lb/>
     mood to ask many questions today that they never 
     <lb/>
     asked before. They are not so easy to bluff as our 
 

            <cb/>
      

     forefathers were in 1869, and our anticon<lb break="no"/>federates are going to find that out in 1948 when 
     <lb/>
     the referendum takes place.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Iwant to say a word on proper<lb break="no"/>ty taxes. This is the topic that the anticonfederates 
     <lb/>
     are going to harp on through the remainder of the 
     <lb/>
     period before the referendum. Their campaign 
     <lb/>
     against confederation is going to be based very 
     <lb/>
     largely on this claim. They will set out to per<lb break="no"/>suade our people that under confederation their 
     <lb/>
     property will be taxed, and also their land and 
     <lb/>
     outhouses and flakes and stages and fishing room 
     <lb/>
     and boats and fishing gear and live stock. You 
     <lb/>
     will have to pay taxes on all these things, the 
     <lb/>
     anticonfederates will tell you. They will try to put 
     <lb/>
     the fear of God in our people about the property 
     <lb/>
     taxes. That is their trump card, so they believe. 
     <lb/>
     They will try the same game that certain people 
     <lb/>
     used in Newfoundland where the people voted on 
     <lb/>
     town councils only last year. Certain people who 
     <lb/>
     were against town councils went around and said 
     <lb/>
     to the people, "Surely you are not going to vote 
     <lb/>
     for town councils — they will tax your garden 
     <lb/>
     and your house and everything in your house, so 
     <lb/>
     much for a cat and a dog and a hen and a pig..."

     town councils. That is what the anticonfederates 
     <lb/>
     are going to try on a grand scale, a national scale 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. They will tell you that your 
     <lb/>
     property will be taxed, and you will be ground to 
     <lb/>
     death by taxes if you vote for confederation. Why

     ing an audience in a hall just a little while ago. 
     <lb/>
     He was an anticonfederate, and seeing a crowd 
     <lb/>
     before him, he could not resist the temptation to 
     <lb/>
     put over a cute piece of anticonfederate 
     <lb/>
     propaganda. He said, "Do you see that? That will 
     <lb/>
     be taxed under confederation. Do you see this and 
     <lb/>
     that? Everything will be taxed under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion." He thought he was going to bluff these 
     <lb/>
     people, but there happened to be some men there 
     <lb/>
     who had lived and worked in Canada, and they 
     <lb/>
     were able to stand up and show up his lies. The 
     <lb/>
     anticonfederates think they have a trump card in 
     <lb/>
     this property tax, but they are not going to get 
     <lb/>
     away with it. We have too many people here 
     <lb/>
     today who have lived and worked in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     too many who have relatives living and working 
     <lb/>
     in Canada for that bluff to be put over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under confederation we will have two go<lb break="no"/>vernments over us — the federal government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the provincial government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The federal government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     never yet collected any property tax whatsoever. 
     <lb/>
     They never did and never will. The provincial 
     <lb/>
     government of course will be our own govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We will elect it, and they will sit here in 
     <lb/>
     this very chamber. They will never pass a law to 
     <lb/>
     collect property taxes from our people — never, 
     <lb/>
     never, never, and if they ever become so foolish, 
     <lb/>
     if they ever become so foolish as to do it, why we 
     <lb/>
     will simply turn them out at the next election. It 
     <lb/>
     is as simple as that. No government in New<lb break="no"/>foundland would stand a week if they ever tried 
     <lb/>
     to put property taxes on us. So the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment will collect no property taxes from us, and 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government will collect none from 
     <lb/>
     us. Who is left? The town council if left. If a town 
     <lb/>
     council exists in a settlement, no doubt that town 
     <lb/>
     council will collect a few local taxes, just as most 
     <lb/>
     town councils are already doing in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. But it is left to the people of every 
     <lb/>
     town or settlement to decide for themselves 
     <lb/>
     whether they will have a town council or not. If 
     <lb/>
     they want one, they will have one. If they do not 
     <lb/>
     want one they will not have it. It is in their own 
     <lb/>
     hands. Nobody can force them. Mr. Claude Hicks 
     <lb/>
     of Fredericton, in Fogo District, says for example 
     <lb/>
     that he has a house, a barn and two acres of land, 
     <lb/>
     and he wants to know what tax he will have to 
     <lb/>
     pay on that property under confederation. I can<lb break="no"/>not answer that question until I know if the people 
 

            <cb/>
           

     of Fredericton will decide to have a town council. 
     <lb/>
     If the Fredericton people, including Mr. Hicks, 
     <lb/>
     should decide to have a town council, then per<lb break="no"/>haps the council will collect a small tax on his 
     <lb/>
     property — maybe a five dollar bill a year, or 
     <lb/>
     whatever the council decides. Maybe Mr. Hicks 
     <lb/>
     would be elected a member of that town council. 
     <lb/>
     If so he would help to decide what tax to put on 
     <lb/>
     his property. But if Fredericton decides not to 
     <lb/>
     have a town council, then there will be no tax at 
     <lb/>
     all on Mr. Hicks' property, for there is no one to 
     <lb/>
     collect a tax on it. The Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     will not tax his property, the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland will not tax it — so who 
     <lb/>
     is there to tax it if there is no town council in 
     <lb/>
     Fredericton? And remember that it is left to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Fredericton to decide whether they will 
     <lb/>
     have a town council or not — it is up to themsel<lb break="no"/>ves. Nobody can force them to have it. And what 
     <lb/>
     I say about Mr. Hicks applies to every man in 
     <lb/>
     Fredericton; and what I say about Fredericton 
     <lb/>
     applies to every settlement or town in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. But the people of Newfoundland need 
     <lb/>
     not worry; all this will be explained to them 
     <lb/>
     before the referendum is held. This is one time 
     <lb/>
     the anticonfederates are not going to bluff our 
     <lb/>
     people on this property tax question.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> did me the honour the other day 
     <lb/>
     of quoting from the speech I made when I intro<lb break="no"/>duced my motion more than a year ago, my 
     <lb/>
     motion that the Convention should send a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Canada to seek the terms of union. I was 
     <lb/>
     greatly interested in the part of my speech that he 
     <lb/>
     read out, and to tell you the truth I thought it was 
     <lb/>
     very good. I am surprised that I made such a good 
     <lb/>
     speech on that occasion. Anyway, that made me 
     <lb/>
     look up my speech, and there was one paragraph 
     <lb/>
     that struck me very much. I think it is worth 
     <lb/>
     repeating. Here is what I said on that occasion, 
     <lb/>
     and now I quote my own words exactly: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     So now, Mr. Chairman, we know all the 
     <lb/>
     factors but one. We know that it is lawful for 
     <lb/>
     the Convention to send the delegation to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa. We know that Ottawa will receive the 
     <lb/>
     delegation, and receive it cordially. We know 
     <lb/>
     that the opposition party will not oppose it. 
     <lb/>
     We know that the Canadian people will not 
     <lb/>
     oppose it. The only thing we still don't know 
     <lb/>
     is what the Newfoundland people want. We 
     <lb/>
     don't know whether they want confederation

     or not — and we're not going to know until 
     <lb/>
     they vote in the referendum. All we can do is 
     <lb/>
     get the terms and conditions and that's all this 
     <lb/>
     resolution calls for. The rest can very safely 
     <lb/>
     be left to the people; once they know the 
     <lb/>
     terms, they'll know how to make up their 
     <lb/>
     minds all right never you fear.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref>

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     That is what I said on that occasion, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, and how true my words were — how 
     <lb/>
     reasonable they were! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First I brought in my resolution that we should 
     <lb/>
    send a delegation to Ottawa to ask for the terms 
     <lb/>of union. The delegation went, and we have had 
     <lb/>the terms laid before us and we have debated 
     <lb/>them. Now I bring in this resolution, that con<lb break="no"/>federation on these terms should be laid before 
     <lb/>the people in the referendum. Could anything be 
     <lb/>more reasonable? Could anything be more 
     <lb/>democratic? This Convention voted by a good 
     <lb/>majority to send a delegation to Ottawa to seek 
     <lb/>the terms of union. That delegation, which the 
     <lb/>Convention voted to send, and which the Con<lb break="no"/>vention elected, cost the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>over $20,000. Major Cashin says it is $30,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think it cost $400,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Over $20,000 came out of the 
     <lb/>public chest to get these terms for the people's 
     <lb/>consideration, and what could be more 
     <lb/>reasonable than to submit the terms to the people? 
     <lb/>We do not own these terms, Mr. Chairman. The 
     <lb/>Newfoundland people paid for them, and the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland people own them. They have 
     <lb/>every right to pass judgement on the terms. They 
     <lb/>have every right to decide whether they will join 
     <lb/>the Canadian family of provinces or try to stagger 
     <lb/>along on our own. That is all my present resolu<lb break="no"/>tion or motion does. It only asks that confedera<lb break="no"/>tion on these terms be submitted to our people for 
     <lb/>their verdict, for their decision. Let the people 
     <lb/>decide, says my motion. Let the people say 
     <lb/>whether they will have confederation. Could any<lb break="no"/>thing be more reasonable? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The more I think about that speech of mine 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Higgins quoted from the other day, the 
     <lb/>
     better I like it. I will read you another part, a part

     that Mr. Higgins did not see fit to read.

     wear and use and have much less than they

            <p>
     Sir, our country is fast becoming a land of 
     <lb/>
     festering monopoly. Freedom of trade is becom<lb break="no"/>ing rapidly a thing of the past. I am not at this 
     <lb/>
     moment speaking of free made; but of ordinary 
     <lb/>
     freedom of trade, the ordinary right, as it used to 
     <lb/>
     exist, of any man to engage in trade, to import his 
     <lb/>
     own merchandise and sell it direct to the people. 
     <lb/>
     That freedom is fast dying in Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     is fast being replaced by monopoly. A new race 
     <lb/>
     of traders has arisen in our midst. They have 
     <lb/>
     secured exclusive agencies all to themselves, 
     <lb/>
     agencies for this and that necessary and desirable 
     <lb/>
     article of merchandise. (I am not talking now 
     <lb/>
     about our regular wholesale firms). What do they 
     <lb/>
     do, these exclusive agents? Do they add one cent 
     <lb/>
     of true value to the things on whose distribution 
     <lb/>
     they have a close monopoly in Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
     No, they do not. Do they reduce the price of these 
     <lb/>
     articles to our people? No, they do not — on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary you will find that in many cases an 
     <lb/>
     article becomes dearer the moment some monop<lb break="no"/>olistic trader secures the exclusive agency for it. 
     <lb/>
     A new race of monopolists has arisen in our 
 

            <cb/>
       

     country. They will hate me for pointing at them. 
     <lb/>
     They will hiss at me for drawing the people's 
     <lb/>
     attention to them. But there they are, and their 
     <lb/>
     chief accomplishment has been to drive up the 
     <lb/>
     cost of things and make it even harder for our 
     <lb/>
     people to live. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I have done my share of pointing to the 
     <lb/>
     shame and infamy of certain tariff-protected in<lb break="no"/>dustries in this country, some of those local in<lb break="no"/>dustries, as we call them, that shelter behind a 
     <lb/>
     high tariff that drives up our cost of living. But 
     <lb/>
     these industries have at least this merit: that they 
     <lb/>
     produce something. They do bring in the raw 
     <lb/>
     material, they do employ a few people, changing 
     <lb/>
     the shape and appearance of those raw materials. 
     <lb/>
     They make something. These monopolistic 
     <lb/>
     traders make nothing, they produce nothing, they 
     <lb/>
     create nothing. They are traders, pure and simple. 
     <lb/>
     They manage to get themselves wedged in be<lb break="no"/>tween the ordinary traders and the people; not, 
     <lb/>
     please note, between the goods and the people, 
     <lb/>
     but between the traders who sell the goods and 
     <lb/>
     the people who buy the goods. By getting these 
     <lb/>
     monopolistic agencies, they set up toll-gates of 
     <lb/>
     their own, and they collect their own special fee 
     <lb/>
     that is piled onto the cost of the articles they sell. 
     <lb/>
     It only means that one additional and one com<lb break="no"/>pletely unnecessary item of expense is piled onto 
     <lb/>
     the cost of the things we must buy. If, sir, I seem 
     <lb/>
     to be paying a lot of attention to these modern 
     <lb/>
     monopolists, it is because I know how they are 
     <lb/>
     driving the high cost of living still higher. We 
     <lb/>
     have seen some of these men become rich and 
     <lb/>
     wealthy men. I could name them for you. I know 
     <lb/>
     their story. This man in 20 years has raked 
     <lb/>
     together a million dollars for himself by monop<lb break="no"/>olistic practices.

     Another man has attracted another million to 
     <lb/>
     himself. This third one is well on the way toward 
     <lb/>
     his first million dollars. This fourth one has 
     <lb/>
     passed comfortably the half-million mark. I look 
     <lb/>
     about this town, and I see men who in the past 
     <lb/>
     half dozen years, the past ten or 12 years, the past 
     <lb/>
     15 or 20 years, have piled up great fortunes out 
     <lb/>
     of their comfortable monopolies. Where did they 
     <lb/>
     get their money, sir? Was it by the sweat of their 
     <lb/>
     brows? Was it by making two blades of grass

     grow where one grew before? Was it by starting 
     <lb/>
     a new industry? Was it by helping to carry on our 
     <lb/>
     fishery or agriculture, our paper mills or mines, 
     <lb/>
     or any of our basic industries? No, it was by none 
     <lb/>
     of these things. So far as actual production is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, these men do not toil, neither do they 
     <lb/>
     spin. They are just what the name implies, mo<lb break="no"/>nopolistic traders, who have managed to grab to 
     <lb/>
     themselves a convenient and easy way of skim<lb break="no"/>ming off an extra, an additional profit from the 
     <lb/>
     people's needs. I may add that nearly all of these 
     <lb/>
     monopolists are anticonfederates. They are near<lb break="no"/>ly all great supporters of anything and everything 
     <lb/>
     that opposes confederation. They sit and shiver 
     <lb/>
     in their stylish offices for fear confederation will 
     <lb/>
     come and sweep their monopolies into the ash 
     <lb/>
     can of history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yes, sir, here are our new rich, our new aris<lb break="no"/>tocracy. Highly successful men, "men with a 
     <lb/>
     stake in the country" they will proudly tell you. 
     <lb/>
     Men to whom most of us look up — after all, 
     <lb/>
     nothing succeeds like success, does it, sir? And 
     <lb/>
     surely the opinion of a man worth a million 
     <lb/>
     dollars is worth a million times as much as the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of a man worth only one dollar, even on 
     <lb/>
     forms of government, or even advising our 
     <lb/>
     people how they should vote in the referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I would not mind so much if these monop<lb break="no"/>olists took the money they rake in out of their 
     <lb/>
     monopolies over the necessities of life, if they 
     <lb/>
     took that money, or a goodly portion of it and 
     <lb/>
     poured it into our basic industries, our fisheries 
     <lb/>
     and mines and forests; if they poured it into those 
     <lb/>
     main industries by which our people live. But no, 
     <lb/>
     most of their monopolistic profits go promptly 
     <lb/>
     into other trading enterprises, other enterprises in 
     <lb/>
     which, from a productive standpoint, they neither 
     <lb/>
     toil nor spin, but from which they reap more 
     <lb/>
     profits. If confederation did nothing else but 
     <lb/>
     smash these monopolies and restore freedom of 
     <lb/>
     trade, then it would be worthwhile to our people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, what I have said on this point, I have said 
     <lb/>
     with my eyes open. I am perfectly well aware that 
     <lb/>
     in saying it, I am creating more enemies for 
     <lb/>
     myself. But it needed to be said. It cried out to be 
     <lb/>
     said. The people's interest demanded that it be 
     <lb/>
     said. The people are paying me some of their 
     <lb/>
     hard-earned money to be a member of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, and the least I can do is to speak out for 
     <lb/>
     them against these monopolies. Some people 
     <lb/>
     would greatly prefer me to speak on other matters 
     

            <cb/>
          

     — for example, the glorious traditions of the past, 
     <lb/>
     the hallowed walls of the House of Assembly, the 
     <lb/>
     form of government our forefathers bled and died 
     <lb/>
     for, and all that sort of thing. I am sorry, but I 
     <lb/>
     cannot do it. Somebody has got to come out in 
     <lb/>
     the open on these matters that I have mentioned; 
     <lb/>
     somebody has got to bring them out into the open, 
     <lb/>
     even if in so doing he gets nothing but black 
     <lb/>
     hatred and a bad name. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I tell you frankly, Mr. Chairman, I am growing 
     <lb/>
     frightened by the growth of monopoly in this 
     <lb/>
     country; I am growing frightened by the growth 
     <lb/>
     of concentrated wealth. It is a frightening thing 
     <lb/>
     to see in a tiny country with a tiny handful of 
     <lb/>
     struggling people, the rise of a new millionaire 
     <lb/>
     class. This little country is not big enough for 
     <lb/>
     millionaires. They become too powerful, too 
     <lb/>
     strong, too influential. They swing too big a stick. 
     <lb/>
     If they were spread out in a country ten times 
     <lb/>
     larger, they could not make their influence so 
     <lb/>
     strongly felt. But they are not, they are con<lb break="no"/>centrated in a very small country, and most of 
     <lb/>
     them do business within a mile of each other. I 
     <lb/>
     have nothing in the world against any of these 
     <lb/>
     men personally. I know most of them and for 
     <lb/>
     some of them I have genuine liking and respect. 
     <lb/>
     They do not mean to hurt the country, indeed that 
     <lb/>
     would be the last thing in their minds. But just the 
     <lb/>
     same, it is a perilous thing for Newfoundland that 
     <lb/>
     we have so many millionaires, and above all 
     <lb/>
     millionaires who are merely traders — and worst 
     <lb/>
     of all, millionaire traders who are monopolists. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was telling you a week or two ago about the 
     <lb/>
     shocking profits made in this country in the year 
     <lb/>
     1945. I mentioned that year, because it happened 
     <lb/>
     to be the latest year for which we had the official 
     <lb/>
     figures, given to us by no less a person than the 
     <lb/>
     Assessor of Taxes. His figures showed us that 
     <lb/>
     105 concerns between them made a clean, clear 
     <lb/>
     profit in that one year of $15.5 million — an 
     <lb/>
     average of $150,000 for each of them in that one 
     <lb/>
     year. $15.5 million clean, clear profits cleaned up 
     <lb/>
     in just one year by those 105 companies and firms 
     <lb/>
     in this little country. But that was only one year. 
     <lb/>
     In 1946 they made even more. In 1947 it was 
     <lb/>
     roughly about the same. Since the war broke out, 
     <lb/>
     sir, down to the present time, our companies and 
     <lb/>
     firms have cleaned up, between them, not less 
     <lb/>
     than $100 million in profits — not less than $100 
     <lb/>
     million of clean, clear profits taken from our 
     <lb/>
     handful of people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     I shall modify that statement, sir. I said "clean, 
     <lb/>
     clear" profits. I take back the word "clean". Their 
     <lb/>
     profits were clear, but they were not always 
     <lb/>
     clean. I wish to choose my words carefully. I want 
     <lb/>
     my words to express exactly what I mean. I say 
     <lb/>
     that never in history, in this or any country, was 
     <lb/>
     any handful of people so looted, so plundered as 
     <lb/>
     our people have been since this late war broke 
     <lb/>
     out. It was in many cases cold, calculated 
     <lb/>
     plunder. If Major Cashin would talk about the 
     <lb/>
     plunder by those firms instead of talking about 
     <lb/>
     the plunder of the public chest, he would do more 
     <lb/>
     good for the people of Newfoundland. They took 
     <lb/>
     all the profits the traffic would bear, and all the 
     <lb/>
     government would let them take, and in many 
     <lb/>
     cases a lot more than the government would 
     <lb/>
     allow them to take. I have never heard or read of 
     <lb/>
     a handful of people whose pockets were so 
     <lb/>
     shamelessly looted as were the pockets of our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people during this war. While 
     <lb/>
     their sons were offering their very lives for the 
     <lb/>
     brave new world they were promised, they them<lb break="no"/>selves were attacked by a looting, monopolistic 
     <lb/>
     plutocracy here in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will tell you what this late war has done to 
     <lb/>
     our country. It has strengthened and solidified our 
     <lb/>
     new rich. It has put great fortunes into the hands 
     <lb/>
     of some who did not have them before the war, 
     <lb/>
     and it has doubled the fortunes of those who did 
     <lb/>
     have them before the war. It has drawn the reins 
     <lb/>
     of monopoly closer, it has fastened the chains of 
     <lb/>
     class domination more securely upon the masses 
     <lb/>
     of our people. Our struggling masses have 
     <lb/>
     managed to renew the wallpaper in their homes; 
     <lb/>
     they have managed to get together a bit more 
     <lb/>
     furniture and household utensils, to paint their 
     <lb/>
     houses, and generally to do a bit of replenishing. 
     <lb/>
     Those of them whose families were not large, and 
     <lb/>
     who were not quite so far down when the war 
     <lb/>
     broke out, have even managed to lay aside a little 
     <lb/>
     modest savings. But the great majority of our 
     <lb/>
     people are fast falling back to where they were 
     <lb/>
     before the war broke out, back into the same 
     <lb/>
     shameful old rut of poverty and insecurity. It has 
     <lb/>
     widened the gulf between the people and their 
     <lb/>
     economic masters. If the poor have not become 
     <lb/>
     absolutely poorer, it certainly cannot be said that 
     <lb/>
     the rich have not become richer, for they have 
     <lb/>
     become richer. The gulf between them has 
     <lb/>
     widened and deepened. And of few countries in

            <p>
     This has got to stop. I know our New<lb break="no"/>foundland people. I am one of them. I am blood 
     <lb/>
     of their blood, bone of their bone, soul of their 
     <lb/>
     soul. I am descended from a family that has lived 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland for over 150 years. My ances<lb break="no"/>tors were fishermen, farmers, shop-keepers, 
     <lb/>
     manufacturers, skilled workmen and artisans. I 
     <lb/>
     have dug deep into my country's history, and in 
     <lb/>
     so doing I have paid special attention to the story 
     <lb/>
     of our people's labours, their battles against na<lb break="no"/>ture and against injustice, the story of their end<lb break="no"/>less search for a square deal. I have travelled my 
     <lb/>
     country, north, east, south and west, into a 
     <lb/>
     thousand of the 1,300 settlements in it. I have 
     <lb/>
     been closely and intimately associated with our 
     <lb/>
     people. I have fished with the fishermen, logged 
     <lb/>
     with the loggers; I have gone down underground 
     <lb/>
     with the miners; held trade union meetings right 
     <lb/>
     inside the paper mills. I was never so close to our 
     <lb/>
     toilers as during those years of the dole, and 
     <lb/>
     always, so long as I live, I will remember those 
     <lb/>
     years of the dole, and always, so long as I live, I 
     <lb/>
     will remember those friends of mine, those toilers 
     <lb/>
     who were stricken down by beri-beri, those 
     <lb/>
     children who felt the pinch of hunger. I saw the 
     <lb/>
     heartbreak in the eyes of patient mothers who had 
     <lb/>
     not enough to give their little ones. I saw the 
     <lb/>
     baffled, sullen rage of fishermen whose greatest 
     <lb/>
     toil and endurance could not provide their 
     <lb/>
     families with enough to eat or wear. I attended 
     <lb/>
     meetings of the unemployed here in St. John's, 
     <lb/>
     but who was I to refuse their invitation to go and 
     <lb/>
     speak to them? I saw them in their despairing 
     <lb/>
     hundreds waiting around the street corners, wait<lb break="no"/>ing for the jobs that never turned up, and around 
     <lb/>
     the dole office, and helped to gather second-hand 
     <lb/>
     clothes to distribute to those who were half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     naked, not for a day or a week or a year, but all 
     <lb/>
     through the depression. I saw them, and I swore 
     <lb/>
     an oath to myself that never would I be a party to 
     <lb/>
     allowing such things to come back to our people 
     <lb/>
     again. I would never be a party to any form of 
     <lb/>
     government that would make us know that thing 
     <lb/>
     again, and that's why I became a confederate. I

     became a confederate and discovered that con<lb break="no"/>federation would give our people a half-decent

     <lb/>right in the referendum. If the anticonfederates

            <p><persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> Mr. Chairman, the greatest hon<lb break="no"/>our I consider I have ever had in my life is at this 
     <lb/>very moment, as I rise to second Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood's motion. I could not hope to find words to 
     <lb/>express what pleasure it gives me. I am a native 
     <lb/>of the southwest coast and a resident of there, and 
     <lb/>as such I would be ashamed ever to go on that 
     <lb/>coast again if I failed to support this motion with 
     <lb/>all my heart. I would be ashamed to look those 
     <lb/>people in the face. I doubt very much if ever a 
     <lb/>member in any district expressed the wishes of 
     <lb/>his district any more than I am expressing the 
     <lb/>wishes of Fortune Bay, and indeed the whole 
     <lb/>coast when I stand up here to advocate confedera<lb break="no"/>tion.

            <p>Ever since 1869 there has not been a month or 
     <lb/>a day when those people were not in favour of 
     <lb/>confederation. In the 1869 election on the south<lb break="no"/>west coast they elected confederate candidates, 
     <lb/>and up there today they are only longing for the 
     <lb/>day of the referendum to come, so that they can 
     <lb/>march into the ballot booths in their thousands to 
     <lb/>mark for confederation. Sir, our southwest coast 
     <lb/>people know a lot about confederation. They 
     <lb/>know a lot about Canada. In their thousands they 
     <lb/>have worked in Canada, fished in Canada, visited

     in Canada. They know what conditions are like 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, and their greatest hope is that some 
     <lb/>
     day conditions on the coast and in their country 
     <lb/>
     will become as good as they know them to be in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and as they know them to be, sir, from 
     <lb/>
     close personal experience. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We often hear talk in this country about the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. We often hear it said that the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces are down and out, poor, up 
     <lb/>
     against it, and opposed to confederation. Our 
     <lb/>
     people on the coast get a great laugh out of that 
     <lb/>
     kind of talk. It is a great joke to them, for they are 
     <lb/>
     extremely familiar with the Maritime Provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. I have been told that the people down 
     <lb/>
     in the Straits, in fact on both sides of the Straits, 
     <lb/>
     are something like ourselves on the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast. Like us they know Canada too, not perhaps 
     <lb/>
     the same part of Canada that we know so well, 
     <lb/>
     but a more northerly part. They travel back and 
     <lb/>
     forth across the Straits to that part of Canada 
     <lb/>
     which is just across the border, and they know the 
     <lb/>
     people well, and know what living conditions are 
     <lb/>
     like, and what prices are, and how much better 
     <lb/>
     these people live and get along than they do 
     <lb/>
     themselves. And it is a very interesting fact that 
     <lb/>
     the people of Labrador and in the Straits of Belle 
     <lb/>
     Isle are such strong confederates. As Mr. Burry 
     <lb/>
     has told us, I understand that the entire population 
     <lb/>
     of Labrador and northern Newfoundland are 
     <lb/>
     practically unanimously for confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     are waiting longingly for the day to come to vote 
     <lb/>
     for confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is a cant word in all the district, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, that the Newfoundland people who know 
     <lb/>
     Canada best are the strongest confederates. That 
     <lb/>
     gives you something to think about. Those people 
     <lb/>
     down north and our people along the coast do not 
     <lb/>
     look upon Canadians as strangers. They do not 
     <lb/>
     look upon Canada as a strange country that is 
     <lb/>
     trying to gobble us up. They do not look upon the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada as a people who are taxed to 
     <lb/>
     death. They know the difference. Of all the 
     <lb/>
     people on the southwest coast who favour con<lb break="no"/>federation our fishermen are the strongest. The 
     <lb/>
     merchants too favour confederation. Fishermen 
     <lb/>
     and merchants are alike in that, but it is the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen who are the strongest of all for it. That 
     <lb/>
     is because they know how the fishermen live in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Our fishermen for many years fished 
     <lb/>
     with the Canadian fishermen. They have been 
     <lb/>
     going up there since long before I was born, in 


            <cb/>
    

     fact fishing alongside the Canadian fishermen in 
     <lb/>
     the same vessels and the same dories. Better than 
     <lb/>
     anyone in Newfoundland our southwest coast 
     <lb/>
     fishermen know how the Canadian fishermen 
     <lb/>
     live, and that is what makes our fishermen such 
     <lb/>
     strong confederates. If all the fishermen of New<lb break="no"/>foundland could spend one season fishing with 
     <lb/>
     Canadian fishermen on Canadian vessels, no 
     <lb/>
     power on earth could hold these men back from 
     <lb/>
     fighting for confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Their greatest worry on that coast today is that 
     <lb/>
     confederation might lose in the referendum. I will 
     <lb/>
     tell you why. They have been in the habit for 
     <lb/>
     many years of going up to Canada to work, but 
     <lb/>
     Canada has been tightening up her immigration 
     <lb/>
     regulations lately, and what many of our people 
     <lb/>
     are afraid of is that if confederation is turned 
     <lb/>
     down that avenue of employment may be closed 
     <lb/>
     against them. It would be a very bad blow to our 
     <lb/>
     coast, if that did happen. No matter what we talk 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention, every man of us knows very 
     <lb/>
     well that hard times are going to come again to 
     <lb/>
     this country. They are bound to come, and what 
     <lb/>
     our people fear is that when hard times come 
     <lb/>
     again they might find themselves bottled up in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, unable to travel freely to Canada 
     <lb/>
     to earn the dollar that they can't earn in their own 
     <lb/>
     country. Many millions of Canadian dollars have 
     <lb/>
     been earned in this way in the past, and the day 
     <lb/>
     is coming when we will need the chance to earn 
     <lb/>
     those Canadian dollars again. But I would not 
     <lb/>
     have you think that I am advocating confedera<lb break="no"/>tion only because the southwest coast is so 
     <lb/>
     strongly in favour of it. I am advocating confeder<lb break="no"/>ation because it would be good for the whole 
     <lb/>
     country, and for all our toilers wherever they may 
     <lb/>
     live, north, south, east or west. All our people 
     <lb/>
     may not want to have Canada's door open to them 
     <lb/>
     to seek work, when they can't find it at home, but 
     <lb/>
     it is not only the chance to work in Canada that 
     <lb/>
     makes confederation good for Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the present time, if we want the advantages 
     <lb/>
     of confederation we have to go to Canada to get 
     <lb/>
     them. We have to work and live in Canada to get 
     <lb/>
     them, but if Newfoundland joins up with Canada 
     <lb/>
     most of those advantages will be brought right 
     <lb/>
     into Newfoundland itself. Our cost of living will 
     <lb/>
     come down, and although it may not come down 
     <lb/>
     quite as low as in Canada, yet it will come down 
     <lb/>
     a lot. Free trade with Canada will see to that, for 
     <lb/>
     it is plain common sense that when we take off 
 

            <pb n="1360"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-23_Page_1360.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1360</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     all customs import duty on goods coming in from 
     <lb/>
     Canada, our cost of living will fall. And just as 
     <lb/>
     surely as the cost of living falls, the standard of 
     <lb/>
     living must go up. Our dollar will be worth more. 
     <lb/>
     It will buy more, and it will go further. Our people 
     <lb/>
     will live better. Then on top of that, our taxes will 
     <lb/>
     be lower, and not only will they be lower, they 
     <lb/>
     will be more just, they will be fairer. Under 
     <lb/>
     confederation the heaviest burden of taxation 
     <lb/>
     will fall on the broadest shoulders, not on the 
     <lb/>
     poorest where it is in our own country today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, those two reasons would be 
     <lb/>
     plenty to justify confederation: namely that it 
     <lb/>
     would bring down the cost of living, and bring 
     <lb/>
     down taxation, and make taxation more just and 
     <lb/>
     more fair. But there are many other reasons why 
     <lb/>
     confederation would be good for our people, 
     <lb/>
     especially the toiling masses amongst our people. 
     <lb/>
     They may call family allowances immoral if they 
     <lb/>
     like, but I for one cannot see anything immoral 
     <lb/>
     about a plan to pay cash allowances to every child 
     <lb/>
     under 16 in the country. I cannot see anything 
     <lb/>
     immoral in sending a cheque every month of the 
     <lb/>
     year into every home that has children under the 
     <lb/>
     age of 16. I can see how it would be immoral to 
     <lb/>
     deprive our children of the chance to benefit from 
     <lb/>
     family allowances, but I fail completely to see 
     <lb/>
     how any man can stand here in this chamber and 
     <lb/>
     say that it is immoral to protect a country's most 
     <lb/>
     precious heritage, her children. We have been 
     <lb/>
     told that we have in Newfoundland 120,000 
     <lb/>
     children under the age of 16. That is more than 
     <lb/>
     one-third of our whole population. I can think of 
     <lb/>
     nothing better, nothing more Christian than to see 
     <lb/>
     that these future citizens are guaranteed every 
     <lb/>
     month of the year at least enough to eat, and that 
     <lb/>
     is exactly what confederation will do through 
     <lb/>
     family allowances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If they call family allowances immoral, why 
     <lb/>
     don't they call old age pensions immoral as well? 
     <lb/>
     If it is immoral to pay allowances to all our 
     <lb/>
     children under 16, isn't it just as immoral to pay 
     <lb/>
     allowances to wornout toilers who have reached 
     <lb/>
     the age of 70? We have 10,000 old people who 
     <lb/>
     will receive that $30 a month if we become part 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Why don't they get up here and call 
     <lb/>
     that immoral? They can call these things im<lb break="no"/>moral, butI know that our people, and what they 
     <lb/>
     are going to call the man who calls these things 
     <lb/>
     immoral. It won't be complimentary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I am not going to go into the 


            <cb/>
   

     details of confederation. That was done in the 
     <lb/>
     debate on the terms, and there is no need to go all 
     <lb/>
     over that ground again. Our people understand 
     <lb/>
     confederation now, at least the great majority of 
     <lb/>
     them do, and if there are still a few who don't, 
     <lb/>
     then no doubt they will get the chance to under<lb break="no"/>stand them before the referendum comes around. 
     <lb/>
     A great effort was made here to try to make it look 
     <lb/>
     as though confederation was too hard a thing for 
     <lb/>
     our people to understand, but those who bank on 
     <lb/>
     this are banking on something that will not stand 
     <lb/>
     up. Our people are not what some persons think. 
     <lb/>
     They have gathered around their radios in their 
     <lb/>
     thousands, all around the country. They have 
     <lb/>
     studied this thing, and understand it far more than 
     <lb/>
     some people realise. You will see how rightI am, 
     <lb/>
     sir, when the votes are counted in the referendum. 
     <lb/>
       </p>

            <p>In common fair play, Mr. Chairman, con<lb break="no"/>federation must be placed on the ballot. Our 
     <lb/>people must have the chance to vote for or against 
     <lb/>confederation. The choice must be theirs. It 
     <lb/>would be a criminal and shameful thing if this 
     <lb/>Convention voted against letting the people 
     <lb/>decide. I know that a majority of the members 
     <lb/>here are against confederation. Well, that is their 
     <lb/>right. They have a right to be against confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, but they have no right to deny the people 
     <lb/>their chance to pass judgement on it in the 
     <lb/>referendum. Some members may be quite care<lb break="no"/>less of what the people think of them. Some may 
     <lb/>even be carried away with the fact that here in 
     <lb/>this Convention they happen to be lined up with 
     <lb/>a majority, but this Convention will soon be a 
     <lb/>thing of the past, and then that majority will be a 
     <lb/>thing of the past. Members would be short sighted 
     <lb/>indeed to defy the people just for the sake of 
     <lb/>pleasing the majority here in the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if we 
     <lb/>might have a recess for five or ten minutes?

     <lb/>We need a strong partner. We cannot and dare not

            <cb/>
      

     State for Commonwealth Relations to the 
     <lb/>
     effect that the issue raised in the question will 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with in the legislation governing the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. This legislation will not be set<lb break="no"/>tled until after the report of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention has been received and con<lb break="no"/>sidered by His Majesty's Government in the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom. Before it is enacted, the bill 
     <lb/>
     will be published to enable interested parties 
     <lb/>
     to comment thereon. 
     <lb/>

            <p>I said the answer was vague. We are just as wise 
     <lb/>now as when we asked the question. I think 
     <lb/>copies of this have been placed on members' 
     <lb/>desks. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I move now that the debate be adjourned until 
     <lb/>
     Monday, and that it be understood I am not going 
     <lb/>
     to speak first on Monday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> In rising to second the motion, I wish 
     <lb/>
     to say it is a well-known fact that Mr. John 
     <lb/>
     McCormack, one of our fellow delegates has 
     <lb/>
     taken unto himself a wife, and seeing this is the 
     <lb/>
     day after "the night before" I am sure it is the wish 
     <lb/>
     of all the members to wish Mr. and Mrs. Mc<lb break="no"/>Cormack many years of wedded happiness. I 
     <lb/>
     second the motion to adjourn the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I am anxious to get through with this, 
     <lb/>
     and I am also anxious to accommodate members 
     <lb/>
     who are not prepared to speak at this time. But 
     <lb/>
     there are a number of supporters of this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and I look upon it as their day, and I see no 
     <lb/>
     reason why they cannot come on and give us the 
     <lb/>
     "good stuff". I want to get clear and get away as 
     <lb/>
     quickly as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That has to be decided by the 
     <lb/>
     House. It has been suggested by Major Cashin, 
     <lb/>
     and I think I am justified in attaching very con<lb break="no"/>siderable importance to his observations and to 
     <lb/>
     those of his seconder, that there may be some 
     <lb/>
     members who would want time to consider their 
     <lb/>
     remarks before making replies. The motion is 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair and I am entirely in your hands. 
     <lb/>
     What takes place is to be determined by you. 
            </p>
