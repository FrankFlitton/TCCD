     itself." Might I point out that Roosevelt was 
     <lb/>
     addressing those words to 130 million people 
     <lb/>
     living in one of the richest lands of the earth and 
     <lb/>
     with all the mighty forces of a highly in- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     dustrialised civilization theirs to command. The 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report is addressing 320,000 people 
     <lb/>
     living in one of the poorest lands of the earth, and 
     <lb/>
     with but a $30 million national surplus to pull and 
     <lb/>
     haul on if the going gets rough. There just hap<lb break="no"/>pens to be a slight difference. But now that 
     <lb/>
     Roosevelt's name has come up, I remember that 
     <lb/>
     he had a formula for the re-establishment of the 
     <lb/>
     lives of men at a level of not less than the most 
     <lb/>
    that might be had for all men. He wanted all men  
     <lb/>everywhere to enjoy freedom from fear, freedom 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     from want, freedom from the fear of want. And I 
     <lb/>
     like to think that he wanted that not only for the 
     <lb/>
     butcher and baker and candlestick-maker he 
     <lb/>
     knew, but for my last forgotten fisherman on the 
     <lb/>
     bill of Cape St. George as well. And if in the 
     <lb/>
     decision that confronts this nation there shall be 
     <lb/>
     any way of coming by such economic security, 
     <lb/>
     and yet retaining the full measure of our political 
     <lb/>
     liberty, then we should not turn our backs on that 
     <lb/>
     way to a more spacious destiny for purely sen<lb break="no"/>timental reasons.

     Motion to Amend National Convention Act to Permit Voting by Proxy

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Higgins I move: 
     <lb/>
     That this Convention request His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     the Governor in Commission that Paragraph 
     <lb/>
     2 of the National Convention Act, 1946, be 
     <lb/>
     amended, whereby provision may be made 
     <lb/>
     that any member or members of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion incapacitated by reason of illness from 
     <lb/>
     attending sessions of the Convention may 
     <lb/>
     have his or their vote recorded in his or their 
     <lb/>
     absence provided he or they have signed and 
     <lb/>
     executed the proper instrument to give effect 
     <lb/>
     to this purpose. Such right to vote by proxy 
     <lb/>
     shall be exercised only during the debate on 
     <lb/>
     forms of government and the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions to the United Kingdom government 
     <lb/>
     arising therefrom to be put before the people 
     <lb/>

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     at a national referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the motion is carried, and if the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government accede to the request, it will be 
     <lb/>
     necessary to amend article 39 of our own con<lb break="no"/>stitution, but that could wait until after amend<lb break="no"/>ment is made by the Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>
     if the amendment is passed, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
       Mr. Chairman It is to permit members in<lb break="no"/>capacitated by illness from attending to express 
     <lb/>
     by proxy his or their vote or votes on forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, when that business comes before 
     <lb/>
     the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I wish to second that motion.

                                          itself, that has not been <lb/> criticised, and
                                          consequently I was not at all <lb/> surprised when certain
                                          delegates set themselves <lb/> up as being greater
                                          authorities than the compilers <lb/> of the Economic
                                          Report. We have witnessed this <lb/> in the case of every
                                          report which has come before <lb/> us. I regret this,
                                          because whilst I consider a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount
                                          of honest criticism healthy, at the <lb/> same time a
                                          policy of opposition in an assembly <lb/> such as this
                                          cannot be a good thing, either for <lb/> ourselves or for
                                          the country at large. Constructive <lb/> suggestion and
                                          bitter opposition are worlds apart. <lb/> On Tuesday past
                                          we had an exhibition of the sort <lb/> of thing I have in
                                          mind — a verbal storm was <lb/> raised when one delegate
                                          spent hours saying that <lb/> we are not
                                          self-supporting.... <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     I listened attentively to those criticising this 
     <lb/>
     report, hoping I might hear something that would 
     <lb/>
     throw a new light on the facts presented. I heard 
     <lb/>
     the member for Bonavista Centre put his personal 
     <lb/>
     construction on many items but in no case was he 
     <lb/>
     able to change these facts. I heard a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     hair splitting, for instance, the report states that 
     <lb/>
     our Railway is valued at $72 million, and the 
     <lb/>
     member for Bonavista Centre says no one would 
     <lb/>
     pay this amount for it. No one suggested that our 
     <lb/>
     railroad should be put up for sale or that anyone 
     <lb/>
     should be asked to buy it. The report simply states 
     <lb/>
     that the Railway is valued at $72 million, a figure 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Smallwood endorses himself in the 
     <lb/>
     report furnished by the Ottawa delegation. I give 
     <lb/>
     this as an example of the extremes to which critics 
     <lb/>
     will go to get something to say. Again he bewails 
     <lb/>
     the fact that our highroads do not earn any 
     <lb/>
     revenue. If this is an argument against highroads, 
     <lb/>
     then it would appear to be Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     argument that North America has made a grave 
     <lb/>
     mistake in building roads. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again he is not satisfied with the limited na<lb break="no"/>ture of the scope of the report. He says we should 
     <lb/>
     know what the condition of this country is going 
     <lb/>
     to be beyond three years from now. I suggest he 
     <lb/>
     discuss this matter with the governments of the 
     <lb/>
     United States or Canada, or any government. I 
     <lb/>
     imagine he would be surprised at what they 
     <lb/>
     would say to him. He says that we should not plan 
     <lb/>
     to build a local merchant marine. If he honestly 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     thinks this, then it simply means one of two 
     <lb/>
     things, either we should continue to pay hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of thousands of dollars annually to foreign ship<lb break="no"/>ping companies, to pay the wages of hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     foreign sailors, or we should stop bringing goods 
     <lb/>
     to the country. Mr. Smallwood said many other 
     <lb/>
     things, but as they amount to nothing more than 
     <lb/>
     carping criticism, I honestly do not think that I 
     <lb/>
     am justified in taking up the time of this House 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with them. Since he has dismally failed 
     <lb/>
     to show that this country is not self-supporting, 
     <lb/>
     has been unable to prove that Newfoundland will 
     <lb/>
     not be self-supporting in the foreseeable future, I 
     <lb/>
     contend he has failed in everything, except to 
     <lb/>
     show how easy it is to attempt to tear down the 
     <lb/>
     things which other men build up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Coming back to the report itself, the most 
     <lb/>
     interesting thing I found was the fact that it offi<lb break="no"/>cially shows the things which I had always felt to 
     <lb/>
     be so, but which I was not in a position to prove. 
     <lb/>
     The first was my belief that Newfoundland could 
     <lb/>
     always look after itself if given a square chance 
     <lb/>
     to do so.... If Newfoundland had been allowed to 
     <lb/>
     do what she should have done in l933, declare a 
     <lb/>
     moratorium on her debts, we would never have 
     <lb/>
     known a depression such as we had. The report 
     <lb/>
     states that we are self-supporting, and this fact is 
     <lb/>
     so self-evident that a dozen critics cannot change 
     <lb/>
     it. The second fact it shows is that we are in a 
     <lb/>
     position where we can look to our future with 
     <lb/>
     confidence. The report limits its view to three 
     <lb/>
     years. Mr. Chairman, my own view goes far 
     <lb/>
     beyond this. When I review the stable nature of 
     <lb/>
     our industries, I say that our future is assured not 
     <lb/>
     for ten years, but for the next 50 years, until the 
     <lb/>
     last ton of ore is dug from the limitless iron beds 
     <lb/>
     of Bell Island; the last ton of paper comes from 
     <lb/>
     our mills, and the last cod's tail comes out of the 
     <lb/>
     ocean. No man in this chamber will live to see the 
     <lb/>
     exhaustion of our main industries, and to 
     <lb/>
     prophesy the failure of these sources of wealth is 
     <lb/>
     a blasphemy against a bountiful Providence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am leaving out of the picture altogether that 
     <lb/>
     great possession of ours on the Labrador — 
     <lb/>
     110,000 square miles of potential mineral, timber 
     <lb/>
     and water-power riches. Was there ever any 
     <lb/>
     country on God's green earth that could look to 
     <lb/>
     the future with such hope and confidence? The

     very air of this country is breathing with the 
     <lb/>
     expectancy of the great things which are to come. 
     <lb/>
     And that knowledge of our happy position seems 
     <lb/>
     to have reached the notice of those far from our 
     <lb/>
     shores, who are already casting their covetous 
     <lb/>
     eyes on our little country. Mr. Smallwood, with 
     <lb/>
     others, would make much of the fact that we owe 
     <lb/>
     our present prosperity to war conditions. I submit 
     <lb/>
     that we are looking at the picture upside down. If 
     <lb/>
     they said our prosperity began with the war, they 
     <lb/>
     would be more correct. The question is not what 
     <lb/>
     caused our prosperity, but will it continue? Is it 
     <lb/>
     stable? What we have to deal with here are not 
     <lb/>
     causes, but effects. If the discovery of oil in a 
     <lb/>
     territory makes that place rich, are we going to 
     <lb/>
     say that she is not really rich because she owes 
     <lb/>
     her prosperity to the lucky discovery? If America 
     <lb/>
     based her start to greatness on a war of inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, are we going to charge her with having 
     <lb/>
     obtained a false independence and prosperity? If 
     <lb/>
     something like a war happens in this country, 
     <lb/>
     which gives a new life to our industries, are we 
     <lb/>
     going to concern ourselves with the cause, does 
     <lb/>
     not the fact remain that we are prosperous and 
     <lb/>
     promise to remain so? Is not that the whole ques<lb break="no"/>tion? If things were bad in the past, is that to be 
     <lb/>
     a proof that they must also be bad in the future? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Anyone who has given any intelligent survey 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland conditions knows that we can<lb break="no"/>not base our present ideas on the past economic 
     <lb/>
     history of this country. Because the clear fact 
     <lb/>
     remains that our primary industries, fishing and 
     <lb/>
     pulp and paper, are in a vastly different position 
     <lb/>
     than before the war.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The annual payrolls of the pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     industry in 1939 were approximately $6,500,000. 
     <lb/>
     In 1949 they will be about $25 million. The total 
     <lb/>
     value of the exports of the industry in 1939 was 
     <lb/>
     $14 million. In 1949 the value of the exports of 
     <lb/>
     pulp and paper will probably be between $45-50 
     <lb/>
     million. The whole trouble with our paper in<lb break="no"/>dustries a few years ago was not the price but 
     <lb/>
     rather the market, and the market is assured for 
     <lb/>
     ten years for our total output of paper. To satisfy 
     <lb/>
     those who are doubting, let me suggest you get 
     <lb/>
     the total exports of our paper from 1909 to 1946. 
     <lb/>
     You will find that it averaged $60 per ton. The 
     <lb/>
     figures covering our cod fisheries show similar 
     <lb/>
     increases, and it must be remembered that in 
     <lb/>
     connection with our paper industries that full 
     <lb/>
     time operations are assured for the next ten years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     In Mr. Starkes' remarks the other day with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the marketing of our salt codfish, he 
     <lb/>
     drew to our attention that in some sections of the 
     <lb/>
     country a substantial quantity of salt codfish 
     <lb/>
     could not be disposed of. This is not the failure 
     <lb/>
     of the markets to absorb the fish, but is actually 
     <lb/>
     and unfortunately the responsibility of those 
     <lb/>
     people who did not carry out the instructions of 
     <lb/>
     the Fishery Board, who, at the beginning of the 
     <lb/>
     season gave definite instructions to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     shore fish caught in any section of the country 
     <lb/>should not be cured as heavy Labrador cure. This 
     <lb/>is the type of fish that goes pink, and therefore 
     <lb/>the article is spoiled before arriving in the 
     <lb/>markets. Surely, Mr. Chairman, the people who 
     <lb/>buy our fishery products are entitled to receive 
     <lb/>the actual product for which they bargain, and not 
     <lb/>some other substitute. This, therefore, is suffi<lb break="no"/>cient proof that central curing stations should be 
     <lb/>established in selected centres to enable our 
     <lb/>fishermen to spend a longer period in the catching 
     <lb/>of fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Is Mr. Smallwood going to tell us that we are 
     <lb/>
     sending our rolls of paper to fight a war? Is the 
     <lb/>
     ore from Bell Island going out to make shells? Is 
     <lb/>
     our fish going out to feed an army? Is he going to 
     <lb/>
     try and tie in all the dollars we are to receive in 
     <lb/>
     the future with some war that is going on some<lb break="no"/>where that none of the rest of us knows anything 
     <lb/>
     about? I do not think I have ever listened to such 
     <lb/>
     a silly argument since I came to this chamber as 
     <lb/>
     that used by Mr. Starkes in trying to back up a 
     <lb/>
     weak cause, for he himself looks to the bright 
     <lb/>
     economic future for Lewisporte. To prove my 
     <lb/>
     statement, Mr. Starkes is at this very moment 
     <lb/>
     building one of the largest buildings ever to be 
     <lb/>
     erected in our outports, costing in the neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood of $40,000. If codfish, lobsters, wood etc., 
     <lb/>
     fail, where are the dimes coming from to buy 
     <lb/>
     tickets to see the movies at Lewisporte? Who 
     <lb/>
     does he think he is bluffing?

                                          $72 million; so that when the figure of $72 <lb/> million
                                          was handed over to the Ottawa delegation <lb/> he was of

                                          passed it over to the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/><cb/>ment, along with other figures about the Railway
                                          <lb/> without a word of comment whatever.... At no <lb/>
                                          time have I ever said we were trying to fool the <lb/>
                                          Canadian government.... <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It was obtained by

                                          questions. The <lb/> Railway answered with typewritten

                                          there <lb/> were seven members of the delegation; we broke
                                          <lb/> down under various headings the information we <lb/>
                                          wanted. Each member of the delegation was <lb/> given so
                                          many kinds of information to get; he had <lb/> to go to
                                          the various government departments and <lb/> get certain
                                          information. Speaking from memory, <lb/> I believe I am
                                          the one who collected the informa<lb break="no"/>tion on

                                          departments. Mr. Higgins had to do with <lb/> everything

                                          gathered the information on fishery and <lb/> marine

     the information now
                                          and if the Convention <lb/> desires it, we will be only
                                          too happy to produce <lb/> the original documents handed
                                          us by the Railway <lb/> management and containing the
                                          Railway <lb/> management's own estimate of $72 million as
                                          <lb/> being the value of the Railway. <lb/>

                                          was <lb/> the value of the Railway. The value was ascer<lb break="no"/>tained. Now he says, "Do not let us
                                          fool ourselves <lb/> as to the value." Whom were we
                                          fooling then, <lb/> was it ourselves or Canada? <lb/>

                                          Mr. <lb/> Smallwood has said he had fooled the Canadian

                                          did say the figure of $72 millions was obtained <lb/> from
                                          the Railway and that he personally believed <lb/> it to be
                                          an inflated figure. That is as far as I am <lb/> prepared

                                          in other <lb/> respects? I am inclined to use the words of
                                          Mr. <lb/> Smallwood himself regarding another report,
                                          <lb/> "These Canadian reports are not worth the paper
                                          <lb/> they are written on." <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> After listening to the
                                          eloquent <lb/> and sometimes somewhat lengthy speeches
                                          from <lb/> the gentlemen who preceded me, it is with some
                                          <lb/> hesitation I rise to speak on the report which <lb/>
                                          generally speaking reflects great credit on the <lb/>
                                          chairman of the Committee.... I may say it shows <lb/> a
                                          certain amount of optimism which I cannot <lb/> wholly
                                          share. Take as a precedent what happened <lb/> after World
                                          War I — it may not happen again, I <lb/> hope it will not,
                                          but affairs in the world at present <lb/> do not tend to
                                          foster a wholly optimistic view. I <lb/> hope you do not
                                          think I am not an optimist. They <lb/> say the difference
                                          between an optimist and a <lb/> pessimist is that the
                                          former sees the doughnut and <lb/> the latter sees the
                                          hole. But there is always the <lb/> little word "caution".
                                          I do not know what Mr. <lb/> Smallwood would mean by
                                          realism, but I know <lb/> it is a hard word to utilise in
                                          foretelling the future. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     There are a few questions I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     and a few points I would like to mention. Page 2, 
     <lb/>
     "Today therefore, we can definitely state that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's capital account shows a surplus 
     <lb/>
     in cash of $35 million." In fairness to the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee I want to call their attention to a statement 
     <lb/>
     made in one of the local papers asserting that for 
     <lb/>
     the year 1947-48 the accumulated surplus was 
     <lb/>
     $28,789,000. These are the figures according to 
     <lb/>
     the budget speech. May I ask Major Cashin to 
     <lb/>
     explain how the difference has arisen? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Page 6. With the establishment of a mercantile 
     <lb/>
     marine I am in full agreement. As far as I can 
     <lb/>
     ascertain millions of dollars are being sent out of 
     <lb/>
     this country in this connection. There must be 
     <lb/>
     some hitch somewhere or our shipping firms

     would surely be in this business before now. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot agree that the government should go into 
     <lb/>
     the shipping business themselves, as from what I 
     <lb/>
     have seen our government has never been suc<lb break="no"/>cessful in handling business affairs showing 
     <lb/>
     profit. Nevertheless the government could en<lb break="no"/>courage industry by loaning money to some who 
     <lb/>
     had capital to put into the business. I have no 
     <lb/>
     reason to suppose it would be a paying venture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Page 11. Might I ask Major Cashin where is 
     <lb/>
     his authority for saying that the world market is 
     <lb/>
     such that there is a possibility of a rise in price of 
     <lb/>
     newsprint from $90 to $100 per ton? I heartily 
     <lb/>
     agree with what has been said about the export of 
     <lb/>
     raw pulpwood. Immediate steps should be taken 
     <lb/>
     to put a stop to such a practice.

     Page 24. We are told the products of the soil 
     <lb/>
     in this country should approach an estimated 
     <lb/>
     value of $20 million within the next three or four 
     <lb/>
     years. I hope sincerely so. But we must consider 
     <lb/>
     this as being 50% over the Agricultural 
     <lb/>
     Committee's report for 1946.

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Records have proven that in ordinary nor<lb break="no"/>mal times prices for our products of the sea 
     <lb/>
     have been based on the unwritten law of 
     <lb/>
     supply and demand. And so it was that in the 
     <lb/>
     year 1915 when the first World War was 
     <lb/>
     raging, when the German submarines were 
     <lb/>
     making efforts to starve the European 
     <lb/>
     countries, that the prices of our salt codfish 
     <lb/>
     soared to unprecedented figures. Never in 
     <lb/>
     our history have prices for our principal 
     <lb/>
     product been so high. And then once hos<lb break="no"/>tilities ceased and the world generally started 
     <lb/>
     its journey on the road back to normal, prices 
     <lb/>
     obtained for our primary products began to 
     <lb/>
     drop sharply, resulting in many cases in the 
     <lb/>
     bringing about of financial disaster to our 
     <lb/>
     fishing industry. And so we find it once again 
     <lb/>
     when normal conditions had been restored to 
     <lb/>
     the world generally in 1923 that the prices for 
     <lb/>
     our salt codfish product became more 
     <lb/>
     stabilised.

            <p>
     That is to say they dropped.

            <p>
     I am afraid I cannot agree with the assertions 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     made on page 43: "... our present revenues cannot 
     <lb/>
     be something dependent on war boom," and, "... 
     <lb/>
     a great proportion of our present revenues is 
     <lb/>
     coming to us because of the growth of our main 
     <lb/>
     industries. No one can regard our present 
     <lb/>
     revenues as a result of war boom." I wonder if the 
     <lb/>
     Committee wants us to believe that if there had 
     <lb/>
     been no war from 1939-45 we would have had 
     <lb/>
     revenues as high as the present? Do they serious<lb break="no"/>ly believe that if there had been no war, paper 
     <lb/>
     would be worth $90 per ton; fish $10 or $11 per 
     <lb/>
     quintal; iron, copper and zinc at as high prices? 
     <lb/>
     Would the herring industry have attained such 
     <lb/>
     high proportions as it did? Do not the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Committee and the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     believe that as soon as these ravaged countries 
     <lb/>
     who manufacture paper and pulp get into full 
     <lb/>
     production again, it will have a tendency to lower 
     <lb/>
     prices on these commodities? They know the 
     <lb/>
     fishing industry in all its aspects will be affected. 
     <lb/>
     These are facts we have to face. In conclusion, 
     <lb/>
     with the exception of the observations I have 
     <lb/>
     made, I am prepared to accept the report....

                                          three or four years. <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is a dangerous statement. <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am going to prove it. I say it has <lb/>been
                                          plundered and I make that statement before <lb/>the House,
                                          before the country and before my <lb/>God. The other day
                                          in connection with the sink<lb break="no"/>ing fund, I was
                                          asked about this $750,000. I am <lb/>sorry I have not a
                                          blackboard here to work it out. <lb/>If anyone doubts my
                                          veracity, I ask him to take it <lb/>down. I am going to
                                          recite it. In 1937 New<lb break="no"/>foundland paid
                                          £177,950 in sinking funds; at the <lb/>end of 1937 we were
                                          due 3% by buying in our <lb/>original stock. Consequently
                                          it was £183,288 that <lb/>year; in 1938 we sent over
                                          £177,950 — add that <lb/>
                                          <cb/> £361,238; next year 3% on that — £10,837 and <lb/>
                                          so on right down. If there is any gentleman in this <lb/>
                                          House who doubts the veracity of this Commit<lb break="no"/>tee, I am going to move a vote of lack of con<lb break="no"/>fidence and clean the thing up once and
                                          for all. <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p>What do we find? We find the total sinking 
     <lb/>fund should amount to $10,189,391. We go to 
     <lb/>Ottawa to find out what it is — we find it is 
     <lb/>$8,342,000. A discrepancy as the editor calls it 
     <lb/>of $1,750,000 lost to the treasury of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I will say the treasury was plundered 
     <lb/>of that amount. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You ought to amplify it. <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That is the only amplification I can <lb/>make. Now
                                          the interest-free loans. We gave <lb/>Britain $12.3
                                          million interest free during the war <lb/>period; we
                                          borrowed $8 or $9 million and paid <lb/>interest on it.
                                          Why should we borrow money and <lb/>give money away free?
                                          We did not have to bor<lb break="no"/>row the money, to
                                          begin with. We lost <lb/>$1,395,000 in interest. We paid
                                          interest on the <lb/>money we borrowed, $700,000. That was
                                          about <lb/>$2 million more we lost. About $4 million the
                                          <lb/>treasury has been plundered of since 1941, and I
                                          <lb/>say that advisedly and indisputably and no one
                                          <lb/>will ever make me take it back either inside this
                                          <lb/>house or outside. <lb/>
                                   </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The editor said we had $28.5 million surplus. 
     <lb/>
     We recite the figures for him. Turn to your 
     <lb/>
     revenues and expenditures, page 112. I realise 
     <lb/>
     that is the way some people would like it to be. 
     <lb/>
     These figures were proven before. I will call out 
     <lb/>
     the figures, you can check me.

                                          but the <lb/> words "critically correct" brings up another
                                                 mat<lb break="no"/>ter. In a budget speech of mine
                                          in 1931, I forecast <lb/> a deficit of $1.3 million and it
                                          turned out to be $4 <lb/> million; that was put forward as
                                          an argument, <lb/> "Here is an individual who in 1931 made
                                          a budget <lb/> that did not turn out. Can you believe him
                                          now?" <lb/> We will tell them what happened in 1931. This
                                          is <lb/> the place to clean our cloth. I was Minister of
                                          <lb/> Finance. Our loan for $8 million was turned <lb/>
                                          down. Myself and the Prime Minister<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> went to <lb/> Montreal to discuss the
                                          position with the Bank of <lb/> Montreal. Now I am going
                                          to tread on dangerous <lb/> ground. The first thing I was
                                          told in the head <lb/> office of the General Manager at
                                          the time was, <lb/> "Cashin, you should have boosted up
                                          that budget <lb/> speech and made it balance." My reply
                                          was, "Is <lb/> that the way you run the Bank of Montreal?"
                                          I <lb/> knew there was going to be a deficit and I <lb/>
                                          budgeted for it. We were turned down by the <lb/> Bank of
                                          Montreal. Eventually we made a deal; <lb/> we were
                                          advanced $2 million to meet the interest. <lb/> We came
                                          back to Newfoundland. We tore the <lb/> civil service,
                                          everything abroad trying to cut <lb/> down expenses,
                                          railway, schoolteachers, every<lb break="no"/>thing. We
                                          did everything. Most of us took our <lb/> political lives
                                          in our hands. Revenues were still <lb/> falling. The world
                                          was upside down. New<lb break="no"/>foundland did not
                                          cause the world to turn upside <lb/> down. Finally it was
                                          agreed that a delegation, <lb/> another delegation should
                                          go to Canada. We went <lb/> to see if we could get any
                                          money on the Labrador. <lb/> Thanks be to God we did not
                                          get it. We were <lb/> turned down. Canada was bankrupt
                                          herself; her <lb/> banking institutions were on the verge
                                          of col<lb break="no"/>lapse. One of the banks was being
                                          run on while <lb/> we were in Ottawa. We came back to
                                                 New<lb break="no"/>foundland and hardly had we set
                                          foot inside the <lb/> House of Assembly when four managers
                                          of the <lb/> banks were in to see us. For what? They came
                                          to <lb/> us to save themselves; to go off the gold
                                          standard. <lb/> They had an arrangement under the Banking
                                          Act <lb/> whereby Newfoundland or Newfoundlanders, <lb/>
                                          who had $24-25 million on deposit, could <lb/> withdraw
                                          the money in gold. The Canadians did <lb/>
                                          <cb/> not have the gold to pay if called upon. They have
                                          <lb/> $50 million between the four of them — 25 here <lb/>
                                          and the other 25 would have to go against the <lb/>
                                          deposits in Canada. Then what happened? The <lb/> Bank of
                                          Canada was brought into existence. They <lb/> came to us
                                          on their hands and knees, we discussed <lb/> it for nearly
                                          two months. What was happening? <lb/> Merchants here in
                                          this country who had money <lb/> were buying goods in the
                                          United States and the <lb/> Canadian dollar was at a
                                          discount of 20%; the <lb/> pound sterling was $3.50 to
                                          $3.80. Some of the <lb/> merchants said, "We are not going
                                          to pay this <lb/> premium of 20%; pay out the gold and we
                                          will <lb/> ship it to the United States and pay for the
                                          goods." <lb/> They came like a crowd of children bawling
                                          and <lb/> crying to the Newfoundland government to save
                                          <lb/> them from bankruptcy. That is what happened. <lb/>
                                          So on December 31 at midnight, 1931, New<lb break="no"/>foundland went off the gold standard. The whole <lb/>
                                          commercial structure of this country would have <lb/> been
                                          down. The banks would have had to close <lb/> their doors.
                                          The merchants owed the banks a lot <lb/> of money. There
                                          was nothing else left but to go <lb/> off the gold
                                          standard. That was the position in <lb/> 1931. Now, 16
                                          years later, I am accused indirect<lb break="no"/>ly of
                                          cooking up this report on the grounds that <lb/> in 1931 I
                                          forecast a false budget. That is the <lb/> position and I
                                          am not taking it. I think I have <lb/> shown to the
                                          satisfaction of this house how that <lb/> $35 million was
                                          made up. I make this com<lb break="no"/>parison; the
                                          difference in my figures, one way or <lb/> another, on the
                                          short or on the long side, would <lb/> not be sufficient
                                          to stage a good cocktail party in <lb/> St. John's East or
                                          a beer-guzzling party in St. <lb/> John's West. Here is
                                          the statement given by the <lb/> Finance Department. I
                                          think this Convention as <lb/> it is today is not of the
                                          opinion that this Economic <lb/> Report, compiled in four
                                          days, was deliberately <lb/> cooked up or is false or
                                          dishonest; or that any <lb/> gentlemen on that Committee
                                          is dishonest. <lb/>

                                          evening. I am glad Mr. MacDonald <lb/>brought it up,

<p>
     We are prolonging the whole Convention, 
     <lb/>
     deliberately prolonging it. It is about time we got 
     <lb/>
     down and did some work. When we started, we 
     <lb/>
     made mistakes. I am here today steering this 
     <lb/>
     through the committee; we should not be doing 
     <lb/>
     it, it is a report, not a piece of legislation. It is a 
     <lb/>
     waste of time, right from the beginning. When 
     <lb/>
     reports are made in this assembly, I take it these 
     <lb/>
     reports are solid. One report came in here, there 
     <lb/>
     were discrepancies in it and we have not heard 
     <lb/>
     anything about it since; hundreds of thousands 
     <lb/>
     lost to the government, dishonesty in some 
     <lb/>
     department. We were given a document to say 
     <lb/>
     "keep it mum" that is what it amounts to. There 
     <lb/>
     was supposed to be an inquiry. They are experts 
     <lb/>
     with the lime brush, covering up someone. I do 
     <lb/>
     not need to be covered up. Now as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I think I have made it clear to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     MacDonald the situation with regard to the $35 
     <lb/>
     million. I think I made it clear to the Convention. 
     <lb/>
     Is there any gentleman not clear on it?

                                          <lb/> there is a difference of $6 or 7 million in the

                                          surplus is supposed to be, and another figure <lb/> which
                                          he has just read from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening <lb/> Telegram</hi> showing what the

                                          <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I rise to a point of
                                          order. I pointed <lb/> out that the local surplus was $28
                                          million, ap<lb break="no"/>proximately. During that period
                                          we borrowed $7 <lb/> or $8 million which has to be added
                                          on to the cash <lb/> surplus. That makes $35 million. Now
                                          I am going <lb/> to get you some more money. The Auditor
                                          <lb/> General's Report, 1945-46 — Savings Bank <lb/>
                                          <cb/> surplus not included — $800,000; if we add <lb/>
                                          statement of the Liquor Department, another half <lb/>
                                          million; statement from Great Britain on Gander, <lb/> add
                                          half million. You will find from the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Public Health and Welfare that Great <lb/>
                                          Britain owes us, on account of pensions we have <lb/> been
                                          paying on her behalf, probably $500,000. <lb/> Add all
                                          that, that is $38 million or $39 million. <lb/> Take from
                                          that $3.2 million to redeem stocks <lb/> coming due in
                                          1950 or 1952, and which we were <lb/> told yesterday the
                                          Canadian government is going <lb/> to take by cutting out
                                          the word "not". Take that <lb/> off, and the difference
                                          either on one side or the <lb/> other would be very small.
                                          And the excuse given, <lb/> Mr. Chairman, was that they
                                          were being sent over <lb/> to England. They were not being
                                          sent over to <lb/> England. They were taken from our
                                          surplus every <lb/> year and this money was thrown in the
                                          heap, and <lb/> the Finance Department gave us the figures
                                          of <lb/> $34 million on December 31 1946, and we have
                                          <lb/> had a surplus of $3.5 million ever since. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's a rather long
                                          point of <lb/> order. I still don't know what the point of
                                          order <lb/> is. The comment I want to make is this: the
                                          <lb/> Economic Report makes a very simple and a very <lb/>
                                          plain statement, namely, that our surplus is $35 <lb/>
                                          million. There is no other explanation given. <lb/> We'll
                                          forget for the moment what the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening <lb/>

                                          into the <lb/> Department of Finance, suspecting, as I
                                          did, that <lb/> $35 million was not a correct statement of
                                          the <lb/> surplus. I asked them if they would tell me
                                          what, <lb/> in their belief, <hi rendition="simple:italic">in their belief</hi>, is the surplus of the <lb/>

                                          would tell me. I don't mind saying I saw Mr. <lb/>
                                          Marshall, the Secretary for Finance, and here's <lb/> what
                                          they told me: that as at March 31 last, March <lb/> 31,

                                          and a lot of <lb/> time would simply be saved if members

                                          toto <lb/> or in part is their God-given right, but in

                                          will <lb/> be placed before me, at which time you can

                                          <lb/> time again? We had better get on with the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the House. <lb/>

                                          Secretary for Finance told me officially on Satur<lb break="no"/>day past that our surplus is
                                          approximately $28 <lb/> million.... Would it be in order
                                          for me to move <lb/> that this Convention desires to
                                          ascertain officially <lb/> from the Commissioner for

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, this does not come <lb/>as any great
                                          surprise to me. This is not an attack <lb/>on me; not an
                                          attack on the Finance Committee; <lb/>it is an attack on
                                          the country, and I resent the <lb/>whole thing. There has
                                          been a brazen, brutal <lb/>attack on the economy of
                                          Newfoundland, and on <lb/>Newfoundland itself. As only one
                                                 New<lb break="no"/>foundlander I say right here now
                                          that in 1941-42 <lb/>and right up to 1945 when German
                                          submarines <lb/>were lurking outside this harbour, that
                                          she was in <lb/>no greater danger than she is at the
                                          present time. <lb/>I may say that I am not prepared to
                                          tolerate it any <lb/>more — there is a Quisling in this

                                          by one or two Quislings, because that's what I <lb/> must

                                          <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I thoroughly agree with
                                          Mr. Job in <lb/> every way that we will have to step up
                                          our dis<lb break="no"/>cussions here. I think it might be
                                          better for all of <lb/> us if, instead of having morning
                                          sessions, we <lb/> decided we would have night sessions
                                          every day <lb/> that the Convention is in session. I make
                                          the <lb/> motion that, beginning Monday, we have night
                                          <lb/> sessions on every day that we have a day session.
