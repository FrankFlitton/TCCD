     years 1920-34. I would look at the cash surplus, 
     <lb/>
     say $30 million. Never before has our country 
     <lb/>
     been in a position where she has been able to have 
     <lb/>
     a nest egg. I would look at the accumulated 
     <lb/>
     surplus and the sinking fund which is set aside, 
     <lb/>
     and I would be forced to conclude, as the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee did, that as far as finance is concerned 
     <lb/>
     we have much better conditions than we had in 
     <lb/>
     1934. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would say also government plant in the form 
     <lb/>
     of school buildings, public buildings, bait depots, 
     <lb/>
     wharves, hospitals, the demonstration farm, post<lb break="no"/>al telegraphs and the railway are in much better 
     <lb/>
     shape than they were in 1934, and the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture on them will not have to be as great. But we 
     <lb/>
     have also increased our permanent government 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. What are our chances of maintain<lb break="no"/>ing and increasing our services? In view of the 
     <lb/>
     betterment, as I see it, of our economy, stimulated 
     <lb/>
     by war but projected into the future, it is my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that we have a reasonable chance of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining and increasing these services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to ask Major Cashin if, in the 
     <lb/>
     process of compiling the Economic Report, he 
     <lb/>
     had recourse to the memorandum from the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, and the first page on the 
     <lb/>
     Reconstruction and Development Scheme? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin I remember the document. In com<lb break="no"/>piling the report I did not even look at it. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think any member of the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     looked at it. It was received in here and it showed 
     <lb/>
     a programme of reconstruction for the next num<lb break="no"/>ber of years and there it ended. We did not even 
     <lb/>
     debate it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt I am glad you did not. This scheme in 
     <lb/>
     all amounts to $60 million over the next ten years 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     — the government put in $26 million to be car<lb break="no"/>ried out over a period of three years, and it made 
     <lb/>
     a tentative programme for the next seven years; 
     <lb/>
     each of the next seven years would average 
     <lb/>
     $4,700,000. I do not want anyone to say we 
     <lb/>
     would have revenue enough to meet current ex<lb break="no"/>penditure over these ten years, and this much 
     <lb/>
     money over afterwards; but I would say that 
     <lb/>
     we would be able to meet our expenditure <lb break="no"/>balance our revenue and expenditure — and take 
     <lb/>
     care of something on behalf of reconstruction.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My point in bringing this up is to show that a 
     <lb/>
     party independent of the Finance Committee had 
     <lb/>
     the temerity to set down a plan for ten years. They 
     <lb/>
     have also done what I consider reasonable, and 
     <lb/>
     set a plan for three years. If you will refer to the 
     <lb/>
     estimates you will find in the first year they spent 
     <lb/>
     $10 million on reconstruction and they expect to 
     <lb/>
     spend next year $6.5 million, which is one of the 
     <lb/>
     years included in the Finance Committee's 
     <lb/>
     report. I do not want to be accused of having 
     <lb/>
     invoked the government programme to support 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee report in any way. But I 
     <lb/>
     do think it shows there is a reasonable expectancy 
     <lb/>
     in the years to come of meeting expenditures by 
     <lb/>
     the current revenues and providing something for 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to end up by saying that whatever 
     <lb/>
     your natural leanings, whether optimistic or pes<lb break="no"/>simistic, we have been down before; we are not 
     <lb/>
     very high now; we will probably be down again. 
     <lb/>
     When I was a boy my father used to say to me, 
     <lb/>
     "It is nothing against you to fall down flat, but to 
     <lb/>
     lie there, that is a disgrace". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
     the Convention adjourned]

     Report of the Finance Committee: Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </head>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, I made a few remarks 
     <lb/>
     some days ago with regard to this Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, but feel that I should supplement them 
     <lb/>
     with a few additional remarks.... First of all, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to say that the gloomy and pessimistic 
     <lb/>
     viewpoints so courageously and sincerely ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by Messrs. Starkes, Vincent and Banfield 
     <lb/>
     have had the effect of slightly checking, but by 
     <lb/>
     no means obliterating my own optimistic view of 
     <lb/>
     the future. The gentlemen named have been in 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     closer touch with conditions which are not so 
     <lb/>
     readily available to us city delegates. I believe, 
     <lb/>
     and certainly hope, that their pessimism is not 
     <lb/>
     justified. I can understand that the closer contact 
     <lb/>
     they have had with those unfortunate people, who 
     <lb/>
     have had a bad experience this year in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the fishery, has led them to adopt their 
     <lb/>
     defeatist attitude, but the actual all-round facts do 
     <lb/>
     not warrant the conclusions they have adopted. 
     <lb/>
     Their reference to lack of work in the woods, 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="767"

     which I did not expect, came to me as a check on 
     <lb/>
     excessive optimism. It is evident to me that the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report as presented is too optimistic, 
     <lb/>
     and I can only regard it as an excellent sample of 
     <lb/>
     a budget such as we might expect to come from 
     <lb/>
     an enthusiastic finance minister in a responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the remarks I made previously, I stated that 
     <lb/>
     I agreed in a general way —please note the words 
     <lb/>
     "in a general way" — with the concluding para<lb break="no"/>graphs of the report, by which I meant those 
     <lb/>
     reading as follows:  
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     (1) That Newfoundland is at present a 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting country based on sound 
     <lb/>
     economic factors; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) That all the evidence available to us 
     <lb/>
     indicates that this position of self-support 
     <lb/>
     will continue in the foreseeable future.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I dislike this word of "self—support", mainly 
     <lb/>
     because we have not been asked to say whether 
     <lb/>
     the country is or is not self-supporting, nor is it 
     <lb/>
     easy to understand the meaning of the term "self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting", an opinion I expressed in the short 
     <lb/>
     ten page economic report which I myself drafted. 
     <lb/>
     In order to place on record my difference of 
     <lb/>
     outlook, I would like to quote the concluding 
     <lb/>
     paragraphs of the short report referred to, which 
     <lb/>
     was rejected by the chairman of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin I rise to a point of order. It was not 
     <lb/>
     rejected by the chairman of the Finance Commit<lb break="no"/>tee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job Which I "thought" was rejected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I understand it was rejected by 
     <lb/>
     a majority of members. I understand there were 
     <lb/>
     two dissenting members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job I must confess frankly that the Major, 
     <lb/>
     as chairman of the Committee, stated the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee would not introduce the report. If that is 
     <lb/>
     not a rejection, I do not know what it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin While I was in the chair, I was only 
     <lb/>
     one member — there were nine others. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job You were voicing the opinions of the 
     <lb/>
     others. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin That means the others agreed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job They agreed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Apparently the ideas incor<lb break="no"/>porated in your report were not acceptable to the 
     <lb/>
     majority of members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman The ideas were acceptable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Mr. Job The ideas were acceptable, but the 
     <lb/>
     report was not. It was considered to be insuffi<lb break="no"/>cient, I suppose. These paragraphs, which as you 
     <lb/>
     will see were only conditionally optimistic, read 
     <lb/>
     as follows: 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Your Committee feels that 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (1) Although the economy of New<lb break="no"/>foundland has not changed from being an 
     <lb/>
     export economy, it has gained considerable 
     <lb/>
     strength since 1934 by diversification, and 
     <lb/>
     there can be no possible doubt that at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, Newfoundland's finances and 
     <lb/>
     the earnings of the people are in a healthy 
     <lb/>
     economic condition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) There is good reason to believe that in 
     <lb/>
     the foreseeable future, except temporarily 
     <lb/>
     through a re-adjustment period, satisfactory 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I would like to make a short reference to the 
     <lb/>
     speech made recently by the member for 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista East, in which he voiced a very 
     <lb/>
     defeatist attitude towards the proposal to ap<lb break="no"/>proach the USA in an attempt to secure some 
     <lb/>
     special tariff privileges. I consider my opinion on 
     <lb/>
     this subject, which I have voiced on several oc<lb break="no"/>casions, is at least as good as his, and on some 
     <lb/>
     future occasion... I hope to discuss this matter at 
     <lb/>
     greater length, and to be able to produce some 
     <lb/>
     evidence to show that if we can get down to a 
     <lb/>
     round table conference there is some chance of 
     <lb/>
     arriving at some useful conclusion which might 
     <lb/>
     be of lasting benefit to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to wind up these remarks by 
     <lb/>
     suggesting to all pessimists and defeatists that 
     <lb/>
     they read very carefully the last annual report 
     <lb/>
     made by our distinguished and energetic fellow 
     <lb/>
     citizen, Mr. Gerald S. Doyle, which was publish<lb break="no"/>ed in our newspapers a few months ago. I con<lb break="no"/>sidered it, when I read it, an excellent tonic and 
     <lb/>
     cure for pessimism, and it deals with facts from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Doyle's personal experience and close con<lb break="no"/>tacts all over the island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fowler ....I have studied the report and I 
     <lb/>
     submit that it is as honest and fair a picture of the 
     <lb/>
     situation as can reasonably be expected under the 
     <lb/>
     prevailing circumstances. I feel that the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen responsible for this report are honest 
     <lb/>
     men who have the best interests of this country at 
     <lb/>

     heart, and are not trying to fool the people as 
     <lb/>
     some would try to have us believe. Due to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that Major Cashin is chairman of this Committee, 
     <lb/>
     he is entrusted with the unenviable duty of steer<lb break="no"/>ing the report through the committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole. This, I feel, tends to leave the impression 
     <lb/>
     that it is his report — in fact I have heard it 
     <lb/>
     referred to as such. They seem to forget that this 
     <lb/>
     report is submitted over the signatures of seven 
     <lb/>
     other gentlemen in addition to Mr. Cashin.... 
     <lb/>
     Now, regardless of to what extent any of these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen contributed to the report individually, 
     <lb/>
     it is the result of their collective effort and repre<lb break="no"/>sents the considered opinion of each and every 
     <lb/>
     one of them. I realise that their judgement is not 
     <lb/>
     infallible; that their estimates may not, in all 
     <lb/>
     cases, be accurate; but I submit that if they have 
     <lb/>
     erred at all, the error is on the conservative side. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard this report criticised, even 
     <lb/>
     ridiculed in this House — this, gentlemen, is the 
     <lb/>
     easiest thing in the world to do, and no doubt this 
     <lb/>
     is why some delegates indulge in it so frequently. 
     <lb/>
     But do they offer any alternative? No! They just 
     <lb/>
     seek to destroy the significance of this report for 
     <lb/>
     their own selfish purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Point of order. He says this 
     <lb/>
     report has been criticised, even ridiculed in this 
     <lb/>
     House and that those who are doing so seek to 
     <lb/>
     destroy the significance of the report "for their 
     <lb/>
     own selfish purposes". Now, that is pretty low. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman That is a conclusion. There 
     <lb/>seems to be widespread here, for some reason or 
     <lb/>other, the unfortunate element of dishonesty. I do 
     <lb/>not know why it should be here at all. Why cannot 
     <lb/>there be an honest disagreement on any question? 
     <lb/>If it is the right of one man to view something 
     <lb/>optimistically, then <hi rendition="simple:italic">a fortiori</hi> it is the right of any 
     <lb/>other individual to assume the contrary point of 
     <lb/>view. As far as I am concerned, Major Cashin and 
     <lb/>the members of that Committee, all members 
     <lb/>inside or outside the Convention, as far as I am 
     <lb/>concerned, are honest men.... Remember that 
     <lb/>criticism is a very natural thing. It may be 
     <lb/>favourable or unfavourable, it may be construc<lb break="no"/>tive or destructive; but I wish members would 
     <lb/>refrain from imputing dishonesty or ulterior mo<lb break="no"/>tives simply because they find themselves in 
     <lb/>disagreement with opinions expressed by other 
     <lb/>members of the Convention. I do not feel you are 
     <lb/>justified in drawing that conclusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Does that apply equally to men who 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     say a certain report is not an honest report? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman In my decision, there is no mid<lb break="no"/>way position, I particularly stated, between right 
     <lb/>
     and wrong. As far as I am concerned, it is not right 
     <lb/>
     and it is not proper for any member to impute 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty to any other member simply by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that that member happens to express 
     <lb/>
     some opinions on a subject which are not univer<lb break="no"/>sally shared by other members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman I think a lawyer can fool some of 
     <lb/>
     us and can get away with some disgusting 
     <lb/>
     propaganda. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman My ruling is not open to ques<lb break="no"/>tion or debate. Kindly resume your seat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fowler I respect your ruling. I did not im<lb break="no"/>pute dishonesty; I remarked it did appear that way 
     <lb/>
     in some cases. I contend that if any person or 
     <lb/>
     group of persons sees fit to destroy something, 
     <lb/>
     they should be prepared to produce something 
     <lb/>
     better in place of it. I doubt very much their 
     <lb/>
     ability to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I do not accept this report as a guarantee, 
     <lb/>
     but I do accept it as a reasonable picture of our 
     <lb/>
     present position, and a reasonable estimate of 
     <lb/>
     what things are likely to be in the foreseeable 
     <lb/>
     future. The Committee gave us a good review of 
     <lb/>
     our industries and their future possibilities. They 
     <lb/>
     tell us that the industries dependent on our forests 
     <lb/>
     are expanding and that their products are assured 
     <lb/>
     of a steady market. Our mining industries are in 
     <lb/>
     full production and further development is even 
     <lb/>
     now under way. That the great wealth of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador will be developed in the not far distant 
     <lb/>
     future is common knowledge. We know that the 
     <lb/>
     timber resources and water-power of that vast 
     <lb/>
     northern dependency are sources of potential 
     <lb/>
     wealth which cannot be overlooked. I think that 
     <lb/>
     our tourist industry is capable of big development 
     <lb/>
     and that, given the necessary encouragement and 
     <lb/>
     assistance, may well become one of our chief 
     <lb/>
     sources of revenue. Our fisheries cannot be 
     <lb/>
     judged by the result of any one branch of that 
     <lb/>
     industry in any one season. We must take an 
     <lb/>
     overall view of the whole industry and if we do, 
     <lb/>
     we must admit that the fishing industry, as a 
     <lb/>
     whole, is on a sounder economic basis than ever 
     <lb/>
     before. It is more diversified. We are not so 
     <lb/>
     dependent on salt cod as we were in the past.... It 
     <lb/>
     is true that the Labrador fishery has not been good 
     <lb/>
     for the past couple of years, and this is indeed 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate for the men engaged. Had they 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="769"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-18_Page_0769.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">769</fw>
         
     secured average voyages, they would have fared 
     <lb/>
     well with prices ranging from $10.25 to $11.25 
     <lb/>
     per quintal according to the grade. Those who 
     <lb/>
     were fortunate enough to secure a fair voyage had 
     <lb/>
     little cause to complain. I am not prepared to hold 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee responsible for the failure 
     <lb/>
     of this branch of the fishery. It is, in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     prosecuted on an uneconomic basis, to say the 
     <lb/>
     least. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I accept the conclusions of the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee as being fair and honest, 
     <lb/>
     based on sound judgement, good knowledge and 
     <lb/>
     experience. The critics say it is too optimistic. I 
     <lb/>
     do not subscribe to that belief. What right have 
     <lb/>
     we to instill fear and pessimism in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     the people? The order of the day is "nothing for 
     <lb/>
     nothing", and we should face the future with 
     <lb/>
     optimistic determination. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman I have listened for the past eight 
     <lb/>
     or nine days to the arguments pro and con regard<lb break="no"/>ing the Economic Report. First of all, I want to 
     <lb/>
     put myself on record as agreeing with it. The 
     <lb/>
     people who made up this report are good New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, out to try and do the best they can 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland. They have no crystal balls to 
     <lb/>
     peer into the foreseeable future, as the term has 
     <lb/>
     been bandied around here. In fact there is only 
     <lb/>
     one country today which possesses that crystal 
     <lb/>
     ball, and that is Russia. In Russia today they know 
     <lb/>
     what they are going to do for the next five years. 
     <lb/>
     I know something about communism. I do not 
     <lb/>
     agree with it. I believe in democracy, but I do not 
     <lb/>
     think democracy should be put on the spot just 
     <lb/>
     because democracy cannot foresee what is going 
     <lb/>
     to happen in the next year or two. I heard some 
     <lb/>
     of the critics of this Economic Report refer to our 
     <lb/>
     finance ministers of the past and their budgets. In 
     <lb/>
     1929 I saw people fall out of windows on one of 
     <lb/>
     the richest streets in the world, in one of the 
     <lb/>
     richest countries, because of false forecasts.... I 
     <lb/>
     had to walk with 14 million of my brothers in the 
     <lb/>
     richest country in the world, looking for work. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I want to be very brief. I have no 
     <lb/>
     wish whatever to retard the session. I want to get 
     <lb/>
     it over with. I am fed up with so much of what 
     <lb/>
     has been said here. There has been a lot of hot air. 
     <lb/>
     Let us get down to facts. I believe that New<lb break="no"/>foundland is self-supporting. I will go further and 
     <lb/>
     make the belief stronger, and say that right here 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention there are men who are satis<lb break="no"/>fied to put their money into Newfoundland. They 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     have faith in Newfoundland, then why should not 
     <lb/>
     we? 1 think that as regards our own economy, it 
     <lb/>
     is based on a false foundation. I am sure it can be 
     <lb/>
     changed. I have to agree with the member from 
     <lb/>
     White Bay — there has to be a reorganisation, if 
     <lb/>
     you like, of our whole economy. I have faith that 
     <lb/>
     the people who employ labour today in New<lb break="no"/>foundland are satisfied to do so. In other words, 
     <lb/>
     I have faith in labour, in the employer and in all 
     <lb/>
     our people, and I am sure we can make New<lb break="no"/>foundland a much better place to live in than it 
     <lb/>
     was in the past.... I will tell you that there are 
     <lb/>
     42,000 people in Newfoundland today who are 
     <lb/>
     thinking out their problems. I believe in respon<lb break="no"/>sible government and I believe these people want 
     <lb/>
     it. And I believe... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman You are out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman I believe in our economy, our 
     <lb/>
     people, and I will be a Newfoundlander as long 
     <lb/>
     as I draw breath. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Just one or two remarks relative to 
     <lb/>
     something said here yesterday. There was one 
     <lb/>
     thing said by Mr. Bradley in speaking on the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report, he said, "We are not here to 
     <lb/>
     espouse any particular cause". I thought we were 
     <lb/>
     here to espouse the cause of Newfoundland. We 
     <lb/>
     have heard it from Mr. Bradley, we are not here 
     <lb/>
     to espouse any particular cause. I would ask 
     <lb/>
     members of the Convention to note that. Whether 
     <lb/>
     he was referring to any particular form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment or the welfare of the people, I know not. 
     <lb/>
     But, according to Mr. Bradley, you must not 
     <lb/>
     espouse any particular cause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then in his analysis of the figures brought in 
     <lb/>
     by the Finance Committee, he did not elect to take 
     <lb/>
     1897-1947. He thought it would not be fair to take 
     <lb/>
     in six years of war when Newfoundland enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     this false economy. So he put it back seven years, 
     <lb/>
     1890-1939, and by so doing, instead of working 
     <lb/>
     out a surplus as the Finance Committee had done 
     <lb/>
     over that period of years, of $20 million ... by 
     <lb/>
     some manipulation or juggling he made out that 
     <lb/>
     this country had a deficit of $20 million. There 
     <lb/>
     was one particular statement which I expected 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley to say, but which for some reason he 
     <lb/>
     did not say. (I wish Mr. Bradley was here today, 
     <lb/>
     I don't want to say anything behind anybody's 
     <lb/>
     back.) He did not elect to say anything what<lb break="no"/>soever about a little war fought between 1914 and 
     <lb/>
     l9l8, which war, up to the present time, has cost 
     <lb/>
     this country up to $40-50 million. It would have 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="770"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-18_Page_0770.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">770</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          
     been very nice if Mr. Bradley had drawn our 
     <lb/>
     attention to that fact. I presume everybody in this 
     <lb/>
     country knew there was a war in those years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One other statement in reference to the bases. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bradley said, "The base agreement was 
     <lb/>
     signed under no compulsion whatsoever". In the 
     <lb/>
     first place I would like to point out that the base 
     <lb/>
     agreement was signed before the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland knew anything whatsoever about it. 
     <lb/>
     And we have been informed by people who were 
     <lb/>
     very close to things in those days, that when a 
     <lb/>
     couple of our Commissioners, very patriotically 
     <lb/>
     I thought, objected to signing these agreements 
     <lb/>
     on the grounds that something should have been 
     <lb/>
     put into it having reference to a future date when 
     <lb/>
     they might be considered, they were bluntly told 
     <lb/>
     by the Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill that he would 
     <lb/>
     have none of it — sign on the dotted line, or else. 
     <lb/>
     If that is not compulsion, I don't know what else 
     <lb/>
     to call it. More than that, they were signed 
     <lb/>
     without any reference at all to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country. I just wanted to draw these facts to your 
     <lb/>
     attention, Mr. Chairman, I don't want them to go 
     <lb/>
     undisputed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bradley gave an excellent address yester<lb break="no"/>day, delivered in a masterly style for which he is 
     <lb/>
     well noted. I am not trying to make any defama<lb break="no"/>tion of his speech, but I wish to draw your atten<lb break="no"/>tion to these little things, which may be very 
     <lb/>
     important to the future of our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our friend, the Rev. Burry of the Labrador; 
     <lb/>
     with all due respect, I think he is more or less 
     <lb/>
     what we call half and half, or as we say in 
     <lb/>
     London, "an and awf'. He is half in favour of 
     <lb/>
     the report and he is half against it. He did say this 
     <lb/>
     though, and I got it down: "Those people who 
     <lb/>
     drew up this report and agreed with it, were not 
     <lb/>
     treating the people in a fair way". Now that 
     <lb/>
     compares so closely to a statement which has 
     <lb/>
     been made here before, that it was not an honest 
     <lb/>
     report, that I have, sir, to draw your attention to 
     <lb/>
     that also. "The people who drew up that report 
     <lb/>
     gave such a rosy picture that they were not treat<lb break="no"/>ing the people of this country in a fair way." Now 
     <lb/>
     whether Mr. Burry meant to put it in that way or 
     <lb/>
     not I don't know, but that's exactly as he put it, 
     <lb/>
     and then he did go on to the homes in his own 
     <lb/>
     district, in Labrador. He deplored the fact that 
     <lb/>
     everybody on the Labrador has not got a Chester<lb break="no"/>field instead of a home-made bench to sit or lie 
     <lb/>
     on. I think I ought to draw your attention to that 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     because these chesterfields come after many, 
     <lb/>
     many years of civilisation, and when they do 
     <lb/>
     come I don't know that they add very much to the 
     <lb/>
     economy, or peace and happiness of the people 
     <lb/>
     who possess them. That is in the offing I thought, 
     <lb/>
     as far as Newfoundland is concerned, and as far 
     <lb/>
     as Labrador is concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He did speak about unemployment insurance 
     <lb/>
     also, and I would like to point out that that un<lb break="no"/>employment insurance, as I understand it in a 
     <lb/>
     neighbouring country, does not touch the fisher<lb break="no"/>men; so that if we are going to have unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment insurance in this country, get something 
     <lb/>
     which is going to be of some help to the fisher<lb break="no"/>men. I grant you that our fishermen have always 
     <lb/>
     had a pretty rough time of it, but they were always 
     <lb/>
     honest and rugged, and any time when a call 
     <lb/>
     came to fight for our King and country, they were 
     <lb/>
     the first to enlist. So the hardships and battles of 
     <lb/>
     life did not prevent them from being patriotic 
     <lb/>
     when it came to the point of defending that which 
     <lb/>
     they do enjoy, be it rough and tumble, be it 
     <lb/>
     sometimes hunger or whatnot. They did not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate at the call to arms, and they did not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate when it came ... to lay down their lives.... 
     <lb/>
     So I do not think that even the rough times that 
     <lb/>
     our people had, have in any way undermined 
     <lb/>
     their moral attitude towards life and Christianity, 
     <lb/>
     and that is much better, much greater than having 
     <lb/>
     a chesterfield in your front room.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I refer you to a statement made by Mr. Ban<lb break="no"/>field yesterday, in which he referred to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Fortune Bay. I know a good many people from 
     <lb/>
     Fortune Bay, and I know you have not any better 
     <lb/>
     fishermen in this country than in Fortune Bay, 
     <lb/>
     and that nine times out of ten they make a good 
     <lb/>
     voyage, and a pretty good living. I am not saying 
     <lb/>
     all of them. In such a precarious trade as the 
     <lb/>
     fishery there have to be some failures. There have 
     <lb/>
     to be men who get sick during the voyage, and 
     <lb/>
     men who don't seem to run into the fish — even 
     <lb/>
     neighbours. They make trip after trip and don't 
     <lb/>
     strike the fish on the Grand Banks, but when they 
     <lb/>
     do they know how to catch it. And the Fortune 
     <lb/>
     Bay fishermen are some of the best we have. All 
     <lb/>
     right, they have poor years, but is there any 
     <lb/>
     reason why, in considering the future of this 
     <lb/>
     country and the general aspect of the economy, 
     <lb/>
     we should bring up isolated cases of this nature, 
     <lb/>
     and try to tell the rest of our people that this is a 
     <lb/>
     pretty rotten country to live in? I tell you it is 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="771"

            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">771</fw>
           
     highly unfair to the intelligence of our people to 
     <lb/>
     bring up these matters. Everybody knows that in 
     <lb/>
     this country, as in every other country, there are 
     <lb/>
     people out of work. I am told that last fall in the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime provinces there were 30,000 people out 
     <lb/>
     of work. They had some work in Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and as a result 3,000 workers in the 
     <lb/>
     Maritimes had to migrate to Quebec to get work. 
     <lb/>
     You have it there, in the USA, in Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     and all over the world. Let us look at the general 
     <lb/>
     aspect and not pick out a few isolated cases. It is 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate that we have those isolated cases, but 
     <lb/>
     you will have them under whatever form of 
     <lb/>
     government you have to rule this country. You 
     <lb/>
     are bound to have them. If the Finance Commit<lb break="no"/>tee were unfair in painting what has been called 
     <lb/>
     too rosy a picture of our economy, if they were 
     <lb/>
     not honest in that, does that smack more of 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty than getting up and picking out a few 
     <lb/>
     isolated cases, and holding them up to our people, 
     <lb/>
     and trying to persuade them that this country is 
     <lb/>
     rotten at heart? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That's all I have to say, Mr. Chairman. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin and his Finance Committee have done a 
     <lb/>
     good job. The things that were not in the report 
     <lb/>
     they left to the imagination of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     They did not think they were talking to a crowd 
     <lb/>
     of children. Everybody knows about these iso<lb break="no"/>lated cases, and it is much more dishonest to bring 
     <lb/>
     in isolated cases, and try to convince our people 
     <lb/>
     that all is not right with the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I wish members would clearly 
     <lb/>
     remember that I am not going to permit imputa<lb break="no"/>tions of dishonesty towards the Finance Commit<lb break="no"/>tee, any member of the Finance Committee, or 
     <lb/>
     any member of this House.... I can express no 
     <lb/>
     opinion on the merits or demerits of the report, 
     <lb/>
     but in fairness to the compilers, I have to say that 
     <lb/>
     it certainly represents an honest to goodness en<lb break="no"/>deavour on their part to present the potentialities 
     <lb/>
     of this country as they see them, and the fact that 
     <lb/>
     their conclusions may not be universally agreed 
     <lb/>
     to by no means lays the foundation for the allega<lb break="no"/>tion that they were dishonest in the discharge of 
     <lb/>
     what may fairly be regarded as a very onerous 
     <lb/>
     duty, to say the least. I hope that I will hear no 
     <lb/>
     more suggestions of dishonesty, or imputations 
     <lb/>
     of dishonesty.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry Mr. Chairman, I just want to make 
     <lb/>
     one short comment in reply to Mr. Hollett. I don't 
     <lb/>
     see by what stretch of his imagination he could 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     charge me with even thinking that the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee was dishonest....  I think Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     and his Finance Committee did that work with all 
     <lb/>
     honesty, sincerity and patriotism. I give them that 
     <lb/>
     credit, and I only hope that they can give me the 
     <lb/>
     credit of being honest, sincere and patriotic in my 
     <lb/>
     criticism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I said last night 
     <lb/>
     that I had no intention of making any further 
     <lb/>
     contribution to this debate, and I don't intend to 
     <lb/>
     make a speech now. There are just two points 
     <lb/>
     made by Mr. Hollett in comment on the speech 
     <lb/>
     delivered here yesterday by Mr. Bradley, upon 
     <lb/>
     which I would like to offer my own interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion. Mr. Hollett referred to the fact that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley took a period of 50 years of the 
     <lb/>
     government's history, beginning 1890 and en<lb break="no"/>ding 1939, leaving the war, this late war, out of 
     <lb/>
     the picture altogether. Surely it was clear to 
     <lb/>
     everyone who heard that speech that Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>
     did that for a purpose, that he named his purpose, 
     <lb/>
     he described his purpose; he was examining the 
     <lb/>
     contention of the Economic Report that our 
     <lb/>
     present revenues are due to anything but the war. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman As a matter of fact, on that point 
     <lb/>Mr. Miller rose to a point of order and I ruled on 
     <lb/>it, and said that it was obvious that he was setting 
     <lb/>out to prove that very thing, or trying to prove it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Yes, he pointed out how the 
     <lb/>Economic Report was claiming that our swollen 
     <lb/>revenues are due to anything but the war.... That 
     <lb/>was the whole point he was making, to show that 
     <lb/>the report was wrong in its conclusion, he giving 
     <lb/>his conclusion that the war did swell these 
     <lb/>revenues. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would not be attempting, Mr. Chairman, to 
     <lb/>
     make any comment whatever on Mr. Bradley's 
     <lb/>
     speech if it were not for the fact that he is not here. 
     <lb/>
     He had not been out of doors for two weeks when 
     <lb/>
     he came here yesterday. He came here, delivered 
     <lb/>
     his speech and went back immediately to his 
     <lb/>
     room and had to change every stitch of clothing 
     <lb/>
     — he was soaking wet. He is not at all well.... Just 
     <lb/>
     this point about the government in 1941 signing 
     <lb/>
     the bases agreement with the United States 
     <lb/>
     government. Mr. Bradley said they had not done 
     <lb/>
     it under compulsion. I remember that he did say 
     <lb/>
     that, and I remember also that I got this impres<lb break="no"/>sion from what he said: that it was not under the 
     <lb/>
     compulsion of the United States government, and 
     <lb/>
     I agree with him completely. The Government of 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="772"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-18_Page_0772.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">772</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          
     the United States did not compel Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     to sign that bases agreement. That is all I want to 
     <lb/>
     say in comment on what Mr. Hollett said. But a 
     <lb/>
     few days ago I gave notice of two questions to 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency the Governor in Commission. 
     <lb/>
     The replies have just arrived, and have been 
     <lb/>
     placed on my desk by the Secretary. 
     <lb/>
   </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman Do they have any bearing on 
     <lb/>this? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Oh entirely, sir. If you remem<lb break="no"/>ber, I gave notice on Thursday past that I would 
     <lb/>ask His Excellency the Governor in Commission 
     <lb/>to furnish the Convention with a statement show<lb break="no"/>ing the amount of the accumulated cash surplus 
     <lb/>of the Government of Newfoundland, up to 31 
     <lb/>March, 1947. You will remember my reason for 
     <lb/>asking that question. Mr. MacDonald from 
     <lb/>Grand Falls drew the attention of Major Cashin 
     <lb/>to the fact that whereas in the Economic Report 
     <lb/>it was stated that our surplus is $35 million, there 
     <lb/>were other statements appearing in print saying 
     <lb/>that the surplus was $28 million. Major Cashin 
     <lb/>explained why he put the figure in the report, or 
     <lb/>why his Committee put it in the report, at $35 
     <lb/>million. He hoped that the house was satisfied 
     <lb/>with his explanation. Apparently it was, with one 
     <lb/>exception. I was not satisfied, and I said so. I 
     <lb/>therefore gave that notice of question to the 
     <lb/>Governor in Commission, to ask what is the 
     <lb/>amount. Is it $35 million? Is it $28 million? Or 
     <lb/>what is it? Here is the reply, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman May I see it first? I am not 
     <lb/>questioning that, but is there a covering letter? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Yes sir, there is a covering let<lb break="no"/>ter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman This is in reply to the question 
     <lb/>forwarded on my instructions under rule 39, by 
     <lb/>letter of November 15 to the Secretary of 
     <lb/>Finance. All right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood I will now read from the reply: 
     <lb/>The accumulated surplus revenue at 31 
     <lb/>March, 1947, was $28,645,800, distributed as 
     <lb/>follows:<ref target="#fn_02">*</ref> 
     <lb/>That is cash at St. John's, and cash at the Crown 
     <lb/>Agents invested in sterling securities, pro<lb break="no"/>visionally earmarked for the redemption in 1950- 
     <lb break="yes"/>52 of sterling debt amounting to $3,200,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Loaned free of interest to His Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government in the United Kingdom, 
     <lb/>
     $7,300,000. Advances to finance dollar ex<lb break="no"/>penditure by His Majesty's Government in 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom, $200,000: a total of 
     <lb/>
     $28,600,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And then there are two notes, Mr. Chairman: 
     <lb/></p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Note No. 1:</hi> The figure of $28,789,000 given 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     audited figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     The second note has to do with the loan free of 
     <lb/>
    interest to His Majesty's Government in the 
     <lb/>United Kingdom, that is $7.3 million dollars. The 
     <lb/>note on that reads: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     I asked, you may recall, for the figures for the 31 
     <lb/>
     March last, and also for the 31 December last, and 
     <lb/>
     their reply is that the figures for 31 December are 
     <lb/>
     not available. I don't know if Major Cashin has 
     <lb/>
     had a copy of this sent him or not. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Cashin No, I don't need it. I don't require 
     <lb/>them, I know all about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood The accumulated surplus at 31 
     <lb/>March was $28,645,800. Now the sinking fund. 
     <lb/>I was rather shocked by the statement of Major 
     <lb/>Cashin that Newfoundland has been plundered of 
     <lb/>an amount of $1,750,000 on our sinking fund. If 
     <lb/>that can be shown to be true, the persons respon<lb break="no"/>sible must go to gaol. If anyone has plundered 
     <lb/>Newfoundland of $1,750,000, the guilty parties 
     <lb/>should go to gaol or there is no justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Cashin I agree with you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood So being shocked and surprised 
     <lb/>by that rather startling statement I gave notice of 
     <lb/>another question to His Excellency the Governor 
     <lb/>in Commission, to give us an account of the 
     <lb/>creation, nature and operation of the sinking fund 
     <lb/>against the guaranteed stock, that is against our 
     <lb/>sterling debt, the debt that is guaranteed by the 
     <lb/>mother country. The answer reads as follows:

     Mr. Chairman What did they mean there, "for 
     <lb/>
     redemption"? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood No sir, it does not mean that. I 
     <lb/>will explain in a moment. None of the stock has 
     <lb/>been redeemed. Under the covering statute, in<lb break="no"/>come arising from the income of the stock is held 
     <lb/>by the trustees. This has been applied in purchase 
     <lb/>of the stock. The total nominal amount of stock 
     <lb/>held by the trustees at 30 September, 1947, was, 
     <lb/>in sterling, £2,071,477. At $4.04 to the dollar that 
     <lb/>is $8,368,000. That last figure is not my own 
     <lb/>computation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to say a word or two about that 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund. To begin with I want to say this: 
     <lb/>
     that in all the many years that we had a govern<lb break="no"/><cb/>ment in this country down to 1934, we borrowed 
     <lb/>
     many millions of dollars, but in all those years 
     <lb/>
     such a thing as a sinking fund, judging by their 
     <lb/>
     actions at least, never entered the minds of any of 
     <lb/>
     our governments. They just borrowed year after 
     <lb/>
     year, hoping that when each of the loans was gone 
     <lb/>
     through, either there would be a windfall or a 
     <lb/>
     stroke of luck, or else that they could go out on 
     <lb/>
     the market and borrow more to pay off the old 
     <lb/>
     loan as it came due; but there was no sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund. The first sinking fund was established in 
     <lb/>
     1933 by law, and came into operation, as this 
     <lb/>
     reply tells us, in 1938. Now the idea, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it, of a sinking fund is this: if a government 
     <lb/>
     goes out and borrows $5 million or $10 million, 
     <lb/>
     or any amount, for 20 years, or 25, or 30, or 50 
     <lb/>
     years, they have to pay interest on that loan every 
     <lb/>
     year until it matures. But when it matures there 
     <lb/>
     should be some other money accumulated, saved 
     <lb/>
     up, in a pot or a sinking fund, to meet the loan 
     <lb/>
     when it comes due. If not all of it, then as much 
     <lb/>
     of it as is humanly possible. If you have 20 years 
     <lb/>
     to go, then in that 20 years pour into your sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund as much as you can scrape together, so that 
     <lb/>
     when the 20 years are up and the loan falls due, 
     <lb/>
     you will have something saved up to pay on your 
     <lb/>
     principal. And so in 1938 a debt of some £70 or 
     <lb/>
     £80 million sterling, held in England, was 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed by the government's own sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund. The loan comes due in 1963. New<lb break="no"/>foundland has got to pay off that loan in 1963; 
     <lb/>
     she has to go out on the market and buy more 
     <lb/>
     money to pay off the old money, or she has to 
     <lb/>
     have a sinking fund. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, when you come to create 
     <lb/>
     a sinking fund there are two ways to do it. You 
     <lb/>
     can set aside so much a year, say 2%, or 5% of 
     <lb/>
     the principal, and every year you will pay it to the 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund.... What they did in this case was 
     <lb/>
     make it 1%. But 1% from 1948 to 1963 when the 
     <lb/>
     loan would fall due would be what?.... You pay 
     <lb/>
     1% into the sinking fund every year for 20 years, 
     <lb/>
     from 1938 to 1963, and all you have saved up in 
     <lb/>
     our sinking fund to go against your debt when it 
     <lb/>
     falls due is 25%, and there is 75% left. So here is 
     <lb/>
     what they did. They appointed these trustees — <lb/> one man from the Bank of England, one man 
     <lb/>
     from the British Treasury, one man from the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office. They are a board of trustees, 
     <lb/>
     representing whom? Representing the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland and the bondholders, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="774"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-18_Page_0774.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">774</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          
     trustees for both, and their job is to administer 
     <lb/>
     that sinking fund. What they do is this: the 
     <lb/>
     government pays the 1% — £178,000 sterling — <lb/> into the sinking fund. The trustees take that 
     <lb/>
     £178,000 and they go out on the market and go 
     <lb/>
     to John Jones and Thomas Smith or John Brown 
     <lb/>
     in England. John Smith is a man who has a 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland bond. He owns that bond, he has 
     <lb/>
     paid for it, but he now wants to turn that bond into 
     <lb/>
     cash — he wants to sell it, so the trustees buy the 
     <lb/>
     bond from him, and they buy all the bonds they 
     <lb/>
     can get every year, up to the value of over 
     <lb/>
     $750,000, up to £178,000 sterling. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, when the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     pays the trustees that 1% every year into the 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund, the trustees use the money to buy 
     <lb/>
     those very bonds. Now when they buy them, they 
     <lb/>
     own them, and the position today is that the 
     <lb/>
     trustees have bought year after year more and 
     <lb/>
     more of our Newfoundland bonds. But these 
     <lb/>
     bonds were not cancelled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman That was what I was asking you 
     <lb/>
     about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Yes, sir. They were never can<lb break="no"/>celled. They are not going to be cancelled until 
     <lb/>
     1963, when they will all be cancelled. They will 
     <lb/>
     all be cancelled then, but until then the trustees 
     <lb/>
     every year take that 1% and use it to buy New<lb break="no"/>foundland bonds in England from anyone who 
     <lb/>
     wants to sell them.... Every year when the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government pays interest on that £17 
     <lb/>
     million sterling of our guaranteed stock, the in<lb break="no"/>terest goes to the bondholders. Who are the 
     <lb/>
     bondholders? No. 1, all the public of England 
     <lb/>
     who happen to buy those bonds. No. 2, the trus<lb break="no"/>tees of the sinking fund. There are two classes of 
     <lb/>
     bondholders now — the public and the trustees 
     <lb/>
     of the sinking fund. The trustees receive their 
     <lb/>
     interest every year. What do they do with that 
     <lb/>
     interest? They don't put it in their own pockets. 
     <lb/>
     They use that interest to buy still more bonds. All 
     <lb/>
     that income from the sinking fund, whether it be 
     <lb/>
     the 1% they get from the government, or the 3% 
     <lb/>
     interest on those bonds that they buy, all that 
     <lb/>
     income goes to buy still more Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     bonds, so what is happening? What is happening 
     <lb/>
     is this: the sinking fund is growing every year. It 
     <lb/>
     is growing on the one hand, and on the other hand 
     <lb/>
     the number of public bondholders is falling year 
     <lb/>
     by year. Carry it on long enough, and finally our 
     <lb/>
     whole public debt would be owned by the trus<lb break="no"/><cb/>tees, because they will have bought it in from the 
     <lb/>
     public. Is that good for Newfoundland or bad? 
     <lb/>
     That is the crux of the matter.... I claim it is a good 
     <lb/>
     thing to build up a sinking fund as much as you 
     <lb/>
     can, and have so much saved up to meet the whole 
     <lb/>
     principal when it comes due in 1963. Let us say 
     <lb/>
     they could have adopted half a dozen other ways 
     <lb/>
     of handling that sinking fund. The question is not 
     <lb/>
     whether that the right way, the best way, the 
     <lb/>
     question is who is doing the plundering, and how 
     <lb/>
     is the plundering being done?.... I for one am 
     <lb/>
     heartily sick ... of hearing statements made that 
     <lb/>
     the government — whom I do not like — is 
     <lb/>
     plundering and looting when it is not true and 
     <lb/>
     cannot be proved. I challenge any man to prove 
     <lb/>
     to us ordinary, simple-minded Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     that the sinking fund of $1.75 million was 
     <lb/>
     plundered out of this country. I say now, on the 
     <lb/>
     authority of this document which is the official 
     <lb/>
     answer of the government, that every year since 
     <lb/>
     1938 the trustees of that fund have used that 
     <lb/>
     money to buy in Newfoundland bonds. The New<lb break="no"/>foundland government is paying interest on the 
     <lb/>
     bonds the same as they pay any other bondholder, 
     <lb/>
     and that interest is used by the trustees to buy still 
     <lb/>
     more bonds and pile up the sinking fund and 
     <lb/>
     make it grow as fast as possible, so when it comes 
     <lb/>
     due in 1963 they will have a good sizeable 
     <lb/>
     amount accumulated in the sinking fund to pay 
     <lb/>
     over. I say not one cent has been robbed. Not one 
     <lb/>
     cent has been plundered. The statement has been 
     <lb/>
     made that Newfoundland has been plundered of 
     <lb/>
     $1,730,000. It is a shocking statement.... If that 
     <lb/>
     kind of statement is allowed, and it has been 
     <lb/>
     going on for two years, you cannot blame the 
     <lb/>
     people for believing it, if it is not contradicted. 
     <lb/>
     There is as much truth in that accusation as 
     <lb/>
     there was in all the wild crazy statements that 
     <lb/>
     have been made in politics in the last 25 years 
     <lb/>
     about plundering, looting and graft. It is not made 
     <lb/>
     surely, without any sense of responsibility; surely 
     <lb/>
     not made in calm, reasoned tones or feelings, 
     <lb/>
     surely not. If Major Cashin can prove to us — he 
     <lb/>
     does not have to prove it, all he has to do is to 
     <lb/>
     give us a good case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I want to remind members that 
     <lb/>
     we are not sitting as a court of judicature. We are 
     <lb/>
     a fact-finding body. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I agree with your remark ... we 
     <lb/>
     are a fact-finding body. One of the facts is, has 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland been plundered of $1.75 million 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="775"

            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">775</fw>
            
     in our sinking fund? I say that statement is not 
     <lb/>
     true on the basis of the reply. Not a cent has been 
     <lb/>
     plundered, and in common fairness that state<lb break="no"/>ment must be proved or it must be retracted. We 
     <lb/>
     must draw a line somewhere with these charges 
     <lb/>
     of graft, of corruption and plundering. Talk of 
     <lb/>
     faith — how can we have faith if $1.75 million 
     <lb/>
     can be robbed and nothing done about it? Or if 
     <lb/>
     we can sit back and smile, as if the amount 
     <lb/>
     plundered is so much chickenfeed, and is so 
     <lb/>
     commonplace that we can afford to take it in our 
     <lb/>
     stride and forget about it? I am not going to forget 
     <lb/>
     about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman What steps can the Convention 
     <lb/>
     take in the matter? If there has been any sugges<lb break="no"/>tion of criminal libel, that is a matter of no con<lb break="no"/>cern to me or to the Convention. The person or 
     <lb/>
     persons who made it, if called upon to prove it or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, would have to go before a jury of 
     <lb/>
     peers. We are not sitting as a court of trial. I am 
     <lb/>
     Chairman of a fact-finding body. I wish all refer<lb break="no"/>ence to libel would be dropped, as there is no 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that we are going to try it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I am not suggesting legal ac<lb break="no"/>tion, I am suggesting this: Major Cashin made the 
     <lb/>
     statement in public session ... that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has been plundered of $1.75 million in our sink<lb break="no"/>ing fund — a most serious, grave, shocking state<lb break="no"/>ment, calculated if not disproved, if accepted as 
     <lb/>
     truth, to undermine all confidence and all faith in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Therefore what I suggest is either 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Cashin should proceed to prove his statement 
     <lb/>
     or withdraw it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I see absolutely no reason whatever 
     <lb/>
     for Major Cashin to prove his statement. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has not proven that Major Cashin was 
     <lb/>
     incorrect. He has not shown us how much of the 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund was spent in England to redeem or 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     buy up Newfoundland bonds. That document 
     <lb/>
     does not state that. Therefore he has not proven 
     <lb/>
     whether or not we lost money. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     has not proved that Major Cashin was wrong 
     <lb/>
     when he said we had lost $1.75 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Again I want to remind mem<lb break="no"/>bers that as far as I am concerned, so long as the 
     <lb/>
     proprieties of debate are observed, no member is 
     <lb/>
     going to be placed in a position where he has to 
     <lb/>
     defend his opinions. Major Cashin has expressed 
     <lb/>
     an opinion. If he chooses to defend that opinion, 
     <lb/>
     that is a matter for his discretion. Certainly as far 
     <lb/>
     as I am concerned, the question as to whether or 
     <lb/>
     not he proves it or disproves it is entirely up to 
     <lb/>
     himself. Again I want to say the proof of any 
     <lb/>
     statement made here, libellous or otherwise, is a 
     <lb/>
     matter with which I have no concern as a Chair<lb break="no"/>man of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Miller I wonder if each member will be 
     <lb/>
     supplied with a copy of the government's 
     <lb/>
     answer? I would much prefer to read it myself. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman I will have them tomorrow. I am 
     <lb/>assuming that Major Cashin will wind up the 
     <lb/>debate by dealing with questions directed to him 
     <lb/>during the course of the debate. Therefore ... I 
     <lb/>would like it to be understood that if no member 
     <lb/>occupies the floor, I will assume that no member 
     <lb/>desires to address himself further on the 
     <lb/>Economic Report. I will thereupon call upon 
     <lb/>Major Cashin to wind the matter up. If any mem<lb break="no"/>ber has anything to say on the Economic Report, 
     <lb/>I wish he would take the floor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin In view of the fact that there are 
     <lb/>
     several questions outstanding to which I have not 
     <lb/>
     received answers, I am not in a position to go 
     <lb/>
     ahead and finish this aftemoon....

     Mr. Higgins Before, sir, we go on to the busi<lb break="no"/>ness on the order paper today I would like to 
     <lb/>
     submit to you and the Convention, an idea that I 
     <lb/>
     think is well worth our consideration. As you 
     <lb/>
     know, representatives of this country have been 
     <lb/>
     attending a convention at Geneva for many 
     <lb/>
     months, and have made a report in recent days to 
     <lb/>
     the government through Mr. Howell, Secretary 
     <lb/>
     for Customs. I suggest it would be most important 
     <lb/>
     for the members of this Convention to understand 
     <lb/>
     exactly what good is to be derived from the

     propose that, if the Convention will agree to it, I 
     <lb/>
     will move that we have a private session at the 
     <lb/>
     completion of today's business, or at the earliest 
     <lb/>
     possible moment, with Mr. Howell, to get an 
     <lb/>
     understanding of what this whole business means 
     <lb/>
     for the country, for our trade, and for general 
     <lb/>
     customs duties. I don't know what time would be 
     <lb/>
     convenient or agreeable, but we might have it in 
     <lb/>
     the night, or have a private session tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     afternoon. It should be part of the Economic 
     <lb/>
