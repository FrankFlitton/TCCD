<!-- GL, 2017-09-11, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

<!--<p>
     formally by Mr. Hollett. On Wednesday I 
     <lb/>
     deferred it for 48 hours. It can hardly be alleged 
     <lb/>
     that the thing was railroaded through and that 
     <lb/>
     every member was not given sufficient oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to speak to the business then before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. As I intimated on Wednesday and again 
     <lb/>
     yesterday afternoon, I think I have exercised my 
     <lb/>
     discretion to the utmost limits. I feel now that the 
     <lb/>
     time has come when the fate of this motion must 
     <lb/>
     become the responsibility of the House. Before I 
     <lb/>
     put the motion, I want to make it clear that it is 
     <lb/>
     not debatable, not amendable. The House there<lb break="no"/>fore must accept or reject the motion as is. The 
     <lb/>
     motion before the Chair is "that the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     proposals received on November 6 from the Rt. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. The Prime Minister of Canada shall not be 
     <lb/>
     further adjourned." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The motion carried] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before going on to the next order 
     <lb/>
     on the order paper, I would like to make a sug<lb break="no"/>gestion to you and to the House. It appears fairly 
     <lb/>
     definite now that we are going to try and conclude 
     <lb/>
     our business before the end of this month. That 
     <lb/>
     would give us very little more than ten clear days 
     <lb/>
     between now and the end of our sessions. We 
     <lb/>
     have given no thought or no definite expressed 
     <lb/>
     thought to the idea of how we are going to con<lb break="no"/>clude the business of the house — how we are 
     <lb/>
     going to finally wind up the Convention, what 
     <lb/>
     procedure we should take, whether it should be 
     <lb/>
     by formal report drafted by a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     House or some other such procedure, or just in 
     <lb/>
     what form the final wind-up should be made. For 
     <lb/>
     that reason I feel that before we go on to another 
     <lb/>
     matter, because of the shortness of time, it would 
     <lb/>
     be advisable in the interests of members and the 
     <lb/>
     business of the House, if instead of discussing the 
     <lb/>
     next motion we decided to go into a private 
     <lb/>
     meeting immediately after we adjourn, if mem<lb break="no"/>bers are agreeable to adjourn, to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     whole matter. With that idea in mind and with the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the whole House, I now move that we 
     <lb/>
     adjourn until Monday or Tuesday and immedi<lb break="no"/>ately following the finalisation of the orders of 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the day, we should have that private session. I 
     <lb/>
     move that, and feel that not only will we be 
     <lb/>
     expediting our business but will certainly be 
     <lb/>
     doing something of great value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think the point is very well 
     <lb/>
     taken. As members will recall, section 3 lays 
     <lb/>
     upon this Convention the duty of making recom<lb break="no"/>mendations. Further than that, standing order 39 
     <lb/>
     requires members to make a report to the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs on the 
     <lb/>
     forms of government which, in the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, would be inserted in the referendum 
     <lb/>
     presumably to take place next spring. The matter 
     <lb/>
     has given me considerable concern; and while I 
     <lb/>
     have some ideas about it, I would like to put them 
     <lb/>
     before members and have an exchange of ideas. 
     <lb/>
     We have to decide future procedure particularly 
     <lb/>
     in view of the fact that time is running out. The 
     <lb/>
     sooner we get at it, the sooner we will know 
     <lb/>
     where everybody is. The House must decide what 
     <lb/>
     is going to happen. I associate myself un<lb break="no"/>qualifiedly with the view expressed by Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins. I do not know how other members feel about 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman I would like to say that for four 
     <lb/>
     days and four nights most of the members have 
     <lb/>
     spoken and I doubt if very many are ready to 
     <lb/>
     continue the debate on this motion. The next two 
     <lb/>
     days would give them a good opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     prepare to go on. I have much pleasure in second<lb break="no"/>ing the motion to adjourn, and say 15 minutes 
     <lb/>
     later to have a private session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It will be a double-barrelled mo<lb break="no"/>tion. Would the House please consider whether 
     <lb/>
     or not a motion to adjourn is put and carried, 
     <lb/>
     whether we should adjourn to Monday or Tues<lb break="no"/>day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As we have merely ten days left 
     <lb/>
     — I am agreeable to having a private session this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon — I think we should adjourn until 
     <lb/>
     Monday, not Tuesday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman I agree with that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The Convention adjourned until January 19] 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->

<div type="section">
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before we begin the order of<lb/>business for today, may I direct the attention of<lb/>members to the fact that the broadcasts of sittings<lb/>are just about two days behind time, and if we<lb/>continue with regular night sessions it is an<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>
          ticipated that we will be about a week behind time 
     <lb/>
     when the formal closing, which is scheduled to 
     <lb/>
     take place on January 30, does in fact take place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     Wednesday and Friday if members so desire. I 
     <lb/>
     realise time is running out, but if it is the wish of 
     <lb/>
     members to have their speeches broadcast after 
     <lb/>
     the same have been delivered in the chamber, 
     <lb/>
     they should take notice of the fact that the eve<lb break="no"/>ning sessions will of necessity have to be cut 
     <lb/>
     down. If, on the other hand, we continue with 
     <lb/>
     evening sessions, it may very well be no longer 
     <lb/>
     news, but history, by the time it reaches the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country, bearing in mind the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we will eventually get to the stage where the 
     <lb/>
     broadcast will be about seven days behind the

     actual proceedings....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> With Mr. Higgins' permission, I 
     <lb/>
     want to draw your attention to the fact, first, that 
     <lb/>
     two of my questions have not yet been replied to, 
     <lb/>
     particularly in connection with the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Savings Bank. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Captain Warren says he has just 
     <lb/>
     received them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We can get it in a minute or two. 
     <lb/>
     Another point I would like to bring up is this: as 
     <lb/>
     you know we had a private meeting on Friday, in 
     <lb/>
     which it was agreed that this Convention would 
     <lb/>
     be shut out, so to speak, by His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor on Friday, January 30. I bring up this 
     <lb/>
     matter because when the delegation went to 
     <lb/>
     England, Lord Addison, when a question was put 
     <lb/>
     to him regarding say two or three forms of 
     <lb/>
     government there, about making up his mind on 
     <lb/>
     it, said ... he might have to seek further advice 
     <lb/>
     from the Convention. Well, if the Convention is 
     <lb/>
     out of business, then there won't be any Con<lb break="no"/>vention to appeal to, and I bring the matter up 
     <lb/>
     because I feel that the Convention should not be 
     <lb/>
     dissolved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I realise, Mr. Chairman, there's possibly legal 
     <lb/>
     technicalities which say that once we have made 
     <lb/>
     our recommendations, the Convention closes off. 
     <lb/>
     But I feel that the matter should be brought to the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the Governor, so that we would know 
     <lb/>
     the result of these recommendations in one way 
     <lb/>
     or another. Surely if we make these recommen<lb break="no"/>dations we should know what is happening, and 
     <lb/>
     we should remain technically a body, not under 
     <lb/>
     pay, so that it can be called together at a 
     <lb/>
     moment's notice if necessary. I know some 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen will be gone, but as Lord Addison 
     <lb/>
     pointed out and I am not breaking any secrets, 
     <lb/>
     he would probably have to ask the Convention 
     <lb/>
     for further advice. If the Convention is disbanded 


            <cb/>
  

     he won't be able to ask it. I bring this to your 
     <lb/>
     attention so that you can bring it to the proper 
     <lb/>
     authorities, and see what is going to happen. Say 
     <lb/>
     we make these recommendations, we are told that 
     <lb/>
     within 30 days we should know what is going to 
     <lb/>
     happen from the Dominions Office, etc. How 
     <lb/>
     long it will take them to do this and that I do not 
     <lb/>
     know, and I feel that before the Convention is 
     <lb/>
     officially wiped out these things should be set<lb break="no"/>tled. I suggest you take it up with the Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General, or His Excellency the Governor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am rather glad Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     raised that matter. As I understand it, the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act, which created this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     contains no provision for the dissolution of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, and certainly the Convention cannot 
     <lb/>
     dissolve itself. It has no authority to do that. To 
     <lb/>
     be dissolved I suppose one of two methods would 
     <lb/>
     have to be adopted; either the government would 
     <lb/>
     enact a statute to dissolve the Convention, or else 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency, when he comes here on the clos<lb break="no"/>ing day next week, will issue his proclamation 
     <lb/>
     dissolving the Convention, and in either way the 
     <lb/>
     Convention would be dissolved. But the question 
     <lb/>
     arises — should the Convention be dissolved 
     <lb/>
     before the referendum is held? His Excellency, 
     <lb/>
     when he comes here next week, could prorogue 
     <lb/>
     the Convention instead of dissolving it, and as 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin says, we would go on back to our 
     <lb/>
     own business or work, and would not be meeting. 
     <lb/>
     But we would still be a Convention for as long 
     <lb/>
     only as there would be any point or sense in our 
     <lb/>
     being so, and certainly we would not be under 
     <lb/>
     pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am glad he mentioned that matter of not 
     <lb/>
     being under pay, because I have been waiting for 
     <lb/>
     the right moment to point out that there seems to 
     <lb/>
     be a lot of misunderstanding in the country 
     <lb/>
     amongst the people on this question. A lot of 
     <lb/>
     people seem to think we get paid every day, even 
     <lb/>
     when we have holidays, even when we recess for 
     <lb/>
     Christmas, even when the Convention is not 
     <lb/>
     meeting, a lot of people seem to think that our pay 
     <lb/>
     goes right on as if we were sitting here all the 
     <lb/>
     time. The truth is that is not so, and when Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin says that if the Convention were held 
     <lb/>
     together until a later day we would not get paid, 
     <lb/>
     I am glad he made that point, so that nobody 
     <lb/>
     would think that the only reason we would have 
     <lb/>
     this thought in our minds now is trying to hook 
     <lb/>
     more money out of it. We would get no money at 
   

            <pb n="1232"

     all. The question is, when it closes should it be 
     <lb/>
     dissolved for all time or should it be prorogued? 
     <lb/>
     It seems very desirable from a number of 
     <lb/>
     standpoints, that when His Excellency comes to 
     <lb/>
     close the Convention, he should prorogue and not 
     <lb/>
     dissolve it, because, as pointed out, it may be<lb break="no"/>come necessary for the British government to 
     <lb/>
     come back to us and ask for information or advice 
     <lb/>
     on some point connected with the referendum. 
     <lb/>
     Well, if we are dissolved next week, the British 
     <lb/>
     government cannot come back to us — we will 
     <lb/>
     not be in existence, so that I think that is a matter 
     <lb/>
     which you, as Chairman, might take up if you 
     <lb/>
     have not already done it. I am sure you have 
     <lb/>
     already given the matter some thought, because 
     <lb/>
     I know it was in my mind even before it hap<lb break="no"/>pened. There is not a word in the act about 
     <lb/>
     dissolving the Convention. We can go home, but 
     <lb/>
     we are still a Convention until we are dissolved. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, I can't accept that posi<lb break="no"/>tion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We can make our recommen<lb break="no"/>dations and go home. I am not a lawyer, but it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that the Convention Act which 
     <lb/>
     created us leaves us in existence and does not 
     <lb/>
     provide for our dissolution. It only provides for 
     <lb/>
     the discharge of our duty. Once we have dis<lb break="no"/>charged that duty are we not still in existence as 
     <lb/>
     a Convention until we are dissolved by statute or 
     <lb/>
     by the Governor's proclamation? It is certainly 
     <lb/>
     a matter to think over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The reply to Mr. Cashin, and I 
     <lb/>
     think my learned friends Mr. Higgins and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett will bear me out in this, in going 
     <lb/>
     though the transcript of the London proceedings 
     <lb/>
     I did not notice where Lord Addison did 
     <lb/>
     proceed on the presupposition that this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion would be available for him to refer back any 
     <lb/>
     questions which may occur to him during the 
     <lb/>
     hiatus between the making of the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions and the holding of the referendum. My own 
     <lb/>
     opinion, for what it is worth, is that under the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention Act this Convention is 
     <lb/>
     brought to an end in either of two ways: either by 
     <lb/>
     repealing the legislation, the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion Act, or by this Convention completing its 
     <lb/>
     work as set forth in the prescribed act. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, that this Convention would cease to exist 
     <lb/>
     after the time it had made its recommendations. 
     <lb/>
     With these opinions in mind, I promptly took the 
     <lb/>
     matter up with His Excellency the Governor, and 
  

            <cb/>
          

     my respectful submission to him was that if my 
     <lb/>
     interpretation of the section was correct, then I 
     <lb/>
     was at a great loss to understand how Lord Ad<lb break="no"/>dison proposed to refer back, to a nonexistent 
     <lb/>
     body, questions which would arise between its 
     <lb/>
     dissolution and the holding of the referendum, if 
     <lb/>
     my contention was that this Convention would 
     <lb/>
     come to an end instantly when the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions were made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My opinion is that this Convention is in sub<lb break="no"/>stitution of a royal commission, and if a royal 
     <lb/>
     commission is set up to do a certain job, certainly 
     <lb/>
     it comes to an end after that job has been per<lb break="no"/>formed. Therefore, under the present state of the 
     <lb/>
     legislation constituting the Convention, the 
     <lb/>
     Governor has no discretion as to whether the 
     <lb/>
     house will be prorogued or formally dissolved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think that if the Convention is to be 
     <lb/>
     prorogued or dissolved an amendment to the act 
     <lb/>
     is essential. Therefore, if it is the desire of mem<lb break="no"/>bers, I will contact the Hon. Mr. Walsh, who is 
     <lb/>
     now the Acting Chairman of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, and I will place your views before 
     <lb/>
     him, first for the purpose of determining whether 
     <lb/>
     or not he agrees with my interpretation of the act, 
     <lb/>
     and if not, whether or not he is prepared to have 
     <lb/>
     the necessary legislation put into effect to have 
     <lb/>
     the Convention dissolved, and I will pass his 
     <lb/>
     report back to the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I am rather inclined to agree. This 
     <lb/>
     Convention was brought into existence by 
     <lb/>
     statute, and the first observation I would like to 
     <lb/>
     make is that there is no such thing as prorogation 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention. It is not a legislature in any 
     <lb/>
     sense of the word, and the Governor has no more 
     <lb/>
     power to prorogue it than I have. Now when it 
     <lb/>
     was brought into existence by statute it was given 
     <lb/>
     certain powers — to investigate and make re<lb break="no"/>commendations to the British government. Just 
     <lb/>
     when it will have made all its recommendations 
     <lb/>
     I don't know. I understand that, within the next 
     <lb/>
     ten days or so, the intention of the Convention is 
     <lb/>
     to make certain recommendations to the British 
     <lb/>
     government with reference to forms of future 
     <lb/>
     government in this country, but I have no as<lb break="no"/>surance that by the date named all the recommen<lb break="no"/>dations which the Convention will want to make 
     <lb/>
     will have then been made. If not, it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that the Convention will still have a further func<lb break="no"/>tion, and consequently will be legally in exist<lb break="no"/>ence, sir, even if its functions have been 


            <pb n="1233"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-19_Page_1233.jpg"/>

     completely fulfilled and its powers completely 
     <lb/>
     out of existence. It is still there, and although it 
     <lb/>
     may have nothing to do and no power to function 
     <lb/>
     in any way it is still a Convention, if you like, with 
     <lb/>
     nothing to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It might be just as well if you are discussing 
     <lb/>
     the matter with the Attorney General, you might 
     <lb/>
     take up with him the necessity of an act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to put this Convention out of existence. In 
     <lb/>
     any event, even assuming that its work is done, it 
     <lb/>
     is still a Convention by statute. What is there on 
     <lb/>
     the statute book to say that it does not exist any 
     <lb/>
     more? There is nothing to say that having made 
     <lb/>
     its recommendations the Convention shall cease 
     <lb/>
     to exist. It is quite possible that the Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Commission may want it to do some more work. 
     <lb/>
     If so, it is still there, and the Governor can em<lb break="no"/>power it to do that work. I think that should be 
     <lb/>
     taken up with the Attorney General when you see 
     <lb/>
     him.

     it would not be any harm, in our discussions, to 
     <lb/>
     have them actually prepared. You will notice the

     On that page are concessions given to New<lb break="no"/>foundland for which she had to pay certain con<lb break="no"/>cessions to United States. On the other two pages

     appears under my name on the order paper this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, I would remind you once again of the 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference under which this Convention 
     <lb/>
     is constituted, and in particular section 3, which 


            <cb/>
       

     makes it necessary for this Convention to recom<lb break="no"/>mend forms of government. My own inclination 
     <lb/>
     in the matter, would be to recommend one form 
     <lb/>
     of government only, namely responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but to conform to our terms of reference 
     <lb/>
     under the Convention Act it is necessary to 
     <lb/>
     recommend <hi rendition="simple:italic">forms</hi> of government. Therefore this 
     <lb/>
     resolution means, if it passes, that two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government will be recommended to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government to be put before the 
     <lb/>
     people at a national referendum.

            <p>
     Let us review briefly the steps that led to the

     formation of this assembly of which we are mem<lb break="no"/>bers. In the years of the world depression, begin<lb break="no"/>ning around 1930, Newfoundland, in company 
     <lb/>
     with the rest of the world, got in deep water. This 
     <lb/>
     condition was by no means peculiar to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, as you all know. The government of 
     <lb/>
     the day, under the late Hon. F.C. Alderdice, be<lb break="no"/>came worried about the condition of the country, 
     <lb/>
     and approached the United Kingdom in the mat<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_01">[1] See debate for January 16, 1948, p. 1229.</note>

     ter. As a result of this application the famous 
     <lb/>
     royal commission presided over by Lord Amul<lb break="no"/>ree was appointed. It is of interest to note at this 
     <lb/>
     time that in the last election for responsible 
     <lb/>
     government the party led by the late Mr. Alder<lb break="no"/>dice won by a sweeping majority, and only two 
     <lb/>
     of the opposing party were elected, the present 
     <lb/>
     member from Green Bay<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> and the member from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista, Mr. Bradley, and voicing all your sen<lb break="no"/>timents, I say we are all glad to have Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>
     back with us today. There was also elected for the 
     <lb/>
     Alderdice party at that time Mr. K.M. Brown, 
     <lb/>
     another member of this Convention, although not 
     <lb/>
     with us just now unfortunately; and also at that 
     <lb/>
     election we have another member of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention contesting a seat, in the person of the 
     <lb/>
     representative from Bonavista Centre, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. His opponent at that time was Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Quinton. I feel fairly safe in saying that had Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood been elected at that time it is possible 
     <lb/>
     that we would never have lost responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, because we all know, particularly in 
     <lb/>
     this House, what an ardent exponent of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government Mr. Smallwood was all 
     <lb/>
     through the years of Commission government, 
     <lb/>
     and up until a short time before this Convention 
     <lb/>
     opened. In newspaper articles, which I would 
     <lb/>
     read to you if permitted, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     demonstrated himself as the most eager advocate 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government. In his "Barrelman" 
     <lb/>
     programmes he spent many years helping along 
     <lb/>
     the cause and, in fact, it was not until he came in 
     <lb/>
     close contact with residents of Canada at Gander 
     <lb/>
     that his ardour cooled, until now he is the most 
     <lb/>
     destructive opponent of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     as we knew it in 1934. Who among us here will 
     <lb/>
     forget his damning speech at the introduction of 
     <lb/>
     his confederation resolution on October 28, 
     <lb/>
     1946? Let me quote from that speech:

     Compared with the mainland of North 
     <lb/>
     America we are 50 years, in some things 100 
     <lb/>
     years, behind the times. We live more poorly, 
     <lb/>
     more shabbily, more meanly. Our life is more 
     <lb/>
     of a slruggle. Our struggle is tougher, more

     whole family. A metamorphosis steals over

     us the minute we cross the border that 
     <lb/>
     separates us from Newfoundland. We are not

     all our complacency, with all our readiness

     to receive, to take for granted, and even to 
     <lb/>
     justify these things amongst ourselves, we

     shocking facts become known to the outside

     I do not know who is making them known. 
     <lb/>
     Gentlemen, to me these are just the vapourings 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Smallwood. I well remember Mr. K.M. 
     <lb/>
     Brown standing up there and saying, "These 
     <lb/>
     words pierced me to the heart." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, to return to events leading up to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. The commission under Lord Amul<lb break="no"/>ree was constituted by a royal warrant dated 
     <lb/>
     February 17, 1933. It consisted of William War<lb break="no"/>render MacKenzie, Baron Amulree, Charles 
     <lb/>
     Alexander McGrath and Sir William Ewen 
     <lb/>
     Stavert with Peter Alexander Clutterbuck as 
     <lb/>
     Secretary. This commission assembled in 
     <lb/>
     St. John's on March 13, and began its sessions on 
     <lb/>
     March 20, 1933. During its collection of 
     <lb/>
     evidence, it also visited Canada, arriving there on 
     <lb/>
     April 29, and leaving on May 27, 1933. During 
     <lb/>
     that time the commission had interviews with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government and took evidence of wit<lb break="no"/>nesses. They adjourned their sittings in July and 
     <lb/>
     began to compile a report which was presented 
     <lb/>
     on September 14, 1933.<ref target="#fn_03">[2]</ref> This report, which was 
     <lb/>
     the basis for the formation of our present Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, was contained in a 
     <lb/>
     volume of 283 pages, complete with maps and 
     <lb/>
     other exhibits. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you are aware, the reason for this commis<lb break="no"/>sion was the inability of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government at that time to pay the interest on the 
     <lb/>
     bonds. A number of people in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     thought and still think that there would have been 
     <lb/>
     nothing wrong in Newfoundland defaulting on its 
     <lb/>
     bond interest at that time, and as events proved 
     <lb/>
     later, some of the major countries of the world 
     <lb/>
     did so. However, little Newfoundland could not 
     <lb/>
     do so because it would be a disgrace to the 
     <lb/>
     Empire. I would quote to you paragraph 513 of 
     <lb/>
     the report:

     To go further in this description, in January

     1934 the Legislative Council and Assembly, in a

     joint address to His Majesty the King, requested 
     <lb/>
     suspension of the Letters Patent, and the issuance 
     <lb/>
     of new Letters Patent to provide for the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the island until such time as it 
     <lb/>
     became self-supporting again. On January 30 
     <lb/>
     1934, by the Newfoundland Act, 1933, provision 
     <lb/>
     was made for the administration of New<lb break="no"/>foundland during the period whilst the operation 
     <lb/>
     of the former Letters Patent was suspended, and

     so Commission of Government was brought into

     You will thus see quite clearly that it was the

     intention of the compilers of this report and of our 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly and Legislative Council, and 
     <lb/>
     furthermore of the British government, that Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government should only be a tem<lb break="no"/>porary measure. I should like to give you my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, for what it is worth, on the legal position 
  

            <pb n="1236"

     arising out of the agreement made with this 
     <lb/>
     country when we agreed to relinquish respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The strict legal position is that this country 
     <lb/>
     was entitled as of right to demand the return of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government as soon as we were self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting. The only justification for this Con<lb break="no"/>vention is to present the facts to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country, to enable them to make up their minds 
     <lb/>
     as to whether or not they wish to advise the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government that it was their 
     <lb/>
     desire that responsible government be restored. 
     <lb/>
     The only choice that can be put at the referendum 
     <lb/>
     is between responsible government as it existed 
     <lb/>
     prior to 1934 and Commission of Government as 
     <lb/>
     it presently exists. I am quite certain that the act 
     <lb/>
     constituting this Convention was never intended 
     <lb/>
     to cancel the agreement between the New<lb break="no"/>foundland and United Kingdom governments 
     <lb/>
     and that the words in our Convention Act, "forms 
     <lb/>
     of government", must and can only mean two 
     <lb/>
     forms, Commission of Government or res<lb break="no"/>ponsible government. I say this, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     in spite of any contrary interpretation given by

     our constitutional expert, Professor Wheare.

     And now, gentlemen, to enable you to express 
     <lb/>
     your considered views as to the form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment you should recommend, I intend to read to 
     <lb/>
     you the summary of the reports on our three main 
     <lb/>
     industries — mining, forestry and fisheries, and 
     <lb/>
     the concluding paragraphs of the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report. The most important one first — the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. I would direct your attention to the 
     <lb/>
     mimeographed sheets which are on your desks 
     <lb/>
     entitled "United States Concessions to New<lb break="no"/>foundland," and "Reduction in Tariffs of interest 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland other than those obtained in 
     <lb/>
     direct negotiations." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Previously the quota for fresh-frozen fish was 
     <lb/>
     an annual one beginning January 1 each year. The 
     <lb/>
     quota was always used up within the first few 
     <lb/>
     months of the year.... Our main operations do not 
     <lb/>
     start until May, so Newfoundland was getting 
     <lb/>
     very little if any benefit from the reduced quota 
     <lb/>
     rate. Now the quota is subdivided into four 
     <lb/>
     quarterly periods which improves our position 
     <lb/>
     tremendously. The credit for making this arran<lb break="no"/>gement goes entirely to Mr. R. Gushue, Chair<lb break="no"/>man of the Newfoundland Fisheries Board. I 
     <lb/>
     asked Mr. Gushue his opinion of the future of our 
     <lb/>
     fresh-frozen fish in the United States as com<lb break="no"/>pared with that of other countries. He told me,

     "Because of its freshness and quality, there is a 
     <lb/>
     strong demand for Newfoundland fish." I direct 
     <lb/>
     your attention to the note on page 2 relative to 
     <lb/>
     fresh-frozen fish: "The head of the National 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Institute of the United States has 
     <lb/>
     predicted an increased consumption this year." 
     <lb/>
     The explanation is that the United States 
     <lb/>
     authorities estimate their annual consumption for 
     <lb/>
     a three year period as 180,000 tons and of that, 
     <lb/>
     quotas permit 15% or 27 million pounds to enter 
     <lb/>
     the United States at the low rate of 1 7/8 cents per 
     <lb/>
     pound, the remainder at 2 1/2 cents per pound. As 
     <lb/>
     the rate of consumption increases, the amount 
     <lb/>
     coming in at the lower rate increases. Whilst the 
     <lb/>
     former rate was the same, it was not bound. The 
     <lb/>
     agreement cannot be varied for three years and 
     <lb/>
     then if it is not denounced it carries on indefinite<lb break="no"/>ly.... On being asked what effect this agreement 
     <lb/>
     would have on Newfoundland, Mr. Gushue said, 
     <lb/>
     "It gives security to fresh-frozen fish operators 
     <lb/>
     and the advantage of a quarterly quota. It will 
     <lb/>
     mean that more fresh-frozen fish will be 
     <lb/>
     produced than last year and so on from year to 
     <lb/>
     year. It is bound to mean increased employment." 
     <lb/>
     On being asked how our fresh fish business com<lb break="no"/>pared with similar kinds elsewhere, he said, 
     <lb/>
     "Newfoundland has made progressively greater 
     <lb/>
     gains than any other country. The standard of our 
     <lb/>
     plants is higher than that of any other country." 
     <lb/>
     "This", he said, "was confirmed by two Nor<lb break="no"/>wegian experts who came here two months ago 
     <lb/>
     and came back again." "They tell me", said 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Gushue, "that there is nothing like our plants 
     <lb/>
     on the North American continent." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This year we are going to have a record for 
     <lb/>
     saltfish going to Puerto Rico and this month we 
     <lb/>
     are making the first direct shipment to Cuba. The 
     <lb/>
     chairman said, "we can look forward to an in<lb break="no"/>creased demand in America, both north and 
     <lb/>
     south, for saltfish." The great reason that is im<lb break="no"/>portant is that we will be paid for the saltfish in 
     <lb/>
     dollars.

     In summing up the Cold Storage Industry In<lb break="no"/>terim Report, the Fisheries Committee says:

            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     To sum up the position it seems clear to 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Committee that a very strong 
     <lb/>
     case can be worked up for special considera<lb break="no"/>tion in any negotiations for improvement in 
     <lb/>
     trading relations with the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America as well as with Canada and Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain on the following grounds: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     1. The future welfare of Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     without doubt mainly dependent upon a free 
     <lb/>
     market for her export products, especially 
     <lb/>
     those from the fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. The future ability of Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     secure and maintain for her fishermen and 
     <lb/>
     other inhabitants a fair and decent standard 
     <lb/>
     of living is largely dependent upon such free 
     <lb/>
     markets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. The strategical position of New<lb break="no"/>foundland as disclosed by conditions arising 
     <lb/>
     out of the recent world war, is of the utmost 
     <lb/>
     importance to the millions of people in the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America and also to those of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and Great Britain, and all these 
     <lb/>
     countries have a definite interest in assisting 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland to improve their 
     <lb/>
     standard of living for the following reasons: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) In the case of Canada the importance 
     <lb/>
     of a prosperous Newfoundland is of special 
     <lb/>
     interest owing to the fact that Newfound<lb break="no"/>land's imports from Canada amount to a very 
     <lb/>
     large percentage of the total imports into 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, whereas unfortunately she is 
     <lb/>
     not in a position to provide in her own 
     <lb/>
     country a market for Newfoundland's chief 
     <lb/>
     exports. It is therefore to the interest of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to help and encourage our export 
     <lb/>
     trade in other directions, in order to retain and 
     <lb/>
     increase her present exports to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Moreover, Canada has already 
     <lb/>
     received important concessions from New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (b) Great Britain is obviously anxious to 
     <lb/>
     assist us. In recent years she has supplied 
     <lb/>
     grants-in-aid to Newfoundland provided 
     <lb/>
     from the taxation of her own people, but it is 
     <lb/>
     quite likely she may not be in a position to 
     <lb/>
     continue these in future years. She can assist 
     <lb/>
     us in making better tariff arrangements not 
     <lb/>
     only with the United States of America, but 
     <lb/>
     with other countries. Moreover, it can be 
     <lb/>
     borne in mind that it was with her authority 
     <lb/>
     that sections of our territory have been ceded 
     <lb/>
     to the United States of America without any 
     <lb/>
     suitable <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (c) In the case of the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America leases of Newfoundland territory 
     <lb/>
     for military and naval bases for 99 years, and 
     <lb/>
     at the same time facilities for free entry 
     <lb/>
     without taxation of any sort on products im<lb break="no"/>

     ported into this country for use of these bases, 
     <lb/>
     were conceded to the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America without the provision of any direct 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. It would seem to be extremely impor<lb break="no"/>tant to the people of Newfoundland that en<lb break="no"/>deavours should be made to secure 
     <lb/>
     favourable trade arrangements for New<lb break="no"/>foundland with the United States of America, 
     <lb/>
     not only on the basis of reciprocal tariff con<lb break="no"/>cessions, but also as a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the 
     <lb/>
     concessions already granted by way of 99- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     year leases and free customs entries.

            <p>
     I refer you next to the conclusions of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee on Mining: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     From our investigations we are satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that the country has a great future in mining. 
     <lb/>
     We say this for the following reasons: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) Whilst Buchans has only known life of 
     <lb/>
     seven more years, the management feel 
     <lb/>
     hopeful that more ore will be found at 
     <lb/>
     Buchans. This ore has an assured market; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (b) Bell Island has practically unlimited 
     <lb/>
     resources. Providing the ore can continue to 
     <lb/>
     be mined at a price to meet outside competi<lb break="no"/>tion, the market is assured. There is every 
     <lb/>
     indication that this condition will be met; 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>(c)The prospects for continuous employment 
     <lb/>at St. Lawrence appear to be excellent; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (d) Employment at Aguathuna is expected 
     <lb/>
     to maintain its present standard; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (e) The smaller industries, brick, limestone, 
     <lb/>
     etc. will, it is expected, continue their present 
     <lb/>
     production; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (f) The iron ore deposits of Labrador, we 
     <lb/>
     believe, will be a great factor in the future 
     <lb/>
     economy of the country; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (g) The asbestos development in the Lewis 
     <lb/>
     Hills has good promise of becoming a success; 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>(h) The mine at LaManche, we believe, will 
     <lb/>go into production during the present year; 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>(i) The option of Tilt Cove by the Con<lb break="no"/>solidated Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd., may 
     <lb/>indicate a re-opening of this mine; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (j) The prospecting program planned for the 
     <lb/>
     next four years by the Buchans Mining 
     <lb/>
     Co. Ltd, may very well give us a new mine; 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>(k) The cement proposition at Port-au-Port 
     <lb/>and the Pilley's Island pyrites are develop<lb break="no"/>ments that might well be considered by the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland Industrial Development 
  

            <cb/>
       

     Board; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Apart from the iron ore in Labrador, your 
     <lb/>
     Committee is of opinion that this territory has 
     <lb/>
     excellent mineral prospects... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And, gentlemen, the summary of the 
     <lb/>
     Forestry Report: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In concluding this report, we give for the 
     <lb/>
     information of the Convention as well as the 
     <lb/>
     country as a whole, the following summary 
     <lb/>
     of our findings: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (1) The pulp and paper industry in New<lb break="no"/>foundland at the present time is in a most 
     <lb/>
     flourishing condition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) Plans by the two companies for the future 
     <lb/>
     envisage a total annual saleable production 
     <lb/>
     of approximately 550,000 tons of both 
     <lb/>
     newspaper and sulphite annually. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (3) We estimate that at the moment the an<lb break="no"/>nual earnings of our people from the pulp and 
     <lb/>
     paper industry is around $15 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (4) It is estimated that within a period of 
     <lb/>
     another two or three years, the pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     industry will employ about 12,000 of our 
     <lb/>
     people, and that their annual earnings will be 
     <lb/>
     close to $20 million... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (11) Recapitulating the entire forest opera<lb break="no"/>tions of the country, both Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, we find that at the present time 
     <lb/>
     some 14,000 of our people are engaged in this 
     <lb/>
     major industry; that the total earning power 
     <lb/>
     at present amounts to some $16 million year<lb break="no"/>ly. On the most conservative basis we visual<lb break="no"/>ize that within a period of three years at least 
     <lb/>
     15,000 people will find employment in our 
     <lb/>
     various forestry operations, and that the total 
     <lb/>
     earning power accruing to them should be not 
     <lb/>
     less than $20 million yearly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
</quote>


            <p>
     With respect to the other primary industry, 
     <lb/>
     agriculture, I understand that the committee 
     <lb/>
     found when they made up the report that the value 
     <lb/>
     of that industry to Newfoundland in 1946 was 
     <lb/>
     some $12 million, but this year, I believe, the 
     <lb/>
     Director of Agriculture informed the chairman of 
     <lb/>
     the committee, Mr. Butt, that it will reach $15 
     <lb/>
     million, so you can see that also is on the up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And now, gentlemen, to conclude the sum<lb break="no"/>mary of the reports — after all, the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report is the summary of all the reports that came 
     <lb/>
     before us, it is the findings from these reports by 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Committee. I would draw to your 
     <lb/>
     attention that it is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">only</hi> report of the nine or 
  

            <pb n="1239"

     ten reports presented at this Convention that was 
     <lb/>
     adopted. You will remember that the other night 
     <lb/>
     it was actually passed and adopted unani<lb break="no"/>mously.... Now, gentlemen, I go to the sum<lb break="no"/>mary:<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Now the first matter which engaged our 
     <lb/>
     attention was the question of whether New<lb break="no"/>foundland was self-supporting. The Report 
     <lb/>
     of the Finance Committee of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     indicates that we are. In 1945 the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State for Dominion Affairs, according to 
     <lb/>
     the British <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi>, stated in the British 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons that Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting. And Commissioner for 
     <lb/>
     Finance Wild, when he appeared before this 
     <lb/>
     Convention one year ago, distinctly stated 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland was self-supporting. 
     <lb/>
     During the discussions of the delegation from 
     <lb/>
     this National Convention to London with 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison, he told us the same thing. We 
     <lb/>
     think therefore that we can, without further 
     <lb/>
     discussion, accept the fact that New<lb break="no"/>foundland is now a self-supporting country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But the terms of reference of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion contain the following qualification: "to 
     <lb/>
     consider our present financial position hear<lb break="no"/>ing in mind the extent to which the high 
     <lb/>
     revenues of recent years have been due to war 
     <lb/>
     time conditions." In this connection we have 
     <lb/>
     the following observations to make. In the 
     <lb/>
     first place the war has now been over for over 
     <lb/>
     two years and we find our revenues even 
     <lb/>
     greater than our highest war time revenues. 
     <lb/>
     Now, making every allowance for the 
     <lb/>
     momentum of war expenditures, carrying on 
     <lb/>
     after the close of hostilities, and allowing for 
     <lb/>
     the gradual recession of this boom period, it 
     <lb/>
     is yet an obvious fact that our present 
     <lb/>
     revenues cannot be something dependent on 
     <lb/>
     war boom. There must be some other cause, 
     <lb/>
     and on examining the matter further we 
     <lb/>
     found that a great portion of our present 
     <lb/>
     revenue is coming to us because of the 
     <lb/>
     growth of our main industries. Now, these 
     <lb/>
     industries are wholly peace industries and are 
     <lb/>
     not dependent for their prosperity on war 
     <lb/>
     conditions. It is clear merefore that we can 
     <lb/>
     properly regard our present revenues as being 
     <lb/>
     anything but a result of war boom.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Reviewing therefore the results of our in<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
     
   
     vestigation, we arrive at the following con<lb break="no"/>clusions: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (1) That Newfoundland is at present a 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting country based on sound 
     <lb/>
     economic factors; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) That all the evidence available to us 
     <lb/>
     indicates that this position of self-support 
     <lb/>
     will continue in the foreseeable future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of the above, we feel that it is not 
     <lb/>
     beyond the province of our report to conclude 
     <lb/>
     with the observation that it would seem to 
     <lb/>
     your Committee, in reviewing their inves<lb break="no"/>tigations, that it is to be regretted that the list 
     <lb/>
     of our assets does not contain in greater quan<lb break="no"/>tity, one which we cannot place in the 
     <lb/>
     columns of our Economic Report; we mean 
     <lb/>
     faith in ourselves, the faith and confidence 
     <lb/>
     which every man owes to himself and his 
     <lb/>
     country. This lack of faith, of course, is not 
     <lb/>
     so with all of us. Our farmers cannot under<lb break="no"/>stand the mystery of growth, yet by faith they 
     <lb/>
     cast their seed into the earth and God gives a 
     <lb/>
     bountiful harvest. Our fisherman knows not 
     <lb/>
     the fortunes which await him on the bosom 
     <lb/>
     of our waters, but each year finds him ready 
     <lb/>
     to venture with faith and confidence upon his 
     <lb/>
     quest, and it is proper that this should be so. 
     <lb/>
     For faith and trust are in the inescapable laws 
     <lb/>
     of both individuals and nations. To use the 
     <lb/>
     words of the late President Roosevelt, "We 
     <lb/>
     have nothing to fear but fear itself." 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     That, gentlemen, is the summary of the find<lb break="no"/>ings of the Economic Committee, which has been 
     <lb/>
     subscribed to unanimously by the members of 
     <lb/>
     this House. Now to get back to the motion. I think 
     <lb/>
     I have ten minutes, Mr. Chairman, if I am right. 
     <lb/>
     I don't want to go over the time.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Thank you. Well, gentlemen, if 
     <lb/>
     this motion which is tabled before you now pas<lb break="no"/>ses, and it is the only recommendation that goes 
     <lb/>
     to the United Kingdom, where does this leave us? 
     <lb/>
     It puts the country exactly where it was before 
     <lb/>
     this Convention started. It puts the problem clear<lb break="no"/>ly up to the United Kingdom government, where 
     <lb/>
     it should have been from the first. It says, in 
     <lb/>
     effect, that the people of Newfoundland, through 
     <lb/>
     the voice of its elected representatives, is request<lb break="no"/>ing the United Kingdom government to honour

     its bond, because the agreement under which this 
     <lb/>
     country agreed to relinquish responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment was indeed a bond subscribed to by the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government. Then you say, 
     <lb/>
     "Has this Convention been a complete waste of 
     <lb/>
     time and money?" I for one, and I know that most 
     <lb/>
     of you here will agree with me, think that this is 
     <lb/>
     not so. I submit that if it has done nothing else but 
     <lb/>
     awaken this country from its torpor, from its long 
     <lb/>
     sleep, from its lack of interest in all things politi<lb break="no"/>cal, then it has more than justified its existence, 
     <lb/>
     but I say that it's given to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country not only that awakened interest, but a lot 
     <lb/>
     of valuable facts that in a large measure and to 
     <lb/>
     great extent a number of us never would have 
     <lb/>
     acquired. We may say that they have gotten them 
     <lb/>
     in capsule form, through the radio, but neverthe<lb break="no"/>less they have gotten those facts. I would say that 
     <lb/>
     the members have put a lot of hard work into this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, at great inconvenience to themsel<lb break="no"/>ves and in many cases at financial loss. If, at 
     <lb/>
     times, tempers have flared and matters have got<lb break="no"/>ten somewhat out of hand, this was only to be 
     <lb/>
     expected, and it merely proves to me how 
     <lb/>
     seriously the members of this Convention were 
     <lb/>
     taking their duties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All things being considered, I am satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention has justified its existence, and a 
     <lb/>
     lot of thanks are due to the radio operators and to 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen of the press, because all the talking 
     <lb/>
     we have done would have been to naught if it had 
     <lb/>
     not been broadcast. It is true that at times we have 
     <lb/>
     been abusing the radio, but at all events, whether 
     <lb/>
     it has prolonged the Convention or not, whether 
     <lb/>
     some people think it has been a pretty high rate 
     <lb/>
     of entertainment they have received, I say that 
     <lb/>
     what they have heard on a number of occasions 
     <lb/>
     is not the true worth of this Convention, and that 
     <lb/>
     the members have done a good job, and that the 
     <lb/>
     end has justified the means. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, to return to the motion, and my own 
     <lb/>
     opinion that we assume our true obligation of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. We have heard, here 
     <lb/>
     and outside, the members of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ments of the past slandered. This has not been 
     <lb/>
     confined only to our own countrymen, but it 
     <lb/>
     appears in the columns of that famous Amulree 
     <lb/>
     Report as well. With all due respect to our own 
     <lb/>
     countrymen and the compilers of that report, I 
     <lb/>
     want you to consider the revenues of this country 
     <lb/>
     and the revenues that the men who ran our 
    

            <cb/>
         

     responsible government had to contend with. 
     <lb/>
     Responsible government was attained in 1855, 
     <lb/>
     and it is very difficult in this day of big money to 
     <lb/>
     realise that in 1855 the first responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland had a total revenue of not 
     <lb/>
     more than $500,000. And all you have got to do 
     <lb/>
     for the other figures is to go to the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Report, where you have the figures from 1897 up 
     <lb/>
     to the present day. In 1897 there was merely $1.7 
     <lb/>
     million in revenue, in 1902 there was $23 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, in 1909 $3 million, in 1914 $3.9 million. 
     <lb/>
     The first time we got up to $10 million was in 
     <lb/>
     1919, and back it went again to $8 million for a 
     <lb/>
     number of years. In fact the highest revenue that 
     <lb/>
     responsible government ever had to run the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of this country was in 1929-30, when they 
     <lb/>
     had the enormous sum of $11.5 million.... So 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, all I can say to you is that to run this 
     <lb/>
     country on the amount of money that our past 
     <lb/>
     governments had to run it with, was nothing short 
     <lb/>
     of miraculous. Where else in the world could it 
     <lb/>
     have happened? Where else could you get the 
     <lb/>
     men to do the job? I might be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     paraphrase Mr. Churchill: "Never did so few do 
     <lb/>
     so much with so little"; and I might add, "<hi rendition="simple:italic">for</hi> so 
     <lb/>
     little." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What did they get out of it, I ask you? Nothing, 
     <lb/>
     except the satisfaction of sewing their country. 
     <lb/>
     All the way down the line from Dr. Carson, the 
     <lb/>
     ancestor of Mr. Job, our government had good 
     <lb/>
     men and true, and what did they get for their 
     <lb/>
     services of this country? Abuse in their lifetime 
     <lb/>
     and slander of their names after their death. So I 
     <lb/>
     say to you in all sincerity that Newfoundland has 
     <lb/>
     a debt you can never repay to these great men of 
     <lb/>
     our past governments, who served this country 
     <lb/>
     only too well at the expense of their own happi<lb break="no"/>ness and well-being. Let us in some measure, as 
     <lb/>
     some recompense for their work and as a tribute 
     <lb/>
     to their memory, resolve to once again relight the 
     <lb/>
     fires that they so well lit, and so valiantly and 
     <lb/>
     nobly created. Let us keep our trust with them, 
     <lb/>
     and have faith in ourselves and in our country. I 
     <lb/>
     move the motion, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have much 
     <lb/>
     pleasure in seconding the resolution moved by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins. It is, in my opinion, the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant business yet brought before the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     so important in fact, that it behoves the most 
     <lb/>
     flexible mind to examine soberly and carefully 
     <lb/>
     the stark realities of what might be the outcome

     of a hasty decision. If I had worded this resolution 
     <lb/>
     I would have said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     1. Be it resolved that this Convention 
     <lb/>
     recommend to the United Kingdom govern<lb break="no"/>ment that the wishes of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland should be ascertained at the 
     <lb/>
     earliest moment as to whether it is their desire 
     <lb/>
     that a revised form of self-govemment of not 
     <lb/>
     more than 15 men elected from 15 districts to 
     <lb/>
     constitute the local government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, be restored; and that, in view of 
     <lb/>
     our important strategic position and the un<lb break="no"/>retrievable commitments of the Common<lb break="no"/>wealth Office with respect to American and 
     <lb/>
     Canadian bases in Newfoundland territory, 
     <lb/>
     an international committee of three be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed from the respective governments of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, the USA and Canada, to take 
     <lb/>
     charge of our foreign policy in matters of 
     <lb/>
     defence only, it being understood that this is 
     <lb/>
     not to be construed as giving any right to any 
     <lb/>
     outside power to interfere with our domestic 
     <lb/>
     or economic control of all local or foreign 
     <lb/>
     economic affairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Or that the present form of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government be continued for a period of 
     <lb/>
     not more than four years. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     However, as the first and most important part 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution can be properly taken care of by 
     <lb/>
     the first duly elected government, I am prepared 
     <lb/>
     to support the motion as it stands, as our people 
     <lb/>
     must perforce either want selfgovemment or they 
     <lb/>
     do not want it, and I am fully prepared to accept 
     <lb/>
     their judgement on the matter. There is one 
     <lb/>
     reason why I would agree to putting Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government on the ballot paper. At any time 
     <lb/>
     after 1936 to 1941, when we began to feel the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the war time prosperity, it is the general<lb break="no"/>ly accepted opinion that the big majority of our 
     <lb/>
     people would have readily agreed to the return to 
     <lb/>
     self-government without modifications. Under 
     <lb/>
     the unprecedented prosperity of our country, 
     <lb/>
     through circumstances over which the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government had neither influence nor 
     <lb/>
     control, a large number of our people have lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of the true causes for the influx of foreign 
     <lb/>
     capital and the high prices for our commodities, 
     <lb/>
     and they have been giving credit to a form of 
     <lb/>
     government of which neither the personnel nor 
     <lb/>
     the form had anything whatever to do with it. I 
     <lb/>
     do not quarrel with anyone who disagrees with 
   

            <cb/>
         

     me, not even the members of the Commission 
     <lb/>
     themselves. That is their right. In my opinion 
     <lb/>
     most of them on the Commission at present are 
     <lb/>
     fine men, and I have a high opinion of them; but 
     <lb/>
     they and others who have served that unpopular 
     <lb/>
     body have agreed openly that the form is wrong 
     <lb/>
     for any country in this modern age, when all 
     <lb/>
     people, regardless of race or creed, are clamour<lb break="no"/>ing for the right to choose the form of government 
     <lb/>
     under which they will live. But for the fact that I 
     <lb/>
     know our surplus would be gone in four years 
     <lb/>
     unless it could be locked up outside their reach, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to see them suffer for some of the sins 
     <lb/>
     for which I know the government of that four 
     <lb/>
     years will be held responsible, but for which 
     <lb/>
     resettling world conditions will be to blame. By 
     <lb/>
     that time I feel we will have our feet on terra firma 
     <lb/>
     and be able safely to carry on without the aid of 
     <lb/>
     any surplus. 
  </p>

            <p>For the last time in this Convention I shall 
     <lb/>repeat paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Atlantic Charter: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>What greater authority could we have that our 
     <lb/>cause is just, that we are not infringing on the 
     <lb/>rights of others, than the signed statement of these 
     <lb/>two great world leaders and statesmen? This 
     <lb/>famous declaration was made in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>waters. So far, I refuse to believe they were not 
     <lb/>sincere; but less than two months from now will 
     <lb/>prove whether it was an empty, fake promise to 
     <lb/>Newfoundland or a friendly sincere pledge, con<lb break="no"/>scious of the very great wrong that had been 
     <lb/>perpetrated against our people. I stated in my 
     <lb/>radio address of December 20, 1947, "Great

     foundland, are holding her to that written and 
     <lb/>
     spoken word, and it must be our duty afterward 
     <lb/>
     to decide our future destiny as a free people." I 
     <lb/>
     do not need to point to Newfoundland's loyalty. 
     <lb/>
     This has been amply demonstrated on numerous 
     <lb/>
     occasions and will be again if Great Britain does 
     <lb/>
     now, in what I consider her very last chance, give 
     <lb/>
     the freedom, rights and honour to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     for which we have paid for many times in blood. 
     <lb/>
     I could not honestly call it a privilege or a favour, 
     <lb/>
     it is a just and honourable debt for which we, with 
     <lb/>
     her, side by side, gave the lives of the bravest and 
     <lb/>
     best of Newfoundland's manhood and woman<lb break="no"/>hood. That debt can only be repaid by speedily 
     <lb/>
     undoing a wrong, by immediately granting what 
     <lb/>
     costs her nothing, not even her pride, self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment without delay to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I have stated that in my opinion this 
     <lb/>
     will be Britain's last chance to do the right and 
     <lb/>
     proper thing If she fails in this crucial hour, she 
     <lb/>
     will do what the vast majority of the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking world in the west is expecting, drive 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into the arms of the United States 
     <lb/>
     of America. There is a parable that says, 
     <lb/>
     "Children obey your parents." Again, "Parents 
     <lb/>
     provoke not your children to anger lest they rise 
     <lb/>
     up against you." It is a common expression these 
     <lb/>
     days, that if Britain does not very soon wake up 
     <lb/>
     to her responsibility toward her oldest colony, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland must appeal to that great 
     <lb/>
     democratic republic to the west to save us from 
     <lb/>
     our friends. We are conscious of Britain's plight 
     <lb/>
     financially, but she is yet a great nation and what 
     <lb/>
     will make her greater still is to command the 
     <lb/>
     highest respect of all her people and especially 
     <lb/>
     her vast colonial empire. Many great sons have 
     <lb/>
     left unbearable home conditions only to become 
     <lb/>
     greater in the larger expanse of opportunity when 
     <lb/>
     the shackles of intolerable home life were 
     <lb/>
     released. Many depressed colonies of people 
     <lb/>
     have matured to great nations when the shackles 
     <lb/>
     of remote control were, at very often great 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice, lifted from their domain. Surely it must 
     <lb/>
     be admitted that if Newfoundland is forced to 
     <lb/>
     seek a more democratic institution, she will only 
     <lb/>
     do it in desperation, after the mother country has 
     <lb/>
     ignored all the principles of the rights of man.

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I am not critical at this time of 
     <lb/>
     any other form of government; there are many 
   
            <cb/>
       

     forms which could find a place in our economy. 
     <lb/>
     But surely to every sane, sober, sensible, normal 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander there are certain basic fun<lb break="no"/>damental principles which must, of necessity, be 
     <lb/>
     adhered to at this time. If Newfoundlanders are 
     <lb/>
     to be kicked around like footballs they will fight 
     <lb/>
     like demons the party who starts the kicking. 
     <lb/>
     Through perservance, endurance, sacrifice and a 
     <lb/>
     long history of struggle we obtained self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Our constitution was only temporarily sus<lb break="no"/>pended. It <hi rendition="simple:italic">must</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">will</hi> be restored, if it costs 
     <lb/>
     thousands of the lives of our people. If it becomes 
     <lb/>
     necessary the supreme sacrifice will be made. 
     <lb/>
     Our people are true British stock, and history has 
     <lb/>
     proved many times that serious repercussions and 
     <lb/>
     most unsavoury situations might have been 
     <lb/>
     avoided if the heads of state had not been too 
     <lb/>
     stubborn to believe the inevitable could happen, 
     <lb/>
     and their refusal to recognise the rights of others. 
     <lb/>
     Someone must take the risk of stating these un<lb break="no"/>pleasant facts in the hope that the Common<lb break="no"/>wealth Office will see the wisdom of honouring 
     <lb/>
     her obligations toward Newfoundland before it is 
     <lb/>
     too late. Hatred and revenge in the hearts of our 
     <lb/>
     people will be a far greater enemy than an equal 
     <lb/>
     share in the Christian democratic institutions 
     <lb/>
     which we have so nobly built up together. I would 
     <lb/>
     at this time appeal to their sense of justice, to 
     <lb/>
     establish if necessary, a precedent in British 
     <lb/>
     foreign policy and "Do unto others as you would 
     <lb/>
     that they should do unto you." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have spared no efforts to study every report 
     <lb/>
     brought into this Convention soberly, fairly and 
     <lb/>
     honestly. It is on the facts in these reports that I 
     <lb/>
     base my arguments for self-government for the 
     <lb/>
     country. To those of us who have conscientiously 
     <lb/>
     taken advantage of this opportunity to become 
     <lb/>
     really conversant with the potential wealth of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, it has been an education at the 
     <lb/>
     expense of the treasury for which some of us at 
     <lb/>
     least are most grateful. We have delved deeply 
     <lb/>
     into matters for which we previously had no 
     <lb/>
     concern or knowledge, and although with the 
     <lb/>
     limited time of one hour I cannot attempt to give 
     <lb/>
     any review in detail, nevertheless I feel I should 
     <lb/>
     digress for a few moments to outline some of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons why I feel Newfoundland should return 
     <lb/>
     to self-government.

     And were they not English our forefathers, never more

     English than when they shook the dust of her sod

     <lb/>What could I do but ache and long,

     <lb/>What could I do but long and ache,

     <lb/>Lest someone should know the things they'd say. 
     <lb/>Silently, subtly they inspire, 
     <lb/>Most of our youth with a holy fire, 
     <lb/>To shed their blood for the British Empire. 
     <lb/>We'll come in — we'll fight and die 
     <lb/>Humbly to help them and by and by,

            <p>5. The person who conceived the idea of a

     <lb/>was done, in my opinion, mainly as a spiteful

     justice. God grant that it shall never happen in an 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking colony again. No one in New<lb break="no"/>foundland seriously expects a bed of roses to lie 
     <lb/>
     on, and if they do they must be careful they do 
     <lb/>
     not find themselves among the thistles instead,

     Our country is not developed, and we do not 
     <lb/>
     owe money. We can have social security, a 
     <lb/>
     modern way of life and plenty of remunerative 
     <lb/>
     employment for our people, if we are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     take on a national debt equal to what we would 
     <lb/>
     take over by joining any other country. In 1933 
     <lb/>
     our national debt was a serious item in our 
     <lb/>
     economy, but in 1948 even the $100 million 
     <lb/>
     would not be a great source of worry. There are 
     <lb/>
     hard days ahead, but I have faith in our people, 
     <lb/>
     and in our ability to survive. The lesson of 1933 
     <lb/>
     is one we should never forget, and in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     both the United States and Canada regret to this 
     <lb/>
     hour they did not act at that time to save New<lb break="no"/>foundland from losing her democratic institu<lb break="no"/>tions. I never could understand their lack of 
     <lb/>
     foresight and interest in their weaker, friendly 
     <lb/>
     neighbour at that time, and I would urge all 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders to unite at this time and guard 
     <lb/>
     your heritage. We have been elected to recom<lb break="no"/>mend a form or forms of government. I have 
     <lb/>
     given many forms serious consideration. To 
     <lb/>
     preserve our own respect and the love and respect 
     <lb/>
     we have always had for the mother country, there 
     <lb/>
     is only one I can honestly commend to our 
     <lb/>
     people, namely, without reservation whatever, 
     <lb/>
     the restoration of self-government for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There will be a second choice for me, how<lb break="no"/>ever, and that will still be self-government with 
     <lb/>
     modifications as outlined in the beginning of this 
     <lb/>
     address, and if outside powers or interests control 
     <lb/>
     our sovereign territory they should compensate 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland for the right to use

     this spring. The motion does not ask us to be in 
     <lb/>
     favour of responsible government or Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government. It does not ask us voters, as 
     <lb/>
     citizens, to vote for either of these two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government. If it did, I would not vote for this 
     <lb/>
     motion. It only asks us to recommend that these 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government shall be laid before the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country to vote for or against, in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. I believe that the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people have every right in the world to pass their 
     <lb/>
     verdict on these two forms of government in the

     I want it to be clearly understood that in the

     referendum itself I shall not vote for either 
     <lb/>
     responsible or Commission government. I shall 
     <lb/>
     vote against both of them, as a citizen of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I shall vote against them in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum as a member of this Convention. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think our people will vote for either one of 
     <lb/>
     them; but I think they must have the right to do it

     Sir, I am against responsible government com<lb break="no"/>ing back to Newfoundland. In principle, I think 
     <lb/>
     responsible government is right, but in practice, 
     <lb/>
     I think it is wrong. I think if we went back to 
     <lb/>
     responsible government we would bring misery 
     <lb/>
     and suffering on our people. I think it would be a 
     <lb/>
     terrible gamble to take. When I say that respon<lb break="no"/>sible government is all right in principle, I mean 
     <lb/>
     that all people should have the right of self<lb break="yes"/>
          

            <cb/>
           
government, all people should have power over 
     <lb/>
     the government — the power to elect it, and the 
     <lb/>
     power to put them out if they don't do right. But 
     <lb/>
     when I say that responsible government is all 
     <lb/>
     wrong in practice, what I mean is that I see no 
     <lb/>
     chance whatever that responsible government 
     <lb/>
     would be any better for us than it was those last 
     <lb/>
     20 years that we had it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under responsible government our country 
     <lb/>
     went broke.... Our government's credit was gone 
     <lb/>
     — we were bankrupt and insolvent. Our people 
     <lb/>
     were on the dole in the tens of thousands. Our 
     <lb/>
     children went hungry and naked. Our standard of 
     <lb/>
     health fell very low, and TB increased by leaps 
     <lb/>
     and bounds. I see no chance at all that we could 
     <lb/>
     ever keep clear of those same terrible conditions 
     <lb/>
     if we went back to responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, which means that Newfoundland has cut 
     <lb/>
     herself clear of close organic connection with any 
     <lb/>
     other country. Under responsible government we 
     <lb/>
     would be on our own, ... without help from 
     <lb/>
     anyone. We tried that before, and where did we 
     <lb/>
     end? I, for one, am not willing to go through all 
     <lb/>
     that misery again, and I don't think our people are 
     <lb/>
     willing to try that again, for a "burnt child dreads 
     <lb/>
     the fire". Where would people be once our little 
     <lb/>
     cash surplus was all gone? Where would we turn 
     <lb/>
     then for help? It is no use anyone telling me we 
     <lb/>
     would never need help, because I don't believe 
     <lb/>
     it. When the price of fish falls, as fall it will; when 
     <lb/>
     the icy blast of depression strikes again, as it will;

     then this little country will need help. Where will 
     <lb/>
     we turn for help when it comes? Will we come 
     <lb/>
     crawling again to the British government, or will 
     <lb/>
     we go first and crawl to Canada? No sir, I shall 
     <lb/>
     not vote for responsible government in the refer<lb break="no"/>endum.... So far as Commission government is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I want that to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people too. I think they should have the right to 
     <lb/>
     vote for it or against it if they want to. I shall vote 
     <lb/>
     against Commission government in the referen<lb break="no"/>dum, but here in this Convention I shall vote to 
     <lb/>
     give the people the chance to vote for it if they 
     <lb/>
     want to. I am not one of those who are going 
     <lb/>
     around damning Commission government. I am 
     <lb/>
     not one of those who can't see any good in the 
     <lb/>
     Commission's 14 year record, who refuse to give 
     <lb/>
     them any credit. They have done some good you 
     <lb/>
     know, and I am happy to give them credit for it. 
     <lb/>
     They have not done so much good as some of our 
     <lb/>
     people think, but they have done some, and we 
     <lb/>
     should praise them for it. Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment, sir, is the price we paid for mining our 
     <lb/>
     people and our country under responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. We made a mess of things under 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and Britain had to take 
     <lb/>
     us over, but first responsible government had to 
     <lb/>
     go, and Commission government had to take its 
     <lb/>
     place. We needed help back in 1933-34 in the 
     <lb/>
     worst kind of way. Britain was in a position then 
     <lb/>
     to give us some help, in those days before she was 
     <lb/>
     washed up and plunged into poverty by the war; 
     <lb/>
     she was able to help us, and she did help us. We 
     <lb/>
     should be eternally grateful to her for it, and we 
     <lb/>
     should be eternally proud of the fact that we were 
     <lb/>
     able to help her a little bit with our money during 
     <lb/>
     the war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not one of those who go around saying 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain forced Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     on us in 1934, nor am I one of those who go 
     <lb/>
     around trying to say that Great Britain is trying 
     <lb/>
     to force any kind of government on us now. I 
     <lb/>
     don't think that. I am firmly convinced that she 
     <lb/>
     wants all of us to have a thoroughly free choice 
     <lb/>
     in deciding what form of government we shall 
     <lb/>
     have in Newfoundland. We have been told that 
     <lb/>
     Britain would like to see us join up with another 
     <lb/>
     British country. I don't know about that, but if 
     <lb/>
     she would she is not trying to force us to do it. I 
     <lb/>
     dare say it is true that the mother country would 
     <lb/>
     like us to throw in our lot with another British 
     <lb/>
     country. It seems reasonable enough; but that she 


            <cb/>
     

     is trying to force us to do it, I simply don't 
     <lb/>
     believe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, in the referendum I shall vote against 
     <lb/>
     Commission government. I am all in favour of 
     <lb/>
     our people having the chance to vote for Com<lb break="no"/>mission if they want to, but as for myself ... I don't 
     <lb/>
     think that Commission government ever can suc<lb break="no"/>ceed, nor can ever give our people the kind of 
     <lb/>
     government they need and want. The Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government are straight and honest. They 
     <lb/>
     don't rob the public chest — of that I am quite 
     <lb/>
     sure. I believe they are trying to do their best, but 
     <lb/>
     their best is not good enough. So long as we stay 
     <lb/>
     under Commission form of government, or if we 
     <lb/>
     are under responsible government, we shall have 
     <lb/>
     our present unjust system of taxation. They can<lb break="no"/>not change it. This unjust system of taxation 
     <lb/>
     crushes the life out of our people, drives up the 
     <lb/>
     cost of living, and the cost of production in our 
     <lb/>
     main industries, makes it impossible for New<lb break="no"/>foundland's main industries to compete with the 
     <lb/>
     industries of other countries, unless they pay our 
     <lb/>
     producers just barely enough to exist on. So long 
     <lb/>
     as we have this unjust system of taxation the only 
     <lb/>
     way our main industries, especially our fisheries, 
     <lb/>
     can compete with the industries of other countries 
     <lb/>
     is by paying our producers, our fishermen espe<lb break="no"/>cially, a smaller share than the producers and 
     <lb/>
     fishermen of other countries get. Our fishermen 
     <lb/>
     are forced to have a lower standard of life. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, it matters not what form of 
     <lb/>
     government we may have in this country, so long 
     <lb/>
     as that unjust system of taxation is kept on us; so 
     <lb/>
     long as our wicked customs duties are kept on; so 
     <lb/>
     long as our government uses customs duties to 
     <lb/>
     collect the bulk of their revenue... I will give you 
     <lb/>
     just one example of what I mean. Last year, 1947, 
     <lb/>
     our bank fishery was pretty successful. The 
     <lb/>
     fishermen who toiled on our highliner in the bank 
     <lb/>
     fishery, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freda M</hi>, what did they get? Around 
     <lb/>
     $1,550 per man. That was counted pretty good, 
     <lb/>
     wasn't it? And yet what do we find? We find that 
     <lb/>
     other Fortune Bay fishermen, toiling on other 
     <lb/>
     vessels, Nova Scotia bankers, who got about the 
     <lb/>
     same quantity of fish in the same year, were paid 
     <lb/>
     $1,000 more than the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freda M</hi>'s men, I mean 
     <lb/>
     $1,000 per man more — in fact over $1,000 per 
     <lb/>
     man. I am not blaming the owners of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freda 
     <lb/>
     M</hi>; I am not saying one word against them, be<lb break="no"/>cause I know that it cost a lot more to fit our the 
     <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freda M</hi> than it cost to fit out the Nova Scotia 
    

            <pb n="1247"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-19_Page_1247.jpg"/>

     bankers of the same size. That is what I mean 
     <lb/>
     when I say that our unjust system of taxation 
     <lb/>
     drives up the cost of production. The customs 
     <lb/>
     duties drive up the cost of production, and after 
     <lb/>
     paying more to fit up the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freda M</hi> than it cost the 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia bankers of the same size, it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible to pay the crew the same wages as the 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia men got for the same amount of fish. 
     <lb/>
     It could not be done. This is only one example. I 
     <lb/>
     could give you thousands of others if there was 
     <lb/>
     time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am against the Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>
     not because I think they are dishonest — I think 
     <lb/>
     they are honest. Not because I think they are not 
     <lb/>
     doing their best — I think they are doing their 
     <lb/>
     best; but because I know they cannot do away 
     <lb/>
     with out unjust and unsound system of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     They cannot do away with our customs duties. 
     <lb/>
     They can reduce the duties a bit here and there, 
     <lb/>
     but they must go right on getting the bulk of their 
     <lb/>
     revenue from those customs duties, and so must 
     <lb/>
     responsible govemment.... So long as we have 
     <lb/>
     the Commission form of government, or the 
     <lb/>
     responsible form of government, so long as we 
     <lb/>
     have either of them, we shall have those customs 
     <lb/>
     duties and the profits on the customs duties, and 
     <lb/>
     these customs duties will be the bulk of the 
     <lb/>
     government's revenues, so I am against both 
     <lb/>
     responsible and Commission government. I am 
     <lb/>
     willing to give our people a fair chance to vote 
     <lb/>
     for those two forms of government, either one of 
     <lb/>
     them ... but I shall not vote for either one of them 
     <lb/>
     myself when the referendum rolls around. I will 
     <lb/>
     vote for this motion to place those two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government before the people, because I know it 
     <lb/>
     is my duty to do so, the duty of every member of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, but that is as far as I can go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It will be up to our people to decide for them<lb break="no"/>selves in the referendum; if they want to vote for 
     <lb/>
     responsible government well and good, if they 
     <lb/>
     want to vote for Commission government well 
     <lb/>
     and good, but it will not be with any encourage<lb break="no"/>ment from me. If those two forms of government 
     <lb/>
     happened to be the only two forms on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     paper; if we had only two forms, responsible and 
     <lb/>
     Commission, in the referendum, then I will vote 
     <lb/>
     for Commission in the referendum. I would not 
     <lb/>
     be happy doing it, and I would not do it very 
     <lb/>
     willingly, but between the two of them ..., my 
     <lb/>
     vote in the referendum would go for Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. I would hate to be limited to those 
  

            <cb/>
         

     two forms, and by casting my vote for Commis<lb break="no"/>sion I would do it just to take the lesser of two evils. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some people say, Mr. Chairman, that respon<lb break="no"/>sible government means political freedom, but 
     <lb/>
     not economic security; some people say that 
     <lb/>
     Commission government means economic 
     <lb/>
     security, but not political freedom... I don't 
     <lb/>
     believe it. If responsible government failed to 
     <lb/>
     give us economic security, and it has failed, then 
     <lb/>
     it is precious little political freedom we would 
     <lb/>
     have. How can we have political freedom if we 
     <lb/>
     have no economic security and stability? What is 
     <lb/>
     the good of a vote to a man who is hungry? What 
     <lb/>
     is the good of elections to a man on the dole? No, 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid it is very little political freedom we 
     <lb/>
     would have as a people under responsible 
     <lb/>
     government if we had not full bellies and decent 
     <lb/>
     clothes to protect us, or what my good and 
     <lb/>
     respected friends Mr. Newell and Mr. Keough 
     <lb/>
     call three square meals a day, and a suit of clothes 
     <lb/>
     and a roof over their heads... Oh yes, it is all right 
     <lb/>
     to have the glorious right to vote and take part in 
     <lb/>
     elections, but I am afraid an awful lot of the glory 
     <lb/>
     just oozes out of it when you are hungry, and your 
     <lb/>
     children are hungry, and you have nothing to 
     <lb/>
     depend on but the dole. No, Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>
     don't think it is true at all to say that responsible 
     <lb/>
     government means political freedom without 
     <lb/>
     economic security, because without economic 
     <lb/>
     security you just can't have political freedom, 
     <lb/>
     and I think there is very little in the other part of 
     <lb/>
     the saying that Commission government means 
     <lb/>
     economic security without political freedom. I 
     <lb/>
     think that day is gone, if we ever had it. Just when 
     <lb/>
     did Commission government give us economic 
     <lb/>
     security or stability? Commission government 
     <lb/>
     came here to Newfoundland in the winter of 
     <lb/>
     1934. For the first six years they were here they 
     <lb/>
     certainly did not give Newfoundland any 
     <lb/>
     economic security. Don't forget that right up to 
     <lb/>
     the outbreak of the war we had tens of thousands 
     <lb/>
     of our people on the dole under Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. Don't forget that just a bare eight or 
     <lb/>
     nine years ago the total value of all our fish and 
     <lb/>
     fish products exported out of Newfoundland, the 
     <lb/>
     whole lot of them together, had a value of a paltry 
     <lb/>
     $8 million — just eight years ago. Don't forget 
     <lb/>
     that in the first six years of Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment at job was the hardest thing in this world to 
     <lb/>
     get here in Newfoundland, that we had thousands 
     <lb/>
     of our young men leaving school without a 
  

            <pb n="1248"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-19_Page_1248.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1248</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     chance of getting a job. Don't forget that under 
     <lb/>
     the first six years of Commission government we 
     <lb/>
     had no economic prosperity or security or 
     <lb/>
     stability. Then the war broke out, and hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of millions of dollars poured in here from Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the United States to build all those bases. 
     <lb/>
     There was lots of work then. You could sell 
     <lb/>
     anything. Now since the war ended, and with the 
     <lb/>
     whole world short of this and that, we could still 
     <lb/>
     sell our fish and our oil and ore, and we don't feel 
     <lb/>
     like thanking the Commission government for 
     <lb/>
     that. They did not start the war. We can't praise 
     <lb/>
     or blame them for that. We have had Commission 
     <lb/>
     government for the past 14 years — six years 
     <lb/>
     before the war, six years during the war, and two 
     <lb/>
     years since the war, and what economic stability 
     <lb/>
     have we had? We had a bit during the war, and a 
     <lb/>
     lot less since the war, and already it has started to 
     <lb/>
     wear very thin for a lot of our people. It has 
     <lb/>
     started to wear very thin, this wonderful 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, for the 13 or 15,000 of our New<lb break="no"/>foundland people who are on the dole tonight. 
     <lb/>
     Prosperity is wearing very thin for them, but if 
     <lb/>
     Commission government gave us full economic 
     <lb/>
     security up to now, what chance is there that they 
     <lb/>
     will give us economic security in the future? 
     <lb/>
     None at all, Mr. Chairman, not a bit. The Com<lb break="no"/>missioners would be the first themselves to admit 
     <lb/>
     it. There is only one thing that the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government can promise us or guarantee us, and 
     <lb/>
     that is that they will collect taxes from us and they 
     <lb/>
     will spend the money honestly. That is, they 
     <lb/>
     won't rob the till. They can't even promise that 
     <lb/>
     they will do these two things wisely: wisely col<lb break="no"/>lect the taxes, and wisely spend them. As for 
     <lb/>
     guaranteeing economic security in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, it is out of the question altogether. So 
     <lb/>
     you see, Mr. Chairman, the Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment means neither political freedom nor 
     <lb/>
     economic security, neither one or the other, and 
     <lb/>
     responsible government does not mean political 
     <lb/>
     freedom without economic security, because 
     <lb/>
     there can't be such a thing as political freedom 
     <lb/>
     without economic security, and in any case, what 
     <lb/>
     I want in this country and for our people is a form 
     <lb/>
     of government that will mean political freedom 
     <lb/>
     and economic security, both, for one is useless 
     <lb/>
     without the other. I can tell you that is what our 
     <lb/>
     people are looking for. First and foremost our 
     <lb/>
     people are looking for economic prosperity and 
     <lb/>
     security. They are looking for a form of govern<lb break="no"/>
           

    <cb/>
      
ment that will give them those three square meals 
     <lb/>
     a day, and a second suit of clothes, and a tight 
     <lb/>
     roof over their heads, and the chance to rear their 
     <lb/>
     families in Christian decency and frugal comfort. 
     <lb/>
     They are looking for political freedom, but al<lb break="no"/>ways remember that the three square meals and 
     <lb/>
     the rest of it comes first, before the political 
     <lb/>
     freedom. It is a cruel mockery to talk political 
     <lb/>
     freedom to a people who are harassed by want, 
     <lb/>
     and don't know where to turn for the next meal, 
     <lb/>
     a people who are anxious and eager to work, not 
     <lb/>
     lazy, anxious and eager to work, but can't find 
     <lb/>
     work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We will make the biggest mistake of our lives 
     <lb/>
     here in this Convention if we think that our 
     <lb/>
     people are bothering their heads about voting and 
     <lb/>
     elections and governments, or even National 
     <lb/>
     Conventions, ahead of that more pressing prob<lb break="no"/>lem of three square meals a day and a chance by 
     <lb/>
     their labour to live decently as Christian human 
     <lb/>
     beings. No system of government is of the 
     <lb/>
     slightest use to our people unless it gives them 
     <lb/>
     that chance to make their living as decent Chris<lb break="no"/>tians. We here can talk till we are blue in the face 
     <lb/>
     about forms of government, but it will all be a 
     <lb/>
     waste of breath unless we can show the people 
     <lb/>
     that some particular form of government will 
     <lb/>
     give them a better chance to live and rear their 
     <lb/>
     families. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our Newfoundland people have long suffered 
     <lb/>
     from a sense of injustice. They have long felt that 
     <lb/>
     they were denied a square deal. They are unal<lb break="no"/>terably convinced that they have been kept down 
     <lb/>
     all through the decades and centuries. They feel 
     <lb/>
     that they have never gotten a square show in this 
     <lb/>
     country. Our people, sir, are not lazy, they are 
     <lb/>
     hardworking and loyal fathers and husbands. 
     <lb/>
     They ask for nothing big and outrageous and 
     <lb/>
     extravagant, but only a fair chance to earn a fair 
     <lb/>
     living. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Truly this is one country of which it can be 
     <lb/>
     said, "to him that hath shall be added; from him 
     <lb/>
     that hath not, shall be taken away; even the little 
     <lb/>
     that he hath." Our Newfoundlanders look yearn<lb break="no"/>ingly for a new deal. Their deeper instincts cry 
     <lb/>
     out for justice. That is how our people feel and I 
     <lb/>
     share that feeling to the last fibre of me. I am of 
     <lb/>
     the people and for the people of the working 
     <lb/>
     class, to the last drop of my blood in my veins, 
     <lb/>
     the last ounce of flesh on my body. I came from 
     <lb/>
     the working class, I belong to them. My brothers

     toil for a living. I share their feelings and the 
     <lb/>
     feelings of the toiiers of this country. They have 
     <lb/>
     never got a square show and a deliberate attempt 
     <lb/>
     has been made to stack up the powers of govern<lb break="no"/>ment and powers of taxation against them, so as 
     <lb/>
     to keep them down. I share that belief. Ihave no 
     <lb/>
     shame in saying it. There is nothing aristocratic 
     <lb/>
     about me. There is not a single ounce of blue 
     <lb/>
     blood in me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, sir, there is another reason why I shall 
     <lb/>
     vote against Commission government in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. Whatever little help the old mother 
     <lb/>
     country was able to give us when we needed it so 
     <lb/>
     badly before the war — and I repeat that we 
     <lb/>
     should be forever grateful to Britain for what she 
     <lb/>
     gave us before the war — what hope have we of 
     <lb/>
     any help from her in the future, should we need 
     <lb/>
     it? Never, in the history of mankind upon this 
     <lb/>
     earth, never did a country suffer as did the mother 
     <lb/>
     country this past ten years, since 1938. Never did 
     <lb/>
     people sacrifice as the British people sacrificed 
     <lb/>
     and as they are sacrificing today. They gave their 
     <lb/>
     all. They threw it into the fight gladly; they 
     <lb/>
     stripped themselves to the bare bone; everything 
     <lb/>
     went until they were naked and empty of hand. 
     <lb/>
     The whole world has stood in speechless amaze<lb break="no"/>ment over the prodigious sacrifice of the British 
     <lb/>
     people; such effort, such sacrifice and such 
     <lb/>
     courage! I am reminded of the words of Winston 
     <lb/>
     Churchill, "Let no man underrate the abiding 
     <lb/>
     power of the British Empire, not because you see 
     <lb/>
     46 million people on our island harassed about 
     <lb/>
     their food supplies, or because we have difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in re-starting our industries and export trade after 
     <lb/>
     six years of war effort, do not suppose we shall 
     <lb/>
     not come through these dark days as we have 
     <lb/>
     come through the years of the past or that a half 
     <lb/>
     century from now you will not see 70 or 80 
     <lb/>
     million Britons spread about the world united in 
     <lb/>
     the defence of justice and way of life." These are 
     <lb/>
     brave words, sir, and true words. Britain will 
     <lb/>
     come back. Of that I have no doubt. It will not be 
     <lb/>
     soon, but she will receive help from her sons and 
  

            <cb/>
        

     friends around the world and she will strive as no 
     <lb/>
     other people ever strove, and some day she will 
     <lb/>
     stand among the nations of the earth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But meanwhile, we here in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     must vote this spring, this very spring, to decide 
     <lb/>
     what form of government we shall have for our 
     <lb/>
     country. We cannot lean on the old mother 
     <lb/>
     country. We cannot look to her for help. We may 
     <lb/>
     have some in our midst who are satisfied to have 
     <lb/>
     Britain share her poverty with us. We may have 
     <lb/>
     some who would hold on to the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government in the hope that through them 
     <lb/>
     Britain would, out of her own poverty and need, 
     <lb/>
     help us if we should need help. I hope that the 
     <lb/>
     number of such persons is small in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I shall vote for this motion to place these 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government before our people in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum this spring, for I know it is our 
     <lb/>
     people's right to decide. I have no right whatever 
     <lb/>
     to deny our people their right to vote for respon<lb break="no"/>sible government or Commission government if 
     <lb/>
     they wish, and I shall not oppose their having that 
     <lb/>
     right. I shall vote against these two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government myself in the referendum. I shall 
     <lb/>
     hope for a chance to vote for a form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment nearer to their hearts' desire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I move we adjourn until tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     Tuesday.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Might I interject, unless some 
     <lb/>
     members here now intimate they are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     deal with this motion now, it might be as well to 
     <lb/>
     defer it; some members who intend to speak to it 
     <lb/>
     are not ready. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am entirely in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     members. It seems to me you are in a position of 
     <lb/>
     what I may term an unpleasant alternative. The 
     <lb/>
     sands of time are running out and from that 
     <lb/>
     standpoint I must assume that time is of the 
     <lb/>
     essence. However, I am entirely in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     members and with that in mind then, I put the 
     <lb/>
     motion to adjourn.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before proceeding to deal with

     Cashin, arising out of two matters to which you

     directed my attention yesterday afternoon, that I
