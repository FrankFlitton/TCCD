<!-- GL, 2017-03-03, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

 <!--<p>
     Commission of Government or upon its motives. 
     <lb/>
     You can only refer to its suitability as a system, 
     <lb/>
     but not in such a way as to make reference to 
     <lb/>
     individuals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman The point I want to make is that 
     <lb/>
     it is important the road to the beach be attended 
     <lb/>
     to, and for quite a number of years it has not been 
     <lb/>
     kept open. If the report shows $529,000 spent on 
     <lb/>
     nine miles of road, I fail to see how we can have 
     <lb/>
     a transinsular road if it is going to cost $60,000 a 
     <lb/>
     mile. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry I have not spoken in this debate, not 
     <lb/>
     because I am not interested, but because 
     <lb/>
     Labrador was not mentioned in it. I do not feel 
     <lb/>
     that there has been discrimination against 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. We do not want to claim any money to 
     <lb/>
     be spent on opening up the various communities. 
     <lb/>
     We have no roads in Labrador. There are at least 
     <lb/>
     35 miles of good motorable roads in the area of 
     <lb/>
     Goose Bay — Canadian and American — but 
     <lb/>
     apart from that, no roads, as such. We should 
     <lb/>
     spend money to open up the country, but we 
     <lb/>
     should be careful how we apportion the money. 
     <lb/>
     For so small a country to spend a lot of money on 
     <lb/>
     roads, that will not mean very much in opening 
     <lb/>
     up the country, would seem an unwise expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, when we need it so much to develop our 
     <lb/>
     resources and bring prosperity. I am wondering, 
     <lb/>
     when we have spent all those millions of dollars 
     <lb/>
     on roads, how is it going to compare with the 
     <lb/>
     amount the government has spent on fisheries 
     <lb/>
     which are so important to Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I do not think Mr. Smallwood or 
     <lb/>
     anyone else on the Transportation Committee 
     <lb/>
     need worry because there has been so little 
     <lb/>
     criticism. The report is so complete that there is 
     <lb/>
     little room for criticism. I read it during the 
     <lb/>
     Christmas recess, and on the whole their work has 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     been really excellent.... 0n the question of roads, 
     <lb/>
     I am sure we all agree that we should offer 
     <lb/>
     criticism on the amount spent on Avalon Penin<lb break="no"/>sula; it is out of proportion to the amount spent in 
     <lb/>
     other parts of the country. I am thinking of a 
     <lb/>
     funeral I attended at Ireland's Eye¹ during the 
     <lb/>
     summer, when Mr. Toope was buried; they had 
     <lb/>
     to rest the casket on seven different occasions in 
     <lb/>
     order to get across holes where bridges once 
     <lb/>
     were. There has not been a cent spent there in 14 
     <lb/>
     years, If they can spend $500,000 on nine miles, 
     <lb/>
     they should spend money on isolated parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country. Local road committees have done a 
     <lb/>
     great deal, and I agree that the department, on the 
     <lb/>
     whole, has been reasonably liberal to those on the 
     <lb/>
     various committees who are prepared, to some 
     <lb/>
     extent, to help themselves. It is not easy to be<lb break="no"/>come so public-spirited, to take such a com<lb break="no"/>munity interest as to neglect the fishing and 
     <lb/>
     logging in orderto get work done on a 50-50 basis 
     <lb/>
     on the roads. When the government brought in 
     <lb/>
     that policy of spending the money through road 
     <lb/>
     committees, they were thinking in terms of town 
     <lb/>
     councils. They put the cart before the horse. They 
     <lb/>
     should continue to pay the people the rate of $4 
     <lb/>
     a day. I am not complaining because our friend 
     <lb/>
     here says the rate is 58 cents an hour; we have not 
     <lb/>
     been dissatisfied. The people are willing to work 
     <lb/>
     for 40 cents an hour.... I do not think Trinity has 
     <lb/>
     been mentioned. We have been petitioning the 
     <lb/>
     government for the past 25 or 30 years to put a 
     <lb/>
     bridge across the Sound so that Random Island 
     <lb/>
     will become part of Newfoundland also. With 
     <lb/>
     regard to this $6 million for a transinsular road, I 
     <lb/>
     think it will cost at least $10 to $12 million at die 
     <lb/>
     lowest.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The committee rose and reported progress, and 
     <lb/>
     the Convention adjourned]

<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> On page 2, where it says <lb/> "Committees are
                  entitled to grants....", is that <lb/> grant made annually?.... <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, Mr. Chairman, that is the <lb/>amount they
                  give. The experience that I have had <lb/>with the local road committees leads me
                  to think <lb/>that, although $25 per mile, or 25 cents per head <lb/>of the
                  population, is what the government offi<lb break="no"/>cially says it is prepared
                  to grant to local road <lb/>committees, actually they do grant quite a bit
                  <lb/>more than that. So far as I can learn, ... if the <lb/>people of a locality
                  show a genuine interest in <lb/>their own local road problem, and in a way that
                  <lb/>the government likes, i.e., by setting up a local <lb/>road board and showing
                  a definite desire and <lb/>intention to push ahead with local co-operation,
                  <lb/>then in that case, although $25 per mile or 25 <lb/>cents per head is the
                  rule, actually the government <lb/>treats them much more generously. For example,
                  <lb/>if Mr. Harrington will look further down on the <lb/>last page<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> it says that the total value of the repair
                  <lb/>program for local roads and bridges authorised to <lb/>be performed during
                  last year, 1945-46, was <lb/>$179,000. Of this amount the Department of
                  <lb/>Public Works assumed liability for $ 109,000, the <lb/>balance, that is
                  $70,000, being put up by the <lb/>people either in cash or with free labour. In
                  other <lb/>words $109,000 from the government and <lb/>$70,000 from the people in
                  cash or labour. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>Now, at the beginning of the scheme, I under<lb break="no"/>stand the agreement was that the government 
     <lb/>would match the people's money or labour value 
     <lb/>dollar for dollar, but in actual fact they are doing 
     <lb/>much better than that. Then again of course, as 
     <lb/>Mr. Harrington will appreciate, if a local road 
     <lb/>committee is formed it is only because the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of the local roads in a settlement has become 
     <lb/>so bad that the people in desperation get together, 
     <lb/>either led by one of themselves or an official, and 
     <lb/>form a local road committee. When you get a 
     <lb/>committee formed in that way you get a certain 
     <lb/>enthusiasm which results in much better value 
     <lb/>being gotten for the work done than if it were a 
     <lb/>straight out-and-out government project, with the 
     <lb/>government footing all the bills, hiring men and 
     <lb/>paying them wages. So that it's not quite as bad 
     <lb/>as it sounds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I might say $25 a mile is given each <lb/>year provided
                  the committee wants to carry that <lb/>
                  <cb/> out. In other words if $25 is given this year, it <lb/> means that $50 is
                  spent on the road. If they spend <lb/> the same amount next year they may do so,
                  so that <lb/> over a few years the amount spent on that mile of <lb/> road is much
                  more than $25. When those com<lb break="no"/>mittees are formed, it is probably
                  for a number of <lb/> reasons, but one is that when a man sits in an <lb/> office
                  in St. John's, and a community applies for <lb/> a grant, obviously that man
                  cannot answer each <lb/> individual in the community; but if there is a <lb/>
                  representative committee, then the man here <lb/> knows he is dealing with a
                  responsible group of <lb/> people who have taken up the matter already with <lb/>
                  the magistrate or roads superintendent, or some<lb break="no"/>one of that kind.

                  <persName ref="pers:JONE5">Mr. Jones</persName> How is that 25 cents per head basis <lb/> applied
                  to the town councils and their special <lb/> grants? Is it on the same basis?

                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like the answer to that <lb/>
                  question.... I am sure Mr. Butt could answer it. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I drink that as far as town councils are <lb/>concerned
                  it is a matter of dollar for dollar. It may <lb/>be $25 per mile, but it may be
                  very much more. <lb/>For instance, a small community has a small <lb/>piece of
                  road, which having $50 per mile per year <lb/>spent on it would be kept in fairly
                  decent shape, <lb/>but if there is in that community a large bridge <lb/>which
                  requires special attention, then the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is prepared, as I
                  remember it, to give very <lb/>much more so that in some cases it may work out
                  <lb/>a little better than the town councils are getting. <lb/>It depends on the
                  situation. Is that an answer, Mr. <lb/>Jones? <lb/>
               </p>

                  <persName ref="pers:JONE5">Mr. Jones</persName> Yes. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> When it comes to bridge build<lb break="no"/>ing, or repairs of bridges or the provision of <lb/> culverts, I think in that
                  case the government <lb/> provides the material to repair or build the bridge
                  <lb/> or culvert over and above this $25 per mile. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I think you are all wrong about <lb/> that

                  mile or anything <lb/> at all; then the thing got so bad we got after the <lb/>
                  government, and it is only the pastcouple of years <lb/> that we have been getting
                  that. Since then com<lb break="no"/>mittees have started up, and now we are
                  getting <lb/> the $25 per mile or 25 cents per head, Getting <lb/> back to town

            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Smallwood referred to me being <lb/>an authority
                  on local roads, and I believe I can <lb/>claim that honour somewhat, since I have
                  been <lb/>for many years connected with these schemes. I <lb/>was chairman of the
                  first road committee around <lb/>Random.<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> I am
                  chairman of that still and several <lb/>others. Notwithstanding the fact that I
                  have inter<lb break="no"/>ested myself in roads, I am not dead or ready for <lb/>a
                  cemetery, notwithstanding the remarks made <lb/>on the radio last night where they
                  referred to a <lb/>dead Convention and a dead country. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>Regarding these local road committees, first 
     <lb/>there is a magistrate of the district, who is really 
     <lb/>the local government officer today, and very 
     <lb/>useful in that capacity. He has to interest himself 
     <lb/>first in some particular locality, go there, call 
     <lb/>together two or three people and ask them if they 
     <lb/>would interest themselves in forming a local 
     <lb/>roads committee. There must be three, two mem<lb break="no"/>bers and a chairman. They must submit certain 
     <lb/>facts regarding mileage, etc., to the magistrate. 
     <lb/>He turns that over to the officials in St. John's, 
     <lb/>who in turn send back the authority for that local 
     <lb/>road committee to go on with the work, and 
     <lb/>allocate a certain amount of money to it. The 
     <lb/>amount is really very much better than $25 per 
     <lb/>mile or 25 cents per person. I may say that al<lb break="no"/>though I have been most critical of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government, I can hand it out to them 
     <lb/>there, they have done very good work, Never 
     <lb/>have I had a request turned down.... I cannot find 
     <lb/>words too hard to criticise them for their neglect 
     <lb/>of these outside places for ten or twelve years, but 
     <lb/>today I must be fair; if the people get together and 
     <lb/>show a spirit to help themselves, the Department 
     <lb/>of Public Works will definitely go the other half 
     <lb/>way and much farther to help them....

            <p><persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> Mr. Chairman, debating in this <lb/>Convention,
                  whether termed sensible or silly by <lb/>the observer, is fast becoming as real as
                  the <lb/>measles and twice as much fun. Yesterday Mr. <lb/>Smallwood literally
                  said, "Come on fellows <lb/>wade in with a flying tackle and a body slam and
                  <lb/>give 'em all you've got." However, try as he <lb/>might, the chairman of the
                  Transportation Com<lb break="no"/>mittee could work up no enthusiasm, and there
                  <lb/>was a marked reluctance on the part of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention to do
                  any in-fighting with the bureau. <lb/>crats or their subordinates in the
                  Commission of <lb/>
                  <cb/> Government. Even Mr. Hollett, who is generally <lb/> in the thick of the
                  battle, and who, when his stock <lb/> of prose runs out, can always quote
                  trenchant <lb/> lines from Milton's poetic pen, was not in his <lb/> usual
                  fighting mood. Two months ago I said that <lb/> with the facts at present at my
                  command, if a <lb/> plebiscite were held tomorrow, I would vote for <lb/> a
                  retention of the present form of government. <lb/> Now, like my learned friend,
                  Mr. Higgins, I too <lb/> have to make an apology for a former statement <lb/> made
                  in this House, and I do apologise for saying <lb/> that. It was my intention to
                  reserve judgement <lb/> until I had time to study other reports, but after a <lb/>
                  study of the Gander airport, tourist and railway <lb/> sections of the report, I
                  am fully satisfied in my <lb/> own mind that the policies of the present ad<lb break="no"/>ministration not only do not make sense, but that <lb/> they are
                  made without any proper consideration <lb/> for either the fisherman, the farmer
                  or the <lb/> labourer of this country. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I term Gander airport a liability. The refusal 
     <lb/>
     of the government to co-operate with the Tourist 
     <lb/>
     Board for the further development of that in<lb break="no"/>dustry was unwise and poor business. I cannot 
     <lb/>
     talk with any degree of exactitude on the railway. 
     <lb/>
     My district is not even remotely connected with 
     <lb/>
     a railroad town, and to us, when en route to the 
     <lb/>
     capital with its paved roads and magnificent 
     <lb/>
     highways, the sight of the old train engine puffing 
     <lb/>
     down the grade from Glenwood into Gambo Sta<lb break="no"/>tion is as welcome as a rich uncle back from 
     <lb/>
     Australia, especially after we have beaten 
     <lb/>
     through 40 miles of country on what's usually a 
     <lb/>
     two day trip in winter by boat, dogs and horses. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if the seriousness of the need for com<lb break="no"/>munications to the northern outports is apparent 
     <lb/>
     to this Convention. Mr. Newell touched on the 
     <lb/>
     fringe of that yesterday, and Mr. Roberts, speak<lb break="no"/>ing with the courage of his convictions, said in 
     <lb/>
     effect, forget that transinsular highway, and first 
     <lb/>
     concentrate on connecting up with civilisation 
     <lb/>
     some of our godforsaken outport communities. 
     <lb/>
     Since some of you did get, to quote my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell, "district minded" yesterday, you will 
     <lb/>
     permit me to be sectional for a moment and 
     <lb/>
     acquaint you with the appalling situation as 
     <lb/>
     regards roads in Bonavista North. Let's assume 
     <lb/>
     that a fisherman from, say, Lumsden is told by 
     <lb/>
     our hospital doctor that his wife needs 
     <lb/>
     hospitalisation at St. John's. The first thing he 
           
   
<note xml:id="fn_04">[1] On Random Island, Trinity Bay.</note>

     does is to take the patient ten miles by boat to 
     <lb/>
     Newtown; there he connects with another small 
     <lb/>
     boat, and that hospital patient is then subjected to 
     <lb/>
     six hours at sea before reaching railhead at 
     <lb/>
     Gambo. There is no road in summer connecting 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden with Newtown, Wesleyville or Brook<lb break="no"/>field. If a patient is to be removed from any 
     <lb/>
     intermediate point between Hare Bay and Brook<lb break="no"/>field on the south side of the bay, or from 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden to Brookfield, the site of the cottage 
     <lb/>
     hospital, that patient must be taken to hospital by 
     <lb/>
     boat along what is perhaps the roughest coast in 
     <lb/>
     the island. I repeat that no road connects any of 
     <lb/>
     the above settlements to the Brookfield cottage 
     <lb/>
     hospital. True, the Wesleyville town council has 
     <lb/>
     built a road from there to Brookfield, and on to 
     <lb/>
     the adjoining settlement of Badger's Quay, but 
     <lb/>
     actually no roads exist from Musgrave Harbour 
     <lb/>
     to Hare Bay, and in that district live 15,000 
     <lb/>
     people, all taxpayers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not trying to avoid the acute angle when 
     <lb/>
     I say that the proposed estimates for road expen<lb break="no"/>ditures are more than just unfair, they are an insult 
     <lb/>
     to the hard-working, forgotten people of our out<lb break="no"/>port districts. Let's get the picture clear; over 
     <lb/>
     $500,000 for the reconditioning and recon<lb break="no"/>struction of the St. John's-Topsail highroad — a 
     <lb/>
     distance of only a little over nine miles. The 
     <lb/>
     estimates call for another half million within the 
     <lb/>
     near future, and a proposed $6 million for a 
     <lb/>
     transinsular highroad from the capital to Port- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     aux-Basques. This indeed must be pleasant news 
     <lb/>
     for the thousands of fishermen and their families 
     <lb/>
     on the coastline What earthly benefit will this be 
     <lb/>
     to them? Yes, it's just about time that some of us 
     <lb/>
     had a change of mind, or it were better to have no 
     <lb/>
     minds at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. Chairman, the roads section of your report <lb/> is very informative, but I was
                  somewhat amused <lb/> to note, I believe it was on page 2,<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> highroads <lb/> from Bonavista Peninsula west to Cape Freels, <lb/>
                  480 miles. Now only last week I covered that <lb/> section of my district, and if
                  this is a statement of <lb/> fact, it is the quickest piece of road construction
                  <lb/> ever done by the utilities department. Actually it <lb/> must have been
                  built since Christmas Day, for <lb/> there is no road of any kind, highroads or
                  low <lb/> roads connecting Cape Freels with anywhere. Of <lb/> course the
                  department meant a district, and we <lb/> must not assume that they plan some
                  expenditure <lb/>
                  <cb/> out there. The expenditure under all headings of <lb/> roads is presently
                  running around $2.5 million. <lb/> This is not at all adequate to the need, but as
                  <lb/> someone suggested, there may be waste and un<lb break="no"/>necessary
                  reconditioning. Maybe our good <lb/> friends over the way (I refer to the Avalon
                     Penin<lb break="no"/>sula) would consent to drive a little slower, and <lb/>
                  thus allow a little trickle of that million to be <lb/> channelled down to
                  Bonavista or to Mr. Watton's <lb/> district. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     If any progress is to be made in this country 
     <lb/>
     we must have new industries, and we must first 
     <lb/>
     open up our communications. The magnitude of 
     <lb/>
     the task of road building in this country I ap<lb break="no"/>preciate, but am not convinced that a government 
     <lb/>
     that can spend $1 million on the St. John's-Con<lb break="no"/>ception Bay highroad, and forget altogether the 
     <lb/>
     outport districts, is working in the best interest of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as a whole; and I go further and 
     <lb/>
     say that such a government has outlived its use<lb break="no"/>fulness, and its policies should call for the cen<lb break="no"/>sure of every patriotic Newfoundlander. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. Chairman, if this Convention is to be more <lb/> than a woman's story at a
                  winter's fire, it must <lb/> come out in the open and expose those perfidious
                  <lb/> wrongs — the Gander airport agreement, the <lb/> refusal to co-operate with
                  the Tourist Board, the <lb/> supposedly fat concessions granted to the foreign
                  <lb/> corporations, the unfair expenditure and alloca<lb break="no"/>tion of
                  monies to construct and recondition roads, <lb/> and a thousand other things that
                  should and must <lb/> be known. This is a new year, a year of hope, and <lb/> to
                  Newfoundlanders everywhere I say, let's all <lb/> resolve that we will exercise
                  our rights as native <lb/> sons to have and to hold what is rightfully ours, <lb/>
                  and to demand now that these bureaucrats and <lb/> their agents render unto Caesar
                  the things that are <lb/> Caesar's. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     The people of Bonavista North, the people of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Starkes' district, the people of Mr. Roberts' 
     <lb/>
     district, must have been amused yesterday to hear 
     <lb/>
     certain city delegates jump to the defence of the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure on roads on the Avalon. 1 would 
     <lb/>
     remind this House that the people of the outports 
     <lb/>
     are no servile race, and they have certain in<lb break="no"/>alienable rights that will not be denied them. I 
     <lb/>
     once read that the whole economic stmcture of 
     <lb/>
     this island was controlled by a few families in the 
     <lb/>
     capital. This may or may not be true, yet I often 
     <lb/>
     wonder just how much of a stranglehold might be

            </p>

            <p>
     The condition of roads in Newfoundland out<lb break="no"/>ports beggars description. In scores of northern 
     <lb/>
     settlements there are no roads to the schools, no 
     <lb/>
     roads to the churches, no roads to the cemeteries, 
     <lb/>
     yet with a callous indifference to the dire need of 
     <lb/>
     the people, the present government squanders 
     <lb/>
     what, to the country, is a fabulous amount on 
     <lb/>
     what is more or less a luxury road, a super-high- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     way. There are no Superlatives that I can think of 
     <lb/>
     at the moment that will convey the denunciation 
     <lb/>
     of such a policy, that I would here like to say that 
     <lb/>
     it shows the dictatorial power of the present 
     <lb/>
     government, and should make clear to every 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander residing in the outports at least, 
     <lb/>
     that it's high time to tell the Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     that sailing time is here for their colonial ad<lb break="no"/>ministration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> The subject of roads touches the <lb/> hearts and
                  minds of every settlement in the <lb/> country. I do not know just how the late
                  policy of <lb/> the government affects the different settlements <lb/> in the
                  outports, but I do know how it affects the <lb/> people of Carbonear and vicinity.
                  Fourteen years <lb/> ago the local roads in the town of Carbonear and <lb/>
                  outside were in good condition owing to the <lb/> painstaking efforts, of our
                  local road boards, with <lb/> grants so small and limited that they really had to
                  <lb/> scratch for it. Today all these local roads are <lb/> washed out and
                  destroyed at a time when money <lb/> is flush in government departments; so much
                  so <lb/> that if the people only could know the actual cost <lb/> of the two to
                  three mile section of the Tilton <lb/> highway for the past four years, the
                  surprise <lb/> would be really greater proportionately than the <lb/> revelation
                  of the cost of the nine mile Topsail <lb/> highway. In the town of Carbonear, the
                  roads are <lb/> not only destroyed, but the public sewer serving <lb/> the court
                  house building is in such a condition <lb/> that it is now a menace to public
                  health as well as <lb/> being a dangerous trap for pedestrians. A town <lb/>
                  council is the answer, they say! For some of us <lb/> who have been repairing
                  local roads at our own <lb/> cost for a decade, a town council could have been
                  <lb/> negotiated if our citizens had been helped in their <lb/> endeavours....
                  Anyway, we are hoping for better <lb/> results in the near future. Outside our
                  town I <lb/> know the people of the settlements will be bitter <lb/> over the
                  condition of their local roads. May I <lb/>
                  <cb/> suggest that some of the wasted money be ap<lb break="no"/>plied, under
                  proper supervision, to local roads? <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> Mr. Chairman, before making a few <lb/>comments I
                  would like to compliment the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Transportation
                  Committee on their <lb/>very informative report, and their chairman on <lb/>the
                  very able manner in which he is piloting it <lb/>through committee of the whole.
                  The report may <lb/>not contain all the facts we would like to see, but <lb/>then
                  we must bear in mind the limitations under <lb/>which all committees function.
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I listened yesterday with much interest, but the 
     <lb/>
     debate was not of a very high order; to me it 
     <lb/>
     flavoured too much of politics, and too little of 
     <lb/>
     its economic significance. It reminded me of the 
     <lb/>
     old political days, when the man who could talk 
     <lb/>
     the most about roads and make the most 
     <lb/>
     promises, had the edge on the other fellow. I feel 
     <lb/>
     it is our business to raise the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     report from the mire of politics to the realm of our 
     <lb/>
     country's economy, and discuss it purely in that 
     <lb/>
     light. It is time for us to realise that unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     there is nothing we can do regarding the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the present government, but the facts con<lb break="no"/>tained in this report should be stressed insofar as 
     <lb/>
     they effect our economy, and will likely in<lb break="no"/>fluence our final recommendations. I would state 
     <lb/>
     here, however, that I consider the allocation of 
     <lb/>
     public monies for roads altogether dispropor<lb break="no"/>tionate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the opening of the Convention I sought 
     <lb/>
     information relative to the government's policy 
     <lb/>
     in respect to local roads. I am pleased to find that 
     <lb/>
     in the appendix to this report, their policy for 
     <lb/>
     local roads as introduced in 1943 is fully outlined, 
     <lb/>
     and I hope that the public will avail of the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of becoming conversant with it, because I 
     <lb/>
     fear it is a scheme to which the labouring man 
     <lb/>
     very often finds it difficult to reconcile himself, 
     <lb/>
     with the result that we often find him antagonistic 
     <lb/>
     to the road committee which is working in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the community, and without 
     <lb/>
     remuneration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I contend that the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     have neglected the local roads and allocated far 
     <lb/>
     too little of the $2.5 million they have spent on 
     <lb/>
     roads for this upkeep, with the result that the 
     <lb/>
     majority of local roads today are almost impass<lb break="no"/>able, a condition which is yearly becoming more 
     <lb/>
     expensive to remedy, and is a matter of much 
     <lb/>
     concern to a large number of people in the various

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> ....I understand that I do not enjoy <lb/> the
                  ancient rights and privileges that I once did <lb/> when I was an elected
                  representative during <lb/> responsible government. I know I can be sued for <lb/>
                  making statements contrary to the law of the land, <lb/> but my first statement on
                  roads in this country is <lb/> this. It is my firm opinion that practically all
                  roads <lb/> built so far have been undertaken through pull <lb/> with the
                  government in power at the time. The <lb/> report should make the head of every
                  member of <lb/> this Convention hang in shame, to see how such <lb/> large sums
                  collected from all over the country <lb/> have been spent on such small territory
                  as the <lb/> Avalon Peninsula. I feel ashamed after reading <lb/> this report, and
                  seeing how and where the hard- <lb break="yes"/> earned revenue collected from the
                  actual <lb/> producers of this country has been spent; and in <lb/> the same
                  spirit I feel that the men sent here by <lb/> other districts, including the men
                  representing the <lb/> districts that have received such great benefits, <lb/>
                  actually do feel ashamed, when they see how <lb/> unfairly the majority of them
                  has been treated I <lb/> must refer to a statement made yesterday by Mr. <lb/>
                  Gordon Higgins.... His statement hit me hard, and <lb/> I am compelled to take
                  exception to it. He said, <lb/> when talking on roads, "Avalon first and the rest
                  <lb/> of the country after. We bow the knee to nobody <lb/> as far as that is
                  concerned." I certainly give Mr. <lb/> Higgins great credit for making that
                  statement. Is <lb/> there anything he could say that would make him <lb/> more
                  popular on the Avalon Peninsula? But are <lb/> we, the representatives sent here
                  by the actual <lb/> producers, the actual salt of the earth (and we all <lb/> know
                  what that means) from the districts where <lb/> roads are unknown, are we going to
                  come here <lb/> and still allow that thing to go on — "Avalon first <lb/> and the
                  rest of the country afterwards"? <lb/> Gentlemen, if all were of my mind, we would
                  see <lb/> that it would be equal rights for all, and not <lb/> special rights for
                  the Avalon. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I am surprised that the remarks of Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     did not provoke some discussion.... Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     said that the St. John's members were not hang<lb break="no"/>ing their heads in shame over the tremendous 
     <lb/>
     sums of money that had gone out to give St. 
     <lb/>
     John's and neighbourhood all these roads. I come 
     <lb/>
     from a district where there are more people with 
     <lb/>
     broken legs and arms, broken by falling over 
     <lb/>
     rocks and boulders, than any other district in the 
     <lb/>
     country.... What do we find when it comes to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     productive industries in this country? You find 
     <lb/>
     that the great bulk of these industries are in those 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country that have got practically no 
     <lb/>
     roads. It is not in St. John's that you find the bulk 
     <lb/>
     of our great fisheries. It's not in St. John's that 
     <lb/>
     you find the great bulk of our forests, or of our 
     <lb/>
     other productive industries. It's out around the 
     <lb/>
     country, where little or no government money is 
     <lb/>
     being spent on roads. Where would St. John's be 
     <lb/>
     and what roads would they have, if we took the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries away from them? If we took the great 
     <lb/>
     Buchans mine away from them? If we took the 
     <lb/>
     great Grand Falls industry away from them? If 
     <lb/>
     they didn't have the great Comer Brook and 
     <lb/>
     Humber Valley to depend on? These are the 
     <lb/>
     things that keep St. John's going. Suppose we 
     <lb/>
     divided Newfoundland into two separate 
     <lb/>
     countries — the Avalon Peninsula forming one 
     <lb/>
     country, and the rest of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador forming another. Where would the 
     <lb/>
     Avalon Peninsula be then? Who would have most 
     <lb/>
     of the roads in that case? It wouldn't be the 
     <lb/>
     Avalon Peninsula. If you took a photograph of 
     <lb/>
     the Avalon from the air, what you'd get would be 
     <lb/>
     a big web with a spider in the middle of it — and 
     <lb/>
     the spider would be St. John's. I am not advocat<lb break="no"/>ing that Newfoundland be separated into two 
     <lb/>
     countries. I am advocating that the rest of the 
     <lb/>
     country should get a good share of whatever 
     <lb/>
     money is going for roads and other public im<lb break="no"/>provements.... Before they build more beautiful 
     <lb/>
     paved roads around Conception Bay they should 
     <lb/>
     first see that the people of the rest of the island 
     <lb/>
     get half-decent roads to travel over and transport 
     <lb/>
     their produce. I hope Mr. Higgins won't think 
     <lb/>
     that I am making an attack upon him or upon his 
     <lb/>
     St. John's colleagues, or upon the members who 
     <lb/>
     come here from Avalon Peninsula districts. All I 
     <lb/>
     am trying to do is to put in a claim for the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the island.... 
     <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think it would be rather discour<lb break="no"/>teous to say the least of it, if I did not answer our <lb/> friend across the
                  way. I want to make my position <lb/> quite clear in the matter. Yesterday the
                  convenor <lb/> of the Committee was a little worried about <lb/> having no comment
                  on his report. He has harped <lb/> on the fact that the Avalon was getting so much
                  <lb/> money, and because of that suggestion, I suppose <lb/> Mr. Starkes and our
                  other good friend Mr. Vin<lb break="no"/>cent over there, have taken to heart the
                     insinua<lb break="no"/>tion that this highroad was built for the people in

    Topsail. I am not one of the Topsail nabobs,
                  like <lb/> some of my friends near me are! Apart from that, <lb/> the district I
                  represent does not get any money for <lb/> roads whatever. By the grace of the
                  municipal <lb/> council we have the finest roads in the country, <lb/> and we do
                  not have to bother what government <lb/> comes into power. I don't know, I am
                  trusting my <lb/> memory on this, but I believe the highroads <lb/> policy was
                  instituted in 1924. Is that right Mr. <lb/> Chairman? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> 1925. That policy was instituted <lb/> by the
                  people here, chiefly made up for the roads <lb/> through the Avalon. I would not
                  like to undertake <lb/> any comment on that. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We can hardly blame Mr. Starkes, <lb/> although I
                  think he was one of the people who <lb/> subscribed to that highroads policy; but
                  certainly <lb/> there are members in this House today who agree <lb/> that that
                  road was to be built not for the St. John's <lb/> people, but for the whole
                  peninsula. I do agree it <lb/> is a pity that we can't have a series of roads
                  <lb/> through all the places, but that's going to be in <lb/> the future. You have
                  got to depend on your local <lb/> roads committees for that. I am strong in my
                  <lb/> advocacy of a transinsular highroad. I don' t know <lb/> if you can do that
                  for $6 million, but if so it will <lb/> be money well spent. In that event you can
                  have <lb/> Mr. Starkes come up from Nipper's Harbour and <lb/> come in to St.
                  John's by bus, if he lives long <lb/> enough.... It will develop the country and
                  pay for <lb/> itself.... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Mr. Chairman, much discussion has <lb/> taken place
                  since this report has been presented <lb/> regarding the Railway, the amount of
                  money that <lb/> it is costing the country, and especially the loss <lb/> which
                  reaches the tidy sum of $1.5 million. Of <lb/> course, the greatest concern to the
                  Convention is <lb/> to try and devise ways and means to reduce this, <lb/> so that
                  we may be able to recommend our find <lb/> ings to the present or future form of
                  government. <lb/> I understand that in 1938 there were certain con<lb break="no"/>cessions granted to Bowater's Newfoundland <lb/> Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd. by
                  the present form of <lb/> government, and this also, I take it, applies to the
                  <lb/> Anglo-Newfoundland Co. and Buchans Mining <lb/> company. We are all aware of
                  the tremendous <lb/> rise in operating costs since 1938.... Due to rising <lb/>
                  costs, labour has agitated for and received in<lb break="no"/>creases in wages to
                  offset conditions as much as <lb/> possible. I think we will agree that where a
                     com<lb break="no"/>pany contributes an enormous amount of busi<lb break="no"/><cb/>ness to the Railway, it is human nature to expect <lb/> some special
                  consideration or concessions. In <lb/> other words, it is a matter as I see it of
                  wholesale <lb/> and retail prices.... Now, Mr. Chairman, can you <lb/> imagine
                  that our government of today is applying <lb/> concessions to those companies
                  which might <lb/> have been suitable in 1938, but are out of all <lb/> proportion
                  today. It does seem businesslike that <lb/> in view of the high cost of operating
                  the Railway, <lb/> the government should have negotiated with the <lb/> various
                  companies for an adjustment upwards in <lb/> the rates.... But I warn the powers
                  that be that the <lb/> general public will not accept further taxation <lb/> while
                  wealthy corporations are getting off with a <lb/> mere trifle. The Railway cannot
                  pay under such <lb/> circumstances. The increases should rest on the <lb/>
                  shoulders of those who can afford to bear them. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>With regard to roads, I am well aware that 
     <lb/>roads are a necessity, but they should be built in 
     <lb/>sections where they serve the greatest number of 
     <lb/>people, and not through a wilderness. The first 
     <lb/>necessity today is local roads, and roads linking 
     <lb/>up with the railway. It is all very well to talk of a 
     <lb/>highroad through the country, but we must cut 
     <lb/>our garment according to our cloth. I am sure that 
     <lb/>outport doctors will agree with me. Let me tell 
     <lb/>you of one instance that came to my notice last 
     <lb/>year. There is a settlement in Bay of Islands 
     <lb/>called Cox's Cove, which has no road connection 
     <lb/>with Corner Brook.... There was a shortage of 
     <lb/>food, such as sugar, milk and other necessities. It 
     <lb/>was impossible to get these items due to lack of 
     <lb/>road communication and the result it cost the 
     <lb/>businessman $15 additional freight on three 
     <lb/>sacks of sugar from Corner Brook to Cox's Cove, 
     <lb/>a distance of approximately 12 miles, which 
     <lb/>meant that those poor people had to pay in the 
     <lb/>neighbourhood of 20 cents per pound for sugar.... 
     <lb/>It is my firm conviction that people who are 
     <lb/>forced to live in remote places should be given 
     <lb/>first consideration and provided with a road con<lb break="no"/>nection with the railway at least. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>we need men with full realisation of these facts, 
     <lb/>men of vision, not those who build castles in the 
     <lb/>air, but those who can turn their visions into 
     <lb/>reality.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, it may be <lb/> thought that some
                  of the statements made in this <lb/> chamber are not relevant to the job we were
                  sent <lb/> here to do. Perhaps some of the debates on mat<lb break="no"/>ters
                  brought up are not exactly in order, but where

     else can the representatives of the people voice <lb/>
                  their statements except in this chamber? I would <lb/> urge that people should not
                  be too critical when <lb/> we voice our opinions about these different mat<lb break="no"/>ters. We know the roads are the arteries which <lb/> carry the
                  products of industry, and realise also we <lb/> should have a good sound grant as
                  regards our <lb/> system of transportation. These roads help to <lb/> open up the
                  country and connect settlements with <lb/> each other. The amount of money which
                  this <lb/> country can justifiably expend annually on roads <lb/> and bridges is a
                  matter for great consideration. I <lb/> would like to have fixed in my mind what
                  is the <lb/> right percentage of our revenue that we can an<lb break="no"/>nually
                  expend on roads and bridges.... It seems to <lb/> me also that the transinsular
                  road may be a good <lb/> idea. Anyway, from Port-aux-Basques to Hum<lb break="no"/>ber there should be a good road. I believe there <lb/> are a large number of
                  Americans and Canadians <lb/> — monied men — who are prepared to come with <lb/>
                  their wives and families and spend some of that <lb/> money in Newfoundland, and I
                  think it would be <lb/> a good idea to have that section so that these <lb/>
                  people can come in with their cars and use our <lb/> roads down to the Humber
                  where they can go <lb/> fishing. Another section which should be com<lb break="no"/>pleted is from Gander to Lewisporte. The <lb/> Canadian government spent a large
                  sum on that <lb/> road, but it is not completed... Speaking of <lb/> Lewisporte, I
                  would like to take up the matter of <lb/> placing Lewisporte on the main line of
                  railway. <lb/> Whoever heard of a terminal not on the main <lb/> line? There are
                  nine miles of railroad and there <lb/> should be a spur line. I advocated that 20
                  years <lb/> ago.... I feel very strongly on this Lewispone <lb/>matter because
                  this year I had to leave the express <lb/>at Notre Dame Junction, and had to stay
                  there <lb/>overnight to go that nine miles. It would not be <lb/>tolerated in a
                  good many countries, and I hope the <lb/>Commission of Government will consider
                  the <lb/>amount of traffic that goes through Lewisporte. <lb/>It is a big terminus
                  — the Imperial Oil Co. and <lb/>the Shell Oil Co. have tanks there; there are a
                  lot <lb/>of boats; and now that the railway is to be con<lb break="no"/>verted
                  from coal to oil, they would save money. <lb/>They should make a detour and put
                  Lewisporte <lb/>on the main line.... <lb/>
               </p>

    

            <p>
     I would like to know how many miles this 
     <lb/>
     money was spent on as regards local roads — <lb/> how many miles of road were covered by this 
     <lb/>
     small expenditure of money? 
     <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We have not got that informa<lb break="no"/>tion. We could easily get it. No doubt the returns <lb/> are in the department.

               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That information would be <lb/>helpful. I am a
                  firm believer in town councils and <lb/>self-help as regards local roads. People
                  are inter<lb break="no"/>ested in their own communities, and prepared to <lb/>give
                  free labour or pay an amount of taxes, and <lb/>in the spring of the year when
                  people are not so <lb/>busily engaged they will put in a few hours of <lb/>work on
                  the roads.... <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I concur entirely with the remarks <lb/>of Mr. Fudge,
                  my colleague here. It is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary for me to go further into
                  the details of the <lb/>road conditions in the Humber district. We are <lb/>well
                  aware of them. and you have been told a <lb/>good deal about them by Mr. Fudge,
                  and I want <lb/>to go on record as supporting him heartily. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yesterday it was Mr. Jackman, <lb/>I think, who
                  wanted to have some information as <lb/>to the rates of pay of workers on
                  highroads <lb/>work.... The department tells me that their policy <lb/>in
                  employing men on the highroads for labour is <lb/>to pay whatever rate of wages is
                  prevailing in <lb/>each area where any road work is done. They <lb/>have a minimum
                  of 40 cents an hour, but in St. <lb/>John's they pay 55 cents an hour. Out on the
                  west <lb/>coast they pay 58 cents, because that is the <lb/>prevailing rate out
                  there. In the Grand Falls area, <lb/>where I understand the prevailing rate for
                     com<lb break="no"/>mon labour is 70 cents an hour, I assume the rate <lb/>paid
                  common labour by the highroads division is <lb/>the same.... <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> The prevailing rate on Bell Island <lb/>unless it
                  has changed during the past six or eight <lb/>weeks, is 68 cents an hour, and the
                  prevailing rate <lb/>for highroads employees is 40 cents an hour.... <lb/>That
                  rate has been paid for the past five years. <lb/>The union rate has been between
                  58 cents and 60 <lb/>cents, and the highroads rate has been 40 cents an <lb/>hour

     to write an account for the papers tomorrow, or 
     <lb/>
     if I were a radio commentator expected to go on 
     <lb/>
     the air tonight and describe this debate, I think 
     <lb/>
     that, with my knowledge of this country, I would 
     <lb/>
     be deeply impressed by the debate of yesterday 
     <lb/>
     and today. To hear 40-odd men, elected from 37 
     <lb/>
     districts, come in and bear out a united and unan<lb break="no"/>imous story of neglect of roads that once existed 
     <lb/>
     and have disappeared, that have been washed 
     <lb/>
     away by the floods and storms, and have had 
     <lb/>
     practically no money spent on them for a dozen 
     <lb/>
     years, I think I would be deeply impressed by the 
     <lb/>
     fact that here is an island which, except for a few 
     <lb/>
     highroads, is practically without roads, and I 
     <lb/>
     would not feel in the least like ridiculing the 
     <lb/>
     elected representatives from those districts. I 
     <lb/>
     would know enough about the conditions of this 
     <lb/>
     country to know that these members were speak<lb break="no"/>ing the views of the 318,000 men, women and 
     <lb/>
     children of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, this appendix prepared for us by the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Public Utilities describes the new 
     <lb/>
     system which the government has brought into 
     <lb/>
     existence in the past couple of years for dealing 
     <lb/>
     with local roads. I am not disposed to ridicule the 
     <lb/>
     scheme the government has worked out. It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me that behind this plan of working up these 
     <lb/>
     local road boards, of which we now have about 
     <lb/>
     400 involving, I suppose, between 400 and 500 
     <lb/>
     settlements, there is something more than merely 
     <lb/>
     forming committees to handle local roads. Be<lb break="no"/>hind it is a plan to get the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to take a more active part and interest 
     <lb/>
     in the public affairs of their country. It may turn 
     <lb/>
     out, when all ... the reports have been considered 
     <lb/>
     by this small batch of Newfoundlanders, that we 
     <lb/>
     will recommend some form of elected govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or it may turn out that we will recommend 
     <lb/>
     that we go right on under Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment, we don't know yet. Let us say that we 
     <lb/>
     recommend some form of elected government. 
     <lb/>
     What gentleman in this chamber today, or out of 
     <lb/>
     it, would be willing to be a member of that 
     <lb/>
     government of the future, knowing that there 
     <lb/>
     were 1,300 settlements with, at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     3,000 miles of local road (that's only a guess) 
     <lb/>
     which have to be taken care of? What member 
     <lb/>
     would wish to be a member of a government, if 
     <lb/>
     that government had to find every dollar to keep 
     <lb/>
     up those 3,000 miles of local roads? I feel that no 
     <lb/>
     one would want to do that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     For that reason I am delighted to see an effort 
     <lb/>
     made to work up these local road committees, not 
     <lb/>
     merely for the sake of getting the people inter<lb break="no"/>ested in their own local affairs with regard to 
     <lb/>
     roads and bridges, but also for getting these same 
     <lb/>
     people more actively interested in public affairs 
     <lb/>
     generally. One of the weaknesses of this country 
     <lb/>
     in the past has been the fact that we had in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland only one government, namely the 
     <lb/>
     central government in the city of St. John's. They 
     <lb/>
     tell me that you cannot get more than 60 miles 
     <lb/>
     from the salt water anywhere in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     But from St. John's to some parts of this country 
     <lb/>
     it might as well be 2-3,000 miles. This means that 
     <lb/>
     St. John's and the government here know practi<lb break="no"/>cally nothing of what goes on in the country. If 
     <lb/>
     you are going to have democracy and efficient 
     <lb/>
     government, you have got to enlist the people of 
     <lb/>
     the country in it, and to do that they have at least 
     <lb/>
     made a beginning in the formation of these road 
     <lb/>
     committees. I know it is pitiful to think of 
     <lb/>
     $109,000 voted by the government to assist these 
     <lb/>
     local road committees. It only scratches the sur<lb break="no"/>face of the problem, but it is a beginning. I hope 
     <lb/>
     that people in the settlements where they still 
     <lb/>
     have no local road committees, as they listen in 
     <lb/>
     to these broadcasts, many of them finding out, 
     <lb/>
     maybe for the first time, that there is a way in 
     <lb/>
     which they can get a few dollars from the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I hope that they also will get awake and 
     <lb/>
     active and form their road committees. Who 
     <lb/>
     knows but that these local road committees may 
     <lb/>
     some day develop into a first class form of local 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will say that this Convention is supposed to 
     <lb/>
     consider not only roads, but everything else, in 
     <lb/>
     the light of one great question: will the future 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland, whether it be 
     <lb/>
     Commission or anything else, be able to balance 
     <lb/>
     its budget? If it can't, we are up against it. In 
     <lb/>
     trying to decide whether or not the future govern<lb break="no"/>ment can balance its budget we must, whether we 
     <lb/>
     like it or not, we must find out as far as we can 
     <lb/>
     what the future expenditure of the government 
     <lb/>
     has got to be. Now, so far as the Transportation 
     <lb/>
     and Communications Committee is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     that is exactly what we have been trying to do. In 
     <lb/>
     our report on Gander we have told you that so far 
     <lb/>
     as we can see, the country is saddled with a loss 
     <lb/>
     of $1 million a year; that as far as the Railway is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, a loss of $1.5 million a year. So far as 
         
            <pb n="245" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-01-10_Page_0245.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">245</fw>
           
     roads are concerned, we must spend at least $1 
     <lb/>
     million a year in future, no matter what govern<lb break="no"/>ment we have. If that is wasting time, then I don't 
     <lb/>
     know what I am here in this Convention for. Is it 
     <lb/>
     wasting time to try and get a picture of what these 
     <lb/>
     activities will cost us? If it is wasting time, will 
     <lb/>
     some radio commentator tell me just what this 
     <lb/>
     Convention is for? Will some of the critics tell 
     <lb/>
     me just what is the function of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are not great statesmen, we have not had 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of having been trained in the Fiji 
     <lb/>
     Islands, or to be the products of the Colonial 
     <lb/>
     service: we are just ordinary Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     sent in here to examine the various departments 
     <lb/>
     of government — what they have spent in the 
     <lb/>
     past, and what they are liable to spend in the 
     <lb/>
     future. That is what we are trying to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I am of the opinion, that pos<lb break="no"/>sibly only within the last few days, since this <lb/> debate has gone over the
                  air, that in certain iso<lb break="no"/>lated parts of Newfoundland has it been
                  known <lb/> that the government has this plan as regards local <lb/> roads. If
                  that is not so, how can we explain the <lb/> small expenditure which has been made
                  up to the <lb/> present time?.... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, before this sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the Transportation and Communications <lb/> Committee's report — the
                  Railway section — is <lb/> left by the Convention, I'd like to make one or <lb/>
                  two comments on it that appear not to have been <lb/> considered by the Committee.
                  Perhaps they did <lb/> not feel it came within their province — perhaps <lb/> they
                  did not think of it — I shouldn't wonder at <lb/> that, considering the vast
                  amount of data they <lb/> gathered and had to try and assimilate. The point <lb/>
                  I mention arises from a statement of the General <lb/> Manager of the Railway
                  contained on page 6: <lb/> "The General Manager states that the main line <lb/>
                  needs retailing, that seven new locomotives, and <lb/> some new rolling stock must
                  soon be purchased. <lb/> These expenditures, which cannot it seems, long <lb/>be
                  delayed, will run up into millions of dollars." <lb/>
               </p>

    

    

            <p>
     The Newfoundland Railway in recent years 
     <lb/>
     has come in for a great deal of criticism, some of 
     <lb/>
     it deserved, a lot of it unthinking, a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     it unjustifiable. To my mind, the history of rail<lb break="no"/>roading in this country, the story of the railway is 
     <lb/>on the whole an epic of great triumph. The build<lb break="no"/>ing, maintenance and operation of our cross- 
     <lb break="yes"/>country line has been put by some observers on 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         
     a par with similar trans-continental operations in 
     <lb/>
     the United States and Canada. This criticism is 
     <lb/>
     not, however, without reason. For the fact 
     <lb/>
     remains that it still takes an express train over a 
     <lb/>
     day to cover 546 miles from eastern to western 
     <lb/>
     terminus. A person who flies from New York or 
     <lb/>
     Montreal to Gander in a few hours, takes perhaps 
     <lb/>
     12 to 16 hours to reach St. John's by rail, and so 
     <lb/>
     on. I know that trains will never be able to travel 
     <lb/>
     as fast as aeroplanes, but they can travel as fast 
     <lb/>
     as automobiles, at least they do in other countries. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite aware too, that in other countries, there 
     <lb/>
     are trains a lot slower and a lot worse-appointed 
     <lb/>
     than our trains — but again I am not making 
     <lb/>
     comparisons. I am merely saying these few things 
     <lb/>
     as a lead-up to a question that has always 
     <lb/>
     bothered me whenever the Newfoundland Rail<lb break="no"/>way is on the carpet, namely this business of the 
     <lb/>
     narrow gauge. For that, it appears to me, is the 
     <lb/>
     chief drawback of our railway system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In previous debates on other matters, some 
     <lb/>
     delegates have asked in jocose mood or other<lb break="no"/>wise, why we persist in believing that we are right 
     <lb/>
     and the rest of the world is wrong on certain 
     <lb/>
     questions. I make the same observation on the 
     <lb/>
     matter of our railway and its narrow gauge. In 
     <lb/>
     debating this report yesterday, almost every 
     <lb/>
     delegate made the observation that he was not a 
     <lb/>
     railroad man, as though to apologise for his 
     <lb/>
     remarks if they should prove to be stupid, ir<lb break="no"/>relevant or anything else. I make no apology in 
     <lb/>
     referring to the narrow gauge road that traverses 
     <lb/>
     this country, since it is the greatest drawback not 
     <lb/>
     only to the efficient, but also to the profitable 
     <lb/>
     operation of this vital public utility. The standard 
     <lb/>
     gauge railroad, 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches, is in use in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, Canada, Mexico, England, the 
     <lb/>
     continent of Europe, and Australia, amongst 
     <lb/>
     other countries. In Europe, it is true, as well as in 
     <lb/>
     other countries, there are considerable mileages 
     <lb/>
     of smaller gauge, especially in mountainous dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, such as Switzerland and parts of Germany. 
     <lb/>
     But the main trunk lines, if not exactly 4 feet 
     <lb/>
     8 1/2 inches, are so close to that gauge as to permit 
     <lb/>
     the through running of locomotives and rolling 
     <lb/>
     stock. Thus by means of train ferry steamers, 
     <lb/>
     which carry locomotives and rolling stock on 
     <lb/>
     their decks, it is possible for British rolling stock 
     <lb/>
     to cross the continent on the Harwich to 
     <lb/>
     Zeebrugge train feny, traverse all central Europe, 
     <lb/>
     and by means of similar steamers, reach Scan<lb break="no"/>

dinavia, and even cross to Sicily from the Italian 
     <lb/>
     mainland. Similarly, continental rolling stock 
     <lb/>
     can arrive in England if it is not too large for the 
     <lb/>
     smaller British loading gauge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Consider the possibilities if such a position 
     <lb/>
     obtained in this country, if we adopted the stand<lb break="no"/>ard gauge. Just before the Convention adjourned 
     <lb/>
     for the Christmas recess, we were debating 
     <lb/>
     another section of the report of the Transportation 
     <lb/>
     and Communications Committee, namely the 
     <lb/>
     tourist trade. Consider what a boost such an in<lb break="no"/>novation in our railway system would mean to 
     <lb/>
     the growth of a great tourist trade. People from 
     <lb/>
     the Gulf of Mexico not having to leave their 
     <lb/>
     railway cars until they reached their destination 
     <lb/>
     in whatever part of Newfoundland they desired 
     <lb/>
     to reach. Apart from that big consideration, there 
     <lb/>
     would be the added advantages of speed in 
     <lb/>
     transportation, so necessary in the world today. 
     <lb/>
     Travel time across the island could be cut to half 
     <lb/>
     the time, and less, for the trains could travel at 
     <lb/>
     twice their highest speed (40 mph) and more, 
     <lb/>
     without the danger of running off the rails. Bigger 
     <lb/>
     trains could haul heavier loads, and so on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This may sound a trifle ambitious to some of 
     <lb/>
     you, but it doesn't to me. It is certainly a matter 
     <lb/>
     for consideration in relation to the future, and it's 
     <lb/>
     to the future that we are looking. No matter how 
     <lb/>
     many roads we build, including a cross-country 
     <lb/>
     highway, we are still going to need a railroad, at 
     <lb/>
     least for another 50 to 100 years, unless the 
     <lb/>
     atomic energy commission can work out a speedy 
     <lb/>
     method whereby the nations can dish out tablets 
     <lb/>
     or capsules which we can pop in our mouths and 
     <lb/>
     be whisked away to the bounds of the earth. In 
     <lb/>
     other countries the roads did not supplant the 
     <lb/>
     railways, and there's no reason to suppose it will 
     <lb/>
     happen here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore, when I see and note that it is in the 
     <lb/>
     minds and plans of the Railway management to 
     <lb/>
     re-rail the main line, and purchase new locomo<lb break="no"/>tives and rolling-stock, I cannot refrain from 
     <lb/>
     asking the question that has always bothered me 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the railway, "What about the stand<lb break="no"/>ard-gauge?" Has the Railway management given 
     <lb/>
     serious thought to the matter of introducing the 
     <lb/>
     standard gauge in this country? I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     it has been thought about a lot, but has it been 
     <lb/>
     given serious thought? Have the whys and 
     <lb/>
     wherefores been thoroughly gone into the pros 
     <lb/>
     andcons exhaustively discussed? The time has 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
       
     come when this matter must be considered if we 
     <lb/>
     are to make the progress we desire to make. It is 
     <lb/>
     not enough for someone, even someone in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to get up and say the whole thing is 
     <lb/>
     impossible, prohibitive, and to raise a number of 
     <lb/>
     apparently insuperable obstacles. This is not 
     <lb/>
     meant to be critical of governments, past or 
     <lb/>
     present, or of the Railway, or even of the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee which produced this Comprehensive 
     <lb/>
     report. It is simply an opinion I have, which is 
     <lb/>
     shared by many others. I make therefore no apol<lb break="no"/>ogy for these few comments, for our deliberations 
     <lb/>
     concern the future; they concern the costs of 
     <lb/>
     government in the future; they concern the costs 
     <lb/>
     of public utilities like the Railway, and whenever 
     <lb/>
     the costs are discussed, we should make every 
     <lb/>
     effort to see if the country is getting, and is going 
     <lb/>
     to get the maximum results from them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I can understand that neither Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     nor his Committee may be in a position to answer 
     <lb/>
     this question, nor prepared to discuss it; but I feel 
     <lb/>
     that the Convention should take note of it. If we 
     <lb/>
     are to spend some millions of dollars in the next 
     <lb/>
     few years to re-rail our main railway line, surely 
     <lb/>
     to goodness we might just as well go a little 
     <lb/>
     farther and adopt the standard gauge.... I am 
     <lb/>
     hoping that my remarks may be termed a con<lb break="no"/>structive suggestion that may serve to bring this 
     <lb/>
     important matter more into the public gaze, 
     <lb/>
     where they can attempt to appraise the situation 
     <lb/>
     and express their views on the matter also.... 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Contrary to Mr. Harrington's <lb/>guess, the
                  Committee did go into that very matter. <lb/>When we met in the office of the
                  General <lb/>Manager of the Railway, that very question of <lb/>narrow gauge
                  versus standard gauge was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. The difficulty is bridges;
                  there are many <lb/>between St. John's and Port-aux-Basques, which <lb/>were made
                  to accommodate narrow gauge and <lb/>would not now accommodate standard gauge.
                  <lb/>Not only would you have to replace the rolling <lb/>stock, but the bridges.
                  Consider what is involved <lb/>in the replacing of rolling stock.... All that
                  would <lb/>have to go as well as nearly all the existing <lb/>bridges along the
                  main line. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     The main advantage would be in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the tourist trade. I, too, would like to see the 
     <lb/>
     Gulf crossed regularly by train ferry service. A 
     <lb/>
     boat leaving North Sydney would take the trains 
     <lb/>
     aboard and bring them over, and set them on the 
     <lb/>
     rails at Port-aux-Basques. Has Mr. Harrington 
            
            <pb n="247" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-01-10_Page_0247.jpg"/>

    considered the cost of such a ferry? The new one 
     <lb/>
     which has just been launched to serve Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island is costing $5 million. To accom<lb break="no"/>modate that boat they have got to spend $6 mil<lb break="no"/>lion to enlarge the terminal facilities at each end 
     <lb/>
     of the run.... At a rough guess, to get the new 
     <lb/>
     equipment and the ferry on the Gulf, it will run 
     <lb/>
     up to $50 million. That, I am afraid, is a little too 
     <lb/>
     rich for our blood. I appreciate Mr. Harrington's 
     <lb/>
     interest, but I wish to assure him that that is a 
     <lb/>
     matter which the Transportation Committee did 
     <lb/>
     investigate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I would like to correct what I <lb/> said
                  regarding the express train at Lewisporte, <lb/> that this year passengers had to
                  leave the express. <lb/> That should have been last year, not 1947, be<lb break="no"/>cause at the present time the train from <lb/> Lewisporte does meet
                  all the expresses that come <lb/> through. But last spring, (1946) and early in
                  the <lb/> summer, the train from Lewisporte only met cer<lb break="no"/>tain
                  expresses. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     There is another point, and it is that when the 
     <lb/>
    railway was built out there, Norris Ann was 
     <lb/>supposed to be the water point, so to speak, and 
     <lb/>that's why the railroad was brought out to Norris 
     <lb/>Arm, but had people had the vision at that time 
     <lb/>to see the great port of Lewisporte as it is today, 
     <lb/>I think these men would have put the main line 
     <lb/>right out to Lewisporte, and I believe it could 
     <lb/>have been done at very little cost, and it would be 
     <lb/>a great convenience to the travelling people.... I 
     <lb/>feel very strongly in advocating that the Railway 
     <lb/>management seriously consider the matter of put<lb break="no"/>ting Lewisporte on the main line.

            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I have been handicapped the past <lb/>few days with a

                  <lb/>description of conditions throughout the island, <lb/>and would like to have
                  something to say about <lb/>the way things have been handled in general. I
                  <lb/>don't think anybody has been treated worse than <lb/>the people who belong to
                  the district (Trinity <lb/>South) which I come from. When you have had <lb/>things
                  and had them taken away from you, it hurts <lb/>a lot more. <lb/>

     I am glad that Mr. Vincent has seen his way to 
     <lb/>
     make that speech about the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government. When he made his earlier speech, I 
     <lb/>
     don't think there was anybody I felt like shaking 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     more than Mr. Vincent. Ever since I came back 
     <lb/>
     to this country I have been like the Irishman, 
     <lb/>
     "agin it", and as time goes on lam more against 
     <lb/>
     it. I don't believe that we have got a fair repre<lb break="no"/>sentation. We had a royal commission come out 
     <lb/>
     here<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref>, I was not in the country at that time, and it 
     <lb/>
     harked back to our old responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     but that government gave us, where I come from, 
     <lb/>
     a wharf at New Chelsea that must have cost 
     <lb/>
     $8,000; a wharf at Hant's Harbour, and you have 
     <lb/>
     got to take a mark to find where that was today; 
     <lb/>
     at Winterton there was a wharf, and at New 
     <lb/>
     Perlican; and at Heart's Content we had a wharf 
     <lb/>
     that cost $80,000, and a 12,000 ton ship could 
     <lb/>
     load at it. From Heart's Content to Whitbourne 
     <lb/>
     we had a railroad that cost the country, the old 
     <lb/>
     "irresponsible" political parties, $1 million, and 
     <lb/>
     it gave good service. It got to a situation where 
     <lb/>
     they could not find $200,000 to ballast the track 
     <lb/>
     and put it back again. I was one of the committee 
     <lb/>
     that was fighting the government to hold the 
     <lb/>
     railroad to Heart's Content. They said they had 
     <lb/>
     to put the rails somewhere else in the country, but 
     <lb/>
     I found out that $350,000 was spent to build sheds 
     <lb/>
     in St. John's. Now we work with committees, and 
     <lb/>
     find out that it cost $500,000 dollars to put a road 
     <lb/>
     where there was a good road, between St. John's 
     <lb/>
     and Woodstock. When you consider the money 
     <lb/>
     that responsible government spent and the money 
     <lb/>
     that Commission of Government is spending, 
     <lb/>
     you begin to wonder what it is all about. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     that one of the other ideas of the home govern<lb break="no"/>ment, was that they would relieve the depression 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland by building railroads. They 
     <lb/>
     quit building roads, at a cost of 15 or 20 cents an 
     <lb/>
     hour, because the cost was prohibitive; surely 
     <lb/>
     they don't expect us to build roads now when the 
     <lb/>
     British government would notbuild them in 1938 
     <lb/>
     because they were too costly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the cost of living came up here today I 
     <lb/>
     could not help admiring Mr. Fudge when he 
     <lb/>
     spoke. I am sure Mr. Figary was right there on the 
     <lb/>
     spot with the railroad men, but I did not see 
     <lb/>
     anybody get up and say anything about John the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman. I don't know what is expected of the 
     <lb/>
     men today who catch fish. You hear talk about 
     <lb/>
     the cost of living, but I know men who went on 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador last summer and after they paid their 
     <lb/>
     company account (the lowest was about $270 and 
     <lb/>
     the highest $360) they had to live out of that.

     They are home now working their souls out to get 
     <lb/>
     a bit of wood for the winter. Altogether, their 
     <lb/>
     income for the year will be anywhere between 
     <lb/>
     $550 and $750 a year. I can assure the people in 
     <lb/>
     this House that if there is no fish caught next year 
     <lb/>
     there will not be any money spent on the roads, 
     <lb/>
     either on Avalon Peninsula or transinsular roads, 
     <lb/>
     although I believe in them. We have got to get the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen of this country on a paying standard. I 
     <lb/>
     am going to take this up later when the Fishery 
     <lb/>
     Report comes in. We must see that the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     can earn the money so that the politicians will be 
     <lb/>
     able to go ahead and do those things. That's 
     <lb/>
     where I stand. I concur, to use Professor 
     <lb/>
     Wheare's word, with Mr. Higgins, and I am sure 
     <lb/>
     that nobody in this world was treated worse than 
     <lb/>
     we were. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We had a large amount of money, about 
     <lb/>
     $6,000, spent in 1938 on the roads from Victoria 
     <lb/>
     Village<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> down. Last year a Plymouth truck tried 
     <lb/>
     to get over those roads and could not. On the 
     <lb/>
     $223,000 road from Heart's Content to Whit<lb break="no"/>bourne, cars could not get through. When you get 
     <lb/>
     to Winterton hill you get some men to take a rope, 
     <lb/>
     put your car off the road and attach the rope, and 
     <lb/>
     pull the car through the trees, and finally get it on 
     <lb/>
     the road again. You might have it stuck for a week 
     <lb/>
     or two on that road. When you had responsible 
     <lb/>
     government that was a good road. That's what we 
     <lb/>
     have been up against. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> We have in St. John's 63,000 people, which <lb/> in comparison with the mral
                  population is out of <lb/> all proportion. The population of Trinity South <lb/>
                  has dropped two-thirds in the past few years, and <lb/> a lot of them are in here.
                  In the spring when the <lb/> boats came in to load, most everybody got a few <lb/>
                  days work, and when there was a good harbour <lb/> and a good wharfit was all
                  right. This is the thing <lb/> we have been up against — but I don't understand
                  <lb/> it. That's still the position we are faced with. <lb/> Today you have got to
                  go 49 or 50 miles before <lb/> you can connect with anything at all. I think that
                  <lb/> the quicker we can change this the better for the <lb/> country. I believe
                  it would cost $150,000 to put <lb/> the branch railroad back in its place. We
                  pleaded <lb/> with Sir Wilfred Woods, put up every argument <lb/> possible, but in
                  spite of that the railroad was taken <lb/> away from us. I believe the quicker we
                  can get <lb/> clear of this form of government the better. One <lb/> thing we want
                  to do is put our house in order, so <lb/>
                  <cb/> that the people who produce the wealth of this <lb/> country, the fishermen,
                  can make a living. Let us <lb/> get them earning. If you don't you will be in the
                  <lb/> same place four years from today as you were six <lb/> years ago. </p>
               <p><lb/>
                  <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I strongly support Mr. <lb/>
                  Ashboume's remarks. There is one bright spot, <lb/> you know — Lewisporte. The
                  branch line this <lb/> year brought in a credit balance of $58,000. Then <lb/>
                  they took the line away and we had to walk! I <lb/> think that main line should be
                  swung on to <lb/> Lewisporte and Norris Arm to save all that un<lb break="no"/>necessary expense. Lewisporte, though small, is <lb/> a very progressive little
                  town, second to none as <lb/> far as taxes and revenue are concerned. It has <lb/>
                  1,000 people and we have gone over the <lb/> $200,000 mark in revenue alone. When
                  we come <lb/> to roads we have a trail. Thanks to the local <lb/> government we
                  have started now; and I hope in <lb/> the near future it will be more than 25
                  cents per <lb/> mile. I therefore go on record that there should be <lb/> a main
                  line to Lewisporte. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to remind Mr. <lb/> Northcott that
                  it is not quite the case that the <lb/> Lewisporte branch was the only one that
                  showed <lb/> a surplus. The Argentia line and the Lewisporte <lb/> line both show
                  an operating profit, and they are <lb/> the only ones that do. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I was much interested in what Mr. Bailey said. 
     <lb/>
     It is only fair to say this: the government is 
     <lb/>
     spending $2.5 million a year on roads, but if you 
     <lb/>
     go back to just before the war and look at what 
     <lb/>
     the government spent then on roads and bridges, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that in 1938, on the construction of 
     <lb/>
     new roads, they spent only $12,000.... The total 
     <lb/>
     amount they spent was only $480,000, as against 
     <lb/>
     $2.5 million today. The point is that up to 1938 
     <lb/>
     or 1939 we were not paying our way as a country. 
     <lb/>
     There was a deficit every year. After that we 
     <lb/>
     began to have a surplus, and we have had one 
     <lb/>
     every year, and it is only since they have had a 
     <lb/>
     surplus, money from the taxpayers, that they 
     <lb/>
     spent any real money on roads; but when they 
     <lb/>
     were not getting it from us they were only spend<lb break="no"/>ing $500,000 dollars on roads each year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We must get this right. You have people in this 
     <lb/>
     country saying, "You would get no roads if you 
     <lb/>
     had any other kind of government", but the 
     <lb/>
     answer to that is, "We have got no roads and we 
     <lb/>
     still have Commission of Government." What

     made the difference between spending and not 
     <lb/>
     Spending money on roads? When we were not 
     <lb/>
     giving them enough money, then they did not 
     <lb/>
     spend money on roads, but when we began to 
     <lb/>
     pour the money in to them, they began to spend 
     <lb/>
     it; but it's our money all the same. It's only fair 
     <lb/>
     to say that. We must give credit where it is due, 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
           
     but not where it is not due. Roads will be built in 
     <lb/>
     future and maintained and repaired only if we 
     <lb/>
     give them the money to do it, whether it is Com<lb break="no"/>mission or some other government....

            <!--<p>
     January 14, 1947 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Report of the Transportation and Communications Committee:¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, before we go 
     <lb/>
     into the section of the report dealing with posts 
     <lb/>
     and telegraphs, there are some answers to ques<lb break="no"/>tions raised in the House in the debates on pre<lb break="no"/>vious matters, that I have to table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the Railway, there was some question as 
     <lb/>
     to the amount of money paid out in claims. The 
     <lb/>
     Manager informed the Transportation Commit<lb break="no"/>tee in a meeting this forenoon that in the year 
     <lb/>
     ending March 31, l946, the total amount of 
     <lb/>
     claims paid out by the Railway was $36,982 and 
     <lb/>
     in the previous year $26,000. The amount paid 
     <lb/>
     out in claims runs from $25,000 to $30,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year. We asked for some explanation of even that 
     <lb/>
     relatively small amount — only 1% of the freight 
     <lb/>
     handled by the Railway in the course of the year 
     <lb/>
     — and two explanations were given. The first is 
     <lb/>
     that, since the war especially, shippers have not 
     <lb/>
     been using wooden containers but paper cartons 
     <lb/>
     instead. These get broken and the contents are 
     <lb/>
     strewn around or are pilfered. In the second place, 
     <lb/>
     the amount includes compensation paid to 
     <lb/>
     owners of cattle and horses killed along the rail<lb break="no"/>way. Another matter is that of free passes issued 
     <lb/>
     to persons on the Newfoundland Railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Figary Before we go on to the question of 
     <lb/>
     passes, I would like to ask, in regard to claims, is 
     <lb/>
     the chairman of the Committee aware that we 
     <lb/>
     could not get wooden containers, and that 25% 
     <lb/>
     was charged on cardboard containers? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood The freight charged on con<lb break="no"/>tainers was not a matter into which we went.... 
     <lb/>
     On the matter of the railway passes. In the first 
     <lb/>
     place, passes are issued only to employees of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway. One holiday pass per year may or will 
     <lb/>
     be issued to any railroader working a certain 
     <lb/>
     number of years, and the dependent members of 
     <lb/>
     his family.... Passes are issued to no one else 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     except Commissioners and to His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor; when the Commissioners or His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency, have a private or special car, the 
     <lb/>
     government pays the Railway for it. This 
     <lb/>
     privilege is universal practice — to give free 
     <lb/>
     passes to railway employees. Most railways ex<lb break="no"/>change the privilege with each other.... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Starkes Does that mean that Canadian rail<lb break="no"/>roaders coming to this country can travel on a 
     <lb/>pass? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Yes, for employees of the rail<lb break="no"/>ways who have that arrangement with the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Railway.... The General Manager told 
     <lb/>us that very few Americans or Canadians travel 
     <lb/>to Newfoundland on passes; many more New- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>foundlanders go up there than Canadians or 
     <lb/>Americans come down here.... All applications 
     <lb/>for passes go to the head of the department and 
     <lb/>from him to the General Manager, and he must 
     <lb/>sign them before they are any good. In that way 
     <lb/>they keep a record and the General Manager 
     <lb/>knows exactly what is happening with regard to 
     <lb/>the issuing of free passes on the Railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Crummey Could you tell us the number of 
     <lb/>passes in 1946 and the mileage covered? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Neither I nor any member of 
     <lb/>the Committee nor any member of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion present thought of enquiring as to the actual 
     <lb/>number of passes issued. The issuing of railway 
     <lb/>passes is so commonplace throughout the world 
     <lb/>that mere details as to the number of passes is 
     <lb/>relatively unimportant. I ought to say that these 
     <lb/>free passes are merely for travelling. They do not 
     <lb/>include meals on the train or sleepers. In fact, if 
     <lb/>a railroader travelling on a pass wants a sleeper, 
     <lb/>he must buy an upper; he is not permitted to buy 
     <lb/>a lower berth.
