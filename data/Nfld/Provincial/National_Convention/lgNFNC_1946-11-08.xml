<!-- GL, 2017-03-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

           <!-- <p>
     new wage agreement will, I hope, be made up and 
     <lb/>
     we are looking forward to a further increase. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hollett Can you give us the approximate 
     <lb/>earnings of woodcutters during the past season? 
     <lb/>I know they varied considerably, depending on 
     <lb/>the ability of the woodcutters. Could you give us 
     <lb/>the approximate figure? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge I am speaking of the Bowater opera<lb break="no"/>tions. We find that the average cut per man is 
     <lb/>
     1¹/₂ cords; he is paid not less than $3.86 on an 
     <lb/>
     average. You will find the average has increased, 
     <lb/>
     and the reason is because the men have better 
     <lb/>
     accommodations and better food and are there<lb break="no"/>fore better able to do a day's work. The average 
     <lb/>
     days' work in the woods per month is around 23 
     <lb/>
     working days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Ballam The figures quoted here are 
     <lb/>
     average. I think the earnings of many men are 
     <lb/>
     much higher. You will always find that there are 
     <lb/>
     some who work better than others. They can clear 
     <lb/>
     $5 a day less one cent, that is the general overall 
     <lb/>
     average. There are fellows who have a chance of 
     <lb/>
     making $10 or $12 a day. There are fellows who 
     <lb/>
     make that average for months on end. They are 
     <lb/>
     extra good cutters. On a general average they 
     <lb/>
     clear $5 a day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge I do not want to offend my friend, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not think that is correct. A logger does 
     <lb/>
     not clear $12 a day on an average. There are 
     <lb/>
     deductions for board and medical fees. They have 
     <lb/>
     to buy blankets and shirts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett While we are on this particular 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     paragraph I rise to pay tribute to the work being 
     <lb/>
     done by the Woods Labour Board in connection 
     <lb/>
     with wages in the woods. If it had not been for 
     <lb/>
     that board and for the chairman¹ who looked after 
     <lb/>
     their interests, we would have had considerable 
     <lb/>
     trouble in Newfoundland during war years.... In 
     <lb/>
     Grand Falls, I have known bodies of men who 
     <lb/>
     worked together in harmony and I wish to pay 
     <lb/>
     tribute to these unions in Grand Falls. It is only 
     <lb/>
     by the companies and the unions getting together 
     <lb/>
     that we can have harmony in woods operations 
     <lb/>
     and for that matter in all operations throughout 
     <lb/>
     the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge There is another thing I would like 
     <lb/>
     to mention — forest fires. I remind the delegates 
     <lb/>
     that when you take into consideration the number 
     <lb/>
     of men working in the companies' woods during 
     <lb/>
     the summer months, and compare the number of 
     <lb/>
     tires, you will be surprised to hear that very 
     <lb/>
     seldom do we get a fire caused by woodsmen. 
     <lb/>
     There was only one year that we had two fires 
     <lb/>
     and there is, at times, anywhere from 5,000 to 
     <lb/>
     6,000 men engaged in the forest industry and I 
     <lb/>
     should say most of those men make little fires to 
     <lb/>
     boil their kettles and get their lunch twice a day, 
     <lb/>
     and it is remarkable to see how careful the 
     <lb/>
     woodsman is in protecting the forest. We should 
     <lb/>
     not forget them when bringing in this report. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>[There was some discussion of the section on<lb/>local sawmills and the export of pitprops. The<lb/>committee of the whole then rose and reportezi<lb/>progress. The Convention adjourned]<lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> This concerns the whole territory of <lb/>
                  Labrador, and I should inform the committee that <lb/> I have here a map which has
                  been supplied to us <lb/> by the Department of Natural Resources, show<lb
                     break="no"/>ing where the different timber areas are located. <lb/> I will pass
                  it around. You will notice that in the <lb/> Hamilton Inlet area there are 300
                  square miles <lb/> under lease. About 100 square miles of that has <lb/> been
                  taken over by the airport at North West <lb/>
                  <cb/> River.<ref target="#fn_02">[4]</ref> The other 200 square miles left was at
                  one <lb/> time supposed to have over 2 million cords of <lb/> wood. The lease on
                  that expires within five years, <lb/> also the Muskrat Falls waterpower. From the
                  <lb/> Hamilton River you come to Kenimau River — <lb/> 2,100 square miles. That's
                  a 99-year lease, with <lb/> about 70 years to go. All the others are 99-year <lb/>
                  leases, and the people who have held them have <lb/> paid $2 per square mile
                  annually ever since they <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">175</fw> got them. The Labrador Development Company<ref
                     target="#fn_x2">[1]</ref>
                  <lb/> have acquired everything marked in blue. They <lb/> control about 6,000
                  square miles of timber land, <lb/> but a lot of it now has no timber on it at all.
                  We <lb/> mentioned here that they have had advances from <lb/> the government in
                  1934 of $200,000. The <lb/> government has a first mortgage on that property <lb/>
                  and it has been reduced to about $140,000. This <lb/> year they are shipping
                  around 7,000 cords of <lb/> wood. At the same time there is a foreign export <lb/>
                  on the property from the other side, and it is <lb/> impossible to secure the
                  necessary capital to do <lb/> much manufacturing. There are possibilities of <lb/>
                  other parties trying to obtain leases, in fact in the <lb/> hands of the
                  government today are requests for <lb/> leases, but they would not give us the
                  necessary <lb/> information. There is one for a pulp mill on the <lb/> southwest
                  coast, to be fed by timber from <lb/> Labrador. Some people may ask why they can't
                  <lb/> put the mill in Labrador. That place, particularly <lb/> Hamilton Inlet, is
                  closed to navigation about <lb/> seven months of the year, and it would mean a
                  <lb/> great deal of capital expenditure to provide <lb/> storage facilities for
                  that length of time. I would <lb/> be glad to give any information I can about it.
                  <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is only now I am beginning <lb/> to realise
                  how important this report is, or, if Major <lb/> Cashin won't mind my saying so,
                  how important <lb/> it is not, but ought to be. Long before we come to <lb/>
                  discuss forms of government we have to make <lb/> some appraisal, some estimate of
                  What we have <lb/> got in the country, including timber. This report <lb/> is
                  supposed to tell us clearly what are the resour<lb break="no"/>ces of Newfoundland
                  and Labrador so far as <lb/> timber is concerned; how much of mose resour<lb
                     break="no"/>ces are under development, who is developing <lb/> them, what is
                  the value of the production, how <lb/> much are in the hands of private owners,
                  how <lb/> much still in the hands of the Crown. We are <lb/> supposed also to
                  know, and so far as timber in <lb/> Labrador is concerned this is more important
                  than <lb/> what is now being done, what is likely to be done <lb/> in the future.
                  Labrador — 110,000 square miles; <lb/> and we have roughly two pages of the report
                  <lb/> dealing with it. Two-thirds of that is taken up with <lb/> an account of the
                  Labrador Development Com<lb break="no"/>pany, a small operation apparently,
                  although they <lb/> have acquired through purchase and leases 6,000 <lb/> square
                  miles there, and are exporting this year, so <lb/>
                  <cb/> the spokesman of the Forestry Committee tells <lb/> us, 7,000 cords of wood.
                  At present there are two <lb/> small operations, one the Labrador Development
                  <lb/> Company, the other, which began its activines <lb/> this season, is known as
                  the Three Rivers Estates <lb/> Ltd,<ref target="#fn_x3">[2]</ref> Who are the
                  Labrador Development CO., <lb/> and who are the Three Rivers Estates Ltd.? Are
                  <lb/> they local, Canadian, English or what? How <lb/> much capital have they
                  invested? What develop<lb break="no"/>ment have they made? How many people are
                  they <lb/> employing? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     We find that in the meantime several other 
     <lb/>
     speculators acquired interests for the period of 99 
     <lb/>
     years, and at the present time we find what some<lb break="no"/>thing over 10,000 square miles are under lease to 
     <lb/>
     various individuals or companies. Who are these 
     <lb/>
     companies, are they English, Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     Canadian? I submit, that when we come, 
     <lb/>
     sometime next year, to consider forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment which we might feel justified in recom<lb break="no"/>mending to the United Kingdom to be submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the Newfoundland people, we should certainly 
     <lb/>
     have in our minds a fairly clear picture of the 
     <lb/>
     possibilities of this country, including Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     I submit there is almost nothing in this section of 
     <lb/>
     the Forestry Report to help us form that picture.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Someone said here last night something about 
     <lb/>
     optimism about Labrador, and my reply was that 
     <lb/>
     it was not a case of being optimistic or pessimis<lb break="no"/>tic, but of trying to get the facts. So far as 
     <lb/>
     Labrador is concerned this report is practically 
     <lb/>
     useless. I don't want to be unjust about the matter, 
     <lb/>
     and i know very well the terrible difficulty in this

     alienated from private individuals, and if there is

     a map showing water power alienated we ought

     to have one of that. We know the sad truth about

                  indignant about it. I think if this <lb/> country today had the same suspicion
                  that I have <lb/> got, and from scraps of information that I have <lb/> picked up
                  about Labrador and what is going on, <lb/> there would be a little revolution in
                  this country. <lb/> We have been very shortsighted in New<lb break="no"

                  fatal mistake in <lb/> Labrador. It is a very crucial time, and some <lb/> queer
                  things are going on behind the scenes. If <lb/> necessary I would like to see a
                  royal commission <lb/> appointed to get to the bottom of this. There is <lb/> some
                  skulduggery going on about Labrador, and <lb/> we ought to know the truth of it.
                  If we have to <lb/> decide what Labrador may or may not be worth <lb/> to this

                  then I am perfectly able to support Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, because he has

                  Labrador is back of me, and I am interested in its <lb/> welfare, and what Mr.
                  Smallwood had to say was <lb/> very new to me. I had a little suspicion, but <lb/>
                  "skulduggery", whatever that means, I am not <lb/> informed of it. But I do have a
                  feeling, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, that I should give this Convention and the
                  <lb/> Forestry Committee my idea about this timber <lb/> land in Labrador. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     We have large areas of timber land in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. Some of it is not very important in our 
     <lb/>
     estimation, and some of it is very good timber. 
     <lb/>
     Now there is a reference here in this report to the 
     <lb/>
     further concessions being made in Labrador. A 
     <lb/>
     great many concessions have been made as we 
     <lb/>
     see on this map, and I am wondering what is left 
     <lb/>
     to be conceded ... in the accessible areas, that is 
     <lb/>
     along the coastline. The vast areas in the interior 
     <lb/>
     are wooded, but it is wood with small growth, 
     <lb/>
     stunted. I understand from trappers, and my own 
     <lb/>
     observations by air over the country, it is not very 
     <lb/>
     thickly wooded, and being so far in from the 
     <lb/>
     water as 2-300 miles the state of the timber would 
     <lb/>
     make it almost not worth bringing out. That is 
     <lb/>
     considering the fact that we would have to build 
     <lb/>
     a railroad in there. It would have to be very rich 
     <lb/>
     timber to make it of any value to the country. At 
     <lb/>
     the present time,the interior can be left out as far 
     <lb/>
     as bringing anything into the treasury of this 
     <lb/>
     country of ours. At the present time close to the 
     <lb/>
     coastline there are areas taken as well. The area 
     <lb/>
     between Battle Harbour and Sandwich Bay is all 
     <lb/>
     taken by two companies. That is the 6,074 miles 
     <lb/>
     referred to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Where is that map? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> In a general way thatis all the timber <lb/>
                  available to that particular area, and it is all taken <lb/> up by those other
                  companies. Now to come to the <lb/> Hamilton Inlet area ... most of the possible
                  <lb/> wooded territory is taken up by J.C. Hepburn and <lb/> the Grand River Paper
                  Co. There is one area left <lb/> that should be of value, around the Grand Lake
                  <lb/> area, and the north side of Lake Melville itself. <lb/> Therefore, in this
                  area (not including the interior) <lb/> we have l0,000 square miles taken up, and
                  we <lb/> have 2,000 square miles taken up in the north by <lb/> the Three Rivers
                  Estates and the Stag Bay Estate. <lb/> I don't know much about that, but if there
                  is <lb/>

                  would want to go into that's the outside of it. <lb/> There's only that Melville
                  Lake area left. I am <lb/> basing my remarks on the Committee's report. <lb/> Two
                  thousand possible square miles not taken up, <lb/> which altogether means 12,200
                  square miles of <lb/> inaccessible timber area, of which l0,000 <lb/> sq. miles
                  has been taken up.... In Newfoundland <lb/> we find we have 20,000 square miles
                  taken up by <lb/> the two pulp and paper companies. On this <lb/> 20,000 square
                  miles in Newfoundland we es<lb break="no"/>timate that we have between 45 and 50
                  million <lb/> cords of wood. In Labrador we have 12,200 <lb/> square miles on the
                  coast area and we estimate <lb/> that there is 50 to 100 cords of wood on that
                  <lb/> possible 12,200 square miles. <lb/>

            <p>
     You all know how glad I would be to be able 
     <lb/>
     to put up a very good story about the timber areas 
     <lb/>
     in Labrador, but it has often been said here that 
     <lb/>
     we have got to be realists.... I appreciate that the 
     <lb/>
     Committee was at a serious disadvantage and 
     <lb/>
     probably cannot possibly get the information, but 
     <lb/>
     I would not like to give the impression that we 
     <lb/>
     have a vast timber area in Labrador, and find out 
     <lb/>
     in the next few years we were mistaken. This is 
     <lb/>
     not a scientific survey, but I feel that with my own 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of Labrador this 50 million cords of 
     <lb/>
     timber in the country is too high, and I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     we should look into the future thinking that we 
     <lb/>
     have that much timber capable of being turned 
     <lb/>
     into money which will flow into the treasury in 
     <lb/>
     the foreseeable future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to have the optimism that has been 
     <lb/>
     expressed by so many when speaking about the 
     <lb/>
     timber area in Labrador. They tell me of the great 
     <lb/>
     wealth in Labrador, but I don't think we have the 
     <lb/>
     wealth in the timber areas of Labrador that we 
     <lb/>
     think we have, and I think as a Convention we 
     <lb/>
     ought to find out the exact facts. This is based 
     <lb/>
     upon what we know, and upon information that I 
     <lb/>
     have after being in Labrador all these years....

                  <cb/> matter for us to find out, why this information is <lb/> withheld, because
                  we have got to get this infor<lb break="no"/>mation. There is one question here

                  <lb/> Those facts I don't believe are accessible to the <lb/> Committee. Major
                  Cashin probably knows of <lb/> them, but officially I don't suppose he would be '
                  <lb/>allowed to disclose them. <lb/>
               </p>
   
    

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I would like to know the poten<lb break="no"
                  />tial value of Labrador to Newfoundland. I know <lb/> that her fisheries are most
                  valuable. We know <lb/> that the stand of timber on the Labrador is a stand <lb/>
                  which, in my opinion, is virgin growth and we <lb/> also have heard quite a bit of
                  the value of the <lb/> minerals there, Now since last night I have been <lb/>
                  doing a little figuring, and I think it can be safely <lb/> assumed that we have
                  in Labrador 110,000 <lb/> square miles, and seeing that half of that might <lb/>
                  contain a stand of timber, which would be 2,000 <lb/> square miles (and by the way
                  about 10% of <lb/> Labrador is under 99-year lease), this gives us <lb/> about
                  35,200,000 acres, and I believe Major <lb/> Cashin said last night that it has
                  been said that the <lb/> ield of wood on the acreage is up to 15 cords an <lb/>
                  acre. I think that's quite high myself. I am taking <lb/> half of that, 7.5 cords
                  the acre, which would bring <lb/> the cordage, according to my figures, to 264
                  <lb/> million cords of timber. Now I see an estimate <lb/> here of from 50 to 100
                  million cords in the report, <lb/> as compared with 60 million cords in New<lb
                     break="no"/>foundland.... I am greatly interested in the state<lb break="no"
                  />ment given to the Convention by Mr. Burry this <lb/> afternoon, and I am sure
                  that when he speaks <lb/> about the timber he knows what he is talking <lb/>
                  about, but in view of the fact that we have no <lb/> competent surveys of the
                  timber areas in <lb/> Labrador, and I believe that we should get those <lb/>
                  <cb/> surveys which might be given now. You can get <lb/> photography now, a
                  valuable asset to the <lb/> economy of Newfoundland as regards the <lb/> fisheries
                  and the mineral wealth of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I believe Mr. Chairman
                  that we <lb/> should try as a Convention to ascertain some real <lb/> idea of the
                  potential wealth of Newfoundland. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     Now, I hope the time will not come when 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will be a bald rock. It will in<lb break="no"/>fluence the climate, and if we do not, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, look after the matter of reafforestation, 
     <lb/>
     a matter which I advocated in the Assembly over 
     <lb/>
     20 years ago, I fear very much that the time will 
     <lb/>
     come when Newfoundland will be cutout. I can 
     <lb/>
     quite understand that, according to the two large 
     <lb/>
     pulp and paper companies, by discriminate cut<lb break="no"/>ting they may be able to afford a program of 
     <lb/>
     reafforestation which will look after their needs, 
     <lb/>
     but i believe it was Mr. Fudge who talked of not 
     <lb/>
     a stick of wood remaining in 40 years in the 
     <lb/>
     country generally, and I think that the time has 
     <lb/>
     come when the recommendation as given by this 
     <lb/>
     Committee should be apprehended. If there is 
     <lb/>
     indiscriminate cutting in Newfoundland we can 
     <lb/>
     reasonably expect to know what is in store for us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fisheries of Newfoundland, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, are influenced to a great extent by the 
     <lb/>
     fall of snow which happens during the winter on 
     <lb/>
     the northeast coast of Newfoundland particular<lb break="no"/>ly. We know that the last two years particularly 
     <lb/>
     we have had poor voyages and some of it may be 
     <lb/>
     because there is not enough snow on the ground. 
     <lb/>
     Years ago the fisherman used to say if we had lots 
     <lb/>
     of snow you would have a good cod fishery. As 
     <lb/>
     the snow settles on the ground, and as the rains 
     <lb/>
     descend in the spring and wash out from the 
     <lb/>
     ground the salt and other minerals of the land, we 
     <lb/>
     know that the fish pick up these minerals, and as 
     <lb/>
     regards the herring fishery ...
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Ashbourne, what has all this <lb/>got to do
                  with the present report? <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Well, I am talking about the <lb/>reafforestation
                  of Newfoundland, I don't want <lb/>the time to come when Newfoundland will be
                  <lb/>bald rock, and not be able to have any snow settle <lb/>on the lands so that
                  our fisheries would be <lb/>depleted, because the earning power of our <lb/>people
                  comes from the natural resources of our <lb/>country. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     Now, we need cooperage, which is a thing that 
     <lb/>
     comes from the forests, by which we can ship our

     fishery products to markets. We cannot ship our 
     <lb/>
     codfish out of Newfoundland all by bulk.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I wish it to be clearly understood that <lb/>
                  anything I say in reference to the Forestry Report <lb/> is meant purely as
                  constructive criticism with the <lb/> idea of further extending or building it up
                  and not <lb/> with the idea of understanding the real value of <lb/> what has been
                  done either by the Committee or <lb/> department concerned. Frankly, with the
                  limited <lb/> staff and lack of knowledge or interest displayed <lb/> by the
                  various Commissioners I consider the <lb/> forestry branch has done a good job.
                  Very few in <lb/> this country have had a more personal contact <lb/> with the
                  forestry division than I have and I have <lb/> always found them ready to hear any
                  reasonable <lb/> complaints or suggestions for the promotion of <lb/> the industry
                  or the conservation of our forests. It <lb/> is not humanly possible for any group
                  of ten men <lb/> collectively to bring in a report for 45 to agree on <lb/> every
                  detail, it is the fundamental principles that <lb/> count, and I am happy that
                  most of the criticism is <lb/> of a genuine constructive nature. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     It is alarming to find how little we have left of 
     <lb/>
     our natural resources which have not been 
     <lb/>
     sacrificed to someone outside or in the country. I 
     <lb/>
     am not satisfied that there are not remedies for 
     <lb/>
     this unfortunate situation. We have come to the 
     <lb/>
     place when we are compelled to study it in every 
     <lb/>
     detail, and what we want now is a group of men 
     <lb/>
     big enough to face the unpleasant fact and undo 
     <lb/>
     the wrong that has been done and enact new laws 
     <lb/>
     governing these properties more in harmony with 
     <lb/>
     the new age, demands and requirements of both 
     <lb/>
     people and state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not correct to say that 200 saw mills are 
     <lb/>
     not paying any royalty because they saw less than 
     <lb/>
     10,000 feet annually. The facts are not one of the 
     <lb/>
     over 800 saw mills pay any royalty on the first 
     <lb/>
     10,000 feet; but they all pay a license fee of $5 
     <lb/>
     per year for which they are allowed to saw up to 
     <lb/>
     10,000 feet. So in reality, the mill which only 
     <lb/>
     saws 5,000 feet pays a higher percentage of royal<lb break="no"/>ty if you call it such, than the mill which saws up 
     <lb/>
     to 100,000 feet. That is the true picture and in this 
     <lb/>
     respect the Committee is wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am of the opinion that Mr. Dawe, with his 
     <lb/>
     very wide experience within the field of produc<lb break="no"/>tion and manufacturing, might have contributed 
     <lb/>
     considerably more information in the intrinsic 
     <lb/>
     value of forest wealth to this country. In many 
     <lb/>
     instances he has been a pioneer in the wood<lb break="no"/><cb/>working industry, and the experience gained at 
     <lb/>
     great cost to the various firms of Dawes will in 
     <lb/>
     future, and has in the past benefited the whole 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I notice that some mention has been made of 
     <lb/>
     the grading of lumber, but no real suggestion 
     <lb/>
     made to improve the method of grading or count<lb break="no"/>ing; and while I would not attempt to suggest any 
     <lb/>
     motion or resolution I do maintain that any 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile observations made as the result of a 
     <lb/>
     very wide experience in the industry should be 
     <lb/>
     placed on the record for the benefit of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment concerned.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Attempts have been made at grading with 
     <lb/>
     some success; but the greater practical value has 
     <lb/>
     been experienced with lumber used in the build<lb break="no"/>ing trade. With our forests so depleted and 
     <lb/>
     denuded in supplies of the larger logs, it is impos<lb break="no"/>sible to keep up the old standard. This is agreed 
     <lb/>
     by all. Lumber is being sawn now down to 2 or 
     <lb/>
     2.5 inches wide, while the greatest average width 
     <lb/>
     of cooperage is 3.5 to 4 inches. It is generally 
     <lb/>
     agreed that cooperage should be sawn from 3 to 
     <lb/>
     4 inches, tending to make uniform stock and a 
     <lb/>
     uniform package. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Touching briefly on the value of round timber 
     <lb/>
     as a source of earning power to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, I will mention a few of the principal 
     <lb/>
     items which could properly be listed under this 
     <lb/>
     heading: birch junks and billets, birch hoops for 
     <lb/>
     the making of fish drums, casks and barrels, fence 
     <lb/>
     rails, flake shores, beams and longers, wharfpiles 
     <lb/>
     and cribbing, firewood and kindling, boat timbers 
     <lb/>
     and spars, as well as planking, ceiling and deck<lb break="no"/>ing, very little if any of which is listed under sawn 
     <lb/>
     lumber as there isn't any royalty paid on boat 
     <lb/>
     material. Even cutting Christmas trees was for a 
     <lb/>
     number of years no mean industry in this country 
     <lb/>
     and even this year I had an enquiry from the 
     <lb/>
     States for this item but shipping arrangements 
     <lb/>
     could not be made in time to close the deal. To 
     <lb/>
     put the whole of these items I have mentioned at 
     <lb/>
     a very conservative estimate, apart from the 
     <lb/>
     amount cut by our men for their own use, the 
     <lb/>
     figures given you last night of $3 million would 
     <lb/>
     be a very conservative one. Yet if we are going 
     <lb/>
     to value home-grown vegetables for one's own 
     <lb/>
     use as an industry, we must also value the two, 
     <lb/>
     three or four thousand feet of wood put to the 
     <lb/>
     average outport man's door for his 12 months' 
     <lb/>
     fuel. This in every respect enhances his earning 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="180"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-11-08_Page_0180.jpg"/>

     power and helps in a big way to balance his yearly 
     <lb/>
     budget. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall not touch the pulp and paper industry, 
     <lb/>
     it has been well covered; except I would like at 
     <lb/>
     this time to inject a word of praise to those who 
     <lb/>
     have been so indefatigable in their efforts to 
     <lb/>
     better the working conditions of our men. In this 
     <lb/>
     respect they have done an excellent job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     More care should be exercised in the matter of 
     <lb/>
     forest fires, this menace is growing at an alarming 
     <lb/>
     rate and in this respect every man, woman and 
     <lb/>
     child should be a self-appointed warden. It is 
     <lb/>
     criminal to nurse and grow a forest in 50 and 60 
     <lb/>
     years and destroy it overnight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is gratifying to note that at last we have a 
     <lb/>
     chance of getting some value from our enormous 
     <lb/>
     tracts of birch and other hardwoods, which so far 
     <lb/>
     have largely been left to rot. I have gone through 
     <lb/>
     the report from the Forestry Committee several 
     <lb/>
     times and I must admit, in spite of the additions 
     <lb/>
     I have mentioned that on the whole they have 
     <lb/>
     done a good job and if they haven't, I still say it 
     <lb/>
     is up to us to assist them to do it better. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Have you made any effort to <lb/> get the

                  Committee. I have been listening to <lb/> criticism in regard to this report. A
                  good many of <lb/> the questions asked came before the Committee <lb/> and we
                  could not see any possible way of getting <lb/> the information. For instance, the
                  question of the <lb/> value of timber on the Labrador. How can we get <lb/> it?
                  The Natural Resources department which <lb/> gave us a lot of help, could not give
                  us that <lb/> answer. If we have to get that before this Conven<lb break="no"
                  />tion can conclude its decision, I am afraid it is not <lb/> going to be this
                  year or next year. We will have <lb/> to make a survey of the Labrador to do it.
                  There <lb/> has been no survey made on Newfoundland ex<lb break="no"/>cept what we
                  can get from companies; what is left <lb/> is only a guess. I would suggest that

                  government to get concessions or contracts, <lb/> in which case the government
                  would have a <lb/> chance of making a deal with them in regard to <lb/> taxes?
                  Then again, what about royalty and <lb/> stumpage, are they exempt? If we could
                  have <lb/> some definite knowledge on this: is a company <lb/> now holding a
                  thousand miles in a position to go <lb/> to right ahead, without further
                  legislation, with <lb/> development, and be subject only to 25 cents a <lb/> cord
                  and income tax, corporation tax and profits <lb/> tax? That is all they are liable
                  for. The most we <lb/> can get out of these timber areas now leased in <lb/>
                  Labrador is $2 a square mile; 25 cents a cord on <lb/> any wood they export raw
                  and unmanufactured; <lb/> tax on the profits, if they make any. The only <lb/>
                  chance we have of making more is if they come <lb/> before the government for

                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Take the Labrador areas: the Grand <lb/> River -
                  the Labrador Pulp and Lumber Co. has <lb/> leased 200 square miles, they pay
                  $4,200 a year <lb/> rent and they have had it 45 years. The Sandwich <lb/> Bay
                  area has been held 30 years by the Labrador <lb/> Pulp and Lumber Co. That is
                  yielding $3,100 a <lb/> year rental. They have paid $6,000 to $8,000 <lb/>
                  rentals, and have not done a thing with them.... <lb/> The Hamilton Inlet was
                  supposed to be the best <lb/> timber area on the Labrador. That is not under <lb/>
                  lease at the present time, and that is the property <lb/> for which we understand
                  some people are dick. <lb/> ering for a concession.... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Major Cashin said that this area that <lb/> has not
                  been leased is the richest timber area on <lb/> Labrador. That is hardly correct.
                  The richest area <lb/> is the Grand River area which has been leased to <lb/> the
                  Labrador Pulp and Timber Co..... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is the best of the timber now <lb/> leased?
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> My personal opinion is that the best <lb/> is
                  already leased. The Grand River area and the <lb/> Hamilton River area are taken
                  up. The Kinemau <lb/> and the Kenimish, they are taken up and they are <lb/> very
                  richly wooded, I don't want to give this <lb/>

                  <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>
                  <fw type="num">181</fw> Convention a gloomy report, and you all know <lb/> how
                  glad I would be if I could agree with <lb/> Mr. Ashboume that there are 60 million
                  cords of <lb/> wood in Labrador. That seems to be fantastic. <lb/> There may be
                  50,000 square miles with some <lb/> wood on it, but valuable wood I doubt very
                  <lb/> much.... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Referring to Mr. Vardy's <lb/> speech, it is a
                  fact that we have 800 sawmills <lb/> operating, and they saw up to 10,000 feet of
                  <lb/> lumber. They pay the $5 license. Therefore we <lb/> have 800 mills and
                  10,000 ft. of lumber sawn in <lb/> this country and no licence being paid on it. I
                  do <lb/> believe that we should have royalty paid on every <lb/> thousand feet
                  sawn, under the present high price <lb/> of lumber. If it was down to $20 a
                  thousand I <lb/> would not mind, but with that high price we <lb/> should have 50
                  cents on every thousand sawn. <lb/> That in itself would give us a lot of extra
                  money. <lb/> While on this royalty question, I think that we <lb/> should receive
                  this royalty and it should be ear<lb break="no"/>marked to use at a later date for
                  reafforestation. I <lb/> think it is a crime to use this money ordinarily, <lb/>
                  and after FIve or six years, getting 50 cents on <lb/> every thousand feet sawn,
                  we could use that up <lb/> for some betterment in connection with the in<lb
                     break="no"/>dustry. I really feel hurt to know that all this <lb/> lumber is
                  being sawn and no royalty paid. We <lb/> should get after the Department of
                  Natural <lb/> Resources and see that we have stricter and more <lb/> rigid
                  examination of these facts. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If there is no further comment <lb/> on the
                  Labrador, gentlemen, we will proceed to <lb/> the summary. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Does that mean that we are finished <lb/> with the
                  Labrador question? <lb/>

            <p>

               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Mr. Smallwood seemed to speak of <lb/>a lot of things,
                  that are going to get out in the <lb/>papers and over the air, and many people,
                     includ<lb break="no"/>ing the Labrador people themselves, will hear <lb/>that
                  and they are going to wonder what we are <lb/>going to do here. I wonder if we
                  will have an <lb/>opportunity to take up these matters again? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> This Forestry Committee report <lb/> seems to have
                  come under considerable bom<lb break="no"/>bardment since yesterday. It has been
                  severely <lb/> criticised in more ways than one, and various <lb/> questions asked
                  which have not been answered, <lb/> and, if I am in order, I would like to make a
                  <lb/> motion that the whole report be referred back to <lb/>
                  <cb/> the Committee. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Mr. Chairman, the convenor of this <lb/> Committee
                  is outside, but as you know when I <lb/> introduced this report I referred to the
                     sub-com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the Forestry Committee, whose busi<lb
                     break="no"/>ness was to try and get as much of the facts as <lb/> possible
                  together for the report. I would like to <lb/> say now that you have heard Major
                  Cashin refer <lb/> to the awkward position in which this Committee <lb/> has been
                  placed. We have examined several offi<lb break="no"/>cials of the department
                  concerned and sought all <lb/> the information we could, and some we got and <lb/>
                  some we did not get. As far as the report is <lb/> concerned if there is something
                  that some of the <lb/> members think we should seek out, why not make <lb/> those
                  suggestions on paper so that if we should <lb/> meet again, we should know what to
                  tackle. To <lb/> my knowledge, as far as Labrador is concerned, <lb/> any further
                  information that we could get is <lb/> probably only guesswork, and I don't think
                  that <lb/> is much good. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> What is your motion, Mr. Watton'? <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> My motion is that the report be sent
                  <lb/>back. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We promised last night that we <lb/> would
                  supplement the report with the informa<lb break="no"/>tion that we could get. With
                  regard to Labrador <lb/> we can tell you straight that we can't get any <lb/>
                  further information. We can't get the names of <lb/> the individuals who are
                  looking for leases at the <lb/> present time. With regard to the amount of wood,
                  <lb/> we don't know — there has been no real survey <lb/> made, and it is only
                  guesswork. If you are <lb/> prepared to pass this report, we will bring back <lb/>
                  any further information possible when the House <lb/> meets again. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> In that event the various questions <lb/> that
                  have been put forward, if the Forestry Com<lb break="no"/>mittee will take upon
                  itself to bring in these <lb/> answers in supplementary form ... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> If the Convention will receive this <lb/> report
                  as it is now, I will assure you, and I think <lb/> my colleagues will agree with
                  me, that we will <lb/> get the information if possible and get it here <lb/> when
                  the House next meets. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> In that event, if that suits everyone, <lb/> I
                  withdraw that motion. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well I move that the report as it is <lb/> be
                  received, and that the committee rise, and <lb/> when we meet again we will bring
                  in that infor<lb break="no"/>mation as a supplementary report. <lb/>

                  we <lb/>will do our best to get information. I honestly <lb/>believe that we have
                  tried to get the information, <lb/>and there is a lot of credit due to Major
                  Cashin in <lb/>that he has tried, but he seems to get up against a <lb/>
                  <cb/> blank wall. It seems right from the very first, and <lb/> I think we are
                  going to find it right straight <lb/> through, that the government of this country
                  has <lb/> no bookkeeping at all, and sometime of course <lb/> you have to start
                  bookkeeping, and until that day <lb/> we have to do the best we can. I think it is

     Mr. Bradley Mr. Chairman, I move the follow<lb break="no"/>ing resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas Almighty God has removed 
     <lb/>
     from our midst the Honourable Mr. Justice 
     <lb/>
     Fox, K.C., our Chairman; and 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas in his passing Newfoundland has

     lost one of her great sons and this National

     unfailing devotion to its best interests raised

     it high in the esteem of the country: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And Whereas the members of the Nation- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     a1 Convention are deeply conscious of the 
     <lb/>
     light that has passed from them; therefore be 
     <lb/>
     it 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolved that the members of the Nation<lb break="no"/>al Convention desire to record their profound 
     <lb/>
     sorrow over the passing of their Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     and to convey to his family their hope that the 
     <lb/>
     Almighty Father will be present with them in 
     <lb/>
     their bereavement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, how true is it that "in the midst of life, we 
     <lb/>
     are in death." Not many days ago, Mr. Justice 
     <lb/>
     Fox, our Chairman, was amongst us; today, his 
     <lb/>
     Chair is vacant; his soul has winged its way to the 
     <lb/>
     God who gave it and we have laid his earthly 
     <lb/>
     tabernacle beneath the mouldering dust of earth. 
     <lb/>
     Some knew him but a few weeks, since the open<lb break="no"/>ing of this Convention, and yet knew him for his 
     <lb/>
     unfailing courtesy and kindliness, for his 
     <lb/>
     scrupulous fairness, his deep and abiding love for 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the land of his birth, and his loyalty to this cham<lb break="no"/>ber wherein days gone by he presided as Speaker 
     <lb/>
     with such dignity and ability. Others of us knew 
     <lb/>
     him many years. My own acquaintance with him 
     <lb/>
     dates back to the early days of the present cen<lb break="no"/>tury, when we were youths together in the study 
     <lb/>
     of the law. Even then he impressed me with his 
     <lb/>
     kindliness and consideration for others, with his 
     <lb/>
     broad charity and his aversion to speaking ill of 
     <lb/>
     anyone, with his earnest conception of the 
     <lb/>
     seriousness of life and with his complete freedom 
     <lb/>
     from all unworthy motives. That impression, sir, 
     <lb/>
     has outlived the years and it abides with me still. 
     <lb/>
     I need not here enlarge upon his career: that is a 
     <lb/>
     public document which all may read and one of 
     <lb/>
     which those who loved him best may justly be 
     <lb/>
     proud. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the practice of his profession, he was deeply 
     <lb/>
     sensible of his duty to those whose interests were 
     <lb/>
     entrusted to his care. He was profoundly con<lb break="no"/>cerned about our system of laws, which he 
     <lb/>
     regarded as the greatest bulwark of human 
     <lb/>
     freedom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Three times was he called to the counsels of 
     <lb/>
     his country, and in his native district never did he 
     <lb/>
     suffer a defeat at the hands of the electorate <lb break="no"/>eloquent testimony, indeed, of the place that he 
     <lb/>
     filled in the hearts of his countrymen. Later he 
     <lb/>
     was elevated to be one of His Majesty's judges 
     <lb/>
     of our Supreme Court, where he had scarcely 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     ¹The Secretary, Captain Warren, acted as Chairman.
