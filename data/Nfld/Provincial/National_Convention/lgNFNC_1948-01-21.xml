     my pocket, and there was 50 cents in the house. 
     <lb/>
     I went to the Newfoundland Hotel; I knew Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Stafford and I got my dinner. Then I got out of 
     <lb/>
     the country, and thank God, luck has been with 
     <lb/>
     me ever since. But I had to go aboard a Greek 
     <lb/>
     ship to get a job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The other day we had here one of the best 
     <lb/>
     bargains in a ship that Newfoundland ever had, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not need anyone to tell me anything 
     <lb/>
     about ships. I went up and I saw the Commisioner 
     <lb/>
     and I said, "Why not get her?" I was told that they 
     <lb/>
     would investigate the matter. We have a deficit 
     <lb/>
     on the Railway, and here was something that for 
     <lb/>
     the next five years, three at least, would take 
     <lb/>
     $200,000 off the deficit. But, no, that was not 
     <lb/>
     worth bothering about. One of the members of a 
     <lb/>
     firm here who gave me my first job, got the ship 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     and is repairing her here in Newfoundland. This 
     <lb/>
     is what we are up against. There are roughly 
     <lb/>
     4,000 seamen here and not 500 of them can get a 
     <lb/>
     job. One of these days depression will strike and 
     <lb/>
     we will have nothing; and when it does, God help 
     <lb/>
     whoever is in charge of this country — whether 
     <lb/>
     it is confederation, Commission or responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. I can assure you, you are not talking 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundlanders like you had in 1939. You 
     <lb/>
     have Newfoundlanders now who know what it is

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have replies to a couple of 
     <lb/>
     questions we directed to Canada, questions, that 
     <lb/>
     is, that were put by me. Some of these I put more 
     <lb/>
     or less on my own, and others in response to 
     <lb/>
     questions by members throughout the debate. 
     <lb/>
     One question was to ask for statistics showing 
     <lb/>
     exports of salt dried codfish from Canada to the 
     <lb/>
     foreign markets over a period of years, together 
     <lb/>
     with some explanation of why salt codfish exports 
     <lb/>
     to the Mediterranean markets have fallen off in 
     <lb/>
     recent years. That answer, sir, is rather long, and 
     <lb/>
     I don't think the copies are on the desks of the 
     <lb/>
     members, and if not they certainly will be. It says: 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Canada's exports of salt cod to countries 
     <lb/>in the Mediterranean area were of consider<lb break="no"/>able extent in the 1925-29 period, when they 
     <lb/>averaged about l5% of total Canadian ex<lb break="no"/>ports of this commodity. The fish involved 
     <lb/>was product of the Gaspé fisheries mainly, 
     <lb/>and almost all of it was exported to the Italian 
     <lb/>market, with negligible quantities to the 
     <lb/>Spanish and Portuguese markets. This trade 
     <lb/>declined after the period mentioned as a 
     <lb/>result of several influences...

            </p></quote>


            <p>Then it goes on to say that the reason it fell off in 
     <lb/>Europe was that the hard times there dried up the 
     <lb/>demand for fish, and because of the sanctions that 
     <lb/>the League of Nations imposed on Italy at the 
     <lb/>time of the Ethopian war. It points out also that 
     <lb/>in the same time period the current exports from 
     <lb/>the Gaspé coast and Newfoundland exports fell 
     <lb/>off at the same time.

            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     There is another question: "Whether, in the 
     <lb/>
     event of union, existing or other privately-owned 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting stations would be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     operate, and what is the policy of the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada as to power output to such private 
     <lb/>
     stations." The answer is short: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The policy of the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     authorities is, receiving the recommendation 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 
     <lb/>
     each case, annually to renew licences for 
     <lb/>
     private commercial broadcasting stations, 
     <lb/>
     unless there is a special reason for non- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     renewal, and to grant new applications for 
     <lb/>
     licences for such stations where they appear 
     <lb/>
     advisable and technically possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A general ceiling of 5 kw on the power of 
     <lb/>
     private commercial broadcasting stations has 
     <lb/>
     been in effect, but there have been exceptions 
     <lb/>
     to this and it is expected higher power will be 
     <lb/>
     allowed in some other cases where it appears 
     <lb/>
     desirable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the event of union the same policies in 
     <lb/>
     these matters would be applied to New<lb break="no"/>foundland as in the rest of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     The ceiling of 5 kilowatts is 5,000 watts, which 
     <lb/>
     is ten times more, I think, than any private broad<lb break="no"/>casting station in Newfoundland at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then there is another question: "Whether ex<lb break="no"/>isting specially low rates charged to fishermen 
     <lb/>
     travelling by Railway trains and steamers be<lb break="no"/>tween Newfoundland and Labrador would be

     continued in the event of union." I forget who it 
     <lb/>
     was, I think it was Mr. Bailey who mentioned the 
     <lb/>
     matter — under confederation would our fisher<lb break="no"/>men get the old rates travelling down to Labrador 
     <lb/>
     as they always got. The answer is this:  
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The nearest existing Canadian parallel to 
     <lb/>
     the above arrangement would appear to be 
     <lb/>
     the special reduced rates afforded by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National and Canadian Pacific rail<lb break="no"/>ways for the movement of harvesters to the 
     <lb/>
     Prairies and return. These reduced rates are 
     <lb/>
     provided directly by the railways and not as 
     <lb/>
     a matter of governmental arrangement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the event of union, there would appear 
     <lb/>
     to be three possible ways in which existing 
     <lb/>
     specially low rates charged to the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     travelling by Railway trains and steamers 
     <lb/>
     between Newfoundland and Labrador would 
     <lb/>
     be continued: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (1) The Railway could provide the 
     <lb/>
     reduced rates directly; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) The Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     could make an arrangement with the railway 
     <lb/>
     under which the railway would provide the 
     <lb/>
     rates; or 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (3) The federal government could make 
     <lb/>
     such an arrangement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is suggested that the question as to 
     <lb/>
     which of these alternatives should be adopted 
     <lb/>
     is one which could in due course be settled 
     <lb/>
     by the appropriate authorities in Canada and

     Newfoundland.

     I think Mr. Fudge raised this question: Where 
     <lb/>
     does an unemployed man, under the Unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment Insurance Act, have to report? The answer 
     <lb/>
     is this: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     (a) An insured person under the Un<lb break="no"/>employment Insurance Act, on becoming un<lb break="no"/>employed, reports at the nearest National 
     <lb/>
     Employment Office set up under authority of 
     <lb/>
     the Act. The insured person reports at this 
     <lb/>
     office in order that he may register for 
     <lb/>
     employment, and make a claim for benefit if 
     <lb/>
     he so desires. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (b) When first unemployed, an insured 
     <lb/>
     person claiming benefit is required to report 
     <lb/>
     in person, unless the cost of ordinary return 
     <lb/>
     transportation from his residence to the 
     <lb/>
     nearest National Employment Office ex<lb break="no"/>ceeds $1.20. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So long as an insured person continues to 
  
            <cb/>
          

     claim benefit he is required to prove that he 
     <lb/>
     continues to satisfy the conditions for the 
     <lb/>
     receipt of benefit, for example, he must prove 
     <lb/>
     that he is unemployed, capable of work, 
     <lb/>
     available for work, but unable to obtain 
     <lb/>
     suitable employment. An insured person is 
     <lb/>
     required to report once a week, if the cost of 
     <lb/>
     return transportation to the nearest office is 
     <lb/>
     30 cents or less; where the cost of such 
     <lb/>
     transportation is 31 cents to 60 cents, he 
     <lb/>
     reports every two weeks; 61 cents to 90 cents 
     <lb/>
     every three weeks, and 91 cents to $1.20 
     <lb/>
     every four weeks. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Where the cost of return transportation 
     <lb/>
     from an insured person's residence to the 
     <lb/>
     nearest office is more than $1.20, he makes 
     <lb/>
     his claim on becoming unemployed by mail, 
     <lb/>
     and proves that he continues to satisfy the 
     <lb/>
     conditions for the receipt of benefit by mail<lb break="no"/>ing a declaration to the office each week. This 
     <lb/>
     declaration must be certified by two respon<lb break="no"/>sible persons who have knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
     statements which the insured person has 
     <lb/>
     made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (c) The movement of labour in general 
     <lb/>
     across boundaries is much greater in some 
     <lb/>
     areas than in others. This results from the fact 
     <lb/>
     that some industrial centres are located near 
     <lb/>
     to provincial boundaries. The labour is at<lb break="no"/>tracted to these centres, and the crossing of a 
     <lb/>
     provincial boundary is incidental. Clearly the 
     <lb/>
     insured person might be offered employment 
     <lb/>
     within the province in which he resides 
     <lb/>
     which would involve his moving a much 
     <lb/>
     greater distance than to accept employment 
     <lb/>
     in an adjoining province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In deciding whether an insured person 
     <lb/>
     should be required to move to another dis<lb break="no"/>trict, whether or not the new district is in the 
     <lb/>
     same province, many factors would be con<lb break="no"/>sidered. A single person without home 
     <lb/>
     responsibilities would be expected to move 
     <lb/>
     more readily than a married man with a fami<lb break="no"/>ly, for example. One of the most important 
     <lb/>
     considerations would be the insured person's 
     <lb/>
     prospects of employment in his own district. 
     <lb/>
     The length of time he has been unemployed, 
     <lb/>
     the distance of the new district from his place 
     <lb/>
     of residence, and the possibility of obtaining 
     <lb/>
     suitable living accomodation would all be 
     <lb/>
     weighed carefully.

     The relevant section of the Unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment Insurance Act, copies of which have 
     <lb/>
     been supplied to the National Convention, 
     <lb/>
     (section 40) outlines, inter alia, the basis 
     <lb/>
     upon which an insured person may be dis<lb break="no"/>qualified from receiving benefit on account 
     <lb/>
     of neglecting an opportunity to engage in 
     <lb/>
     suitable employment. It will be noted that 
     <lb/>
     employment in this connection is not 
     <lb/>
     regarded as suitable if it is employment in his 
     <lb/>
     usual occupation at a lower rate of wages or 
     <lb/>
     on conditions less favourable, than those ob<lb break="no"/>served by agreement between employers and 
     <lb/>
     employees, or failing any such agreement, 
     <lb/>
     than those recognised by good employers; or 
     <lb/>
     employment...at a lower rate of wages, or on 
     <lb/>
     conditions less favourable, than those which 
     <lb/>
     he might reasonably expect to obtain, having 
     <lb/>
     regard to those which he habitually obtained 
     <lb/>
     in his usual occupation, or would have ob<lb break="no"/>tained had he continued to be so employed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Also until a reasonable length of time has 
     <lb/>
     elapsed, employment is not regarded as 
     <lb/>
     suitable if it is employment of a kind other 
     <lb/>
     than employment in his usual occupation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The only persons who have so far been 
     <lb/>
     moved from one province to another under 
     <lb/>
     the Unemployment Insurance Act have been 
     <lb/>
     single persons over 21 years of age who have 
     <lb/>
     themselves been willing to make the move. 
     <lb/>
     They constitute a very small fraction of the 
     <lb/>
     total number of persons insured and the 
     <lb/>
     federal authorities have paid their transporta<lb break="no"/>tion expenses wherever this was considered 
     <lb/>
     necessary, In short, while an insured person 
     <lb/>
     who is unemployed can be required to 
     <lb/>
     remove to another province to accept 
     <lb/>
     employment, there are numerous conditions 
     <lb/>
     which must be satisfied before this can take 
     <lb/>
     place, and in fact the only such movement 
     <lb/>
     which has so far occured has been on a volun<lb break="no"/>tary basis.

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     It is understood that the Clarenville ves<lb break="no"/>sels are owned by the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but are operated for the government by 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland Railway. In the event of 
     <lb/>
     federal union of Newfoundland and Canada, 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian National Railways could 
     <lb/>
     operate the vessels, either under arrangement 
     <lb/>
     with the Newfoundland government, should 
     <lb/>
     the vessels remain in the ownership of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, or as operators and managers for

     <lb/>
     in the ownership of Newfoundland, or as 
     <lb/>

     Crown property.

            <p>
     Since these vessels appear to some extent

     to fall in a special category, it is felt that it 
     <lb/>
     would be impracticable, without a more com<lb break="no"/>plete examination of the matter than has 
     <lb/>
     hitherto been possible, to attempt to settle the 
     <lb/>
     question at this time. It is suggested that this 
     <lb/>
     matter which could in due course be settled

     That was a question, sir, which I asked 
     <lb/>
     through Mr. Smallwood when he was piloting 
     <lb/>
     through the terms from Ottawa, and while I may 
     <lb/>
     be under a misunderstanding, I thought the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was to include whether the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment was to continue to operate them in the 
     <lb/>
     present service that they are in today, if they are 
     <lb/>
     taken over. I thought that was to be part of it. Why 
     <lb/>
     I mentioned it was this: the answer again is 
     <lb/>
     evasive, it does not give the information we were 
     <lb/>
     looking for. If the federal government took over 
     <lb/>
     those Clarenville motor vessels, and operated 
     <lb/>
     them as such, there would be no reason why the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec or Nova Scotia governments could not 
     <lb/>
     demand part service of them, and they are of

     our fish to the West Indies and bring back salt and 
     <lb/>
     molasses. Steamers cannot get into these small 
     <lb/>
     outports due to their draft, and if we did have part 
     <lb/>
     of these taken away to serve the Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     people in the West Indies it would be to the 
     <lb/>
     detriment of the Newfoundland people, because 
     <lb/>
     they have saved us time and money, and I am 
     <lb/>
     afraid that many of us did not realise the impact 
     <lb/>
     of this on our export trade if they are taken over 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     answer to that, but apparently they cannot give us 
     <lb/>
     an answer to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I may be mistaken, but I 
     <lb/>
     thought it was Mr. Job who raised that question. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> ....Mr. Job mentioned it, but I 
     <lb/>raised the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Who owns the Clarenville 
     <lb/>
     boats? To be quite frank with you I felt a bit 
     <lb/>
     ashamed, for myself only, not for the other mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the delegation, that I had not got that 
     <lb/>
     matter made absolutely crystal clear when we 
     <lb/>
     were there. These boats do not belong to the 
     <lb/>
     Railway — they belong to the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. The Railway, for a fee from the 
     <lb/>
     government, has been managing them, but they 
     <lb/>
     do not own them, and when they take over the 
     <lb/>
     Railway system they don't have to take over 
     <lb/>
     boats which the Railway does not own, so it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that they would continue to belong 
     <lb/>
     to the Newfoundland government. The reply he 
     <lb/>
     has just read out from the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     shows clearly that they think that they belong to 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government, and under con<lb break="no"/>federation why should they not continue to 
     <lb/>
     remain the property of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government? The provincial government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland could make an arrangement for 
     <lb/>
     the Railway to go on managing these boats, or for 
     <lb/>
     the federal government to manage them, but in 
     <lb/>
     either case they would be managed in the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of Newfoundland, because Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     owns these boats. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> The Canadian government got 
     <lb/>
     some officials to value these boats in the event of 
     <lb/>
     taking them over, and the value was considerably 
     <lb/>
     lower than we have put on them today. I realise 
     <lb/>
     our value is higher because of the fact that we had 
     <lb/>
     to first build a shipyard. The most important part 
     <lb/>
     of the question was: In the event of their taking 
     <lb/>
     them over would they maintain them in the 
  

            <cb/>
          

     present service? That was not asked, and we have 
     <lb/>
     not got an answer to it. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Frankly I don't think we need 
     <lb/>doubt that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I am afraid I am full of a lot of

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Because in the Grey Book it says 
     <lb/>they are going to take over the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Railway, including steamship and other marine 
     <lb/>services of the government. And also I would like 
     <lb/>to point out in this respect that another section 
     <lb/>definitely states that our government would not 
     <lb/>be permitted to subsidise any industry which 
     <lb/>would be in competition with a similar industry 
     <lb/>in any other province of Canada. If we had our 
     <lb/>own steamers we would, in a sense, be subsidis<lb break="no"/>ing the industry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There are literally thousands, 
     <lb/>as Major Cashin knows a lot better than I do, of 
     <lb/>boats, ships in Canada privately owned and 
     <lb/>operated, that are subsidised by the Government 
     <lb/>of Canada. Every little twopenny-half-penny 
     <lb/>boat in the Maritimes is subsidised every year by 
     <lb/>the Government of Canada.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Even at the present time they are

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to point of order. I understood

     Dear Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have considered the question concerning 
     <lb/>
     the continuance of the National Convention, 
     <lb/>
     raised at a recent session of the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     to which your letter of January 20 relates. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The Convention, is constituted by the Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention Act, 1946, with the duty 
     <lb/>
     and function in that act set forth. A conven<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
     representatives with the Chairman form the 
     <lb/>
     convention when assembled for the perfor<lb break="no"/>mance of the function assigned by the act. 
     <lb/>
     The Convention will have completed its 
     <lb/>
     function with the making of recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions as to possible forms of future govern<lb break="no"/>ment to be put before the people at the 
     <lb/>
     national referendum and will thereupon 
     <lb/>
     cease to exist as a convention or assembly. It 
     <lb/>
     therefore follows that, after completion of the 
     <lb/>
     function set forth in the act, any meetings of 
     <lb/>
     representatives with the Chairman would not 
     <lb/>
     be sessions of the National Convention.

            </p>

     necessary for the purpose of terminating the

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, as I moved the ad<lb break="no"/>journment of this debate yesterday afternoon I

     take itI am entitled to the floor this afternoon, but 
     <lb/>
     Mr. McCormack, who has to go out of town this

     afternoon, has asked that I yield the floor to him 
     <lb/>
     first, and on the understanding that I can have it 
     <lb/>
     next I am prepared to do that. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. McCormack spoke of it to

     me, and it is of very great importance to him, and 
     <lb/>
     I think the House would have no objection.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In 
     <lb/>
     speaking in support of this motion I might say 
     <lb/>
     that our Letters Patent of 1934, wherein we were 
     <lb/>
     promised the return of our former status on the 
     <lb/>
     request of the people when we again became 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting, has caused me considerable 
     <lb/>
     perplexity, especially in the early days of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention when we heard so much talk of the 
     <lb/>
     constitutionality of almost everything before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. At that time I was quite concerned, and 
     <lb/>
     was most desirous to have the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     angles ironed out, and as yet I fail to see why 
     <lb/>
     some of our legal minds did not have the position 
     <lb/>
     clarified for the benefit of the electorate. How<lb break="no"/>ever, this issue appears to have disappeared with 
     <lb/>
     the disappearance of the constitutional expert, 
     <lb/>
     Professor Wheare. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, the electorate of this country is 
     <lb/>
     awakening to that political interest which was 
     <lb/>
     drugged into insensibility during 14 years of non- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     representative government, and I feel that this 
   

            <cb/>
         

     much criticised Convention will have fully jus<lb break="no"/>tified its existence if it thoroughly awakens in our 
     <lb/>
     people a realisation of the purposes and duty of 
     <lb/>
     government. Incidentally I feel that this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, with all its shortcomings, has been unduly 
     <lb/>
     censured. We were given a job that usually re<lb break="no"/>quires experts and expected to do it without the 
     <lb/>
     necessary assistance and co-operation that ex<lb break="no"/>perts usually receive. However, we are about to 
     <lb/>
     finish our work and in a short while the people 
     <lb/>
     will be asked to register their decision on the form 
     <lb/>
     of government they desire, and in my opinion it 
     <lb/>
     should be made as easy and clearcut as possible, 
     <lb/>
     it being our duty to give them a factual and true 
     <lb/>
     position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under the motion we are to concern ourselves 
     <lb/>
     with two forms of government — responsible and 
     <lb/>
     commission, and I wish to say that it is my 
     <lb/>
     conviction that the people of the district which I 
     <lb/>
     have the honour to represent are concerned with 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">only</hi> these two forms, and because of the small 
     <lb/>
     minority who have mistaken ideas about the latter 
     <lb/>
     form — commission government — I choose to 
     <lb/>
     deal with that first. I would point out to these few 
     <lb/>
     that, to use a very common and oft-repeated 
     <lb/>
     expression, government by commission has out<lb break="no"/>lived its usefulness. Granted we were in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion of default in 1933 — so were others. 
     <lb/>
     Anyway, it was fine to have Britain underwrite 
     <lb/>
     our obligations, but in giving credit where it is 
     <lb/>
     due, we must also realise that in making a com<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1281</fw>
         

     parison of the work accomplished by Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government and our old responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ments, we must bear in mind the unprecedented 
     <lb/>
     revenues the former had to work with, as against 
     <lb/>
     the meagre revenues of the old days. Also, that 
     <lb/>
     prior to wartime prosperity, we still had dole 
     <lb/>
     under Commission government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Most people realise now that the stabilisation 
     <lb/>
     of fish prices was not due to Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment; and to those who talk of our additional 
     <lb/>
     social services, I would say that the millions spent 
     <lb/>
     on dole made necessary many of these services 
     <lb/>
     — I have in mind the undernourishment of our 
     <lb/>
     people as a cause of the present high cost of 
     <lb/>
     Public Health and Welfare. I feel that these high<lb break="no"/>ly-spoken-of additional services may be a burden 
     <lb/>
     of expense which any future government may 
     <lb/>
     very well find it difficult to maintain. This 
     <lb/>
     degrading dole business brought to many of our 
     <lb/>
     people a lack of that independence and initiative 
     <lb/>
     so characteristic of Newfoundlanders, many of 
     <lb/>
     whom are now willing to wait for government 
     <lb/>
     assistance or accept bonuses from other 
     <lb/>
     countries. Mr. Chairman, Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment personnel, as someone has said, are but 
     <lb/>
     puppets of the Dominions Office and are not at 
     <lb/>
     present in a position to assure us of those guaran<lb break="no"/>tees given in 1934; and considering the mag<lb break="no"/>nificent role played by Britain in the recent war, 
     <lb/>
     we must realise that she is in the worst position 
     <lb/>
     of her history, so we cannot expect her to under<lb break="no"/>write our finances. Most of the evils of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion were due to the set-up rather than the 
     <lb/>
     personnel, as in all matters of policy they were 
     <lb/>
     subject to the Dominions Office, and in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion the English Commissioners were never 
     <lb/>
     left here long enough to get a thorough grasp of 
     <lb/>
     the problems of our economy or the requirements 
     <lb/>
     of our people. Certainly, they could not expect to 
     <lb/>
     get a knowledge of the former, with their behind- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     the-scenes policy, having no consultations with 
     <lb/>
     the men who make possible our trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce, and most certainly not the latter, when 
     <lb/>
     people were completely ignored and disregarded 
     <lb/>
     on all matters pertaining to their welfare. To put 
     <lb/>
     it simply, it is practical dictatorship from 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office, the heads of which were quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with balanced budgets, and that no loud 
     <lb/>
     protests reached the British Parliament. In pass<lb break="no"/>ing from Commission government, I might say 
     <lb/>
     that we fully appreciate Britain's war effort, and 
  

            <cb/>
           

     in her emergency of 1941 any Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government would have approved the lease of 
     <lb/>
     bases to the USA. But we feel that she should not 
     <lb/>
     have given territorial concessions for 99 years 
     <lb/>
     without our consent; and might have given them 
     <lb/>
     for the duration, as Iceland did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, before I deal with responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, it might be well to point out that 
     <lb/>
     whilst the primary function of government is to 
     <lb/>
     provide rules and safeguards for law and order, 
     <lb/>
     to secure freedom and liberty and protect the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the people, it should also provide an 
     <lb/>
     efficient administrative service, advance the 
     <lb/>
     causes of public health, education and other social 
     <lb/>
     services; provide communications, endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     raise living standards, assist trade and commerce 
     <lb/>
     and help develop natural resources. When this 
     <lb/>
     country first got responsible government, its 
     <lb/>
     population was something over one-third what it 
     <lb/>
     is today, whilst its revenue was only about one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     eightieth, Yet our forebears had the courage to 
     <lb/>
     want to govern themselves. Today, with a record 
     <lb/>
     revenue of $40 million, when we are enjoying the 
     <lb/>
     greatest prosperity in our history, some of our 
     <lb/>
     people are so lethargic as to shun the respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities of self-government. We undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     have made steady progress since the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     this century. We have a much larger population; 
     <lb/>
     our standard of living is higher, and many of our 
     <lb/>
     natural resources are being developed, and it is 
     <lb/>
     time that we realised our importance. We should 
     <lb/>
     remember that from the very discovery of this 
     <lb/>
     island we have had something that others wanted. 
     <lb/>
     In our early history, it was our teeming waters, 
     <lb/>
     today it is the key position of strategic value in 
     <lb/>
     the defence of the western hemisphere. The 
     <lb/>
     recent war really put us on the map, and our 
     <lb/>
     country has become known and its value ap<lb break="no"/>preciated by the occupation forces from all over, 
     <lb/>
     both the USA and Canada. This factor alone, 
     <lb/>
     gives us a strong bargaining power. It is quite 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary for me to dwell further on this point, 
     <lb/>
     as it has been thoroughly covered by other 
     <lb/>
     delegates, particularly by Mr. Higgins and the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. R. B. Job. Coupled with this is another 
     <lb/>
     factor of equal importance, the vast mineral 
     <lb/>
     deposits of our northern dependency, Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     This point has been stressed by Major Cashin, but 
     <lb/>
     it well merits repetition, without becoming 
     <lb/>
     tedious. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Considering these facts, gentlemen, which

     even Mr. Smallwood won't deny, we might well 
     <lb/>
     ask ourselves which of the two forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment which we are discussing would be able 
     <lb/>
     better to capitalise on such assets. In my opinion 
     <lb/>
     it is responsible government, and I doubt if any 
     <lb/>
     delegate thinks differently. Mr. Chairman, in ad<lb break="no"/>dition to this great bargaining power which a 
     <lb/>
     responsible government could use to our ad<lb break="no"/>vantage, permit me to point out that the demand 
     <lb/>
     for pulp and paper is practically guaranteed for 
     <lb/>
     some years to come. Our mining prospects are 
     <lb/>
     exceptionally good. We have considerable 
     <lb/>
     employment at the different bases and at Gander. 
     <lb/>
     We have a nice surplus and our national savings 
     <lb/>
     are high. Our immediate outlook for the future 
     <lb/>
     must look good to the business brains of the 
     <lb/>
     country, considering the amount of capital ex<lb break="no"/>pended in the construction of fish processing and 
     <lb/>
     canning plants; and given a government respon<lb break="no"/>sible to the people, with the initiative to in<lb break="no"/>augurate a continuous and intensive program of 
     <lb/>
     research and experimentation, we could very 
     <lb/>
     well build up the national income to the point 
     <lb/>
     where the earnings of the people would guarantee 
     <lb/>
     sufficient revenues to provide adequate social 
     <lb/>
     services. Mr. Bailey's idea of more intelligent 
     <lb/>
     buying merits consideration. He says, "Take 
     <lb/>
     more from the countries who can and will take 
     <lb/>
     more from us." Import grain from countries who 
     <lb/>
     will take our fish in exchange, and mill it oursel<lb break="no"/>ves, giving employment in the mills and using our 
     <lb/>
     own ships for both the export and import. Ship<lb break="no"/>building, I might say in passing, is an industry 
     <lb/>
     which deserves every encouragement from a 
     <lb/>
     maritime people, and the Clarenville shipyards 
     <lb/>
     have proven the quality of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     workmanship. Before concluding, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, I wish to refer briefly to our main industry, 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries, which affects directly and indirectly 
     <lb/>
     almost every class of workmen in this island. 
     <lb/>
     Government should endeavour to reduce the cost 
     <lb/>
     of supplies, production, processing and market<lb break="no"/>ing, in order to give our young men some incen<lb break="no"/>tive to return to the most vital industry. In 
     <lb/>
     conclusion, I would tell the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, particularly those from my own district, 
     <lb/>
     it is my sincere conviction, after mature considera<lb break="no"/>tion, that responsible government would better 
     <lb/>
     advance our political, social and economic welfare. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, in rising to support 
     <lb/>the motion before the Chair, I feel there is not 


            <cb/>
    

     much that I can add to what I have already said 
     <lb/>
     on this matter. This House well knows, as I 
     <lb/>
     believe does the entire country ... where I stand 
     <lb/>
     today and where I can be found tomorrow. When 
     <lb/>
     first this Convention opened its doors, there were 
     <lb/>
     many who were inclined to believe that my at<lb break="no"/>titude was somewhat unreasonable, if not wholly 
     <lb/>
     prejudiced. They accused me of not being in 
     <lb/>
     possession of that priceless thing called an open 
     <lb/>
     mind. They insinuated that I had not given this 
     <lb/>
     country's political condition proper study, that I 
     <lb/>
     just didn't know what I was talking about. Now, 
     <lb/>
     all this, of course, was entirely incorrect. It is true 
     <lb/>
     I did not have an open mind. I don't think I ever 
     <lb/>
     had such a thing in my life. As a rule, I could 
     <lb/>
     make up my mind on such matters that called for 
     <lb/>
     a decision. To me, an open mind is like an open 
     <lb/>
     mouth. It catches all sorts of flies, and the owner 
     <lb/>
     sometimes does not know when to shut it up. I 
     <lb/>
     did not have to wait for the opening of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to give thought and study to the 
     <lb/>
     political situation of our country. Indeed, for 
     <lb/>
     nearly a year previous to the Convention election, 
     <lb/>
     I had been broadcasting my political doctrine to 
     <lb/>
     all who cared to hear me. The conclusions which 
     <lb/>
     I voiced were arrived at for the simple reason that 
     <lb/>
     the bare facts and the truth of things left no other 
     <lb/>
     course open to me, that for Newfoundland, the 
     <lb/>
     proper, logical, only course open to her was as a 
     <lb/>
     first step, to recover that former status and politi<lb break="no"/>cal position which was hers previous to the loss 
     <lb/>
     of her political freedom in 1933. And so I came 
     <lb/>
     as one who had already added up the sum and 
     <lb/>
     found the answer. And if I had wanted any further 
     <lb/>
     proof that my decision was the right one, and that 
     <lb/>
     I had the right answer, I was given ample proof 
     <lb/>
     of it in the course of the debates which have taken 
     <lb/>
     place in this chamber. Every report on our in<lb break="no"/>dustrial and economic position went to verify it. 
     <lb/>
     Every figure in the Financial Report came as a 
     <lb/>
     further endorsement. And, although I have heard 
     <lb/>
     the endless speeches of those whose political 
     <lb/>
     opinions differ from mine, I, and the country, 
     <lb/>
     have yet to hear any sound, reasonable or logical 
     <lb/>
     arguments advanced to prove to me or them that 
     <lb/>
     this country is not now fitted to assume once 
     <lb/>
     again the proud mantle of democracy which was 
     <lb/>
     unjustly torn from her weakened shoulders in the 
     <lb/>
     dark days of 1933. And after all, I submit that my 
     <lb/>
     attitude will not seem at all strange to anyone who 
     <lb/>
     has given any sound consideration to our political

     history; because if he is at all impartial or fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minded, he must inevitably come to the same 
     <lb/>
     conclusions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First, let us consider why Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should have lost responsible government at all. 
     <lb/>
     Let us ask ourselves why we, of all the British 
     <lb/>
     dominions, should have suddenly had the control 
     <lb/>
     of our country taken from the hands of its people 
     <lb/>
     and passed over to those of outsiders. If we read 
     <lb/>
     the Amulree Report ... we will find in that docu<lb break="no"/>ment many strange and peculiar statements, 
     <lb/>
     made by men who had been sent here at the 
     <lb/>
     instance of the British government, none of whom, 
     <lb/>
     as far as I have been aware, had set eyes on this 
     <lb/>
     country in their whole lifetime. I found in this 
     <lb/>
     report many harsh, reckless statements about our 
     <lb/>
     living and our dead. I found an amazing distortion 
     <lb/>
     of facts and figures, obviously all directed to 
     <lb/>
     justify that final condemnation and judgement 
     <lb/>
     which was to put Newfoundland democracy to 
     <lb/>
     death and condemn our people to a national 
     <lb/>
     debtors' prison for an indefinite term of years. I 
     <lb/>
     asked myself, could such a harsh judgement be 
     <lb/>
     justified? Was there, perhaps, some reasons 
     <lb/>
     which I could not perceive or understand which 
     <lb/>
     would justify this pillaging of those political 
     <lb/>
     liberties for which our forefathers had struggled 
     <lb/>
     so valiantly and so long and which, for over 80 
     <lb/>
     years, had made this island of ours the freest land 
     <lb/>
     in the world? I wanted to know what was the 
     <lb/>
     underlying reason as to why this should come to 
     <lb/>
     a disgraceful end on a dark winter's day in 
     <lb/>
     February 1934, at the dictates of a handful of 
     <lb/>
     outsiders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I asked, "Why did this thing happen to us?" In 
     <lb/>
     what respect had we been wanting? What had we 
     <lb/>
     failed to do, or in what qualities were we, as a 
     <lb/>
     people, so deficient as to disqualify us from 
     <lb/>
     governing our very own land? Was it that New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders had neither the mental capacity, the 
     <lb/>
     executive ability or the vision to govern themsel<lb break="no"/>ves? To answer this question, let your minds 
     <lb/>
     travel with me back through the pages of our long 
     <lb/>
     island story and recall and estimate the calibre of 
     <lb/>
     men who figured in our public life — men whose 
     <lb/>
     names I need not speak, for these names speak 
     <lb/>
     for themselves. The records of their greatness are 
     <lb/>
     ploughed deep into the soil of our national his<lb break="no"/>tory, their names stand out like mountain tops on 
     <lb/>
     the dim horizons of our yesterdays. Would they 
     <lb/>
     have us believe that these men were not pos<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
     
sessed of the qualities of leadership? Do not their 
     <lb/>
     lives and their actions serve as a denial of such 
     <lb/>
     an assumption? Well do we know the path they 
     <lb/>
     travelled was no easy one. No lush revenues nor 
     <lb/>
     $40 million budget was theirs to make smooth the 
     <lb/>
     rough paths of the country's beginnings, to make 
     <lb/>
     the job of statesmen something within the men<lb break="no"/>tality of intelligent office boys. Yet we see them 
     <lb/>
     in the face of the monstrous handicaps of small 
     <lb/>
     revenues and a numerically insignificant popula<lb break="no"/>tion, measuring up to their task of being both 
     <lb/>
     pioneers and statesmen. To them there was the 
     <lb/>
     task of not merely having to run a country, they 
     <lb/>
     had first to build one. And the fact that we sit here 
     <lb/>
     representing some 325,000 people is perhaps the 
     <lb/>
     best evidence that they succeeded and built better 
     <lb/>
     than they knew; that out of the harsh wilderness 
     <lb/>
     of the past they had hewn the solid foundation of 
     <lb/>
     our present, our mines, forests, fisheries, roads, 
     <lb/>
     and railway. For every single industry that we 
     <lb/>
     have with us today, we have to look back in 
     <lb/>
     thanks and lay our tribute on the honoured graves 
     <lb/>
     of these great Newfoundlanders of the past. Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive ability, you say — leadership, capacity to 
     <lb/>
     run a country! Why, if these giants of the past 
     <lb/>
     were here today and were asked to take over this 
     <lb/>
     country and look after it and its people, they 
     <lb/>
     would regard it as mere child's play. And at the 
     <lb/>
     same time they would smile at us, half in pity, 
     <lb/>
     half in contempt, at the timidity and fear which 
     <lb/>
     some of us express when asked to face up to the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of running our own house. No, sir, 
     <lb/>
     the records of our people just won't bear out the 
     <lb/>
     truth of those who say that we are not now, nor 
     <lb/>
     were we in the past, capable of running our own 
     <lb/>
     affairs. Our history gives the denial, written in 
     <lb/>
     letters too large and too brilliant to make any such 
     <lb/>
     statements acceptable to the minds of real New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, you may say, even if we are competent, 
     <lb/>
     have we as a people the courage, the endurance, 
     <lb/>
     the ambition to govern ourselves? And was it 
     <lb/>
     because we lacked these things that we lost our 
     <lb/>
     government? Again let us look at the record: we 
     <lb/>
     find that if there is anything for which we New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders can claim a pride, it is for the 
     <lb/>
     courage of our people. Indeed, we find that per<lb break="no"/>haps more than any other single people in the 
     <lb/>
     world, Newfoundlanders, if they would live and 
     <lb/>
     survive, had to live with the spirit of courage. It 
     <lb/>
     is a spirit which sits with the fisherman in the

     stern of his dory as he voyages over the storm- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lashed ocean. It strides with our sealers over the 
     <lb/>
     perilous icefloes. It marched shoulder to shoulder 
     <lb/>
     with our soldiers along the "Trail of the Caribou" 
     <lb/>
     and to the bloody glory of Beaumont Hamel. Out 
     <lb/>
     from the white cliffs of Dover, it has flown in the 
     <lb/>
     cockpits of the Newfoundland pilots, it has paced 
     <lb/>
     the decks of the heaving destroyers and has 
     <lb/>
     answered the stand-by signal of our gunners on 
     <lb/>
     the desert sands of Africa. No, sir, if the red badge 
     <lb/>
     of courage be the price of democratic freedom, 
     <lb/>
     then to paraphrase Kipling's words, "Lord God, 
     <lb/>
     we have paid in full." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If, then, it was not for the lack of either our 
     <lb/>
     mental or physical fitness that we lost our 
     <lb/>
     democratic freedom, then why was it? I ask the 
     <lb/>
     question, but I think that all of you have the 
     <lb/>
     answer. The people of the country know it, and 
     <lb/>
     the outside world too is aware of it. The answer 
     <lb/>
     is that we lost that last final reward of democratic 
     <lb/>
     living because we were found by Lord Amulree 
     <lb/>
     and the British and Canadian financiers guilty of 
     <lb/>
     the unpardonable sin of being poor. For this alone 
     <lb/>
     we lost all that our forefathers had treasured and 
     <lb/>
     fought for. For this the proud title of "dominion" 
     <lb/>
     was stripped from us. For this these very legisla<lb break="no"/>tive halls were sabotaged of the symbols of a 
     <lb/>
     proud free people.... But did those who sat in 
     <lb/>
     judgement on us give any thought to the things 
     <lb/>
     which had made us poor? In those days we saw 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the world justify their financial dis<lb break="no"/>asters by placing the blame where it rightly 
     <lb/>
     belonged, at the doorstep of the world depression. 
     <lb/>
     Not so with Newfoundland, no such excuse was 
     <lb/>
     accepted from us! On us was pronounced the 
     <lb/>
     verdict of guilty — guilty of being corrupt in our 
     <lb/>
     leaders, both in church and state. These things 
     <lb/>
     they said, and the bad old politicians were 
     <lb/>
     responsible for our downfall. Other and bigger 
     <lb/>
     nations could ignore and even default on their 
     <lb/>
     gigantic national debts, on the pretext that they 
     <lb/>
     were war debts. This they did and believed that 
     <lb/>
     they were keeping their self-respect. Yet could 
     <lb/>
     we not claim the same defense? For was not 
     <lb/>
     nearly $40 million the price we handed out to 
     <lb/>
     help our allies in the war of 1914-18? Over $30 
     <lb/>
     million, nearly a third of our national debt in 
     <lb/>
     1933, which if we had possessed at that time 
     <lb/>
     would have saved us from national misfortune — 
     <lb/>
     dollars which this country and its people freely 
     <lb/>
     gave in a spirit of generous patriotism and for the 


            <cb/>
          

     defense of democracy. The Scripture says, "Cast 
     <lb/>
     your bread upon the waters and it will come back 
     <lb/>
     to you after many days." But, alas, the bread 
     <lb/>
     which came back to 80,000 of our people in the 
     <lb/>
     dark thirties was the bitter crust of the dole. The 
     <lb/>
     millions we had freely poured out to ensure the 
     <lb/>
     freedom of other small countries like ourselves 
     <lb/>
     was the tragic reason that we lost our own 
     <lb/>
     freedom. In Newfoundland democracy died, that 
     <lb/>
     it might live with other peoples! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I continue with my prepared script, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to bring our minds back to this place 
     <lb/>
     in 1931. On many occasions I have repeated what 
     <lb/>
     I am going to repeat now. I feel that my remarks 
     <lb/>
     will not be tedious repetition, for this reason. In 
     <lb/>
     1931, I happened to be Minister of Finance of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — Sir Richard Squires was Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister. We passed an act in this very hall 
     <lb/>
     authorising the government to borrow, on the 
     <lb/>
     credit of the colony, some $8 million. When the 
     <lb/>
     time came round to ask for tenders on the loan, 
     <lb/>
     we were turned down. The executive of the 
     <lb/>
     government met — Mr. Bradley was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the executive — and it was suggested that 
     <lb/>
     myself and the Prime Minister should go to 
     <lb/>
     Montreal to consult with our bankers, the Bank 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal. We did this, and after considerable 
     <lb/>
     difficulty we were able to negotiate a temporary 
     <lb/>
     loan, so to speak, of $2 million to meet our 
     <lb/>
     semi-annual interest coming due on June 30, 
     <lb/>
     1931. Before we did this the General Manager 
     <lb/>
     of the Bank of Montreal took occasion to write 
     <lb/>
     myself and Sir Richard Squires, pointing out that 
     <lb/>
     we should then and there bring about commission 
     <lb/>
     government in Newfoundland, and if we did, they 
     <lb/>
     would guarantee us any kind of money we 
     <lb/>
     wanted, or words to that effect. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     you are now sitting in the Chair occupied by your 
     <lb/>
     predecessor, Hon. Mr. Justice Fox, who was in 
     <lb/>
     Canada at that time and who drafted a reply to 
     <lb/>
     that letter. Our reply was "No". After we got the 
     <lb/>
     $2 million, we came back. We took our political 
     <lb/>
     lives in our hands. We had to strip the public 
     <lb/>
     services. Mr. Bradley served on committees with 
     <lb/>
     us. We stripped the Railway, education, soldiers' 
     <lb/>
     pensions, everything. What was the result? In 
     <lb/>
     December, 1931, we were short again; $2 million 
     <lb/>
     had to be found. That was found by the British 
     <lb/>
     government and, I think, the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment. What happened then? The House opened 
     <lb/>
     in February, 1932. I had resigned as Finance

     Minister, but (I am coming to a very important 
     <lb/>
     matter) for political reasons the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, some of whom now hold responsible 
     <lb/>
     positions in the government, organised a 
     <lb/>
     deliberate attack, physically and otherwise on the 
     <lb/>
     government of the day, with the result that a 
     <lb/>
     general election took place in June, 1932. State<lb break="no"/>ments about that general election have been 
     <lb/>
     repeated over and over again. After the election 
     <lb/>
     in 1932, it was pointed out to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country that immediately after Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government assumed office, they would restore 
     <lb/>
     our financial stability; they would establish new 
     <lb/>
     industries and, if necessary, appoint a royal com<lb break="no"/>mission to go into our position. But (and this is 
     <lb/>
     the real thing!) they told us that ... under no 
     <lb/>
     circumstances would our status as a dominion be 
     <lb/>
     surrendered without first consulting the people. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I don't want to go into the history 
     <lb/>
     of it any further. 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would that be a plebiscite? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> The words were, "Nothing will be 
     <lb/>done". 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am just speaking from memory: 
     <lb/>that nothing will be done unless by way of pleb<lb break="no"/>iscite or referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> But what happened? The next thing 
     <lb/>we find ourselves saddled with is a royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion. There were no new industries started, in 
     <lb/>spite of the fact that many prominent men in the 
     <lb/>country went into the matter and were promised 
     <lb/>that as soon as this government was returned to 
     <lb/>office this would be started. The next thing we 
     <lb/>find is the Amulree royal commission, and the 
     <lb/>Amulree Report will go down in history as — 
     <lb/>well, I can't think of anything bad enough to call 
     <lb/>it. Lord Amulree has passed away since that time 
     <lb/>and many of the men of the government of that 
     <lb/>day have passed away, but I say now that was 
     <lb/>done deliberately, not mind you by the people 
     <lb/>who voted for it in there, they were merely used 
     <lb/>by half a dozen, used to take away our integrity. 
     <lb/>Now the other day Mr. Smallwood stated that 
     <lb/>we were bankrupt. Mr. Chairman, I contend that 
     <lb/>we were not bankrupt. We had not got money, but 
     <lb/>did the British government have it, or Canada, or 
     <lb/>any other countries in Europe have it? No, they 
     <lb/>all defaulted on their war debts, and the war up 
     <lb/>to that time had cost us nearly $40 million and we 
     <lb/>were sweating to pay the interest on that, and the 
   

            <cb/>
      

     other countries were defaulting on it. And I want 
     <lb/>
     to condemn the Amulree Report because in one 
     <lb/>
     paragraph it states that no British dominion or 
     <lb/>
     part of the British Empire had defaulted. Why the 
     <lb/>
     man who wrote that knew he was lying, because 
     <lb/>
     three months previous the British government 
     <lb/>
     itself had defaulted on a payment to the United 
     <lb/>
     States of between $75-90 million, and the in<lb break="no"/>dividual who was principally concerned with 
     <lb/>
     writing that report is now High Commissioner for 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain in Ottawa, and I refer to a gentle<lb break="no"/>man called Mr. Clutterbuck, and I apologise for 
     <lb/>
     calling him a gentleman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Commission government took over here in 
     <lb/>
     1934. Mr. Smallwood said the other day that they 
     <lb/>
     were honest. I say they are the most dishonest 
     <lb/>
     government that ever administered the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     this country. Now I have proven it, and I think I 
     <lb/>
     have already proven it here before and we are 
     <lb/>
     going to have a little tedious repetition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Don't have any criminal libel, 
     <lb/>
     now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am able to take care of myself in 
     <lb/>
     that. The dole was given right from 1933 to 1940. 
     <lb/>
     If you look at the records of the Financial Report 
     <lb/>
     which I have compiled you will find that $17-20 
     <lb/>
     million were advanced by Great Britain in that 
     <lb/>
     period, and the interest on our national debt 
     <lb/>
     during that period was more than the advance 
     <lb/>
     made by Great Britain. Now what is the answer? 
     <lb/>
     Out of our own revenue we got the money to pay 
     <lb/>
     the six cents a day dole, and those monies that 
     <lb/>
     they advanced (the British government) were 
     <lb/>
     really paying their own bondholders in England, 
     <lb/>
     and they were defaulting on their payments to the 
     <lb/>
     United States at the same time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to 1940-41. Here was a trus<lb break="no"/>teeship created in 1934. What is a trusteeship? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, you know all about it better than 
     <lb/>
     I do, and so does Mr. Bradley and Mr. Higgins. 
     <lb/>
     A man comes in and runs an estate, and if he is 
     <lb/>
     out any money he is liable. Now what happens? 
     <lb/>
     In 1940-41 the Commission government and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office there gave away to the United 
     <lb/>
     States government 99-year leases on these bases 
     <lb/>
     for nothing. Now I have no objection, be it under<lb break="no"/>stood, as pointed out by my friend Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Cormick, to giving these bases for the period of 
     <lb/>
     the war. I would give it whole-heartedly; but I 
     <lb/>
     object to any government, particularly this 
     <lb/>
     government who are acting as the trustees of the

     people of Newfoundland, taking our assets and 
     <lb/>
     giving them away for 99 years, and New<lb break="no"/>foundland not reaping any benefit. It has been 
     <lb/>
     pointed out by members that the least we should 
     <lb/>
     have received was a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> in concessions 
     <lb/>
     for our fishery products. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They went out and, I state deliberately, gave 
     <lb/>
     indirect instructions to the American contractors 
     <lb/>
     not to pay our people the same rate of wages as 
     <lb/>
     the Americans and Canadians. They are doing the 
     <lb/>
     same thing now in the Gander territory. There are 
     <lb/>
     Canadians and Americans out there today who 
     <lb/>
     are getting more money for doing the same kind 
     <lb/>
     of work; and they are doing the same thing at the 
     <lb/>
     Torbay airport. Our men are getting 45 cents an 
     <lb/>
     hour today, and the lowest rate paid in St. John's, 
     <lb/>
     if I am correct, is not less than 50 cents to 60 cents 
     <lb/>
     an hour; but the Canadian government, backed 
     <lb/>
     by the Commission government, are paying our 
     <lb/>
     men 45 cents an hour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Expenditure went to wing. Expenditure in 
     <lb/>
     1940-41 was around $6.5 million, and it is up 
     <lb/>
     today to $40 million. That is what we are going 
     <lb/>
     to have, and we are going to have a deficit this 
     <lb/>
     year — we are told that. I charge the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government now with deliberately attempting to 
     <lb/>
     dissipate the treasury of Newfoundland. When 
     <lb/>
     this Convention opened, September 11, 1946, I 
     <lb/>
     made a statement that Mr. Attlee stated in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, when he was bringing in this 
     <lb/>
     White Paper which created this Convention Act, 
     <lb/>
     that his understanding would be that under no 
     <lb/>
     circumstances would any change of government 
     <lb/>
     take place in Newfoundland under ten years, 
     <lb/>
     because the Commission government had a 
     <lb/>
     programme that they wanted to go ahead with 
     <lb/>
     without interruption. Well how far out was I? It 
     <lb/>
     is three years now. There will be no change in any 
     <lb/>
     wise until this fall, and it may not even take place 
     <lb/>
     then, because we are a powerless group with no 
     <lb/>
     courage. Would you mind telling me, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, how long I was on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You have half an hour to go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Thank you. Now reverting again to 
     <lb/>
     the passing of this act, these resolutions that went 
     <lb/>
     over to England to be confirmed by the British 
     <lb/>
     government. I don't intend to read the full resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, but I will draw your attention, and the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the house and of the country to it; I have 
     <lb/>
     drawn it before, but I am going to do it again, 
   

            <cb/>
       

     because I am suspicious of Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and of those who brought it into existence. 
     <lb/>
     If you take the annex to the resolution, sub-sec<lb break="no"/>tion 8, it says definitely: "The existing form of 
     <lb/>
     government would be suspended until such time 
     <lb/>
     as the island would become self-supporting 
     <lb/>
     again." That is sub-section 8. Turn to sub-section 
     <lb/>
     G, which is the last one. What does it say? "It 
     <lb/>
     would be understood that, as soon and the 
     <lb/>
     country is again self-supporting, responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, on request from the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would be restored."<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> Now sir, why 
     <lb/>
     was it necessary to stick in sub-section G when 
     <lb/>
     they had the thing covered in sub-section 8? I 
     <lb/>
     have very suspicious ideas about that sub-sec<lb break="no"/>tion, and I have talked with many gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     were in this House at that time, and they under<lb break="no"/>stood that when Newfoundland was self-support<lb break="no"/>ing responsible government would be handed 
     <lb/>
     back; but now they stuck that in, in the last 
     <lb/>
     section. I have seen funny things happen in this 
     <lb/>
     House once in a while. I feel that "there's some<lb break="no"/>thing rotten in the state of Denmark" in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with that sub-section. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think therefore, Mr. Chairman, that in a 
     <lb/>
     general way I have outlined what brought about 
     <lb/>
     Commission government — we were poor. But 
     <lb/>
     that was not so in 1931 and 1932. It took another 
     <lb/>
     government to come in here and barter it away — 
     <lb/>
     I call it the great betrayal of 1933-34. I have heard 
     <lb/>
     people say, "What could we have done?" What 
     <lb/>
     did the British government do? What did the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Saskatchewan do? What did 
     <lb/>
     other countries do? They defaulted. And weren't 
     <lb/>
     we as much entitled to default as they were? 
     <lb/>
     Couldn't we have carried on and paid six cents a 
     <lb/>
     day dole on our own? Why Professor Plumptre 
     <lb/>
     said that Newfoundland would have been jus<lb break="no"/>tified in defaulting then! And whilst this report I 
     <lb/>
     am referring to was being written, which said that 
     <lb/>
     no British dominion had defaulted, it is a fact that 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain herself had defaulted to America 
     <lb/>
     three months previous to the writing of that 
     <lb/>
     report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What happened in 1894 in the bank crash, and 
     <lb/>
     in 1895? Did the politicians of those days accept 
     <lb/>
     a royal commission from Great Britain? Certain<lb break="no"/>ly not, because they knew what was behind it. But 
     <lb/>
     we did not have courage enough in our govern<lb break="no"/>ment in those days. It was take the line of least

     resistance. I feel if you are not prepared to help 
     <lb/>
     yourself, no one else will help you. We had to 
     <lb/>
     help ourselves and not outsiders. We had no right 
     <lb/>
     to let them in here at all. And so it is that today, 
     <lb/>
     after 14 years, we sit here in these same legisla<lb break="no"/>tive halls, this same House of Assembly that 
     <lb/>
     battered away our liberties in 1933, whose walls 
     <lb/>
     once re-echoed to the voices of our illustrious 
     <lb/>
     men. Where we sit today the fervent oratory of 
     <lb/>
     our ancestors urged our people to eternally fight 
     <lb/>
     and battle for the protection of their democratic 
     <lb/>
     rights. It is a tragic twist of fate that in this very 
     <lb/>
     place we should also sit, and have placed before 
     <lb/>
     us the strange question as to what form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment we want for our people and our country. As 
     <lb/>
     if there were any form but one that any intelligent, 
     <lb/>
     any reasonable, any patriotic Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     could think of asking for either himself or his 
     <lb/>
     people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To understand how misguided such a question 
     <lb/>
     really is, just consider what would be the reaction 
     <lb/>
     if the same question were put today before the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Great Britain or Canada or the 
     <lb/>
     USA, or for that matter any country, whether big 
     <lb/>
     or small, whose people know what it is to enjoy 
     <lb/>
     the priceless privileges of self-government. Do 
     <lb/>
     you think that any of them would consider the 
     <lb/>
     surrender of their liberties for the boon of any 
     <lb/>
     form of commission government? That they 
     <lb/>
     would think of giving a small group of strangers 
     <lb/>
     a free hand to do as they wish with their treasury 
     <lb/>
     and their territory? That has been done. I have 
     <lb/>
     already pointed out that the Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment gave away our territory. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     said they were honest. Again I am reminded of 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador mining concession given out in 
     <lb/>
     1937, whereby certain concessions were given to 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador Mining Co., and for which New<lb break="no"/>foundland was to receive in return a royalty of ten 
     <lb/>
     cents a ton on ore when the mine came into 
     <lb/>
     production, but what happened? Two years ago 
     <lb/>
     this same company approached the government, 
     <lb/>
     and what happened? They cancelled this royalty 
     <lb/>
     and instead took an agreement to be paid 5% on 
     <lb/>
     the net profits of a company that is going to cost 
     <lb/>
     $140-150 million to go into production, and it 
     <lb/>
     will be years before there are any net profits 
     <lb/>
     arrived at. What is that but dishonesty? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, I pointed out here during the debate on 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report and on the Finance Report 
     <lb/>
     the manner in which our various monies were 


            <cb/>
   

     handled by the Commission government, and I 
     <lb/>
     re-point out now that I consider personally, that 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland treasury has been plundered 
     <lb/>
     of $4-5 million since 1940-41, and if anyone 
     <lb/>
     wants to take me up on that I am prepared to meet 
     <lb/>
     them. The talk is too extravagant, too far-fetched, 
     <lb/>
     too ridiculous to even contemplate, and yet that 
     <lb/>
     is the crazy proposition which is put before us 
     <lb/>
     today, and which we are asked to calmly consider. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Can you imagine, Mr. Chairman, what our 
     <lb/>
     forefathers would have done in such a situation? 
     <lb/>
     They would have regarded the whole thing as a 
     <lb/>
     black insult to themselves and their country, and 
     <lb/>
     would have probably thrown it out of the window 
     <lb/>
     and those who proposed it after them. These men 
     <lb/>
     are in the cemetery. We must face the facts as we 
     <lb/>
     find them, disagreeable though they be. We have 
     <lb/>
     to recognise that we are allowed to sit here at all 
     <lb/>
     only by the grace and permission of a dictatorship 
     <lb/>
     government, and consequently that we can only 
     <lb/>
     move and act to the extent and limits which our 
     <lb/>
     chains of bondage will allow us. So recognising 
     <lb/>
     these facts, we find that we must include in our 
     <lb/>
     recommendation, not a form of government mind 
     <lb/>
     you, but forms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My first reaction to such a proposition was that 
     <lb/>
     the terms of reference which contain such a 
     <lb/>
     stipulation were, and are, absolutely contrary to 
     <lb/>
     both the letter, spirit and substance of the agree<lb break="no"/>ment made between the government of this 
     <lb/>
     country and Great Britain in November, 1933. I 
     <lb/>
     regret to say that such a condition is an absolute 
     <lb/>
     violation of that contract, and of the laws govern<lb break="no"/>ing relations between two governments. The 
     <lb/>
     question has been asked here many times as to 
     <lb/>
     why the British government did not and does not 
     <lb/>
     carry out the contract which it made with our 
     <lb/>
     government in 1933; further, on what grounds we 
     <lb/>
     are supposed to ignore this solemn international 
     <lb/>
     pact and allow it to be kicked aside. That question 
     <lb/>
     has been asked but we are still waiting for the 
     <lb/>
     answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I directed that question the other day to His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency the Governor through the medium of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, that on his visit to Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     he ascertain why they did not carry out the 1933 
     <lb/>
     agreement up to the present time. All that has 
     <lb/>
     come back to us are trick evasions and flimsy 
     <lb/>
     excuses. They tell us in effect, as if we were so 
     <lb/>
     many children, that we have no right to ask such 
     <lb/>
     embarrassing, impudent questions. What a

     brazen effrontery to our country! Here we are a 
     <lb/>
     body of men representing all Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     brought here apparently, so we are told, for the 
     <lb/>
     express purpose of deciding on our country's 
     <lb/>
     future form of government; we ask a highly 
     <lb/>
     relevant and important question about a contract 
     <lb/>
     to which we ourselves are party, and under which 
     <lb/>
     we lost our former government, and we are 
     <lb/>
     politely told, Mr. Chairman, to mind our own 
     <lb/>
     business. Every intelligent person knows that the 
     <lb/>
     ballot which by force of law and under the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the 1933 agreement should be put to our people 
     <lb/>
     is simply this: "Do you or do you not want the 
     <lb/>
     return of responsible government?" That is the 
     <lb/>
     choice. That is the legal and the only option 
     <lb/>
     which is provided for in this agreement to which 
     <lb/>
     the British government attached its hand and seal. 
     <lb/>
     That is the choice they promised us. Under what 
     <lb/>
     right do they withhold that choice from us? Under 
     <lb/>
     what law are we deprived of our legal rights? 
     <lb/>
     What is behind all this international double-deal<lb break="no"/>ing and chicanery anyhow? It is a pity that those 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders who can afford it have not long 
     <lb/>
     ago taken steps to bring this whole matter before 
     <lb/>
     the Privy Council, and in this way found out 
     <lb/>
     whether the contract which Great Britain made 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland in 1933 is a proper and 
     <lb/>
     decent transaction, or whether it is a worthless 
     <lb/>
     joke played at the expense of a helpless people. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I am voting in favour of the 
     <lb/>motion before us because, under the circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces I have outlined, I have no choice to do other<lb break="no"/>wise. Now some may say, "Is not this ballot in 
     <lb/>effect carrying out the terms of the 1933 agree<lb break="no"/>ment?" Does it not give our people the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to ask for the return of responsible 
     <lb/>government if they want it?" I tell them it is not. 
     <lb/>There is no reference whatever in this contract 
     <lb/>which asks us to vote on the retention of Com<lb break="no"/>mission government. It is something imported 
     <lb/>and foisted on us. As I said before, the ballot 
     <lb/>which this contract provides for is a simple re<lb break="no"/>quest for the return of one form of government. 
     <lb/>If more than one form of government goes on the 
     <lb/>ballot then I say it goes beyond the powers 
     <lb/>provided in that contract, and to be consistent the 
     <lb/>British government should be ready to put every 
     <lb/>conceivable form of government on the ballot. 
     <lb/>For all we know there may be people in this 
     <lb/>country who may have elected Commission of 
     <lb/>Government, representative government, union 
   

            <cb/>
      

     with Great Britain, union with the USA, etc. Yes, 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing is obviously impracticable, even 
     <lb/>
     ridiculuous, but as I have observed, we must do 
     <lb/>
     the best we can in spite of the obstacles which 
     <lb/>
     have been placed in our path; and as the motion 
     <lb/>
     before us seems to me to be the only method by 
     <lb/>
     which our people are to be given the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of requesting the restoration of their lost political 
     <lb/>
     rights, I have no option but to support the motion. 
     <lb/>
     In doing so it is my fervent hope that if such a 
     <lb/>
     ballot is placed before our people they will regard 
     <lb/>
     it in its true light. They will see it not as a choice 
     <lb/>
     of being asked to vote for two equal forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, but rather as an opportunity for 
     <lb/>
     demanding that the British government fulfill the 
     <lb/>
     pledge that they gave this country in 1933. Let us 
     <lb/>
     see to it that we Newfoundlanders live up to our 
     <lb/>
     solemn contractual obligations, and if the pact of 
     <lb/>
     1933 is to be broken and made a scrap of paper, 
     <lb/>
     let us not allow ourselves to be willing parties to 
     <lb/>
     such a breach of faith. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In dealing with the matter of forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment to go on the ballot, I cannot ignore the fact 
     <lb/>
     that what we recommend, when it reaches Lon<lb break="no"/>don, may be thrown in the waste-paper basket if 
     <lb/>
     it does not suit the fancies of Mr. Attlee, or be in 
     <lb/>
     accord with the future which he has planned for 
     <lb/>
     us. And that reminds me, Mr. Chairman, with 
     <lb/>
     reference to Mr. Attlee, that when this legislation 
     <lb/>
     of 1933 was being passed in the British House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons Mr. Attlee viciously attacked it, and 
     <lb/>
     when the Commission of Government was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed he called them a bunch of bum bailiffs. 
     <lb/>
     Somewhat consistent with his attitude today isn't 
     <lb/>
     it, Mr. Chairman? In which event all our work 
     <lb/>
     here will have been for nothing, and we will 
     <lb/>
     become once again placed in a farcical situation 
     <lb/>
     which we are helpless to prevent. As for myself 
     <lb/>
     I am prepared to believe that the Commonwealth 
     <lb/>
     Secretary has our ballot made out long ago and 
     <lb/>
     poked away in his rolltop desk till the time comes 
     <lb/>
     to send it on to us. I saw it when I was over there. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What is on the ballot? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is poked away up in the attic in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominions Office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You said you saw the ballot. 
     <lb/>
     What is on the ballot? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I said I saw the rolltop desk! And in 
     <lb/>
     reply to my friend Mr. Smallwood, the other day 
     <lb/>
     when he was speaking to this motion he said, and 
     <lb/>
     I quote him practically verbatim, that "he was 
    

            <pb n="1289" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1289.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1289</fw>
         

     voting for this motion, but that he would not vote 
     <lb/>
     for either of them if they went on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     paper". Well, assuming that the two of them 
     <lb/>
     would be on and the other is left off, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is going to be in an awful position, 
     <lb/>
     unless he has the inside dope from the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office. He might have that, because you know 
     <lb/>
     how I feel about the Dominions Office. I say now 
     <lb/>
     about this ballot that I said is tucked away in the 
     <lb/>
     rolltop desk, what a pity that individual did not 
     <lb/>
     send it on to us 12 or 14 months ago, and save us 
     <lb/>
     the trouble and expense of this long drawn out 
     <lb/>
     Convention. However, let us hope that we have 
     <lb/>
     gotten some benefit out of these sessions. Now in 
     <lb/>
     making that statement, much as I have con<lb break="no"/>demned this Convention, and I have called it 
     <lb/>
     everything, I think there has been some good 
     <lb/>
     come out of it. One thing came out of it, we as 
     <lb/>
     members of this National Convention, from 
     <lb/>
     various sections of the country, have met here 
     <lb/>
     together and we have made warm friendships 
     <lb/>
     whichI feel will last for life. Some of us who have 
     <lb/>
     not had any parliamentary experience have 
     <lb/>
     learned considerably about it, and a lot about 
     <lb/>
     government affairs, which without this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion they would never have learned, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently I feel that is one bit of good the 
     <lb/>
     Convention has probably done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And the people, too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And the people have been in<lb break="no"/>formed, Mr. Chairman, as I said this afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     by me, that this government which Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood said was honest, I claim was the most 
     <lb/>
     dishonest government we ever had, and I want to 
     <lb/>
     tell the people and the Convention that now. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You have eight minutes to go, 
     <lb/>Mr. Cashin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> All right, sir. I have often heard 
     <lb/>
     "two minutes to go", and my friend Mr. Bailey 
     <lb/>
     often heard that too. If we have succeeded in 
     <lb/>
     showing our people that Newfoundland is today 
     <lb/>
     a prosperous and self-supporting country, if we 
     <lb/>
     have brought to their notice the great potential 
     <lb/>
     wealth of Labrador, if it has enabled us to remove 
     <lb/>
     some of the smear campaign which has been 
     <lb/>
     directed on our public men of the past, then I 
     <lb/>
     believe to that extent the work will not have been 
     <lb/>
     in vain. I have every confidence that a majority 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention will vote for the motion now 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair. Perhaps some of those who vote 
     <lb/>
     for it may do so for reasons of political strategy 
  

            <cb/>
       

     rather than because they favour either responsible 
     <lb/>
     government or Commission of Government; but 
     <lb/>
     I am sure that the great majority will vote for the 
     <lb/>
     motion because they feel it is the only way open 
     <lb/>
     to them to show their support to the form of 
     <lb/>
     government which the majority of our people 
     <lb/>
     want. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, for a few minutes I will just refer 
     <lb/>
     briefly to our Economic Report, which was based 
     <lb/>
     on every report that was brought in here during 
     <lb/>
     the past 14 or 15 months, our Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     which says that this country at the present time is 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting. That report was unanimously 
     <lb/>
     adopted by this Convention — the only report 
     <lb/>
     that was adopted unanimously. When we 
     <lb/>
     presented our Economic Report, we were most 
     <lb/>
     conservative in our views. We felt that the future 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland is better really than we could 
     <lb/>
     take the chance of telling the people; they would 
     <lb/>
     think we were faking the report. We did not take 
     <lb/>
     into consideration the potential wealth of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, that in Labrador, within five or ten 
     <lb/>
     years, there will be developed the most out<lb break="no"/>standing iron ore mines in the world, on the North 
     <lb/>
     American continent at any rate. Nearly 10 million 
     <lb/>
     tons of iron ore, or possibly 100 million tons a 
     <lb/>
     year. I also wish to point out to Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     who tells us the Commission government was so 
     <lb/>
     honest, they gave away this water-power on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador practically for nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I did not say they were bright 
     <lb/>
     and intelligent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I say they are dishonest. I still say 
     <lb/>
     it. They must be fools. Here we have the greatest 
     <lb/>
     water-power, and the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, prompted by the Dominions Office, gives 
     <lb/>
     it away for 15 cents a horsepower and right 
     <lb/>
     alongside in Quebec, they have to pay $1 a horse<lb break="no"/>power. Honest? I do not think they are fools. I 
     <lb/>
     challenge anyone from the Dominions Office to 
     <lb/>
     show me they are honest in handling the sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund, honest in the handling of the interest-free 
     <lb/>
     loans; honest about the reduction in interest char<lb break="no"/>ges; honest in applying the interest-free loans in 
     <lb/>
     the reduction of our debt. Why, it is the biggest 
     <lb/>
     piece of plundering I ever heard of! If an ordinary 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government pulled off any stunts 
     <lb/>
     like the Commission government did — talk 
     <lb/>
     about the raid which happened in 1932! You 
     <lb/>
     would never hear the like. You do not see the 
     <lb/>
     same people marching on the Colonial Building

     behind us with the awful finality of the prison

     <lb/>
     any preference which he may choose to express 
     <lb/>
     as between one form of government and 
  

            <cb/>
        

     another." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is therefore the duty of this Convention to 
     <lb/>
     record the opinion of each member of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention on two points: (1) As to the form of 
     <lb/>
     government which, in his opinion should be put 
     <lb/>
     before the people of Newfoundland, together 
     <lb/>
     with (2) any preference he may choose to ex<lb break="no"/>press. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I simply mention the rule at this time because 
     <lb/>
     there is a double-barreled motion before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. The motion covers responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Commission government. It may very 
     <lb/>
     well be that some members may have a 
     <lb/>
     preference as between the two forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and therefore would perhaps be hesitant in 
     <lb/>
     expressing their views by virtue of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     in supporting the motion, they would be support<lb break="no"/>ing one form of government with which he or 
     <lb/>
     they did not find themselves in agreement. I want 
     <lb/>
     to make it clear. I propose by a series of polls or 
     <lb/>
     divisions on this motion to find out, first, the 
     <lb/>
     members voting for or against the motion, and 
     <lb/>
     secondly ... it will be my duty to carry out the 
     <lb/>
     order to have their views recorded on both ques<lb break="no"/>tions. Therefore, any member desiring to support 
     <lb/>
     this motion will not be precluded from expressing 
     <lb/>
     his preference as to either of the two forms con<lb break="no"/>tained in the motion. Indeed, it is the other way 
     <lb/>
     about. It is the duty of the Convention, after and 
     <lb/>
     when a member votes for the motion, to decide 
     <lb/>
     whether or not he has any preference for either of 
     <lb/>
     the two forms of government contained in the 
     <lb/>
     motion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would that polling be done 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Mr. Chairman, we are come to the 
     <lb/>
     last scene of all, that will end this strange eventful 
     <lb/>
     history. As she was about to pass into her 450th 
     <lb/>
     year of history, Newfoundland called 45 of her 
     <lb/>
     sons to gather in National Convention to serve a 
     <lb/>
     great cause. And now in a little while New<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
      foundland will know whether or not we who are 
     <lb/>
     gathered here did serve that great purpose with 
     <lb/>
     intelligence, honour and integrity of conscience, 
     <lb/>
     and even at this moment history waits with poised 
     <lb/>
     pen to write upon immortal tablets whether in 
     <lb/>
     these last days we proved to be men of great or 
     <lb/>
     little souls. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, the final test of all will come not so 
     <lb/>
     much upon this motion as upon the next. We have 
     <lb/>
     completed the first part of the task to which we 
     <lb/>
     are committed. We have examined and discussed 
     <lb/>
     among ourselves the financial and economic 
     <lb/>
     changes that have taken place in the island since 
     <lb/>
     1934. With what degree of confidence we have 
     <lb/>
     executed adequate to this hour, all that is now for 
     <lb/>
     history to judge. And so we are come to the 
     <lb/>
     completion of our mission — the recommending 
     <lb/>
     to His Majesty's Government in the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom possible forms of future government to 
     <lb/>
     be put before the people at a national referendum. 
     <lb/>
     In the matter of this great final debate based upon 
     <lb/>
     systems of government I had been hoping for a 
     <lb/>
     better bargain. I had been hoping that the form 
     <lb/>
     that would be taken would be different from that 
     <lb/>
     which has been taken. I had been hoping that it 
     <lb/>
     would be a three-in-one affair, and that the three 
     <lb/>
     forms of government that this Convention has 
     <lb/>
     elected to concern itself with could have been 
     <lb/>
     discussed within the compass of one motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As matters stand the motion now before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair does not admit of any discussion of con<lb break="no"/>federation in conjunction with the two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government with which the motion is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     It is a bit of a bother that the motion does not do 
     <lb/>
     the obvious thing and raise the three issues at 
     <lb/>
     once, for the same yardstick must be applied to 
     <lb/>
     measuring the admittability for referendum pur<lb break="no"/>poses of the form of government proposed by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's forthcoming motion, as to the 
     <lb/>
     measuring of the admittability of the forms with 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Higgins' motion is concerned; I 
     <lb/>
     should have preferred to make one definition of 
     <lb/>
     that yardstick and get it all over with. Indeed, I 
     <lb/>
     think I may just as well do so, and what l have to 
     <lb/>
     say in preamble to discussion of this motion I ask 
     <lb/>
     you to consider as being likewise in preamble to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's motion presently pending. That 
     <lb/>
     would eliminate any need for me to reiterate 
     <lb/>
     myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I take it that I am expected to do here what I 
     <lb/>
     was sent here to do, and that, I hope, is not an

     unreasonable assumption of prerogative unto 
     <lb/>
     myself, since it was written in the bond that what 
     <lb/>
     I should do was recommend possible forms of 
     <lb/>
     future government to be put before the people at 
     <lb/>
     a national referendum. That was what the people 
     <lb/>
     of my district sent me here to do — to recommend 
     <lb/>
     possible forms of future government. I ask you to 
     <lb/>
     note particularly the words, "possible forms". 
     <lb/>
     "Possible", mind you, not impossible, and 
     <lb/>
     "forms", mind you, not form. "Forms" — note 
     <lb/>
     the "s". A great deal of misunderstanding has 
     <lb/>
     arisen about that "possible" and that plural; and 
     <lb/>
     in particular one hears arguments these days that 
     <lb/>
     for the Convention to have to recommend the 
     <lb/>
     maximum of possible alternatives would mean 
     <lb/>
     that we should have to recommend every form of 
     <lb/>
     government known to man. Carry that sort of 
     <lb/>
     thing to its logical conclusion, the argument goes, 
     <lb/>
     and the sky is the limit. The referendum ballot 
     <lb/>
     should run the gamut of government from aristo<lb break="no"/>cracy to theocracy. However, that is an argument 
     <lb/>
     calculated merely to confuse the issue. It is rooted 
     <lb/>
     in either inability or unwillingness to see the 
     <lb/>
     distinction between recommending for the 
     <lb/>
     referendum ballot all the possible forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, and all the forms of government 
     <lb/>
     possible. In the latter instance the sky would 
     <lb/>
     indeed be the limit, but it is not to the latter 
     <lb/>
     enterprise that we are committed. Our concern 
     <lb/>
     here is with all the possible forms of government, 
     <lb/>
     and within that compass the alternatives open are 
     <lb/>
     few. Broadly speaking there are three ways in 
     <lb/>
     which we are limited in the forms of government 
     <lb/>
     that we may recommend: we are limited in con<lb break="no"/>science, by tradition and in fact. We live in a 
     <lb/>
     Christian country. There is behind us a long 
     <lb/>
     Christian tradition; our way of life is Christian to 
     <lb/>
     the core, and so we are bound in conscience to 
     <lb/>
     recommend for purposes of the national referen<lb break="no"/>dum constitutions that will not be in conflict with 
     <lb/>
     Christian ethics. It is consequently not within our 
     <lb/>
     competency to recommend any of those 
     <lb/>
     totalitarian forms of government that put the state 
     <lb/>
     before the individual. This is a free country. 
     <lb/>
     There is behind us along tradition of the rights 
     <lb/>
     of all men to life, liberty and the pursuit of 
     <lb/>
     happiness. Our way of life is democratic to the 
     <lb/>
     core. We are consequently bound by tradition to 
     <lb/>
     recommend for purposes of the national referen<lb break="no"/>dum constitutions that are not in conflict with the 
     <lb/>
     democratic ideal. It is consequently not within 


            <cb/>
    

     our jurisdiction to recommend any form of 
     <lb/>
     government that would encroach upon the liber<lb break="no"/>ties and prerogatives and wishes of the common 
     <lb/>
     man, in consequence of centuries of parliamen<lb break="no"/>tary government and striving to be free. And 
     <lb/>
     finally, we live in a British country. There is 
     <lb/>
     behind us a long and intimate association with the 
     <lb/>
     mother country, and our relations with Britain at 
     <lb/>
     this time are of a very special kind. As we are all 
     <lb/>
     aware, the final decision as to what will appear 
     <lb/>
     on the ballot will be made in Downing Street, and 
     <lb/>
     to my mind we are limited by that fact to constitu<lb break="no"/>tions not incompatible with our remaining within 
     <lb/>
     the structure of the British Commonwealth of 
     <lb/>
     Nations. I think it unlikely that Downing Street 
     <lb/>
     would consider for referendum purposes con<lb break="no"/>stitutions to the contrary. As I see it, we are 
     <lb/>
     limited in fact. We could recommend union with 
     <lb/>
     the United States, but I doubt that in Downing 
     <lb/>
     Street it would receive a second thought, and as 
     <lb/>
     far as I am concerned quite properly so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The truth of the matter is that the sky is not the 
     <lb/>
     limit when it comes to recommending constitu<lb break="no"/>tions. All the forms of government possible are 
     <lb/>
     not all possible forms of government for us, and 
     <lb/>
     we are limited in conscience, by tradition, and in 
     <lb/>
     fact to a few alternatives, and in my opinion it is 
     <lb/>
     our solemn duty to determine among these alter<lb break="no"/>natives, and to recommend those that ought to be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the people of this island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In proceeding to the determination of these 
     <lb/>
     alternatives, there is one further thing to be 
     <lb/>
     remembered — that there is reason in all things. 
     <lb/>
     Notwithstanding the limitations imposed by con<lb break="no"/>science, tradition and fact, there is a goodly num<lb break="no"/>ber of constitutions that we might recommend, 
     <lb/>
     but not all of them are relevant. Not all of them 
     <lb/>
     could be superimposed on the economy of this 
     <lb/>
     country without severe dislocation. Not all of 
     <lb/>
     them are suited to the temperament of our people, 
     <lb/>
     and so it becomes us to exercise such discretion 
     <lb/>
     as to avoid the recommendation of a multiplicity 
     <lb/>
     of irrelevant constitutions, which, if they were to 
     <lb/>
     appear on the referendum ballot would only con<lb break="no"/>fuse the electorate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as I am concerned there are, in addition 
     <lb/>
     to the form of government we now know, but two 
     <lb/>
     other constitutions that may safely and justly be 
     <lb/>
     imposed on our economy, our institutions and our 
     <lb/>
     people. I am compelled to dismiss all other con<lb break="no"/>stitutions we hear suggested as being beside the 


            <pb n="1293" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1293.jpg"/>

     point, even those that we hear mentioned most. 
     <lb/>
     True Crown colony status would go too much 
     <lb/>
     against the grain; Not-them Ireland status would 
     <lb/>
     be merely avoiding the issue; so too would be 
     <lb/>
     representative government — we might as well 
     <lb/>
     retain our caretaker government as replace it with 
     <lb/>
     a kindergarten government; and union with the 
     <lb/>
     United States would raise matters of conscience 
     <lb/>
     for our people to which I for one will not be a 
     <lb/>
     party. As far as my own conscience is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     I am satisfied that I can recommend for submis<lb break="no"/>sion to the Newfoundland people in national 
     <lb/>
     referendum not less than the forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment proposed in the motion before the Chair. In 
     <lb/>
     other words, the least that we dare recommend is 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. When I say Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I mean Commission of Government in its 
     <lb/>
     present form. I cannot see wherein any worth<lb break="no"/>while modification of Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment can be achieved, for if you modify it you 
     <lb/>
     have to do one of two things: provide for the 
     <lb/>
     election of enough Newfoundlanders to carry a 
     <lb/>
     decision in case of dispute, or provide for a 
     <lb/>
     preponderance of Commonwealth Office ap<lb break="no"/>pointees. In a modified Commission in which 
     <lb/>
     elected Newfoundlanders would be in the 
     <lb/>
     majority you would have, in effect, in all but 
     <lb/>
     name, responsible government; so why not have 
     <lb/>
     it by name, and by restoration of our suspended 
     <lb/>
     constitution? It may be that "a rose by any other 
     <lb/>
     name would smell as sweet", but not in this 
     <lb/>
     island, if what would be in effect responsible 
     <lb/>
     government were still called Commission. But on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, in a modified Commission in 
     <lb/>
     which elected Newfoundlanders would be in the 
     <lb/>
     minority, you would have in effect representative 
     <lb/>
     government, and you would have in addition all 
     <lb/>
     the furor, all the dissension, all the bickering that 
     <lb/>
     went with representative government before. 
     <lb/>
     Yes, and no throwing into the balance advisory 
     <lb/>
     councils or anything else would make for peace, 
     <lb/>
     quiet and good government in a body partly 
     <lb/>
     elected by the people, yet preponderantly ap<lb break="no"/>pointed in Whitehall. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am convinced that one of the choices to be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the Newfoundland people should be 
     <lb/>
     retention of Commission of Government in its 
     <lb/>
     present form, but before I go on to say why, let 
     <lb/>
     me say this. Because I like to give credit where 
     <lb/>
     credit is due, I have not joined in the diatribes 


            <cb/>
 

     against the Commission in which this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion has from time to time indulged. Some of the 
     <lb/>
     criticisms of Commission that have been 
     <lb/>
     mouthed have been justified, for the Commission 
     <lb/>
     did fall far short of making the most of the golden 
     <lb/>
     opportunities that Came its way; but hardly a 
     <lb/>
     word of credit has been given to the Commission, 
     <lb/>
     and that has been just simply the old game of 
     <lb/>
     playing politics. In order to redress in some little 
     <lb/>
     manner the injury the Commission has suffered 
     <lb/>
     at our hands, I avail of this opportunity to say this 
     <lb/>
     much in its favour; that notwithstanding its 
     <lb/>
     shortcomings, Commission of Government has 
     <lb/>
     done as much, and perhaps more, for the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     people in this country, the fishermen and farmers 
     <lb/>
     and the loggers, than any government within 
     <lb/>
     living memory; and in saying that I am voicing 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of people all over this country whose 
     <lb/>
     memories can go back much farther than my own. 
     <lb/>
     It would serve no useful purpose for me to 
     <lb/>
     enumerate here the excellencies and negligence 
     <lb/>
     of Commission of Government. The ordinary 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland are not likely to forget 
     <lb/>
     overnight wherein the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has served them well, and this Convention 
     <lb/>
     has done its best to see to it that they will not 
     <lb/>
     forget wherein it has failed, and so I will forego 
     <lb/>
     any recital of hallelujahs and lamentations. There 
     <lb/>
     is this, however, that I think deserving of special 
     <lb/>
     mention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We hear it said these days that the British 
     <lb/>
     government promised that we would have politi<lb break="no"/>cal education during the days of Commission 
     <lb/>
     government, and that that pledge was not 
     <lb/>
     honoured. That, as far as I am concerned, is 
     <lb/>
     something decidedly open to question. It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me that during the days of Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government Newfoundlanders have grown to a 
     <lb/>
     greater political perspicacity than has ever been 
     <lb/>
     there. Commission of Government has been 
     <lb/>
     criticised as dictatorial, and whilst definitely an 
     <lb/>
     oligarchy, it has put into effect policies that have 
     <lb/>
     made the people more politically adequate than 
     <lb/>
     they have ever been. These policies have led to 
     <lb/>
     the growth of many small organisations wherein 
     <lb/>
     many Newfoundlanders have learned the rudi<lb break="no"/>ments of parliamentary procedure, how to talk on 
     <lb/>
     their feet, how to think their way through to 
     <lb/>
     resolutions of a community's problems, what to 
     <lb/>
     look for in a proposal to make it worth their 
     <lb/>
     concern, how to select leaders from among them<lb break="no"/>

     selves — organisations such as co-operative 
     <lb/>
     societies, agricultural societies, regional library 
     <lb/>
     boards, Jubilee Guilds, adult education study 
     <lb/>
     groups and all the rest of it. And as a direct result 
     <lb/>
     of the Commission's specific policy of encour<lb break="no"/>aging local government a score or more com<lb break="no"/>munities have taken upon themselves the status 
     <lb/>
     of municipalities, formally incorporated. All this 
     <lb/>
     has naturally strengthened the competency and 
     <lb/>
     increased the capacity of Newfoundlanders for 
     <lb/>
     the political, and when again politicians take up 
     <lb/>
     the telling of their fairy tales where they left off 
     <lb/>
     15 years ago, they will find themselves up against 
     <lb/>
     this increased capacity for the political. The his<lb break="no"/>toric assumption that the electorate was too green 
     <lb/>
     to burn will have to be revised. It is no longer 
     <lb/>
     quite so green. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Of course, the relative merits of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion's worth must ever remain a matter of dis<lb break="no"/>pute. The Commission has been in office during 
     <lb/>
     two abnormal periods of our history, an abnormal 
     <lb/>
     period of depression and an abnormal period of 
     <lb/>
     what some have been pleased to call prosperity. 
     <lb/>
     It has not been in office during what might be 
     <lb/>
     termed a normal period. In consequence it is 
     <lb/>
     difficult to make comparisons, and therefore dif<lb break="no"/>ficult to judge of the absolute value of its work. 
     <lb/>
     That is not a good and sufficient reason for with<lb break="no"/>holding credit where it is due, and in many mat<lb break="no"/>ters the Commission did act with advantage to 
     <lb/>
     this island and to its people, and I think that a fair 
     <lb/>
     verdict is that we have had good value from the 
     <lb/>
     Commission, and I think that will be the verdict 
     <lb/>
     of history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been suggested to me that aside from the 
     <lb/>
     fact that Commission is government without rep<lb break="no"/>resentation, that there is a further reason why this 
     <lb/>
     Convention should not recommend Commission 
     <lb/>
     for referendum purposes. The Commission sys<lb break="no"/>tem carries with it the guarantee of Britain to 
     <lb/>
     meet our deficits, but for seven years now we 
     <lb/>
     have been able to balance our budget and have 
     <lb/>
     something over and to spare. It is contended 
     <lb/>
     therefore that it would be perhaps immoral of us, 
     <lb/>
     and certainly would not be honourable, to seek a 
     <lb/>
     continuation of the Commission system and 
     <lb/>
     thereby hold Britain to a promise given in al<lb break="no"/>together different circumstances. To put it blunt<lb break="no"/>ly, it is held that we should be without honour to 
     <lb/>
     forego self-govemment merely to have the as<lb break="no"/>surance that somebody else would pay our debts, 
  

            <cb/>
        

     when there are reasonable hopes of being able to 
     <lb/>
     pay our own way in the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The validity of that argument any fair man 
     <lb/>
     must admit, and I have to commend it to the 
     <lb/>
     conscience of the people for their consideration 
     <lb/>
     at the time of the referendum. But it is a matter 
     <lb/>
     for the conscience of the people, it is not a matter 
     <lb/>
     of honour with us. We have no choice but to let 
     <lb/>
     the people have a choice among other forms of 
     <lb/>
     government — Commission. True, the thing was 
     <lb/>
     loaded upon our people in the beginning without 
     <lb/>
     consultation, but they did accept it. Not only does 
     <lb/>
     silence give consent, but so too does acquies<lb break="no"/>cence. Indeed, nobody doubts now but had the 
     <lb/>
     people been consulted during those grim Geth<lb break="no"/>semane days of 1933, that they would have ac<lb break="no"/>cepted Commission. In fact it was welcomed on 
     <lb/>
     every hand with open arms, and there is no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that most of our people have found it good. In any 
     <lb/>
     case, if we are going to give the people a choice 
     <lb/>
     of anything, we must surely ask them if they want 
     <lb/>
     to keep what they already have. To propose alter<lb break="no"/>natives you must begin with what you already 
     <lb/>
     have. A great many people believe that the 
     <lb/>
     specific term of years for which Commission is 
     <lb/>
     to be retained, if it is to be retained, should be 
     <lb/>
     decided in advance. They argue that any retention 
     <lb/>
     of Commission that may materialise from the 
     <lb/>
     referendum should be conditional upon review of 
     <lb/>
     the whole position at the end of five or ten years. 
     <lb/>
     I really cannot see much point in making such a 
     <lb/>
     proviso. If the Newfoundland people decide to 
     <lb/>
     retain the Commission system, and at the end of 
     <lb/>
     a term of years want to examine the situation, 
     <lb/>
     they will have merely to take the necessary steps 
     <lb/>
     to bring about such review; if there is no popular 
     <lb/>
     feeling and agitation for re-opening the question, 
     <lb/>
     then the people should not find themselves com 
     <lb/>
     mitted to such a procedure 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Obviously we have to recommend as a refer<lb break="no"/>endum alternative responsible government as it 
     <lb/>
     existed in Newfoundland prior to its suspension 
     <lb/>
     in 1934, in form that is, if not in substance. Not 
     <lb/>
     to would be to seek an abridgement of the under<lb break="no"/>taking given by the British Parliament to restore 
     <lb/>
     responsible government at the request of our 
     <lb/>
     people. But I do hope that if we come to see 
     <lb/>
     responsible government restored, it will not get 
     <lb/>
     to be a matter of the same old story all over again. 
     <lb/>
     If in the past responsible government was not 
     <lb/>
     always all that it should have been, I think that 


            <pb n="1295" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1295.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1295</fw>
          

     perhaps one of the greatest contributing causes 
     <lb/>
     was that the Newfoundland people never did 
     <lb/>
     have a choice of political philosophies. True, they 
     <lb/>
     did have a choice of political parties, but in es<lb break="no"/>sence the only choice they offered was a choice 
     <lb/>
     between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, a choice 
     <lb/>
     of political tenants not poles apart, but only the 
     <lb/>
     width of the street apart. It was never to distinct 
     <lb/>
     political faiths that Newfoundlanders had oc<lb break="no"/>casion to give their allegiance. At the best what 
     <lb/>
     they had was political personalities. There were 
     <lb/>
     no political parties held together by any bonds 
     <lb/>
     stronger than the desire to win the next election. 
     <lb/>
     There were certainly none held together by the 
     <lb/>
     belief that the political briefs they stood for were 
     <lb/>
     overwhelmingly right and true and worth holding 
     <lb/>
     out for against all odds. For if there had been, 
     <lb/>
     those parties would have held together and 
     <lb/>
     preserved their identity, but they did not. Not one 
     <lb/>
     of the old political parties that we used to know 
     <lb/>
     has survived — not one. As a matter of fact, none 
     <lb/>
     survived longer than it took the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government to move in. The Commission was 
     <lb/>
     appointed and the political parties were never 
     <lb/>
     heard of again. They had not that within them 
     <lb/>
     which could hold them together overnight, once 
     <lb/>
     there was no more chance of winning an election. 
     <lb/>
     And in that connection may I offer this advice to 
     <lb/>
     my political parties that may subsequently arise 
     <lb/>
     in this land: if any one of them can appeal to our 
     <lb/>
     people with a concrete vital platform that can 
     <lb/>
     touch their lives in terms of three square meals a 
     <lb/>
     day, they will likely go a long, long way. And if 
     <lb/>
     in the past responsible government was not all 
     <lb/>
     that it should be, particularly towards the end of 
     <lb/>
     its days, it was mostly because what we used to 
     <lb/>
     have every four years was not an election but a 
     <lb/>
     revolution. You will remember what would hap<lb break="no"/>pen at election times: brother was set against 
     <lb/>
     brother, community was set against community, 
     <lb/>
     class was set against class, deliberately and with 
     <lb/>
     malice aforethought to serve political ends. 
     <lb/>
     Hatred was engendered that lasted for years and 
     <lb/>
     wrought disturbance of the people's peaceful 
     <lb/>
     way of life. Then to crown it all, if a new govern<lb break="no"/>ment was elected, almost its first move was in<lb break="no"/>variably to disrupt the civil service with many 
     <lb/>
     discharges and new appointments of party hacks 
     <lb/>
     and of the faithful. Irrespective of all the 
     <lb/>
     whitewash that has lately been spattered around 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">corpus delicti</hi> of responsible government, it 


            <cb/>
           

     is an unassailable fact that for a term of years 
     <lb/>
     immediately prior to Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment the spoils system was in great effect. I do 
     <lb/>
     hope that we have done with all that forever, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly the spoils system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Come what may in the shape of government, 
     <lb/>
     our people should insist on the civil service being 
     <lb/>
     placed, as I believe Mr. Hickman suggested 
     <lb/>
     yesterday afternoon, under a nonpolitical, inde<lb break="no"/>pendent civil service commission, and they 
     <lb/>
     should keep on insisting upon just that until they 
     <lb/>
     get it. Otherwise we will never get good govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and every four years the national interest 
     <lb/>
     will be sacrificed so that to the victors may go the 
     <lb/>
     spoils. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I have suggested that responsible 
     <lb/>
     government as we knew it was not at all times all 
     <lb/>
     that it should have been. I should like to make it 
     <lb/>
     quite clear that in doing so I am not suggesting 
     <lb/>
     that responsible government as we knew it was 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">never</hi> all that it should have been. I think it only 
     <lb/>
     fair to say that not all our politicians were con<lb break="no"/>cerned only with the grinding of their own axes, 
     <lb/>
     and the feathering of their own nests. If I had to 
     <lb/>
     prove that any single one of them was not all that 
     <lb/>
     he should have been, I am quite certain that I 
     <lb/>
     should be unable to do so, and again I think that 
     <lb/>
     a fair verdict is that a great many of our public 
     <lb/>
     men of yesteryear were sincere men who did the 
     <lb/>
     best that they could with the little that they had. 
     <lb/>
     The supreme tragedy was that they did not have 
     <lb/>
     enough to work with. Otherwise the story of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government might have been much 
     <lb/>
     different. I have said before that in the last 
     <lb/>
     analysis it was not our politicians who failed us, 
     <lb/>
     it was our economy. Yet notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>
     meagemess of the resources and the facilities 
     <lb/>
     drey had to work with, there were men in our past 
     <lb/>
     who wrought monumental works in this land. 
     <lb/>
     Men who were born to greatness, and set the mark 
     <lb/>
     of their greatness upon the causes they espoused, 
     <lb/>
     men in consequence of whose living we have all 
     <lb/>
     come to be at great advantage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Mr. Chairman, I take pleasure in 
     <lb/>
     supporting this motion, and I base my decision 
     <lb/>
     on the reasonable supposition of our ability to 
     <lb/>
     maintain self-government. A second reason for 
     <lb/>
     doing so is the fact that the condition for the 
     <lb/>
     correction of which the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was introduced, now no longer exists. As to 
     <lb/>
     whether or not they can be credited with success, 
 

            <pb n="1296" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1296.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1296</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
          

     I have a divided opinion. In some instances, yes; 
     <lb/>
     in others, definitely no. Could a continuation 
     <lb/>
     bring about a greater achievement on their part? 
     <lb/>
     That I greatly doubt. It would appear on the face 
     <lb/>
     of things, and I believe would be borne out by 
     <lb/>
     deeper investigation, that a government so con<lb break="no"/>stituted may make progress in its early days and 
     <lb/>
     then become routine. This, I fear, is the condition 
     <lb/>
     today; and I have much the same opinion of 
     <lb/>
     monotonous routine as I have of tedious repeti<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the British government adopted the 
     <lb/>
     recommendations of the Amulree Commission, I 
     <lb/>
     believe they did so in the best interests of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. If in some way their own inter<lb break="no"/>ests, which might have been impaired by their 
     <lb/>
     association with us, were protected, in that I see 
     <lb/>
     no great wrong. Viewed in these later years, the 
     <lb/>
     recommendations they submitted have helped us 
     <lb/>
     along and we are willing to give credit where 
     <lb/>
     credit is due. I feel quite certain we will be glad 
     <lb/>
     to see continued much of the organisation they 
     <lb/>
     set in place and it was meant to be that way. For 
     <lb/>
     they were to undertake to strengthen our 
     <lb/>
     economic and financial structure which would, in 
     <lb/>
     time, put our country in good standing and having 
     <lb/>
     done that, the government would be passed back 
     <lb/>
     to the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Many things have been said about that trans<lb break="no"/>action. As it came into effect it displeased many, 
     <lb/>
     if not all; and strong opinions were expressed as 
     <lb/>
     to other possible ways out. Truly, they could have 
     <lb/>
     left some vestige of representation with us. We 
     <lb/>
     yielded, believing that we would have sent here 
     <lb/>
     men of the highest calibre, men to develop our 
     <lb/>
     industrial life as well as play watchdog on our 
     <lb/>
     treasury. No barriers were created by us in the 
     <lb/>
     selection of these men. If the good and useful did 
     <lb/>
     not come, the fault is surely that of the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office. All this can be excused on the ground that 
     <lb/>
     they were taking things in their stride. Just when 
     <lb/>
     they planned to get us out of the woods seemed 
     <lb/>
     very obscure. However, perhaps everyone's pur<lb break="no"/>pose is served today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One thing for which we can be thankful today, 
     <lb/>
     is that we did not suffer impairment of our form 
     <lb/>
     of government permanently. Written into that 
     <lb/>
     original recommendation and subsequently into 
     <lb/>
     the Letters Patent constituting Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, is the promise of restoration, if and 
     <lb/>
     when the people request it. A proviso to this is 
  

            <cb/>
          

     that the country be self-supporting to the extent 
     <lb/>
     that reasonable assurance of its ability to main<lb break="no"/>tain self-government be evident. We first heard 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland being self-supporting from the 
     <lb/>
     outside world. And in fairness to the British 
     <lb/>
     government, it may be said that they lost no time 
     <lb/>
     in setting up machinery to determine the people's 
     <lb/>
     wishes. Perhaps the invidiousness of their posi<lb break="no"/>tion out here was all too well realised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we have reached the point where we are 
     <lb/>
     to decide the extent of their usefulness and the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of further advancement under Com<lb break="no"/>mission government rule. For my part, I believe 
     <lb/>
     they have done their job and should go. First 
     <lb/>
     because I see no justification in the continuance 
     <lb/>
     of a dictatorial form of government, and secondly 
     <lb/>
     because I want to see it supplanted by a respon<lb break="no"/>sible government with full dominion status. It is 
     <lb/>
     to me a tragedy that we cannot negotiate our 
     <lb/>
     external affairs. Witness the many attempts made 
     <lb/>
     by the Hon. R.B. Job in trying to get outside the 
     <lb/>
     curtain — not but that I am fully aware of the lift 
     <lb/>
     along which Great Britain gives in world 
     <lb/>
     markets. I do not suggest anything but the closest 
     <lb/>
     friendship with the mother country; but our posi<lb break="no"/>tion has been so unsatisfactory, having to sell in 
     <lb/>
     one currency and buy in another, that I look for 
     <lb/>
     some solution to it. That solution I can see only 
     <lb/>
     in economic ties with the USA. There, to a nation 
     <lb/>
     of 130 million people, we should be able to sell 
     <lb/>
     largely, and purchase all our requirements. This 
     <lb/>
     may be wishful thinking. I do not for a minute 
     <lb/>
     entertain the thought that the USA would want us 
     <lb/>
     to enter political union, and I would definitely be 
     <lb/>
     opposed to it. But there should be a pooling of 
     <lb/>
     advantages, with greater returns to our country. 
     <lb/>
     For that is just what Great Britain did in the base 
     <lb/>
     deal, with greater return to Great Britain. 
     <lb/>

     people, should not have to worry or know want. 
     <lb/>
     They play their part. I feel their government 
     <lb/>
     should have no restriction in facilitating the 
     <lb/>
     marketing of their products and that all bargain<lb break="no"/>ing powers should be applied to this purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those who would deprive the people of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government advance a great variety of reasons, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps their greatest and most effective one 
     <lb/>
     is the recalling of the misdeeds of the last years 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government; whilst in the same 
     <lb/>
     breath they say, "Responsible government! Why, 
     <lb/>
     what has that to offer?" It is when I hear such 
     <lb/>
     remarks that I doubt the wisdom of restoring 
     <lb/>
     self-government, for it portrays, as I see it, a great 
     <lb/>
     misconception of the duties and functions of 
     <lb/>
     government. The reason for this is given in the 
     <lb/>
     fact that we secured national government before 
     <lb/>
     we had come to appreciate its capabilities by a 
     <lb/>
     closer view of municipal government. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that to be largely correct, but I try to outweigh it 
     <lb/>
     with the advancement, in om age, of education, 
     <lb/>
     and in the great advantages of radio and press 
     <lb/>
     distribution. I further try to outweigh it by the 
     <lb/>
     ability of our people to grasp the intricacies of 
     <lb/>
     any situation. I know they can do it. I have visited 
     <lb/>
     people's homes where, in the war days, the ad<lb break="no"/>vancement of the allied armies was charted and 
     <lb/>
     recorded with marvelous enlightenment. I have 
     <lb/>
     been astounded at their ability to constructively 
     <lb/>
     estimate world reactions. We are indeed a great 
     <lb/>
     people, but we have to outlive a period of our 
     <lb/>
     history when we were a spoiled people. We have 
     <lb/>
     to outlive a period in our history when we 
     <lb/>
     believed our government to be capable of un<lb break="no"/>limited handouts, when we seemed to shut our 
     <lb/>
     eyes to the fact that a government can give back 
     <lb/>
     to the people only part of that which they take 
     <lb/>
     from them. We did not seem to realise that the 
     <lb/>
     more gratuities a government bestows, the more 
     <lb/>
     taxes it must collect. This was not a deliberate 
     <lb/>
     wrong, but it certainly was an error and it gave 
     <lb/>
     rise to serious reactions. And now, as we consider 
     <lb/>
     a return to self-govemment, we must check the 
     <lb/>
     credentials of our people as well as the resources 
     <lb/>
     of our country. My faith in both I have already 
     <lb/>
     indicated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The investigations of the committees and the 
     <lb/>
     reports submitted on our natural resources are 
     <lb/>
     very encouraging. There is evident, however, a 
     <lb/>
     dependency of too large a proportion of our 
     <lb/>
     population on the main industries. This tends to 
    

            <cb/>
      

     make our position highly susceptible to world 
     <lb/>
     conditions. It is to be hoped that the future will 
     <lb/>
     see a greater application of our energies to the 
     <lb/>
     elimination of many items from our import list 
     <lb/>
     and their manufacture in this country. We could 
     <lb/>
     even start a button factory. Time does not permit 
     <lb/>
     me to repeat the many encouraging features of 
     <lb/>
     these reports. I feel, however, that your memory 
     <lb/>
     will serve you well, and that they are set in 
     <lb/>
     permanent vision before your mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Generally, I would say that Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     position today is a coveted one and that our 
     <lb/>
     progress offers further promise. We have a better 
     <lb/>
     marketing system for our fish, which should 
     <lb/>
     serve us well in the years ahead, whilst con<lb break="no"/>solidating our position on these markets, and we 
     <lb/>
     continued to enjoy high price for this commodity. 
     <lb/>
     How unlike this is to other countries, some of 
     <lb/>
     which were marketing their products, for ex<lb break="no"/>ample wheat, at slightly in excess of one-third of 
     <lb/>
     its current market value in an effort to hold down 
     <lb/>
     post-war business. Let us stop a moment to ap<lb break="no"/>preciate our position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was a satisfying feature, in the days of 
     <lb/>
     committee meetings, to see the way many of our 
     <lb/>
     industrialists considered themselves a part of this 
     <lb/>
     land of ours; to hear them tell of things that give 
     <lb/>
     promise and to weigh their earnestness and deter<lb break="no"/>mination in developing industries. In one in<lb break="no"/>stance only did we meet an antagonistic attitude 
     <lb/>
     and what could be described as a refusal to co<lb break="no"/>operate. I take this opportunity to interject a word 
     <lb/>
     of praise to the civil servants who assisted the 
     <lb/>
     committees on which I worked; and of whose 
     <lb/>
     integrity and ability I formed a very high opinion. 
     <lb/>
     It is matters such as these that strengthens one's 
     <lb/>
     outlook and faith. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yes, Newfoundland's position today bears lit<lb break="no"/>tle or no resemblance to its past; and confidence, 
     <lb/>
     hope and trust should swell the hearts of her 
     <lb/>
     people. Today, the great nations of the world 
     <lb/>
     shudder under the weight of debts contracted 
     <lb/>
     because of war, and countries of our own kindred 
     <lb/>
     have the sufferings of want added to their sor<lb break="no"/>rows. Nor in the near future, will this condition 
     <lb/>
     be corrected. Through it all, through their dis<lb break="no"/>mantled industries, through their disrupted mode 
     <lb/>
     of life, through their great human sacrifice, they 
     <lb/>
     cling tenaciously to the right of self-government. 
     <lb/>
     They show a belief in themselves, a belief in their 
     <lb/>
     neighbours and a perseverance that will lead

     them to success. Can we be so different from 
     <lb/>
     those people? Are we the kind who refuse to 
     <lb/>
     honour obligations? Will we fail to make our 
     <lb/>
     country a respected one? For posterity, what do 
     <lb/>
     we provide? Of that which we have! If we cannot 
     <lb/>
     add to it, let us not take from it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We pass on — the man, the country; the great 
     <lb/>
     and the small fill their places in the universe, 
     <lb/>
     some willingly, some strugglingly, some with 
     <lb/>
     endurance and forbearance, some with vigour, 
     <lb/>
     some with viciousness, some with languor, dis<lb break="no"/>ease and deterioration. The man, the country, are 
     <lb/>
     but one; and fame or glory but a line in history's 
     <lb/>
     pages. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Quo vadis</hi>? Whither goest thou? And 
     <lb/>
     whence and wherefore the struggle? For that line 
     <lb/>
     in history's pages? I think not. For the pleasures 
     <lb/>
     of the day then, for three square meals and a tight 
     <lb/>
     roof? Not there does man's duty to man begin or 
     <lb/>
     end. Somewhere it is said, "Man doth not live by 
     <lb/>
     bread alone." There is a call, a challenge born in 
     <lb/>
     the heart of man to rule, to govern. This must find 
     <lb/>
     an outlet, or the man, the country, deteriorates. 
     <lb/>
     This instinct, strong and lasting, is patent; and its 
     <lb/>
     suppression can but activate more strongly. 
     <lb/>
     Sometimes it is that suppression that guides it on 
     <lb/>
     to a predetermined destiny, if such there can be. 
     <lb/>
     It was suppression that many years ago urged our 
     <lb/>
     forefathers to seek this new land. It was the 
     <lb/>
     suppression which followed them here that urged 
     <lb/>
     them to fight for the freedom and justice and the 
     <lb/>
     right to govern, which was theirs. They have won 
     <lb/>
     their cause. They have passed to us the torch. Will 
     <lb/>
     we fail to hold it high?

     to a return of responsible government in its old

     <lb/>
     my opinion, should accompany any report that is

     sent to the authorities prior to their coming to a 
     <lb/>
     definite decision as to the forms of government 
     <lb/>
     to be placed on the referendum. I propose to make 
     <lb/>
     brief reference to the question of return of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. Much abuse has been heaped 
     <lb/>
     upon the head of the late Hon. F. C. Alderdice, as 
     <lb/>
     well as upon those who supported him in accept<lb break="no"/>ing the recommendations of the royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion which resulted in the installation of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, which appeared to 
     <lb/>
     be the only choice except the one of facing 
     <lb/>
     default on our bond issues, which was the clear 
     <lb/>
     alternative. I knew Mr. Alderdice very well, and 
     <lb/>
     believe that we never had a more sincere or a 
     <lb/>
     more honourable leader of our government; but 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, he did make a mistake in not 
     <lb/>
     referring the recommendations of the royal com<lb break="no"/>mission to the people of Newfoundland prior to 
     <lb/>
     accepting them. I was aware of his view, and that 
     <lb/>
     of his supporters, that there was not the slightest 
     <lb/>
     doubt that the scheme would be approved by the 
     <lb/>
     electorate, but as a matter of principle it should 
     <lb/>
     certainly have been submitted. The urgency of 
     <lb/>
     the situation, however, had convinced Mr. Alder<lb break="no"/>dice and his government that they were following 
     <lb/>
     the right course, and as history shows, the 
     <lb/>
     proposals were carried in the House of Assembly, 
     <lb/>
     rightly or wrongly, with only one or two dissent<lb break="no"/>ing voices. One of these was that of Mr. Bradley, 
     <lb/>
     whose efforts to get some revision of the proposal 
     <lb/>
     are on record, and I fancy that history will say he 
     <lb/>
     should be given credit for those efforts to im<lb break="no"/>prove the system outlined by the royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion.

            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     As a temporary measure, I am wholehear<lb break="no"/>tedly in favour of the changes proposed, dras<lb break="no"/>tic as they are. My reasons for supporting 
     <lb/>
     them are: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Firstly, because the report of the royal 
     <lb/>
     commission and the proposals of His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government breathe deep earnest<lb break="no"/>ness and great sympathy with our situation 
     <lb/>
     throughout its many pages, and because the 
     <lb/>
     offer is an especially generous one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Secondly, because I believe that stringent 
     <lb/>
     and drastic measures alone can save us from 
     <lb/>
     ourselves in this serious crisis, and 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thirdly, because I see no other alternative 
     <lb/>
     except the disgrace and increased misery that 
     <lb/>
     default would bring in its train. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that it will probably be found 
     <lb/>
     necessary, as time goes on, and possibly 
     <lb/>
     within a decade, to resort once more to some 
     <lb/>
     form of representation, and I also believe that 
     <lb/>
     when the need is evident, this will not be 
     <lb/>
     grudged to us by those who are offering a 
     <lb/>
     helping hand at this present juncture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What form this representation may take I 
     <lb/>
     dare not prophesy, but it has been shown 
     <lb/>
     beyond doubt that our present form of full 
     <lb/>
     responsibility is not suited to a large country 
     <lb/>
     with a small population. A large section of 
     <lb/>
     our population is so scattered and isolated 
     <lb/>
     and out of touch with its fellow citizens, that 
     <lb/>
     it is extremely difficult for it to understand 
     <lb/>
     and digest the principles of good govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We want something more simple and 
     <lb/>
     must endeavour to avoid what has been aptly 
     <lb/>
     described as "the trappings of an elephant on 
     <lb/>
     the back of a cat." 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I do not think there is any need for me to take 
     <lb/>
     back these words, sir, as I am still of that same 
     <lb/>
     opinion. I did not believe then, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe now that there was any deep-laid plot to 
     <lb/>
     deprive us of our rights, and on the other hand 
     <lb/>
     believe that Great Britain was conscientiously 
     <lb/>
     anxious to help us, and that although the Amulree 
     <lb/>
     Report was in many respects wrong, its motives 
     <lb/>
     were, on the whole, perfectly honest and 
     <lb/>
     designed to help us. It must be remembered, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that at that time no one for a moment con<lb break="no"/>templated that the period of Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, with its lack of representation, 
     <lb/>
     would extend as it has done for a period of nearly 
  


            <cb/>
        

     14 years; but I think it will be agreed that cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances beyond our control have been mainly 
     <lb/>
     responsible for this, namely the recent war. The 
     <lb/>
     utmost limit of time envisaged for its continuance 
     <lb/>
     when introduced was ten years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Commission of Government was considered 
     <lb/>
     by many to be a means of providing a thinking 
     <lb/>
     period during which, with the assistance of the 
     <lb/>
     Mother country, our finances would be 
     <lb/>
     straightened out and our departments reorga<lb break="no"/>nised. It was thought that this could be achieved 
     <lb/>
     without the bickering, and oftentimes unfair at<lb break="no"/>tack that is and must be associated with party 
     <lb/>
     government. It was also thought that government 
     <lb/>
     by commission would still be government in the 
     <lb/>
     interests of Newfoundland and we were not, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the scheme suggested under which three 
     <lb/>
     of the Commissioners were Newfoundlanders, 
     <lb/>
     afraid that strictly Newfoundland interests would 
     <lb/>
     be disregarded. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you are aware, sir, it seems to be clear from 
     <lb/>
     opinions expressed at this Convention that New<lb break="no"/>foundland interests have been, in some cases, 
     <lb/>
     neglected, especially in connection with the leas<lb break="no"/>ing, without consideration for Newfoundland, for 
     <lb/>
     99 years of certain of our territories to a foreign 
     <lb/>
     government, though an admittedly very friendly 
     <lb/>
     one. Owing to the secrecy of the Commission's 
     <lb/>
     deliberations we do not know to what extent our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Commissioners fought for our in<lb break="no"/>terests in these matters; but it is fair to assume that 
     <lb/>
     as Newfoundlanders they did their best in at least 
     <lb/>
     mildly protesting against long leases; and 
     <lb/>
     probably felt that anything stronger than a mild 
     <lb/>
     protest would be, and perhaps was quite useless 
     <lb/>
     in view of the fact that they were in a minority on 
     <lb/>
     the Commission. Moreover, it must not be forgot<lb break="no"/>ten that they must have been influenced while the 
     <lb/>
     war was in progress by the fact that everything 
     <lb/>
     was of minor importance except steps for win<lb break="no"/>ning the war; and one can quite understand their 
     <lb/>
     disinclination to make themselves strongly ob<lb break="no"/>jectionable at that time, entirely apart from any 
     <lb/>
     personal considerations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commission government, in the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of whose personnel the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland have had no say, is admittedly all 
     <lb/>
     wrong in principle, and this our Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     themselves will admit and have admitted. Again, 
     <lb/>
     it is impossible to argue that some form of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government would not be right. I would 
 

            <pb n="1300" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1300.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1300</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
       

     certainly favour responsible government in some 
     <lb/>
     amended form, a much simplified form, more 
     <lb/>
     suitable to our conditions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In spite of what I have stated, however, I feel 
     <lb/>
     I would not be doing my duty if I did not suggest 
     <lb/>
     that the electorate would be very well advised to 
     <lb/>
     carefully consider before marking their ballot the 
     <lb/>
     possible advisability of waiting a few years more 
     <lb/>
     before taking a leap in the dark, and diving again 
     <lb/>
     into the dangerous waters of the old form of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, at a time when the 
     <lb/>
     whole world is so very seriously upset politically 
     <lb/>
     and economically. I am not definitely advising 
     <lb/>
     this course, but I do believe that the electorate 
     <lb/>
     should take it very seriously into consideration 
     <lb/>
     when they come to mark their ballots. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, I am going to suggest that it should 
     <lb/>
     be recommended in our report that in the event 
     <lb/>
     of the electorate possibly deciding in favour of a 
     <lb/>
     continuation of Commission government for a 
     <lb/>
     few years, some machinery should be immedi<lb break="no"/>ately set up in the form of a royal commission, or 
     <lb/>
     a special committee, whose duty it would be to 
     <lb/>
     spend the next few years endeavouring to formu<lb break="no"/>late an improvement upon our old form of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government with a view to making it 
     <lb/>
     more suitable for our peculiar needs, and also in 
     <lb/>
     studying the confederation issue. I have often 
     <lb/>
     wondered, Mr. Chairman, whether in actual fact 
     <lb/>
     party government is necessary at all in a small 
     <lb/>
     community like ours. There is no party spirit or 
     <lb/>
     division in our St. John's Municipal Council, 
     <lb/>
     although there is lots of bickering and difference 
     <lb/>
     of opinion; they seem to do very well under the 
     <lb/>
     chairmanship of a mayor who, whatever his 
     <lb/>
     faults may be, has a singularity of purpose in his 
     <lb/>
     devotion to his job of administering, with the 
     <lb/>
     assistance of his councillors, the affairs of our 
     <lb/>
     city to the best advantage, financially and other<lb break="no"/>wise. There is room for thought in this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This royal commission or committee which I 
     <lb/>
     have suggested would, I hope, also study the 
     <lb/>
     practicability of forming some arrangement 
     <lb/>
     under which Great Britain, Canada and the USA 
     <lb/>
     would take a joint interest in our affairs, for 
     <lb/>
     reasons which I have many times pointed out. It 
     <lb/>
     is probably not generally known at this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion that the USA and the United Kingdom set 
     <lb/>
     aside, at the time they were taking over certain 
     <lb/>
     bases in the Caribbean and West Indian districts, 
     <lb/>
     a large sum of money to be spent on satisfying 
 

            <cb/>
         

     the people of that region that they were going to 
     <lb/>
     take a special interest in their affairs in return for 
     <lb/>
     the concessions granted, with a view to improv<lb break="no"/>ing the standards of living in these areas. This is 
     <lb/>
     being administered by what is known as the 
     <lb/>
     Caribbean Commission, and I am informed that 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian authorities have been also co<lb break="no"/>operating with it. The amount of money set aside 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose was large, many millions of dol<lb break="no"/>lars. I believe the committee is still sitting and has 
     <lb/>
     not yet concluded its work. Is not this a precedent 
     <lb/>
     for Great Britain, the USA and Canada to get 
     <lb/>
     together to see whether our people are not entitled 
     <lb/>
     to some consideration with a view to the im<lb break="no"/>provement of our standard of living, in return for 
     <lb/>
     the concessions which Newfoundland has also 
     <lb/>
     yielded for the benefit of those countries and of 
     <lb/>
     democracy in general? The royal commission or 
     <lb/>
     committee which I have suggested might, per<lb break="no"/>haps, also act as a link between the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government and the people of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     The absence of such a link has been one of the 
     <lb/>
     causes of dissatisfaction with the Commission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not unconscious of the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     amounts at present being expended by the Com<lb break="no"/>mission appear to be extravagant and I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that this is giving serious worry to our 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners. If a responsible government 
     <lb/>
     takes over at an early date, this worry will be 
     <lb/>
     transferred to their shoulders, and if I were a party 
     <lb/>
     politician, I would hesitate before taking on the 
     <lb/>
     job of reducing this expenditure and thereby, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, reducing the efficiency of social and 
     <lb/>
     other services to our people. A part of our surplus 
     <lb/>
     is certainly disappearing in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of advancing part of our own dollar 
     <lb/>
     surplus to provide payment in dollars to our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen for their produce, but to be fair to the 
     <lb/>
     Commission, it is reasonable to ask, what would 
     <lb/>
     a responsible government do in such a case? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot wholeheartedly support Mr. Higgins' 
     <lb/>
     motion as it stands, but would support it 
     <lb/>
     wholeheartedly with a slight amendment limiting 
     <lb/>
     the continuance of Commission government to, 
     <lb/>
     say, four years, and with the hope that a provision 
     <lb/>
     would be made that if a renewal of Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government should be the choice of the 
     <lb/>
     people, then a royal commission or something of 
     <lb/>
     that sort, with economic experts thereon, would 
     <lb/>
     be appointed to further investigate and report 
     <lb/>
     upon: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="1301" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1301.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1301</fw>
           

 <p>
     1. Suitable amendments to our old form of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, a matter which I notice 
     <lb/>
     several supporters of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     have advocated during recent addresses; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Investigation of the practicability of the so- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     called Con-Dominion suggestion, and of closer 
     <lb/>
     fiscal relations with both the USA and Canada; 
     <lb/>
     and 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. Investigation in much more detail of the im<lb break="no"/>pact of confederation with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The weak part of Commission government, in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, has been the control of our affairs by 
     <lb/>
     a British department (often by subordinates in 
     <lb/>
     that department) 2,000 miles away from what 
     <lb/>
     should be the real seat of government. I cannot 
     <lb/>
     altogether subscribe to the charges that the Com<lb break="no"/>mission has been wilfully wasteful; and in that 
     <lb/>
     respect they have certainly not been worse than 
     <lb/>
     many of the former responsible governments, 
     <lb/>
     whose spending was, in most cases, only limited 
     <lb/>
     by their revenues, plus the amounts they could 
     <lb/>
     borrow. True, their revenues were limited. There 
     <lb/>
     is bound to be an end of lavish expenditures, and 
     <lb/>
     even amongst our more wealthy neighbours this 
     <lb/>
     must come to an end — as witness the present 
     <lb/>
     so-called austerity programme now in force on 
     <lb/>
     the mainland. It certainly may be necessary in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and every other country to reduce 
     <lb/>
     public expenditures before very long; and it 
     <lb/>
     would seem to me that any party politicians 
     <lb/>
     taking charge at the present time and being 
     <lb/>
     obliged to cut expenditures, would very quickly 
     <lb/>
     become unpopular. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before leaving this question of Commission 
     <lb/>
     government, which has received some hard 
     <lb/>
     knocks during our deliberations, I would like to 
     <lb/>
     emphasise at least a few good things which I think 
     <lb/>
     it has accomplished. Its deficiencies and mistakes 
     <lb/>
     do not require setting out by me as they have been 
     <lb/>
     amply exposed during our debates, but I think we 
     <lb/>
     would not be doing our duty if we did not remind 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland of some of the ac<lb break="no"/>complishments which have benefited the country 
     <lb/>
     during the Commission years. These seem to me 
     <lb/>
     to be as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. The refunding of our debt, which was only 
     <lb/>
     made possible by the guarantee of the British 
     <lb/>
     government and which has saved a very large 
     <lb/>
     amount of interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. The payment out of funds taken from tax<lb break="no"/>payers of Great Britain of sums amounting in 
    

            <cb/>
         

     total to over $16 million as grants-in-aid, free 
     <lb/>
     grants from the Colonial Development Fund, and 
     <lb/>
     loans from that fund which were eventually con<lb break="no"/>verted to free grants. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. The payment by the British government of 
     <lb/>
     the remuneration of the three British Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners for a period of 14 years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. The setting up and supporting of a sane and 
     <lb/>
     most useful marketing system for our fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry, which has definitely resulted in a more 
     <lb/>
     stable position and which, in my opinion, could 
     <lb/>
     not have been attained under responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment as evidenced by the failure of a similar 
     <lb/>
     attempt by a responsible government after the 
     <lb/>
     end of the first world war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. The formation of co-operative societies, 
     <lb/>
     with their most useful study clubs, which have 
     <lb/>
     encouraged and are still encouraging careful 
     <lb/>
     thought by that most important section of our 
     <lb/>
     people, our fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. The constitution of many municipalities 
     <lb/>
     whose constituents are learning in a practical way 
     <lb/>
     the meaning and difficulties of local government, 
     <lb/>
     and whose experience and influence must have a 
     <lb/>
     marked effect in future years on the respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities of the people in connection with respon<lb break="no"/>sible governments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     7. The extension of our social services, espe<lb break="no"/>cially the medical and hospital services all over 
     <lb/>
     the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Surely, in common decency we owe a large 
     <lb/>
     measure of gratitude to the British people for 
     <lb/>
     their assistance, from their own funds, of the 
     <lb/>
     substantial and generous financial help detailed 
     <lb/>
     in the paragraphs which I have just quoted. Let 
     <lb/>
     us be fair, Mr. Chairman, in view of the facts and 
     <lb/>
     admit that these seven accomplishments listed 
     <lb/>
     warrant the thought that perhaps three or four 
     <lb/>
     more years of Government by Commission might 
     <lb/>
     do us no harm, and I am not at all sure that the 
     <lb/>
     wisest words spoken at this Convention were not 
     <lb/>
     those spoken by my friend, the member for St. 
     <lb/>

     when he suggested that perhaps we were about 
     <lb/>
     five years too soon in starting the deliberations of

     <lb/>
     the institution of municipalities and co-opera<lb break="no"/>tives, as well as recent developments and im<lb break="no"/>provements in connection with our trade unions, 
     <lb/>

     electorate, and that a few more years of this sort 
     <lb/>
     of self-education will help Newfoundlanders to 
     <lb/>
     weigh more carefully than they have been able to 
     <lb/>
     do in the past, or even than they can do today, 
     <lb/>
     what is best for the future welfare of their beloved 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I do not wish to delay matters by moving 
     <lb/>
    an amendment to the resolution before the Chair, 
     <lb/>I support it with the definite expectation that the 
     <lb/>suggestions I have made will be taken into ac<lb break="no"/>count when our report is being formulated. Let us 
     <lb/>look, and advise the electorate to look carefully 
     <lb/>before they take their leap. God grant them 
     <lb/>guidance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> It gives me much pleasure, sir, to 
     <lb/>speak to the motion so ably moved by my learned 
     <lb/>friend, Mr. Higgins and seconded by my good 
     <lb/>friend, Mr. Vardy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The time has come, sir, at last when we as true 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders can talk on forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment now before the Chair and make recommen<lb break="no"/>dations. In reviewing the many reports of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, I with many others am satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     this country is not only self-supporting, but is in 
     <lb/>
     a very good, sound, healthy condition, financially 
     <lb/>
     and economically; and under good, wise counsel 
     <lb/>
     and leadership, we should continue to be a strong, 
     <lb/>
     happy, contented and a prosperous people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My mind goes back to 1932-33 when, as it 
     <lb/>
     were, our backs were up against the wall due to 
     <lb/>
     the scarcity of dollars to run the country. Cannot 
     <lb/>
     the same be said of many countries of the world 
     <lb/>
     at that time? And did not a great many nations 
     <lb/>
     default? If we had gotten a little help at that time 
     <lb/>
     from our so-called good neighbours, there would 
     <lb/>
     have been no need of the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     today and Newfoundland would still have 
     <lb/>
     retained responsible government, and I have not 
     <lb/>
     the least shadow of a doubt but that our country 
     <lb/>
     would have been very prosperous and happy 
     <lb/>
     today. However, since 1933 a lot of water has 
     <lb/>
     gone under the bridge. We have had many ups 
     <lb/>
     and downs, many broken hearts and homes due 
     <lb/>
     to the world war; but thanks be to God we are still 
     <lb/>
     a great people and a great country; and, sir, under 
     <lb/>
     Divine guidance, good government and real 
     <lb/>
     leadership we shall, as Mr. Fudge has said, sail 
     <lb/>
     our good ship safely to port and to safe anchorage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our great, friendly neighbour, America, is 
     <lb/>
     slowly but surely opening the way for our fish to 
     <lb/>
     enter into its markets, and when once we can ship 
 

            <cb/>
           

     a great many of our fishery commodities into that 
     <lb/>
     great republic, our people will obtain a better 
     <lb/>
     price for their fish, and a much better standard of 
     <lb/>
     living will be assured. But on the other hand, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, we must insist on giving them a num<lb break="no"/>ber-one article so that we can hold the market for 
     <lb/>
     all time. I understand too that provision is being 
     <lb/>
     made to take care of some of our saltfish. There<lb break="no"/>fore, with our fisheries in fair and improving 
     <lb/>
     conditions, our paper industries going full blast, 
     <lb/>
     our mines working to full capacity, our railway 
     <lb/>
     working full time, our farms doing well and being 
     <lb/>
     extended rapidly; and last but not least, with the 
     <lb/>
     very great iron ore deposit with its many, many 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars worth awaiting to be 
     <lb/>
     developed on Labrador, how in the name of com<lb break="no"/>mon sense and decency can one do otherwise 
     <lb/>
     than support wholeheartedly the restoration of 
     <lb/>
     self-government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are the crossroads of the world today, and 
     <lb/>
     I pray that we, as real men, will see to it that we 
     <lb/>
     remain as such; and may we use our bargaining 
     <lb/>
     power wisely and well and for the betterment of 
     <lb/>
     the country as a whole, and not for a mere few. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     God gave us this great land to use to the best 
     <lb/>
     of our ability, and not to abuse; and today our 
     <lb/>
     country is only in the making. It is true we have 
     <lb/>
     weathered many a storm, but as free men, and as 
     <lb/>
     never before, may we march ever onward to 
     <lb/>
     make Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders one 
     <lb/>
     great happy family; and I am sure that if we do 
     <lb/>
     just that, we cannot go far wrong, and there will 
     <lb/>
     be no place for greed or graft in our midst. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And now, sir, in conclusion, about Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government. It came in Newfoundland when 
     <lb/>
     our government, shall I say, faded out. The 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government was given grants- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     in-aid by the mother country to tide us over the 
     <lb/>
     terrible times we were then passing through. 
     <lb/>
     They have made much progress. It is true they 
     <lb/>
     have made many mistakes — what government 
     <lb/>
     doesn't? But we should be ever grateful for their 
     <lb/>
     strong arm in time of weakness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The time is ripe, Mr. Chairman, for us to take 
     <lb/>
     up the torch ourselves and wave it high, and to 
     <lb/>
     see that it is kept waving for all time. Gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     I shall support the motion now before the Chair.

     might be a good time to make a few observations. 
     <lb/>
     
</p>

            <p>The National Convention, which is now com<lb break="no"/>ing near its end, came into being as a result of the 
     <lb/>existence of another organisation. It might never 
     <lb/>have been called into existence if there had never 
     <lb/>existed in Newfoundland a regime known as 
     <lb/>"Government by Commission". The main reason 
     <lb/>for the existence of the National Convention lay 
     <lb/>in the desire of the United Kingdom government 
     <lb/>to ascertain whether Newfoundlanders wanted a 
     <lb/>continuation of Commission government or 
     <lb/>some other form in its place. In my opinion, the 
     <lb/>problem is probably stated in this motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins to which I now speak. I support that 
     <lb/>motion because I can admit of only two forms of 
     <lb/>government known to and experienced by con<lb break="no"/>temporary Newfoundlanders — self-government 
     <lb/>and Commission government. There are other 
     <lb/>forms of government existing in the world today, 
     <lb/>all the way from Russian communism to British 
     <lb/>socialism to American or Canadian federalism, 
     <lb/>and other forms operating within the British 
     <lb/>Commonwealth which may be possible or 
     <lb/>suitable forms of government for Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>But these forms are outside the practice of 
     <lb/>government in Newfoundland and at the moment 
     <lb/>we have no means, in my opinion, of testing them 
     <lb/>accurately and fully enough to warrant asking the 
     <lb/>people of this country to make a decision on 
     <lb/>them, apart from the two which I have mentioned. 
     <lb/>Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that 
     <lb/>any people should be asked to choose between 
     <lb/>more than that form of government which they 
     <lb/>have and one other, at any one time. Will any 
     <lb/>delegate please tell me any other people who 
     <lb/>have been asked to do more anywhere at any 
     <lb/>time? Normally to make a radical change in the 
     <lb/>form of government requires many years of ac<lb break="no"/>tively educating the people for that change. Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins' motion covers the choice that I think 
     <lb/>should <hi rendition="simple:italic">now</hi> be put to the people of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Some 20 months ago when the Convention 
     <lb/>was being born, I had the privilege of telling 
     <lb/>groups of people now within the sound of my 
     <lb/>voice, that if they elected me as their delegate 
     <lb/>they would understand that I would be looking 
     <lb/>for that form of government which would give 
     <lb/>the greatest possible freedom, consistent with a 
     <lb/>tolerable standard of living. As this Convention 
     <lb/>comes to an end I feel that I have now a duty to 
     <lb/>perform. And after some 20 months of getting 
    

            <cb/>
        

     information, comparing, studying and discussing 
     <lb/>
     facts, I am now ready to discharge that duty. I am 
     <lb/>
     ready, fully aware of the import of this matter, to 
     <lb/>
     give my most serious and considered opinion as 
     <lb/>
     to what form of government is in the best interest 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some 20 months ago, I confess, I had my 
     <lb/>
     doubts as to whether full self-government, which 
     <lb/>
     offered the greatest political freedom, could give 
     <lb/>
     us a tolerable standard of living. In common with 
     <lb/>
     other Newfoundlanders I had been conditioned, 
     <lb/>
     consciously or unconsciously, by the economic 
     <lb/>
     depression which struck me as it did many other 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders. I had been conditioned by the 
     <lb/>
     obvious weaknesses of the democratic way, 
     <lb/>
     which had earned the phrase "decadent", until a 
     <lb/>
     war against dictatorship awoke the democracies 
     <lb/>
     into galvanised action. Like many contemporary 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders, I had also been conditioned by 
     <lb/>
     the provincialism of living in an island, and I 
     <lb/>
     think I may also add, by the insidious propaganda 
     <lb/>
     of those who were weak in courage but strong in 
     <lb/>
     playing safe. I had almost come to believe that 
     <lb/>
     there were none so poor as Newfoundlanders in 
     <lb/>
     that depression; none so depraved as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's politicians of that period; none 
     <lb/>
     so poorly endowed by nature with natural resour<lb break="no"/>ces to work on as this island home of ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Later, I began to have my doubts as to whether 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland poverty was even as bad as that 
     <lb/>
     of the depressed areas of England, or of the 
     <lb/>
     "Grapes of Wrath" areas in America, or many 
     <lb/>
     other places that could be mentioned in other 
     <lb/>
     countries. Reading of the bosses of American 
     <lb/>
     politics or the Canadian equivalents, I had begun 
     <lb/>
     to doubt whether alongside them our politicians 
     <lb/>
     were not just pikers. Still, as I say, I was in doubt. 
     <lb/>
     I felt I knew what Newfoundlanders wanted — 
     <lb/>
     that is, political freedom consistent with fair 
     <lb/>
     security, but I was not sure which was the best 
     <lb/>
     way out; considering seriously, for instance, a 
     <lb/>
     modified form of Commission of Government as 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the possible solution. In other words, I 
     <lb/>
     entered the Convention with an open mind. In the 
     <lb/>
     20 months to which I refer I have read a lot of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland history, a lot of present day 
     <lb/>
     economic and political papers, and I have, in 
     <lb/>
     common with all you gentlemen here, had the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to study, and in some measure report 
     <lb/>
     on the economic state of our country. I had also 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity, in common with six other mem<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="1304" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1304.jpg"/>

     bers, of conferring with the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government in London. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a result of all this I have now made up my 
     <lb/>
     mind, with all the detachment and intellectual 
     <lb/>
     honesty of which I am capable, that full self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government would be in the best interests of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, particularly at this moment in our 
     <lb/>
     history. My reasons for coming to this conclusion 
     <lb/>
     will, in some measure, be set before you now. 
     <lb/>
     Before I give my reasons, however, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to say that I am accepting without question the 
     <lb/>
     assumption that the political freedom which goes 
     <lb/>
     with self-government — with all its dangers, 
     <lb/>
     weaknesses, corruptions, responsibilities on the 
     <lb/>
     part of politicians and on the part of citizens — 
     <lb/>
     is the goal of all peoples like ourselves, nurtured 
     <lb/>
     in the democratic tradition. I therefore propose to 
     <lb/>
     give my attention chiefly to this matter of 
     <lb/>
     material security, which is not unnaturally agitat<lb break="no"/>ing men and women and on which is laid the 
     <lb/>
     emphasis of our times, always bearing in mind, 
     <lb/>
     however, that too great a price must not be paid 
     <lb/>
     for the one at the expense of the other. There will 
     <lb/>
     be, as I think it is inevitable, some repetition in 
     <lb/>
     what I have to say at this time. Nearly all of it has 
     <lb/>
     been said before, perhaps on more than one occasion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The most important point of all, the point 
     <lb/>
     which caused the turning-point in my thinking, 
     <lb/>
     arose out of our visit to London; and this was that 
     <lb/>
     it was only by getting our own government — I 
     <lb/>
     am giving the substance of what we were told by 
     <lb/>
     the Secretary of State — that we could raise the 
     <lb/>
     question with our friendly and wealthy neighbour 
     <lb/>
     nation, the USA, on some form of concessions, 
     <lb/>
     by trade agreement or otherwise, for the granting 
     <lb/>
     of extra-territorial rights to that nation without 
     <lb/>
     our consent. I am well aware that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     had to be, of necessity, whether she liked it or not, 
     <lb/>
     a factor in the defense of the western hemisphere, 
     <lb/>
     which she will have to be in the future, whether 
     <lb/>
     she likes it or not; just as Canada will have to be 
     <lb/>
     a factor, and in the end will be dominated by the 
     <lb/>
     USA in that respect. But I am also aware of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that a nation which today, in common with 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire, represents the highest ideals 
     <lb/>
     of "live and let live" in this world of ours, would 
     <lb/>
     not be unwilling to take the necessary measures 
     <lb/>
     to see that a small people from whom she has 
     <lb/>
     taken, in no small measure, a large part of her 
     <lb/>
     sovereign rights was vouchsafed some returns for 
     <lb/>
     her sacrifice. And I would point out here that 

            <cb/>
           

     what to us would be of tremendous advantage, 
     <lb/>
     would be a very small concession on the part of 
     <lb/>
     our great neighbour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now as I have said before, I am not satisfied 
     <lb/>
     to let the opportunity of approaching the United 
     <lb/>
     States, whether we get anything or not, go by 
     <lb/>
     default because we may not have the vision or the 
     <lb/>
     courage to see the possibility. It was for that 
     <lb/>
     reason that I pointed out on a former occasion, 
     <lb/>
     that we ought not to deliver into the hands of any 
     <lb/>
     other country the controlling power of our 
     <lb/>
     strategic position. But some sceptic may be for<lb break="no"/>mulating this question: "But what has that to do 
     <lb/>
     with the standard of living for New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders?" If we let control go by default, 
     <lb/>
     nothing. If we do not, the answer is that our right 
     <lb/>
     to bargain for trade concessions would have in<lb break="no"/>finite possibilities which would affect the earning 
     <lb/>
     power, and hence the standard of living of every 
     <lb/>
     individual citizen in this country. A trade conces<lb break="no"/>sion, for instance, which would increase our 
     <lb/>
     markets or even create a new market for our fish 
     <lb/>
     of all kinds, could spell all the difference for our 
     <lb/>
     people between a decent standard of living and 
     <lb/>
     an uncertain one. Our ability to negotiate with 
     <lb/>
     any country could only be the highest under 
     <lb/>
     self-government; and I repeat that that was the 
     <lb/>
     definite impression on this matter that I received 
     <lb/>
     from the Secretary of State. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My second reason is this. I believe we are on 
     <lb/>
     the verge of a tremendous development of air 
     <lb/>
     traffic, and it so happens that Newfoundland is so 
     <lb/>
     strategically placed as to be of the utmost impor<lb break="no"/>tance as a junction for one of the most important 
     <lb/>
     air routes of the world. In this connection once 
     <lb/>
     again it was made abundantly clear, and we got 
     <lb/>
     the definite impression, that that matter could 
     <lb/>
     only be handled if we were to get a government 
     <lb/>
     of our own, for the simple reason that it could not 
     <lb/>
     be done under the present circumstances, for 
     <lb/>
     political and other reasons, by His Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government in the United Kingdom. In this mat<lb break="no"/>ter of air control and traffic of the future, I again 
     <lb/>
     repeat what I have said before, that we ought to 
     <lb/>
     be able to extract certain material rights which 
     <lb/>
     ought to affect the well-being of every citizen in 
     <lb/>
     this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My third point is this, that during the last 
     <lb/>
     couple of years it has been abundantly clear that 
     <lb/>
     the USA as a nation has become of necessity, 
     <lb/>
     because of the depletion of her own mineral 
    

            <pb n="1305" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1305.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1305</fw>
          

     resources, tremendously interested in the iron ore 
     <lb/>
     deposits recently discovered in the New<lb break="no"/>foundland-Labrador. As that development takes 
     <lb/>
     place, no government however benevolent could 
     <lb/>
     look after the material interests to be derived 
     <lb/>
     from the situation as well as a government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders fighting for Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     interests It is admitted on all sides today that the 
     <lb/>
     development of this mineral wealth can be 
     <lb/>
     probably one of the most important, if not the 
     <lb/>
     most important development that has ever taken 
     <lb/>
     place in the history of this country. To bring this 
     <lb/>
     home to us, let us suppose that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would be assured in the future of 
     <lb/>
     another industry which would be as valuable to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as the development of the paper 
     <lb/>
     industry at Comer Brook. That is the position 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the almost certain development of 
     <lb/>
     the mineral deposits of the Labrador, if we can 
     <lb/>
     believe the facts which have been placed before 
     <lb/>
     us. The important thing to me is this: that we, the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, who should reap the 
     <lb/>
     advantages from this wealthy resource, should be 
     <lb/>
     in a position to get all the material advantages for 
     <lb/>
     our own people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fourth reason which helped me to make 
     <lb/>
     up my mind in favour of self-government is the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the development of our fisheries, both 
     <lb/>
     on the side of marketing possibilities and the 
     <lb/>
     extension of the industry itself is, for a number of 
     <lb/>
     reasons, stronger today than it has ever been. In 
     <lb/>
     spite of the present difficulties, particularly ex<lb break="no"/>change difficulties which I feel certain will be 
     <lb/>
     resolved, the over-riding consideration is that for 
     <lb/>
     no little time to come there will be a shortage of 
     <lb/>
     food in the world which Newfoundland fish will 
     <lb/>
     help to fill. I believe that our recent progressive<lb break="no"/>ness in the fisheries has been due to a realisation 
     <lb/>
     on the part of Newfoundland exporters of the 
     <lb/>
     need for modernisation and diversification, and 
     <lb/>
     for a more co-operative approach to the market<lb break="no"/>ing problem which found its instrumentation in 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Board and further, that a govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundlanders would not jeopardise 
     <lb/>
     these accomplishments, but would be anxious to 
     <lb/>
     advance them still further. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Further, since 1934 (which we were bound to 
     <lb/>
     take into consideration under our terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence) due to the goodwill and assistance of the 
     <lb/>
     British government, we were able to reduce our 
     <lb/>
     permanent burden of debt interest by 100%. I 


            <cb/>
  

     would point out that this amount of about $2.5 
     <lb/>
     million yearly would, in our time of depression, 
     <lb/>
     have very possibly saved us the loss of what 
     <lb/>
     ought to be a very prized possession — political 
     <lb/>
     independence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Further, I am convinced that if we could once 
     <lb/>
     get that spirit of national pride which pervades 
     <lb/>
     the more progressive nations, big or small, we 
     <lb/>
     would be in a position to take on to ourselves 
     <lb/>
     under present conditions the whole of the balance 
     <lb/>
     of our national debt. That national pride can best 
     <lb/>
     be fostered at this time by the feeling that once 
     <lb/>
     again we have had the guts to take our political 
     <lb/>
     and economic future into our own hands as an 
     <lb/>
     expression of faith in our country and in oursel<lb break="no"/>ves. There are a number of other things which 
     <lb/>
     have been added to the development of the 
     <lb/>
     economy of the country. They have been men<lb break="no"/>tioned so often that I propose to skip over them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, there is still another reason why I feel 
     <lb/>
     that self-government is the best for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. It is a reason which is less easily tied 
     <lb/>
     down, because it has nothing to do with tangible 
     <lb/>
     facts or figures. It has to do with personality, with 
     <lb/>
     human hopes, with that quality of man that 
     <lb/>
     pushes him onward through the generations 
     <lb/>
     toward a better way of living. I happen to believe 
     <lb/>
     that a man can best develop his personality, can 
     <lb/>
     best arrive at what happiness is possible in this 
     <lb/>
     life, through accepting all the dangers and pos<lb break="no"/>sible catastrophes of independence. The man 
     <lb/>
     who relies on himself, we all know, takes a risk 
     <lb/>
     on everything that he has — his health, his ability, 
     <lb/>
     his wealth, his circumstances. But the man who 
     <lb/>
     relies on others, who has no thought or power of 
     <lb/>
     earning which is really his own, no achievements 
     <lb/>
     that he can regard with pride as his own, no 
     <lb/>
     victories over his own personal struggles — such 
     <lb/>
     a man can know no victory because he knows no 
     <lb/>
     defeat. So, Mr. Chairman, I believe it is with a 
     <lb/>
     nation or a counuy; countries, like men, can only 
     <lb/>
     achieve real maturity by accepting the challenge 
     <lb/>
     of free will to make or break themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Life is a struggle, and only those who do not 
     <lb/>
     face this fact must escape into dependence upon 
     <lb/>
     stronger personalities. One gentleman said, 
     <lb/>
     "Responsible government is right in principle, 
     <lb/>
     but wrong in practice." He was expressing an 
     <lb/>
     escape into theory. Anything that exists in real 
     <lb/>
     life cannot be right in principle and wrong in 
     <lb/>
     practice. The most one can say of it is that it is 
 

            <pb n="1306" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-21_Page_1306.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1306</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
     

     being practiced with the hope that its weaknesses 
     <lb/>
     will gradually be overcome. It can be right in 
     <lb/>
     principle and imperfect in practice, but not 
     <lb/>
     wrong. By making such a statement the 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is being very naive. He is making the 
     <lb/>
     sort of statement that has no meaning in real life. 
     <lb/>
     Why it was made, people can judge for themsel<lb break="no"/>ves.... It is not self-government that is wrong, that 
     <lb/>
     has its weaknesses, it is we who have the weak<lb break="no"/>nesses, the men and women who in the last 
     <lb/>
     analysis make it what it is. But I happen to believe 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland men and women — no better, 
     <lb/>
     no worse than other men and women in their 
     <lb/>
     ability to progress and improve and work out a 
     <lb/>
     destiny for themselves. For the same reason I 
     <lb/>
     believe that that system of self-government can 
     <lb/>
     progress and improve. Otherwise I would not 
     <lb/>
     advocate it. I believe men and women no longer 
     <lb/>
     are satisfied with government which gives politi<lb break="no"/>cal freedom but denies freedom to carve out in an 
     <lb/>
     intricate world a means of making a decent 
     <lb/>
     living. Why should we assume, as has been done 
     <lb/>
     so often, that self-government is to be a stagnant, 
     <lb/>
     reactionary, dead thing? Does it not exist as a 
     <lb/>
     means of implementing the wishes of the people? 
     <lb/>
     When we are asked what is the good of a vote to 
     <lb/>
     a man who has nothing to eat, the answer is, "It 
     <lb/>
     is no good." But the question itself does not make 
     <lb/>
     sense. A man does not want a vote instead of 
     <lb/>
     food. Nobody ever argued that. Neither does he 
     <lb/>
     want food at a price which will bring the loss of 
     <lb/>
     his self-respect, his power to develop and live 
     <lb/>
     more fully. In short, most men who are men at all 
     <lb/>
     feel that they are entitled to both. And I think they 
     <lb/>
     are right. I think also, under self-government that 
     <lb/>
     they have at this moment in our history the best 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of getting both. Otherwise I would 
     <lb/>
     not be advocating it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "But", says my timid friend, "who will 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that he will get both? Who will guaran<lb break="no"/>tee that his interests will not be forgotten? Who 
     <lb/>
     will guarantee him against inefficiency in 
     <lb/>
     government, corruption among politicians, 
     <lb/>
     preferment among certain classes? That is a $64 
     <lb/>
     question." It is indeed a $64 question. And the 
     <lb/>
     answer is, "Who other on this earth but you and 
     <lb/>
     me, sir, who other but the little fellow, the fisher<lb break="no"/>man, the farmer, the logger, the teacher, the office 
     <lb/>
     clerk?" He and his fellows must see to it that the 
     <lb/>
     politicians they vote for — or even more effec<lb break="no"/>tively sometimes, the politicians they refuse to 
    

            <cb/>
         

     vote for — the economic planning they agitate 
     <lb/>
     for, the values they would set store by, will be 
     <lb/>
     implemented; and if we ordinary citizens do not 
     <lb/>
     see that this is done, then forms of government in 
     <lb/>
     themselves are meaningless and all our work and 
     <lb/>
     talking in this Convention for the last 20 months, 
     <lb/>
     in my personal opinion, futile. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we as voters do not want corruption, we 
     <lb/>
     must throw out those who practice it. If we are 
     <lb/>
     offered the kind of candidates whose integrity 
     <lb/>
     does not satisfy us, then we must organise to 
     <lb/>
     replace them by others whom we the people will 
     <lb/>
     prevail upon to offer themselves, at our request, 
     <lb/>
     to the service of their country. If politicians, on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, do not want to be hampered in 
     <lb/>
     their desire to be statesmenlike by job-seekers, 
     <lb/>
     by incessant requests to spoonfeed certain com<lb break="no"/>munities, then they must initiate certain 
     <lb/>
     safeguards against such weakening pater<lb break="no"/>nalism.... The people must encourage the forma<lb break="no"/>tion of decentralised government through 
     <lb/>
     councils, boards and municipalities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In discharging my duty as a member of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention as a result of no little study and 
     <lb/>
     thought, by giving my opinion on the question 
     <lb/>
     of forms of government, I am in honour bound 
     <lb/>
     to say something else which is of great impor<lb break="no"/>tance. Whilst I think that Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders have most to profit from a 
     <lb/>
     form of government which is free and inde<lb break="no"/>pendent, I am duty bound to say that I believe 
     <lb/>
     that that form of government does not necessarily 
     <lb/>
     offer the easiest way. I believe it demands more 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice, more native ability, more self-ad<lb break="no"/>ministered checks and responsibilities than any 
     <lb/>
     other form considered in this Convention so far. 
     <lb/>
     I feel it would be wrong to recommend self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     government to the people of Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     the easiest way out. But just because it is not the 
     <lb/>
     easiest way out, and because of the future poten<lb break="no"/>tial of this country, I feel, after 20 months of 
     <lb/>
     study, that given the effort, the results will be the 
     <lb/>
     most rewarding from self-government. </p>

<p>
In speaking to another motion a short while
<lb/>
ago, a gentleman here said, on the same point to
<lb/>
which I have just referred, that another form of
<lb/>
government would not necessarily mean that we
<lb/>
would not have to struggle for an existence. I 
<lb/>
would like to bring that in to emphasise the last 
<lb/>
thing I propose to say and it is this: that only by
<lb/>
knuckling down to our problem, by doing it our<lb break="no"/>

     selves, can we hope to bring about in New<lb break="no"/>foundland that decent standard of living and cer<lb break="no"/>tain independence which we all desire. One great 
     <lb/>
     man, now passed to his reward, said it this way 
     <lb/>
     — a man who devoted his life to achieving small 
     <lb/>
     steps towards the future betterment of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, a man whom Newfoundlanders have 
     <lb/>
     reason to respect, Sir Wilfred Grenfell; what he 
     <lb/>
     said was this: "What this country needs is not 
     <lb/>
     infallibility, but courage."

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> As Iintimated yesterday afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     I proposed, with the consent of the House, to

     introduce this evening a motion whereby mem<lb break="no"/>bers absent through illness or for good and suffi<lb break="no"/>cient cause, would have the right to have their 
     <lb/>
     wishes recorded at this stage of the proceedings. 
     <lb/>
     As you will remember, sir, I intimated some 
     <lb/>
     months ago that Mr. K.M. Brown had made a 
     <lb/>
     request to me that provision be made whereby his 
     <lb/>
     vote could be recorded. You are aware of the 
     <lb/>
     details of our application at that time time to make 
     <lb/>
     provision in this respect. Because of that, and I 
     <lb/>
     think it is imperative, if the House is satisfied to 
     <lb/>
     receive the motion I think we should pass it as 
     <lb/>
     soon as possible, and perhaps I could make the 
     <lb/>
     motion now.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In that case, I will try and en<lb break="no"/>deavour to ascertain the wishes of the House. As 
     <lb/>
     the House is aware, this is a motion of urgency, 
     <lb/>
     but I am not expected to receive a motion without 
     <lb/>
     previous notice. In this particular connection the 
     <lb/>
     matter was gone into at a private session held 
     <lb/>
     approximately a month ago, and I think it was 
     <lb/>
     agreed that some machinery should be set up 
     <lb/>
     whereby Mr. Brown, because of illness, would 
     <lb/>
     not be deprived of the privilege of recording his 
     <lb/>
     vote. In fact, I would be prepared to record it now 
     <lb/>
     under rule 39. I must assume Mr. Brown is in 
     <lb/>
     good standing, at all events, and the nature of the 
     <lb/>
     motion has already been made known to the 
     <lb/>
     house.... The motion therefore is that the opera<lb break="no"/>tion of rule 13 be suspended so as to permit Mr.

     <lb/>
     which has already been made known to the

     the rules of the House of Assembly shall

     apply;

            <p>
     And whereas by the rules of the House of

            <p>
     Be it therefore resolved that section 54 of

     the rules of procedure of the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention be amended by adding to paragraph

     54 the following words: "save and except that 
     <lb/>
     in the event of a member of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     being incapacitated by reason of illness or 
     <lb/>
     some other good or sufficient reason from 
     <lb/>
     attending the meeting of the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     such member shall have the right to have his 
     <lb/>
     vote recorded by delivering to the Chairman 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention an expression of his 
     <lb/>
     wishes. The wishes of such member may be 
     <lb/>
     conveyed to the Chairman by letter or by 
     <lb/>
     telegram from and bearing the signature of 
     <lb/>
     any such member."

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Before you put that — it is clearly 
     <lb/>
     understood, I take it, that such indication by any

     member, by telegram, letter or otherwise, will be 
     <lb/>
     available to the members and to <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> or in

     some other manner?

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....The opinions of all members 
     <lb/>
     will be recorded and the opinions of such mem<lb break="no"/>bers who express a preference will also be 
     <lb/>
     recorded. Therefore, if I receive from any mem<lb break="no"/>ber any expression of opinion on either or both

     of these two questions, by letter or by telegram, 
     <lb/>
     from and bearing the signatures of any such

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> May I advance a little further along 
     <lb/>
     so that I can have it understood — I intend to 
     <lb/>
     communicate with Mr. Brown. I take it, when we 
     <lb/>
     finish this debate tomorrow, if the motion is 
     <lb/>
     carried there and then, the members will not have 
     <lb/>
     to express their preference? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is another point and I 
     <lb/>
     want to make this clear. If any member of the 
     <lb/>
     House has any objection to it, I want him to state 
     <lb/>
     it now. Suppose for argument's sake a poll is 
     <lb/>
     taken at 5 o'clock, and 30 minutes after the poll 
     <lb/>
     has been taken the letter or cable arrives from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown. I intend to record the views expressed by 
 

            <cb/>
         

     Mr. Brown whether or not the document contain<lb break="no"/>ing his expressions has reached me at the time the 
     <lb/>
     poll is taken....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I take it, the deadline would be the

     time the Drafting Committee had completed its

     report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is my view. Any time be<lb break="no"/>tween now and when it goes to the Drafting 
     <lb/>
     Committee, any letters or telegrams directed to 
     <lb/>
     me from any members, like Mr. Brown, who are 
     <lb/>
     unavoidably absent through illness or any other 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, I will cause their views to be be 
     <lb/>
     recorded the moment I receive the letter or cable, 
     <lb/>
     and the deadline can only be at the moment when 
     <lb/>
     you pass the matter over to the Drafting Commit<lb break="no"/>tee for finalisation, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> On that, would it not be passed over 
     <lb/>
     to the Drafting Committee after voting is taken? 
     <lb/>
     Would that allow much time to record his vote? 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....As you know, it was agreed 
     <lb/>that Monday and Tuesday would be devoted to 
     <lb/>the final order now on the order paper and that 
     <lb/>means the matter would not go before the Draft<lb break="no"/>ing Committee before Wednesday morning. At 
     <lb/>all events, it is proposed to submit the draft to the 
     <lb/>Convention for ratification and adoption on 
     <lb/>Thursday. Any time up to next Thursday, before 
     <lb/>it comes up for ratification, anything I receive 
     <lb/>definitely will be recorded.

            <p>
     January 22, 1948 
     <lb/>
     Motion to recommend to the United Kingdom Government that the wishes of the People of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland be ascertained as to whether it is their desire that Responsible Goverment be 
     <lb/>
     restored or Commission of Government be continued 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Vincent Yesterday I moved the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the debate with the hope of getting 
     <lb/>
     precedence to the floor; since then I have been 
     <lb/>
     told that there are quite a few members who wish 
     <lb/>
     to speak on this motion and I may say that I 
     <lb/>
     propose to finish my address within 20 minutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As the Convention fast draws to its long-ex- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     pected end, its conduct has indeed become com<lb break="no"/>mendable; so much so that one of my delegate 
     <lb/>
     friends yesterday called it the glad-handers club; 
     <lb/>
     and in speaking to the motion certain members 
     <lb/>
     have even waxed poetical. My respected and 
     <lb/>
     close personal friend, Mr. Hickman, at the con<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>clusion of a very fine address a few days ago, 
     <lb/>
     invoked in his usual masterful way the poetical 
     <lb/>
     phraseology of our national ode. Mr. Vardy, my 
     <lb/>
     associate from Trinity North, content with noth<lb break="no"/>ing less than the original, wrote a poem which he 
     <lb/>
     quoted in support of his arguments, and seriously, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, our poet of the year, your friend 
     <lb/>
     and mine, delegate Ike Newell,1 had better look 
     <lb/>
     to his laurels or Mr. Vardy with his free verse may 
     <lb/>
     supplant him — that verse was entirely free, I am 
     <lb/>
     sure, Mr. Vardy! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, as the Convention is about to conclude 
     <lb/>
     its findings and make its recommendations; as 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     lIsaac Newell's poem, "Lines for An Anniversary 1497-1947" won the O'Leary Newfoundland Poetry Award 
     <lb/>
    in 1947.
