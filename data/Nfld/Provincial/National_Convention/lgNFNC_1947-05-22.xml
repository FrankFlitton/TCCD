     on solid facts. That is why we sent this delegation 
     <lb/>
     to London We wanted to know just where we 
     <lb/>
     stood with the old country. Did they really mean 
     <lb/>
     it when they told us that we could vote for any 
     <lb/>
     form of government we liked? They told the 
     <lb/>
     delegation that we could vote for any form of 
     <lb/>
     government we liked. We wanted to know where 
     <lb/>
     we would stand if we voted for responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. They told the delegation that if we 
     <lb/>
     voted for responsible government we would be 
     <lb/>
     on our own so far as Britain is concerned. We 
     <lb/>
     wanted to know where we would stand if we 
     <lb/>
     voted for Commission government. They told the 
     <lb/>
     delegation that if we voted for Commission 
     <lb/>
     government they would continue to stand behind 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, when a man promises to do something 
     <lb/>
     for you, it's only common sense to take a look at 
     <lb/>
     his ability to do what he promises. He may make 
     <lb/>
     the promise in good faith and sincerity, but he 
     <lb/>
     may not be able to keep his promise. And so it is 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     with Great Britain. She promises to help New<lb break="no"/>foundland if we need help in the future — 
     <lb/>
     provided we stay under Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment. But then we take a look at Britain's condi<lb break="no"/>tion, and we are very doubtful whether Britain 
     <lb/>
     would be able to give us any help for many years 
     <lb/>
     to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have very great doubt about Britain's ability 
     <lb/>
    to help this country. I have no doubt at all about 
     <lb/>her sincerity.... If I had to sum it all up, I would 
     <lb/>say that so far as Great Britain is concerned, this 
     <lb/>country is on its own right now. We' ll get no help 
     <lb/>from Britain whatever form of government we 
     <lb/>may choose. We needed to have the information 
     <lb/>that the London delegation brought back to us, 
     <lb/>and at last we are beginning to know where we 
     <lb/>stand.

     occasion when in London to visit South Ken<lb break="no"/>sington, and I saw this Imperial Institute of

     by the imperial government and mostly by mini<lb break="no"/>ng interests. We were informed that this Imperial

     Institute was made up of Lord Somebody and the

     deputy minister of mines for each dominion.

     There is one deputy minister of mines on the

     You will recollect we had a resolution of a

     somewhat similar character in the early part of 
     <lb/>
     Febmary, made by Mr. Job.<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> The motion itself

     was for the purpose of acquiring a discussion with

     the Commission of Government, for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of obtaining advice from them as to how to 
     <lb/>
     proceed about the matter. I have a copy of that

     Both these resolutions — that is Mr. Job's and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Penney's — concern trade and tariffs and 
     <lb/>
     commercial agreements between the two 
     <lb/>
     countries. At the conference which was held with 
     <lb/>
     the government by the delegation from this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, the government expressed this opinion: 
     <lb/>
     "Upon the question raised in clause 1 of the 
     <lb/>
     resolution respecting steps for establishing an 
     <lb/>
     economic or fiscal relationship between the 
     <lb/>
     United States and Newfoundland, your commit<lb break="no"/>tee was informed that this question was one for 
     <lb/>
     negotiation between governments through the 
     <lb/>
     regular diplomatic channels and that it was 
     <lb/>
     doubtful whether the subject matter of the clause 


            <cb/>
  

     came within the terms of reference of the Nation<lb break="no"/>al Convention".<ref target="#fn_05">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That was the government's views on the mat<lb break="no"/>ter. With their view I am not particularly con<lb break="no"/>cerned this afternoon. I have to decide for myself 
     <lb/>
     as to whether the resolution itself comes within 
     <lb/>
     the terms of the National Convention. because 
     <lb/>
     our powers must be confined to that Convention 
     <lb/>
     Act. It is the act which gives us the powers we 
     <lb/>
     have, whatever they may be. Unless I can find 
     <lb/>
     words in that Convention Act which will enable 
     <lb/>
     us to receive a motion of this kind or act upon it, 
     <lb/>
     I shall have to rule against the resolution. I have 
     <lb/>
     given considerable thought to the matter, and I 
     <lb/>
     am unable to read into that Convention Act any 
     <lb/>
     power to deal with matters of trade or matters of 
     <lb/>
     tariffs. We are a fact-finding body, our activities 
     <lb/>
     being confined to ascertaining the present posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the country, estimating her future 
     <lb/>
     prospects, and discussing forms of government, 
     <lb/>
     but obviously we have no power to do anything 
     <lb/>
     about trade concessions or tariff agreements. 
     <lb/>
     That is within the jurisdiction of the government 
     <lb/>
     only, and we are not a government. I must there<lb break="no"/>fore mle out that resolution.... I know that some 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this Convention feel very 
     <lb/>
     strongly on this subject, and in view of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that this Convention is a rather extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     body, I am inclined to think that perhaps in cer<lb break="no"/>tain instances we may be justified in taking ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary steps. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This Convention will presumably die some<lb break="no"/>time within the next few months, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it is ever likely to be resurrected. I do not 
     <lb/>
     mean the individual members of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     will pass beyond the pale, but the Convention 
     <lb/>
     itself will go into history and remain there; I am 
     <lb/>
     not disposed unduly to restrict the endeavours of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, and for that reason, while I am

     bound, as Chairman, to rule that resolution out of 
     <lb/>
     order, I would like to point out that there is a way 
     <lb/>
     to overcome that point, if you so desire. It is 
     <lb/>
     highly unusual for a House of Commons or 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly to challenge the ruling of the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, highly unusual, but it can be done. If 
     <lb/>
     any members of this Convention feel sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     strongly about the matter, I am quite content that 
     <lb/>
     my ruling should be challenged. I shall not feel 
     <lb/>
     offended if the ruling is not sustained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Am I in order in speaking to that chal<lb break="no"/>lenge? My feeling is we would like to challenge 
     <lb/>
     your ruling if at all possible. It would not be 
     <lb/>
     pleasant for this house to do that, although you 
     <lb/>
     have been sporting, shall I say.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will not have the slightest ob<lb break="no"/>jection. I cannot allow you to argue the point. 
     <lb/>
     You must raise the question whether the ruling of

     the Chair must be sustained or not.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Can I not point out my reasons for

     thinking that this has a great deal to do with the

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ... Is it the pleasure of the House

     <lb/>most powerful nation on this side of the Atlantic 
     <lb/>if not in the world, and is situated right at our 
     <lb/>door. As a matter of fact she has already settled 
     <lb/>on our soil to stay, and in these circumstances 
     <lb/>would likely be very willing, through friendly 
     <lb/>negotiations with an official delegation of this 
     <lb/>elected National Convention, to allow New<lb break="no"/>foundland something for our territory on which 
     <lb/>her bases are now permanently built, and for 
     <lb/>which we did not receive any payment. She has 
     <lb/>already given definite proof of her goodwill in 
     <lb/>rushing to our aid in many emergencies. She has,

     bosom — who are in the main keen missionaries 
     <lb/>
     for closer contact with a country they love so 
     <lb/>
     well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This Convention has already sent a delegation 
     <lb/>
     to London, the result of which is now known to 
     <lb/>
     all, and are sending a delegation to Ottawa in the 
     <lb/>
     near future. It is my firm belief that we should 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to Washington also. In fact I 
     <lb/>
     feel we should not fail to do so, looking to the 
     <lb/>
     future prospects of Newfoundland, and with a 
     <lb/>
     belief that the Government of the USA would 
     <lb/>
     receive and welcome such a delegation warmly. 
     <lb/>
     May I ask you, then, to arrange for a delegation 
     <lb/>
     to proceed to Washington for trade discussions 
     <lb/>
     and other relevant matters affecting the future 
     <lb/>
     economy of Newfoundland.... I feel it to be my 
     <lb/>
     humble duty in serving the interests of New<lb break="no"/>foundland as a whole, no matter what may be said 
     <lb/>
     to the contrary. There is no disloyalty in this 
     <lb/>
     move; no person dare say otherwise, nor is there 
     <lb/>
     any party politics involved, for it does not run 
     <lb/>
     contrary to any political party. It can, however, 
     <lb/>
     affect materially the whole people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, no matter what form of government 
     <lb/>
     they will eventually decide to support and elect; 
     <lb/>
     so may I submit to you that we should obtain the 
     <lb/>
     facts from Washington, as well as from England 
     <lb/>
     and Canada.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have very great 
     <lb/>
     pleasure in seconding the motion. We have very 
     <lb/>
     considerable trade with the United States, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly in the export of paper, and recently in 
     <lb/>
     cod fillets and other fishery products. In connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the export of cod fillets, it is desirable 
     <lb/>
     that we should be able to extend our market 
     <lb/>
     substantially in that country. We have the 
     <lb/>
     product, and we know that there is a very substan<lb break="no"/>tial market in the United States for it. and it is a 
     <lb/>
     matter for negotiation on a mutually beneficial 
     <lb/>
     basis, in order that our fishermen may benefit 
     <lb/>
     from having the very extensive market that is 
     <lb/>
     there available, and that the people of the United 
     <lb/>
     States may be able to get our product at a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable price. We must reasonably expect that 
     <lb/>
     if we hope to get our fishery products into the 
     <lb/>
     United States free of duty, they will want to send 
     <lb/>
     some of their products to this country either free 
     <lb/>
     of duty or at a substantially reduced rate of duty, 
     <lb/>
     and this is of great concern to the lower income 
     <lb/>
     classes. We all realise that many of our working 
     <lb/>
     people have a low standard of living due to the 


            <pb n="571" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-22_Page_0571.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">571</fw>
          

     fact that they are unable to get the things that are 
     <lb/>
     being produced in the United States, because to 
     <lb/>
     the original cost is added the many costs of han<lb break="no"/>dling, and then a very substantial duty.... There 
     <lb/>
     are many items from which we might completely 
     <lb/>
     wipe out the duty in order that our working people 
     <lb/>
     may be able to purchase things at a cheaper price. 
     <lb/>
     This may involve the much bigger issue of creat<lb break="no"/>ing a customs union between this country and the 
     <lb/>
     United States. Should such a proposition be 
     <lb/>
     entertained, the Canadian government would 
     <lb/>
     also be interested, and perhaps the discussions 
     <lb/>
     which would take place might finally bring about 
     <lb/>
     a customs union between the United States, 
     <lb/>
     Canada and Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To do that, of course, it would be necessary 
     <lb/>
     for us to give consideration to some other method 
     <lb/>
     of taxation, but the one great benefit of such a 
     <lb/>
     union would be that the standard of living of our 
     <lb/>
     working people would be substantially raised, in 
     <lb/>
     that they would be enabled to get many of the 
     <lb/>
     things that today are entirely beyond their reach 
     <lb/>
     because of the high prices. It is almost impossible 
     <lb/>
     to envisage at this time all the results that may be 
     <lb/>
     achieved by sending a delegation to Washington, 
     <lb/>
     but I am quite sure that we have good grounds for 
     <lb/>
     believing that if we are prepared to take a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable attitude that we can extend the market 
     <lb/>
     for our fishery products and at the same time 
     <lb/>
     benefit all our people by reducing the tariff on our 
     <lb/>
     imports from that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Chairman, it has been a source 
     <lb/>
     of wonder to me why it is that a motion of this 
     <lb/>
     kind did not come before the House long ago. 
     <lb/>
     One of the terms of reference of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     is to inquire into and explore the economic pos<lb break="no"/>sibilities that lie before our country. In the early 
     <lb/>
     days of this Convention, when our authority to 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to the USA to inquire into trade 
     <lb/>
     and political relationships with that country was 
     <lb/>
     brought up, it was referred to the late Chairman 
     <lb/>
     and the constitutional authority, Professor 
     <lb/>
     Wheare, and we were advised that it was within 
     <lb/>
     the province of this Convention to send a delega<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not correct. You were 
     <lb/>
     never advised by the late Chairman or Professor 
     <lb/>
     Wheare that you could send a trade delegation to 
     <lb/>
     the United States of America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I thought that was what he said, sir. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am quite sure you are wrong. 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
        

     What Professor Wheare and the late Justice Fox 
     <lb/>
     did say, was that you could send a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     the United States to discuss the question of 
     <lb/>
     federal union, with the assent of the British 
     <lb/>
     government and the United States government. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Thank you, sir. I hope this will be 
     <lb/>with the consent of both governments. If there be 
     <lb/>in this House all the sincerity for the people's 
     <lb/>interest that some of the delegates wish us to 
     <lb/>believe, and not forgetting that lone fisherman on 
     <lb/>the bill of Cape St. George, and if the pussy-foot<lb break="no"/>ing with respect to the people's economic well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>being is to cease, then I think that a motion of this 
     <lb/>kind should have been one of the first resolutions 
     <lb/>dealt with and not one of the last. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems to me that there has been an utter lack 
     <lb/>
     of frankness in dealing with this all-important 
     <lb/>
     subject. Delegates adopt a hush-hush and "don't 
     <lb/>
     wake the baby" attitude when this subject has 
     <lb/>
     appeared likely to come up. The Chairman is 
     <lb/>
     aware, and every other delegate is aware, that in 
     <lb/>
     the two instances where a vote was taken with 
     <lb/>
     respect to forms of government and other rela<lb break="no"/>tions that this country should adopt, the 
     <lb/>
     preponderance of public opinion was in favour of 
     <lb/>
     establishing relations with the USA over all other 
     <lb/>
     forms of government. I refer to a poll that was 
     <lb/>
     conducted about a year ago in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Western Star</hi> 
     <lb/>
     published at Corner Brook, and a more recent poll 
     <lb/>
     conducted by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sunday Herald</hi> at St. John's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Don't you think that it is about time that we 
     <lb/>
     should cease trimming, and discuss our economic 
     <lb/>
     and political relations with the country that year 
     <lb/>
     after year buys a larger percentage of our exports 
     <lb/>
     than any other country? Don't you think that our 
     <lb/>
     relations with that country, which sends us from 
     <lb/>
     our immigrant brothers and sisters several mil<lb break="no"/>lion dollars each year, ... which is at present 
     <lb/>
     employing at the bases here 3-4,000 New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, a country with which half the 
     <lb/>
     world is trying to establish closer trade relations, 
     <lb/>
     don't you think that if we are sincere to those who 
     <lb/>
     sent us here, and if we are not to be known as a 
     <lb/>
     conglomeration of pussy-footers and hypocrites, 
     <lb/>
     don't you think it is about time that something be 
     <lb/>
     done towards exploring every avenue of 
     <lb/>
     economic and political approach in this connec<lb break="no"/>tion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My good friend from Bonavista Centre gets 
     <lb/>
     his delegation for Canada. Our trade relations 
     <lb/>
     with Canada may be summed up briefly as fol<lb break="no"/>
      

            <pb n="572" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-22_Page_0572.jpg"/>

     lows: we buy five times as much from Canada as 
     <lb/>
     Canada buys from us. The life savings of our 
     <lb/>
     people, which amounts to eight or ten millions of 
     <lb/>
     new life insurance yearly, goes to Canada, rather 
     <lb/>
     than stays here to develop the industries of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Possibly this may be a good 
     <lb/>
     reason to send a delegation to Canada, but if it be, 
     <lb/>
     what can be said of a delegation to a country that 
     <lb/>
     each year buys from us more than we buy from 
     <lb/>
     her, and in addition to which sends into this 
     <lb/>
     country millions of dollars from our immigrants 
     <lb/>
     living there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not a one-way financial traffic that we 
     <lb/>
     seek, as our relations with Canada happen to be, 
     <lb/>
     and it is about time that something is done about 
     <lb/>
     it. A lot of our economic uncertainty is because 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that we are a milch cow for Canadian 
     <lb/>
     business interests, and our economic prosperity 
     <lb/>
     would be advanced if we were to decrease, rather 
     <lb/>
     than increase the one-way business traffic with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and increase it with the USA. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1890, when Sir Robert Bond negotiated the 
     <lb/>
     Bond-Blaine treaty, it was blocked by Canada 
     <lb/>
     with the concurrence of the British government.<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     Later, about 15 years ago I believe, when our 
     <lb/>
     government was negotiating an advantageous 
     <lb/>
     trade agreement with the West Indies with 
     <lb/>
     respect to our fish, this agreement too was block<lb break="no"/>ed by Canada; and a few years later the big 
     <lb/>
     hearted Canadian government descended to 
     <lb/>
     penny-pinching antics by discontinuing the few 
     <lb/>
     dollars that they contributed as subsidy to the 
     <lb/>
     steamer on the Cabot Strait. When Sir Robert 
     <lb/>
     Bond tried to negotiate the Bond-Blaine treaty, 
     <lb/>
     which would have meant the economic salvation 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, it was objected to by Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and blocked by the interference of the British 
     <lb/>
     government. The British government has now 
     <lb/>
     told as that we can no longer expect financial 
     <lb/>
     assistance. This is all right, but may I ask the 
     <lb/>
     British government one favour, that if they are 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to help us, will they please in future 
     <lb/>
     do nothing to hinder us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1775, I believe, a small body of poor, 
     <lb/>
     hungry, ill-equipped Englishmen, and the sons of 
     <lb/>
     Englishmen, who were settled along the New 
     <lb/>
     England coast felt that their economic and politi<lb break="no"/>cal interests were being retarded and blocked by 
 

            <cb/>
          

     the English government. What did these English<lb break="no"/>men do? Did they say, "Hush, hush, don't wake 
     <lb/>
     the baby"? No, poor as they were, they had the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of independence, which has made England 
     <lb/>
     great and which has made Britishers the great 
     <lb/>
     pioneers, fearless and forward-looking people 
     <lb/>
     wherever they have gone. They said "No", and 
     <lb/>
     out of that came the War of Independence, and 
     <lb/>
     the USA. It was conceived in the hearts of 
     <lb/>
     Englishmen and brought to fruition by English<lb break="no"/>men, and it was this same USA that four or five 
     <lb/>
     years ago sent her sons and daughters to 
     <lb/>
     England's aid, and made it possible for England 
     <lb/>
     to survive in her greatest struggle. Is it then 
     <lb/>
     inopportune or improper for us to approach this 
     <lb/>
     subject any less fearlessly than those poor 
     <lb/>
     Englishmen did in 1775?....

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am an unreformed, un<lb break="no"/>regenerate and unrepentant free trader. If this 
     <lb/>
     country could have free trade with the United 
     <lb/>
     States, it would be a great thing. If we could have 
     <lb/>
     free trade with the Dominion of Canada, it would 
     <lb/>
     be a great thing. If we could have free trade with 
     <lb/>
     every country in the world, it would be a great 
     <lb/>
     thing for the people of this country. I believe in 
     <lb/>
     abolishing every single cent of customs duties. I 
     <lb/>
     am a believer in bringing down the cost of living. 
     <lb/>
     The only way I can see to do that is by absolutely 
     <lb/>
     free trade. Now, if this motion passes, we may get 
     <lb/>
     a committee of this Convention going to 
     <lb/>
     Washington. We may.... It may be received by 
     <lb/>
     the Government of the United States. If it is, they 
     <lb/>
     could talk about trade and tariffs, and maybe we 
     <lb/>
     could get some trade with the United States. As 
     <lb/>
     a free trader and only as a free trader — and 
     <lb/>
     remember that cuts all ways, local industries, 
     <lb/>
     protected industries that are an imposition on this 
     <lb/>
     country, will be wiped out, and our people will 
     <lb/>
     get a chance to live. I am all for our people getting 
     <lb/>
     a chance to live, and I don't care if there are a 
     <lb/>
     dozen or a hundred whose toes will be trod on. I 
     <lb/>
     am only concerned with the people in this country 
     <lb/>
     who have never had a break in the 450 years of 
     <lb/>
     our history. Whenever they poked their head up 
     <lb/>
     over the stage head, there was someone there to 
     <lb/>
     kick them down again. Let's get free trade if we 
     <lb/>
     are allowed to send a delegation and if they will 
     <lb/>
     receive one I will not vote against it.

<p>
     I don't believe for a single moment that there 
     <lb/>
     will be a delegation going to Washington. Why 
     <lb/>
     be hypocritical about it, or try to bluff about it? 
     <lb/>
     Why say there will be one, when I don't believe 
     <lb/>
     it? We may take a very dim View of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government or the Dominions Office, but 
     <lb/>
     whether it is dim or bright, the fact is that they 
     <lb/>
     both told us that negotiation of trade and tariff 
     <lb/>
     agreements is a matter between governments. I 
     <lb/>
     don't know whether they are right or wrong, but 
     <lb/>
     they ought to know what they are talking about, 
     <lb/>
     so I don't think this delegation will go. I will vote 
     <lb/>
     for it to go, and I will be sorry if it does not go, 
     <lb/>
     because I am a free trader. I can't make myself 
     <lb/>
     any plainer than that....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> ....I feel a bit unhappy over these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions and negotiations, because, rightly or 
     <lb/>
     wrongly, the feeling comes to me that negotia<lb break="no"/>tions on national matters such as trade and tariffs 
     <lb/>
     are matters for government with government, and 
     <lb/>
     we definitely are not a government. Moreover, I 
     <lb/>
     feel that we are somewhat confusing the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, and I am sure that we have no 
     <lb/>
     desire to do that. Whether I am right or wrong, I 
     <lb/>
     leave that to those who are better versed in public 
     <lb/>
     life and politics than I am.

     <persName ref="pers:CRAN1">Mr. Cranford</persName> In rising in support of the motion 
     <lb/>
     I do so with the feeling that I possess as good a 
     <lb/>
     British spirit as the members of the British 
     <lb/>
     government that made the base deal with the 
     <lb/>
     United States for 99 years. I feel sure the British 
     <lb/>
     government knew at the time they made that deal 
     <lb/>
     for such a long time, which to us means forever, 
     <lb/>
     that they were placing us in the front line of battle 
     <lb/>
     in the event of the United States becoming in<lb break="no"/>volved in war, whether Britain would be with 
     <lb/>
     them or not, and in view of that knowledge, and 
     <lb/>
     considering the United States to be on the most 
     <lb/>
     friendly terms with Great Britain, it behoves us 
     <lb/>
     to take advantage and endeavour to be placed in 
     <lb/>
     the front line in securing markets for our 
     <lb/>
     products, so we can enjoy a decent living....

            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> While I am in full accord with the 
     <lb/>spirit of the motion, I am also of the opinion that 
     <lb/>you were within your rights in rejecting the mo<lb break="no"/>tion at the beginning. You went strictly by the 
     <lb/>terms of reference. I think this will put the Com-   
     <lb/>mission of Government to a test. They will be 
     <lb/>given the privilege or otherwise of throwing it 
     <lb/>out. I have always felt, particularly for the past 
     <lb/>14 years, that Newfoundland, with our foreign 


            <cb/>
         

     politics so much controlled by three great powers, 
     <lb/>
     should have a government of its own, of a strictly 
     <lb/>
     limited number, and within an international 
     <lb/>
     group of three. In that I am in full accord with my 
     <lb/>
     old friend Mr. Job. Now I cannot see eye to eye 
     <lb/>
     with a lot that has been said, because I think we 
     <lb/>
     are getting things confused. Some of the speakers 
     <lb/>
     have confused matters pertaining to the sending 
     <lb/>
     of a trade delegation, with a group that we may 
     <lb/>
     or may not send to seek union with the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Trade is a matter strictly between govern<lb break="no"/>ments, and it is just as well to face up to facts. But 
     <lb/>
     I will be glad to see any delegation going there. I 
     <lb/>
     have no hard feelings against anyone in the 
     <lb/>
     United States. I am reminded of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     George Washington's father was a great English<lb break="no"/>man, and I think we have reached the time in life 
     <lb/>
     when, in the very near future, not only those in 
     <lb/>
     Canada and America must come together more 
     <lb/>
     closely, but Newfoundland must eventually 
     <lb/>
     come into some kind of a union with these great 
     <lb/>
     powers on this side of the Atlantic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some speakers have criticised the idea of 
     <lb/>
     sending a delegation to Ottawa, but seem to 
     <lb/>
     favour sending a delegation to Washington. I am 
     <lb/>
     not in that group. I try to be fair towards every 
     <lb/>
     subject brought before this Convention, and to be 
     <lb/>
     fair to the people of this country we must give 
     <lb/>
     sober thought to any resolution that's brought in. 
     <lb/>
     We have been severely criticised for turning the 
     <lb/>
     former resolution down, but I am of the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that the time is premature for sending this delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Washington. This is a very delicate matter, 
     <lb/>
     and we could get ourselves embroiled into some 
     <lb/>
     pretty hard feelings, because when it comes to 
     <lb/>
     changing matters of this kind, it strikes very deep. 
     <lb/>
     I know we need three meals a day, but I believe 
     <lb/>
     these things could be settled around the table, and 
     <lb/>
     a closer union than now exists could be brought 
     <lb/>
     about between Canada, USA and New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and that it would improve the future 
     <lb/>
     standard ofliving for the people ofthis country.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't want to take up too much time over this 
     <lb/>
     matter, but if it is possible to send a trade delega<lb break="no"/>tion — and I am firmly of the opinion that it is 
     <lb/>
     not — we won't be made a joke of; the joke will 
     <lb/>
     be on them, because they are not willing to face 
     <lb/>
     up to the grim realities. But I still believe, know<lb break="no"/>ing them as I do, that the Commission will turn 
     <lb/>
     this resolution down. It is within their power to 
     <lb/>
     do so.

            <p>I take it that is the basis of your not agreeing?

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. Lord Addison may hold

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I find myself on the horns of a 
     <lb/>dilemma. I knew the bird would come home to 
     <lb/>roost. I think it came home to roost when they 
     <lb/>told us we could send a delegation to Canada. I 
     <lb/>have never thought we had the right to send 
     <lb/>delegations anywhere, more particularly when it 
     <lb/>comes to affiliating us politically with some out<lb break="no"/>side power. I want to refer you to the document 
     <lb/>of February 12, handed to the delegation which 
     <lb/>interviewed the Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>paragraph 4: "Upon the question raised in Clause 
     <lb/>1 of the Resolution respecting steps for estab<lb break="no"/>lishing economic or fiscal relationship between 
     <lb/>United States and Newfoundland, your Commit<lb break="no"/>tee was informed that this question was one be<lb break="no"/>tween Governments through the regular 
     <lb/>diplomatic channels." I think every man agrees 
 

            <cb/>
           
     that that is perfectly normal and correct. In going 
     <lb/>
     to Canada you cannot discuss terms of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion without bringing up these matters, or enter<lb break="no"/>ing into negotiations with Canada relative to 
     <lb/>
     economic matters. They say it is a matter between 
     <lb/>
     governments. We all agree with that. That is one 
     <lb/>
     of the bases on which I form my opinion that we 
     <lb/>
     never had any right sending any delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Canada with regard to political union, because 
     <lb/>
     political union must be tied up with economic 
     <lb/>
     discussions. Further, they say it was doubtful 
     <lb/>
     whether the subject matter of the clause came 
     <lb/>
     within the terms of reference. Even the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government had a doubt as to whether or 
     <lb/>
     not the matter of sending the delegation to the 
     <lb/>
     USA came within the terms of reference. The 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act, 1946, definitely describes the 
     <lb/>
     duties of the Convention.... I hold that the exports 
     <lb/>
     of this country are tied up with any recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion which any reasonable man in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion has to make in regard to forms of 
     <lb/>
     government. If we knew we could export so 
     <lb/>
     many tons of ore, or quintals of fish, to that or the 
     <lb/>
     other country, it would have a bearing on the form 
     <lb/>
     of government. We are to examine the position 
     <lb/>
     of the country — that is a broad statement. You 
     <lb/>
     cannot examine the position of the country if you 
     <lb/>
     do not examine its relations with outside 
     <lb/>
     countries. Now I am no longer on the horns of a 
     <lb/>
     dilemma. I support Mr. Penney's motion, at least 
     <lb/>
     it will afford the Commission of Government an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to make up their minds as to the 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I support Mr. Penney's motion and 
     <lb/>
     I want to say a word or two with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     future economy. When the delegation went to 
     <lb/>
     London, and when we brought up the matter of 
     <lb/>
     exports of fish and iron ore — which form the 
     <lb/>
     basis of our exports, and consequently have an 
     <lb/>
     effect on our economic position — we were told 
     <lb/>
     that Great Britain could not guarantee to buy any 
     <lb/>
     fish. They could not guarantee to buy any iron ore 
     <lb/>
     next year, or any year. They also told us, when 
     <lb/>
     we brought up the matter of the base deals, that 
     <lb/>
     they were not in a position to go to the US to 
     <lb/>
     make any deal regarding the taking of any fish in 
     <lb/>
     the future. If that is so, how can they expect us as 
     <lb/>
     a Convention to prepare an economic report on 
     <lb/>
     the future of this country? If, in the first place, 
     <lb/>
     they cannot guarantee to take any fish or iron ore, 
     <lb/>
     how can they expect us to prepare an economic

     report, when we know Great Britain is not in a 
     <lb/>
     position to buy iron ore or fresh fish?.... The point 
     <lb/>
     I am trying to make is this... that this matter comes 
     <lb/>
     within the scope of the Convention for the simple 
     <lb/>
     reason we are here to find out the economic 
     <lb/>
     position of the country. Great Britain tells us they 
     <lb/>
     cannot do anything with the US. The Dorninions 
     <lb/>
     Office tells us they are not going to try Why not 
     <lb/>
     let us try?.... The fish business is the livelihood 
     <lb/>
     of 50% of the people. Consequently, as a Con<lb break="no"/>vention, even if we have no power, it is our job, 
     <lb/>
     even if we have to drive it down the throat of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government and the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another matter, the sale of iron ore to 
     <lb/>
     the United States. We all know some of their 
     <lb/>
     mines are worked out. It will be five to ten years 
     <lb/>
     before Labrador produces. If Lake Superior is 
     <lb/>
     worked out, there are millions of tons here on Bell 
     <lb/>
     Island. That would be another trade agreement. 
     <lb/>
     No effort has been made by the Commission or 
     <lb/>
     the Dorninions Office to get trade agreements for 
     <lb/>
     us. When they gave the bases away, the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion and the Dominions Office forgot all about 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland.... They tell us we got some 
     <lb/>
     labour; we did, at restricted wages. They tell us 
     <lb/>
     it was to protect us. Do they expect us to swallow 
     <lb/>
     that? 300,000 people, and they are worried about 
     <lb/>
     us! The island of Newfoundland is a fortress for 
     <lb/>
     North America, and both the Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     American governments are interested in New<lb break="no"/>foundland for that reason. The Commission 
     <lb/>
     betrayed their trusteeship. I think it was brought 
     <lb/>
     up at a meeting with the Dominions Office, that 
     <lb/>
     they were trustees, and we were told that the 
     <lb/>
     bases were gone and that there was nothing they 
     <lb/>
     could do about it. I am going to support this 
     <lb/>
     motion whether it receives the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to compliment Mr. Reddy on his 
     <lb/>
     speech. Today all our newsprint goes into the 
     <lb/>
     United States.... We have to develop a fresh and 
     <lb/>
     frozen fish market in the United States if this 
     <lb/>
     country is going to live. We do not know whether 
     <lb/>
     we are going to sell a ton of iron ore to Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain orapound of fish. They tell us they cannot 
     <lb/>
     approach the United States. If they cannot do 
     <lb/>
     their job, then let them get out of here and let 
     <lb/>
     someone else do it....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> We have a very peculiar situation 
     <lb/>
     here. First we have your ruling; second we dig 


            <cb/>
         

     back and find we have information from the 
     <lb/>
     Commission that it was beyond our power to do 
     <lb/>
     this; third, we have information supplied by the 
     <lb/>
     delegation to London. We defy all that and go on 
     <lb/>
     trying to press something. I would press just as 
     <lb/>
     hard as anyone, if I found just the slightest chance 
     <lb/>
     of getting it through.... What is the sense? I have 
     <lb/>
     every respect for Mr. Penney and the effort he 
     <lb/>
     made. I agree entirely that the future of New<lb break="no"/>foundland lies with the United States, but I do not 
     <lb/>
     think we are going to get anywhere with this.... I 
     <lb/>
     am going to introduce an amendment to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Penney's motion. I move that the words 
     <lb/>
     beginning "for general trade..." be deleted, and 
     <lb/>
     the following substituted: "to secure information 
     <lb/>
     on matters affecting the future economy of New<lb break="no"/>foundland in its relationship to the United States

     of America."

     <lb/>
     against it. I will second it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> One is for general trade discus<lb break="no"/>sions, the other is to secure information on mat<lb break="no"/>ters affecting the future economy of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I cannot rule it out as being a 
     <lb/>
     repetition of the other. On the same grounds as I 
     <lb/>
     ruled out the original motion, I would have to rule 
     <lb/>
     out the amendment. I still think you are entirely 
     <lb/>
     wrong in your interpretation of the motion. I do 
     <lb/>
     not intend to rule out the amendment.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We do not want to look 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous: a "delegation of six or less" — it

     in it, and I believe we may get somewhere if we

     can get the delegation to go there. I think one of

     the troubles may be to get the request passed by

     I do not see how the deputation can be of use to

     the United States, which is the vital point. I have 
     <lb/>
     stressed it on a good many occasions. I don't see 
     <lb/>
     any reason for not endeavouring to get this inter<lb break="no"/>view, if you like to call it that, to find out whether 
     <lb/>
     it is possible to get formal discussions. I have 
     <lb/>
     heard people who have come back from the USA 
     <lb/>
     quite recently state that there is a feeling there in 
     <lb/>
     business circles that, in view of connections here, 
     <lb/>
     we are entitled to special consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to read if I have not lost it, an 
     <lb/>
     extract from a letter from a gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     been living in the USA for the last 15 or 20 years, 
     <lb/>
     and is connected with one of the universities. He 
     <lb/>
     stresses that the great difficulty in the USA is that 
     <lb/>
     we are not known there. The public has no con<lb break="no"/>ception of what Newfoundland was, what it is, 
     <lb/>
     and what it expects to be, so it is very difficult to 
     <lb/>
     get any public interest in this question.... As you 
     <lb/>
     know, I published a pamphlet which I circulated 
     <lb/>
     among the members of the Convention a long 
     <lb/>
     time ago, and I have had some communication 
     <lb/>
     about it from the United States, they have been 
     <lb/>
     favourably impressed, and I think something will 
     <lb/>
     come if we can discuss matters with them. We 
     <lb/>
     can do nothing by sitting here, we have to get 
     <lb/>
     there. Difficulties will be raised by the authorities 
     <lb/>
     here, I think. They will say it is not within our 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference, and they can't agree to it. It 
     <lb/>
     may be they will say, "Even if you pass this 
     <lb/>
     resolution, you will have to provide your own 
     <lb/>
     funds to go". In that case we might pass around 
     <lb/>
     the hat.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Over a month ago I introduced a 
     <lb/>
     resolution regarding a delegation to be sent to 
     <lb/>
     Washington. It received such a chilling recep<lb break="no"/>tion, and myself as well, that I am not properly 
     <lb/>
     thawed out yet. When I brought that resolution in 
     <lb/>
     here I had one thing in mind, and I still have it.... 
     <lb/>
     I had the concern of the working people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and I still have it. The people are 
     <lb/>
     looking for the wherewithal to live. I had that in 
     <lb/>
     mind when I brought in the resolution. I feel as I 
     <lb/>
     felt in the beginning, that I am a lone wolf in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. I came with preconceived ideas and 
     <lb/>
     I have them today, and I am going to hold them 
     <lb/>
     despite the political groups in this Convention. 1 
     <lb/>
     have not said a word for the past while because, 
     <lb/>
     as I said before, I was frozen.... I do not like the 
     <lb/>
     attitude of the Convention itself. When I entered 
     <lb/>
     this door I was not asking favours from anyone 


            <cb/>
      

     — no personality. If I have to tread on a man's 
     <lb/>
     toes, I will tread on them whether he like it or not. 
     <lb/>
     I am here to do all in my power for the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Personalities are outside the 
     <lb/>
     question as far as I am concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Regarding this resolution, I am going to back 
     <lb/>
     it up, as it is similar to my resolution. I see in this 
     <lb/>
     something of benefit, possibly we won't get 
     <lb/>
     anywhere but you have got to knock on the door 
     <lb/>
     before you get an answer. Scripture says, "Ask 
     <lb/>
     and ye shall receive". We are going to ask. With 
     <lb/>
     regards to my resolution, I want to say a few more 
     <lb/>
     words.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you will pardon me, we can't 
     <lb/>
     discuss your resolution now. We are discussing

     this resolution before the Chair, and you must

     confine your remarks to that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> All right, I'm wholeheartedly be<lb break="no"/>hind it, and I am going to support it. This resolu<lb break="no"/>tion is after all dealing with a foreign people, so 
     <lb/>
     we say. A foreign people — why? Why, outside 
     <lb/>
     this House we have a foreign flag. We have three 
     <lb/>
     flags in this country, and if we are not careful we 
     <lb/>
     will have the fourth flag, the red flag, and I will

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I have not spoken to the amend<lb break="no"/>ment. That amendment is going to tangle things

     up. They both mean the same thing, and it seems 
     <lb/>
     rather silly to divide on a motion and an amend<lb break="no"/>ment which mean the same thing, so I am going

     to vote for the motion and we can make any

     general trade discussions. We have been told that

     we can't deal in trade discussions, but we have 
     <lb/>
     not been told, and one thing they had better not 
     <lb/>
     tell us, is that we can't go and seek information.

     That's my point — it is seeking information

            </p>

            <p>
     Ever since the Convention opened, I have 
     <lb/>
     been approached by students and ex-students of 
     <lb/>
     the Memorial University College asking me to 
     <lb/>
     place before the Convention their wish that the 
     <lb/>
     status of the college be raised to that of a degree- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     conferring institution. I have not acceded to their 
     <lb/>
     request until the present time, because I wished 
     <lb/>
     to survey the position as carefully as possible, and 
     <lb/>
     to give some consideration to the grounds upon 
     <lb/>
     which such a claim is based. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think one can take it for granted that there is 
     <lb/>
     an increasing demand for university education. 
     <lb/>
     The number of students at the Memorial Univer<lb break="no"/>sity College this year is 432; of these, 181 are 
     <lb/>
     teachers in training; the remainder, 251 persons, 
     <lb/>
     is a body of students who can take the first two 
     <lb/>
     years of their university course there, and will 
     <lb/>
     then have to proceed elsewhere — if they can — 
     <lb/>
     to complete it. Many of you have read the 
     <lb/>
     numerous letters that have appeared in the daily 
     <lb/>
     papers from students who are bitterly disap<lb break="no"/>pointed that this September they must either ter<lb break="no"/>minate their university studies, or go to a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian or American university. Their appeal 
     <lb/>
     cannot remain unheeded. But I have come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that the need for a university is not 
     <lb/>
     based upon the claims of these students alone, but 
     <lb/>
     on a deeper, fundamental need. This country 
     <lb/>
     needs a university. A university acts as a natural 
     <lb/>
     co-ordinating centre of education, and at the 
     <lb/>
     present time the need for this is a basic one. There 
     <lb/>
     is no body of Newfoundlanders more sincere in 
     <lb/>
     their work or devoted to their profession, than the 
     <lb/>
     educationalists and teachers of this country, and 
     <lb/>
     they themselves are acutely conscious that the 
     <lb/>
     establishing of a university would polarise our 
     <lb/>
     educational aims. 
     <lb/>

     The heads of the different denominations — 
     <lb/>
     the Conference of the United Church and the 
   

            <cb/>
          

     Anglican Synod — have in their ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>
     legislatures passed formal resolutions in favour 
     <lb/>
     of a national university. His Grace the Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop, in an address delivered on the occasion 
     <lb/>
     of the presentation of the first Judge Higgins 
     <lb/>
     Memorial Scholarships on February 27, 1945, 
     <lb/>

     I am glad to know that the expansion and 
     <lb/>
     development of the Memorial University 
     <lb/>
     College to the status of a full-fledged New<lb break="no"/>foundland university is under the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of the educational authorities. This is a 
     <lb/>
     move that will commend itself to, and will 
     <lb/>
     have the approval of, all who have the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of the country at heart. But it would 
     <lb/>
     seem that there are one or two conditions 
     <lb/>
     indispensable to its success. In the first place 
     <lb/>
     it must be in personnel and equipment of such 
     <lb/>
     a standard that it will command the recogni<lb break="no"/>tion of outside universities, and secondly it 
     <lb/>
     must be a Newfoundland university in the 
     <lb/>
     fullest sense of the word, with a New<lb break="no"/>foundland atmosphere and background. To 
     <lb/>
     be a Newfoundland university its charter and 
     <lb/>
     constitutions should be such, after the model 
     <lb/>
     of many universities abroad, as to embrace 
     <lb/>
     within its scope and ambit those institutions 
     <lb/>
     in our midst which have their roots deep in 
     <lb/>
     the soil and the traditions of the country. Only 
     <lb/>
     in this way can it become a genuine New<lb break="no"/>foundland institution, which will have the 
     <lb/>
     co-operation and support of all sections in the 
     <lb/>
     country. In order that the advantages and 
     <lb/>
     benefits of such a university be accessible to 
     <lb/>
     all, the establishment of scholarships would 
     <lb/>
     appear to be necessary both by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and private philanthropy. We hope that 
     <lb/>
     as the years go on, and the new university 
     <lb/>
     develops to its full stature, many individual 
     <lb/>
     societies and other agencies amongst us will 
     <lb/>
     establish scholarships similar to those I have 
     <lb/>
     the privilege of presenting to these pupils 
     <lb/>
     today.

     Various local organisations have passed

     similar resolutions. Now in view of the numerous 
     <lb/>
     petitions to the government, it is difficult to see 
     <lb/>
     why it is that this university has not already been

     account of the cost involved. I am informed, that,

     in order to give the full four year course in arts 
     <lb/>
     and in teacher training, the addition of one or two 
     <lb/>
     professors and a small amount of extra equipment 
     <lb/>
     is practically all that is necessary. While the cost 
     <lb/>
     cannot be estimated, yet I understand that it might 
     <lb/>
     entail perhaps an extra $15,000 a year. As the 
     <lb/>
     vote to the college this year is say $50,000, surely 
     <lb/>
     $65-70,000 is a very reasonable sum to pay for 
     <lb/>
     the great advantages a university offers. At the 
     <lb/>
     present time it costs us $50,000 a year to give 
     <lb/>
     students a two years' course; surely the extra 
     <lb/>
     amount required is proportionately a very modest 
     <lb/>
     sum to pay for the great advantages that would 
     <lb/>
     accrue from the establishing of a university. In 
     <lb/>
     the nature of things, the first stages of growth of 
     <lb/>
     a university would not be extensive, and it is only 
     <lb/>
     sensible to assume that we can rely upon those in 
     <lb/>
     whom the responsibility of the direction of the 
     <lb/>
     university will vest, to shape the moulding of our 
     <lb/>
     national university with caution and circumspec<lb break="no"/>tion, and will have regard to the financial 
     <lb/>
     capacity of this country to pay, and the merits of 
     <lb/>
     the claims of the students of our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is true that we assist a certain number of 
     <lb/>
     students to go to Canada, but only to a small 
     <lb/>
     proportion of students is assistance granted. Con<lb break="no"/>sequently we have a large body of earnest stu<lb break="no"/>dents, whose educational and cultural 
     <lb/>
     development is a matter of great importance, 
     <lb/>
     frustrated at the most important time of their 
     <lb/>
     lives. This country may well expect a valuable 
     <lb/>
     return from the young people who avail of our 
     <lb/>
     educational facilities If we fail to grant these 
     <lb/>
     facilities, we may reasonably expect to pay for 
     <lb/>
     our short-sightedness. In fact, I myself view the 
     <lb/>
     existence of a large number of frustrated students 
     <lb/>
     with apprehension. We do not want a disgruntled 
     <lb/>
     semi-intelligensia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Memorial University College was 
     <lb/>
     founded in 1924. By great good luck the first 
     <lb/>
     President was an outstanding English 
     <lb/>
     educationalist, John Lewis Paton, who was a man 
     <lb/>
     not only of profound emdition but of extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary personality, and he has bequeathed to the 
     <lb/>
     college a valuable spirit and a fine tradition of 
     <lb/>
     academic thoroughness and high personal aims. 
     <lb/>
     This spirit has been developed through the last 
     <lb/>
     two decades, and a university college can no 
     <lb/>
     longer adequately foster the development of his 
     <lb/>
     vision and accomplishment. The college itself 
     <lb/>
     ranks high in the educational world and has won 


            <cb/>
        

     a unique reputation, not only in Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     American universities, but at Oxford as well. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>The academic work of a college is not today 
     <lb/>sufficient. The extension departments of univer<lb break="no"/>sities in other countries constitute an important 
     <lb/>element in education. They cater to the needs of 
     <lb/>those who wish to continue their education but 
     <lb/>do not desire to graduate from a university. An 
     <lb/>extension department would be particularly valu<lb break="no"/>able to this country — it is one of our most 
     <lb/>pressing needs — and only a university can direct 
     <lb/>it adequately. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have asked several educationalists whether 
     <lb/>
     or not they consider that education should begin 
     <lb/>
     at the bottom or at the top, whether money would 
     <lb/>
     not be spent more advantageously upon primary 
     <lb/>
     schools, but they have uniformly assured me that 
     <lb/>
     the idea that improvement starts at the bottom has 
     <lb/>
     been exploded everywhere, and that it is univer<lb break="no"/>sally recognised by educationalists that the good 
     <lb/>
     permeates downward. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have in this country a very definite char<lb break="no"/>acter of our own. One might call it the New<lb break="no"/>foundland character, and we have a culture of our 
     <lb/>
     own; but a culture needs a home, it needs enrich<lb break="no"/>ment and development; only a university can 
     <lb/>
     adequately provide the necessary stimulation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the last ten years there has been con<lb break="no"/>siderable government activity in science, agricul<lb break="no"/>ture and adult education, and I believe a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of valuable work has been accomplished; 
     <lb/>
     but how are these various activities to be co-or<lb break="no"/>dinated except through a university? Nothing 
     <lb/>
     would be more valuable to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country than an understanding of our economic 
     <lb/>
     and political problems. We must evolve our own 
     <lb/>
     way of life in this country, a way of life based on 
     <lb/>
     our national culture and our special traditions, 
     <lb/>
     and the solving ofour educational problem is the 
     <lb/>
     first essential. In the years that lie ahead these 
     <lb/>
     problems may demand an immense national ef<lb break="no"/>fort, an effort which can be made only by a people 
     <lb/>
     possessing a sound knowlege of the problems of 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I need not enlarge upon the cultural develop<lb break="no"/>ments that would inevitably flow from the estab<lb break="no"/>lishment of a university, the stimulus it would 
     <lb/>
     give to an, music, architecture and literature. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people are not devoid of talent, 
     <lb/>
     and a university would be the most practical way 
     <lb/>
     of giving these talents and interests a real chance

     of development.

            </p>

            <p>
     There are many who hold that this country has 
     <lb/>
     suffered grievously by being tied down to the 
     <lb/>
     system of education of other countries. They do 
     <lb/>
     not believe that any system, no matter how excel<lb break="no"/>lent in its own country, is really suited to our life 
     <lb/>
     and problems. It is their belief that we must 
     <lb/>
     evolve our own system of education completely 
     <lb/>
     independently of other countries, so that New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders may develop their own way of life 
     <lb/>
     with the enlightenment and enrichment that only 
     <lb/>
     a sound educational system can provide, and in 
     <lb/>
     my belief this system can only be developed from 
     <lb/>
     the establishing of a cultural focus, such as a 
     <lb/>
     university. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I now wish to move the following resolution: 
     <lb/>
     I move that the report of the Committee on 
     <lb/>
     Education be further considered.
