<!-- GL, 2017-06-23, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     1928 I found that they had not paid any royalties 
     <lb/>
     or profits taxes for a number of years. They are 
     <lb/>
     in financial difficulties today and if the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government foreclosed on them tomorrow they 
     <lb/>
     would be out of business. They owe the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government many millions of dollars. I am not 
     <lb/>
     defending the company, but it is bankrupt in a 
     <lb/>
     sense today. They are not making any money. 
     <lb/>
     The common stockholders in that company have 
     <lb/>
     not had a dividend for years. I forget what they 
     <lb/>
     owed the treasury — $2-300,000, They sent 
     <lb/>
     down representatives every spring looking for 
     <lb/>
     free export tax for the coming year, and the first 
     <lb/>
     year we were in office we objected, and finally 
     <lb/>
     made a deal whereby they paid 10 cents royalty 
     <lb/>
     up to one million tons and 3 cents up to 1.5 
     <lb/>
     million tons, and in addition they paid us 
     <lb/>
     $136,000 in settlement of back taxes. They paid 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 down and $12,000 each year till it was 
     <lb/>
     paid. The company has been struggling. In this 
     <lb/>
     report you will notice a letter signed by Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister Baldwin, wherein he indicated to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of that day that they were going 
     <lb/>
     to try to get some business for the Dominion Steel 
     <lb/>
     Company. They never got it. That 20,000 odd 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     tons was all. They made certain promises to us 
     <lb/>
     but they did not carry them out. That is the 
     <lb/>
     position. I am glad to see now that Bell Island is 
     <lb/>
     going along well, but it cannot go along unless 
     <lb/>
     you have a prosperous Corporation. They have to 
     <lb/>
     produce at least 1.5 million tons a year in order 
     <lb/>
     to make it prosperous. Up to a month before die 
     <lb/>
     war started the Germans were buying one million 
     <lb/>
     tons a year. Great Britain bought none, Sydney 
     <lb/>
     from 6-700,000 tons, and if she continues to use 
     <lb/>
     that amount and Great Britain takes 750,000 tons 
     <lb/>
     it will be fine.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am glad Bell Island is going well, and I am 
     <lb/>
     glad Mr. Jackman is making such a good thing of 
     <lb/>
     the union on Bell Island. I hope Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     continues to take ore from us instead of going 
     <lb/>
     back to Sweden. If she can take 750,000 tons of 
     <lb/>
     ore a year to mix with that high grade ore which 
     <lb/>
     will suit the furnaces, it would be a great thing. 
     <lb/>
     One of their greatest excuses was that the docks 
     <lb/>
     could not take the big ships for ore, but suddenly 
     <lb/>
     all this changes, therefore they were kidding us 
     <lb/>
     in the past.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, when we ad<lb break="no"/>journed yesterday afternoon the section on Bell 
     <lb/>
     Island had been read and there had been some 
     <lb/>
     discussion on it. I don't know if the discussion 
     <lb/>
     was completed or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Has the Committee any figures 
     <lb/>
     on the 1946 production of ore at Bell Island? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The Committee have only the 
     <lb/>figures in the report. I don't know if Mr. Jackman 
     <lb/>can give us any further information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> The production for this year will 
     <lb/>
     be about the same as last year — roughly around 
     <lb/>
     1.5 million tons.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I mentioned this because 
     <lb/>
     yesterday the figure of $4 per ton was mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     and I see from the I945 figures that the same 
     <lb/>
     value for export was about $2.50 per ton. I was 
     <lb/>
     wondering if that $150 increase was brought 
     <lb/>
     about by the Canadian market paying a higher 
     <lb/>
     price than the English market, and if the English 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     market is prepared to pay a higher price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> These are Major Cashin's figures, 
     <lb/>
     not mine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> There is quite a difference be<lb break="no"/>tween $2.50 and $4, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I quite realise that, but they are not 
     <lb/>
     the Committee's figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I was wondering if it was a 
     <lb/>
     matter of price, or if it is just quantity.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Possibly Major Cashin could ex<lb break="no"/>plain it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Those figures were given over two 
     <lb/>
     years. If my memory serves me correctly the 
     <lb/>
     amount exported in l945 would be much higher 
     <lb/>
     than in 1946 because the miners have since got 
     <lb/>
     an increase in pay and that would drive up the 
     <lb/>
     cost. The officials on Bell Island told me that the 
     <lb/>
     payroll would be approximately $4 million a 
     <lb/>
     year.

     tion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> The Sydney market is subsidised 
     <lb/>
     by the Dominion government, and only gives us 
     <lb/>
     three days a week with two mines operating. The 
     <lb/>
     company told us they were losing money on that. 
     <lb/>
     We won't dispute that, but what we are looking 
     <lb/>
     for is full time operation for everybody — not 
     <lb/>
     working two slopes, three days a week, but four 
     <lb/>
     slopes. six days a week. The only way we can get 
     <lb/>
     it is by having something to absorb our output. 
     <lb/>
     We have it today in England. She will take our 
     <lb/>
     output if we can keep within the price.... It is a 
     <lb/>
     question of keen competition. The Spaniards, 
     <lb/>
     Africans and all the rest are competing in the 
     <lb/>
     British market, and our management said. 
     <lb/>
     "Here is the position: we can break into the 
     <lb/>
     English market for 750,000 tons of ore, but to do 
     <lb/>
     so everybody must co-operate", and we did 
     <lb/>
     decide that we were going to go all out to hold 
     <lb/>
     that market.... The point I want to bring out is this: 
     <lb/>
     ... I say forget taxation and give all our people 
     <lb/>
     work, and let all the ore we can get be exported 
     <lb/>
     to England — let it go there, and our payroll will 
     <lb/>
     be around $4 million. Our payroll would not be 
     <lb/>
     $1 million if we got too tough with the company 
     <lb/>
     insofar as government and labour are concerned. 
     <lb/>
     I don't care what anyone says in this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     my argument is that we are today encouraging 
     <lb/>
     capital to work on Bell Island, to maintain 
     <lb/>
     employment for all of us, and we are not going to 
     <lb/>
     tax them out of it. I do not see how anybody, when 
     <lb/>
     they know the full terms of it, could say that the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Coal and Steel Co. are getting away 
     <lb/>
     with anything. They are not. We are putting more 
     <lb/>
     money into the hands of the people and less 
     <lb/>
     money into the hands of the government. As I 
     <lb/>
     said yesterday, the less money the government 
     <lb/>
     has to spend the better for all of us. Purchasing 
     <lb/>
     power is what we want in this country, less 
     <lb/>
     government, more work for the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> What I am concerned about is 
     <lb/>
     the value of this ore that goes out of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and that's what I am trying to find out. 
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In order to spare Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>further worry on that, I think you will find that 
     <lb/>the value here is the export value, which I believe 
     <lb/>had been agreed upon between the Bell Island 
     <lb/>company and the government. The price of ore 
     <lb/>apparently fluctuates considerably, and, as I un<lb break="no"/>derstand it, there was some sort of agreement in 


            <cb/>
         

     order to get a reasonable amount, and the export 
     <lb/>
     value was fixed at $2.55 per ton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That's the point I was driving 
     <lb/>
     at, and I don't see why the government or the 
     <lb/>
     Customs or anybody else should put in nominal 
     <lb/>
     prices for export. If this ore is worth so much in 
     <lb/>
     England or Canada, let the people know what it 
     <lb/>
     is worth. I know the export price of fish has gone 
     <lb/>
     up, and every exporter has to put down the value, 
     <lb/>
     and why should not these companies? Any firm 
     <lb/>
     that's sending out exports, why don't they put in 
     <lb/>
     the current domestic value, no matter whether it 
     <lb/>
     is up or down? In 1939-40, according to the 
     <lb/>
     number of tons exported and the value, it is about 
     <lb/>
     $2.50 per ton, and that's what I am driving at.... 
     <lb/>
     A person trying to assess the assets and resources 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland will find that these are not 
     <lb/>
     correct values, and we, as people wanting to find 
     <lb/>
     out the value of Newfoundland, want to get die 
     <lb/>
     thing as correct as we can. Therefore we ought to 
     <lb/>
     have what this ore is worth in Canada and also in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, so that we will know what these 
     <lb/>
     companies are getting for it. Until we know what 
     <lb/>
     they are getting for their ore, how can we say 
     <lb/>
     whether they are paying their proper price or not?

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> They won't receive too much 
     <lb/>
     as far as I am concerned, for mining.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I certainly agree with Mr. Ash<lb break="no"/>bourne. I can see his point— whatis the working 
     <lb/>
     man getting out of it? That is what we had to 
     <lb/>
     consider on Bell Island, ... and here are the facts 
     <lb/>
     in regards to our position: we have an output, as 
     <lb/>
     far as Sydney is concerned, of 750,000 tons of 
     <lb/>
     ore, which gives us about two days work a week. 
     <lb/>
     It has been brought out in the board of arbitration 
     <lb/>
     and there is no question about it, that the Sydney 
     <lb/>
     steel plant is losing money and has been sub<lb break="no"/>sidised by the federal government of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     it still is. I notice by today's paper that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is not subsidising the coal mines any longer, 
     <lb/>
     but they are subsidising the steel plant. We recog<lb break="no"/>nise that we are up against a hard proposition, but 
     <lb/>
     we have an opportunity to get into the British 
     <lb/>
     market, and we know just exactly what we are up 
     <lb/>
     against. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am a labour man, but I am standing on my 
     <lb/>
     feet to defend capital in Bell Island for doing a 
     <lb/>
     darn good job. The taxation may seem easy but 
     <lb/>
     we, the workers, get the benefit. The less money 
     <lb/>
     they pay the government the more we get. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I would like to move that this 
     <lb/>
     section do pass as read, but I would like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     chairman if he could get the values Mr. Ash<lb break="no"/>bourne asked for. I would like, as Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>
     has said, to have the actual fob. values of the ore 
     <lb/>
     exported, not the nominal one set by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. After all, you can hardly arrive at the value 
     <lb/>
     of the exports and imports if you have not got the 
     <lb/>
     true values. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I will try to get it by Monday. 
     <lb/>
     
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There are one or two points I 
     <lb/>would like to have cleared up. When you are 
     <lb/>finding out whether there is some arrangement 
     <lb/>between the government and the company under 
     <lb/>which only some nominal value is placed on the 
     <lb/>exports of the ore, if you find out that that is the 
     <lb/>case, will you also find out what is the real value? 
     <lb/>It is unbelievable that the government of the 
     <lb/>country should connive with a corporation to put 
     <lb/>a falsified value on the exports of that company. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't believe that is so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is unbelievable, but I would 
     <lb/>
     like to know the actual value of the exports from 
     <lb/>
     Bell Island. Major Cashin here yesterday told us 
     <lb/>
     that the company which owns the Bell Island 
     <lb/>
     mines has not been paying dividends for a num<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
          

     ber of years, and that they are in a bad way. I am 
     <lb/>
     not in a position to deny that. I am inclined to 
     <lb/>
     think it is true. I see by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Financial Post</hi> in 
     <lb/>
     recent issues that American capital is talking of 
     <lb/>
     buying out the company. The point I want to 
     <lb/>
     make is this: we must be very much on our guard, 
     <lb/>
     in spite of Mr. Jackman's eloquent and sincere 
     <lb/>
     defence of the miners and the management, as a 
     <lb/>
     country and a Convention, when we are thinking 
     <lb/>
     about Bell Island and the company that owns it. 
     <lb/>
     The record of the relations between that com<lb break="no"/>pany, or those companies (they have been from 
     <lb/>
     time to time under various names) and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland, the history of 
     <lb/>
     those relationships is not such as to make us feel 
     <lb/>
     any too ready to accept any statement made in the 
     <lb/>
     matter. For 30 years now it has been a long 
     <lb/>
     drawnout filthy story. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I would like Mr. Smallwood to 
     <lb/>
     say what he thinks is a filthy story about Bell 
     <lb/>
     Island. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood is in order,

     Mr. Jackman. Sit down, please.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't want Mr. lackman for 
     <lb/>
     one moment to suppose that I have in my mind 
     <lb/>
     or heart one evil thought about the miners of Bell 
     <lb/>
     Island — not one. But the history of the relation<lb break="no"/>ships for 20 or 30 years between the Bell Island 
     <lb/>
     company or companies and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has been a filthy story that would 
     <lb/>
     disgrace any country. Some of it came out in 
     <lb/>
     public and we know it. We know of election 
     <lb/>
     campaigns financed out of money from these 
     <lb/>
     companies. It is a filthy story and I don't want to 
     <lb/>
     see it repeated. I think we have a perfect right, as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders, and as a National Convention, 
     <lb/>
     to be very suspicious about any fair and plausible 
     <lb/>
     story about that company losing money. I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to believe it, but I am also remembering 
     <lb/>
     that this is a company with two countries, one 
     <lb/>
     being Canada and the other Newfoundland. It has 
     <lb/>
     three activities — mining ore, and smelting ore....

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am far from finished. I have 
     <lb/>
     heard of this kind of thing happening.... I would 
     <lb/>
     like to have an auditor look and explain to me, 
     <lb/>
     how far, if at all, one part of a company operation 
     <lb/>
     is milked and sucked dry for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     another part of the same company's operation. 
     <lb/>
     Let's say that company is losing money. But they 
     <lb/>
     may be making money in Bell Island, and sinking

     it in their steel mills, and milking Bell Island dry. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe that company in Cape Breton has kept 
     <lb/>
     going for years by the money made in Bell Island, 
     <lb/>
     in which case the Government of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would be defrauded. I am not saying it is so, but 
     <lb/>
     I am suspicious. Maybe Newfoundland is getting 
     <lb/>
     the rotten end of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is a new contract coming up in 1949. 
     <lb/>
     When the last contract came up, I remember the 
     <lb/>
     company approached the Monroe<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> government 
     <lb/>
     to pass this new contract. The government did not 
     <lb/>
     like it, they were ashamed of it. What did they 
     <lb/>
     do? They sent over to the Wabana Mineworkers' 
     <lb/>
     Union and asked them to send over a delegation 
     <lb/>
     so that the government could explain the 
     <lb/>
     proposed contract to them. The delegation came 
     <lb/>
     and met the government, and the proposed agree<lb break="no"/>ment was read out and there was a dead silence 
     <lb/>
     when they finished. The government then said 
     <lb/>
     that if the mineworkers of Bell Island were satis<lb break="no"/>fied with the agreement, the government might 
     <lb/>
     feel justified in bringing it before the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly and getting itpassed, but if the workers 
     <lb/>
     were not satisfied then they would not bring it 
     <lb/>
     before the House. That was in 1927, I think, or 
     <lb/>
     1926. I don't think any agreement was signed, at 
     <lb/>
     least it was not passed, and it rode on without any 
     <lb/>
     agreement until 1929, when this present agree<lb break="no"/>ment was brought in — 10 cents a ton up to a 
     <lb/>
    million and 3 cents a ton for the next half million 
     <lb/>tons, and after that nothing at all. That expires in 
     <lb/>1949.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I rise to a point of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is no point of order. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood is speaking. You will have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to rebut Mr. Smallwood later if you 
     <lb/>
     wish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> So far the government is get<lb break="no"/>ting royalties or an export tax from them, and the 
     <lb/>
     most they can get is $115,000 a year. No matter 
     <lb/>
     what they export or produce, no matter what 
     <lb/>
     profit they make or don't make, the most they can 
     <lb/>
     get is $115,000.... Mr. Jackman and the people in 
     <lb/>
     Bell Island and his union must remember that 
     <lb/>
     they are Newfoundlanders — that Bell Island is 
     <lb/>
     not a separate country, but is part of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. They don't need me to remind them 
     <lb/>
     that when the company falls down on the job, as 
     <lb/>
     they have done, it is not the company that has kept 
     <lb/>
     them, but the government and that's why the 


            <cb/>
          

     government is interested in the amount of taxes 
     <lb/>
     that they get. I hope that this thing will be cleared 
     <lb/>
     up, and that this company in cape Breton, which 
     <lb/>
     Operates also in Bell Island, will be reorganised. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe they are top-heavy, or inefficient, I don't 
     <lb/>
     know. Maybe they can't get markets, but 
     <lb/>
     whatever is wrong I hope it will be cleaned up. 
     <lb/>
     We have resources in Bell Island that God gave 
     <lb/>
     us, and it is up to this country and the government 
     <lb/>
     to get out of those resources the most that can be 
     <lb/>
     got out. It is up to this Convention to figure the 
     <lb/>
     possibilities that lie in that direction. I am not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the taxation we are getting out of 
     <lb/>
     Bell Island. I would rather see that corporation 
     <lb/>
     pay it — if it can be done without hurting the 
     <lb/>
     miners — than the fishermen and the loggers and 
     <lb/>
     the labourers. The whole policy of the country 
     <lb/>
     and the government is to defend these corpora<lb break="no"/>tions. We have been down and out so long, that 
     <lb/>
     if we get a bit of labour we bless them and let 
     <lb/>
     them off from the payment of taxes, but we tax 
     <lb/>
     our own people and the fishery, and they are 
     <lb/>
     maybe playing us for suckers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I sit down there is one point I want to 
     <lb/>
     ask Mr. Higgins. On page 11, the breakdown of 
     <lb/>
     employees' earnings for 1946; 1,182 men, most<lb break="no"/>ly casual labour, earned less than $1 ,000, and 509 
     <lb/>
     regular employees earned from $1,000 to $1,500, 
     <lb/>
     etc., a total of 2,807 men. Actually there were not 
     <lb/>
     that many employed, were there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> There were a certain number of 
     <lb/>
     floaters, if you can call it that. They come in for 
     <lb/>
     a period and then they leave and there are others 
     <lb/>
     taken on. In other words, to have something like 
     <lb/>
     800 working men constantly employed you really 
     <lb/>
     have to employ about 1,200 during the year. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is that it? Is it that there is such 
     <lb/>a turnover of labour? Is it that, or is it because in 
     <lb/>the peak season they have to take on additional 
     <lb/>men? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Possibly I could explain that, I 
     <lb/>
     am sure Mr. Smallwood would like to get the 
     <lb/>
     explanation. Here is the position: we mine ore in 
     <lb/>
     wintertime and stockpile. That means that we 
     <lb/>
     have a certain number of men who service the 
     <lb/>
     ships during the shipping season, and that starts 
     <lb/>
     around the middle of April, and continues from 
     <lb/>
     then till December. While we are taking this ore 
     <lb/>
     in stockpiles off the surface, we have around 300 
     <lb/>
     seasonal workers. At the end of the year that's

     finished, but our mining force amounts to 1,400 
     <lb/>
     men. These are permanent, steady workers. That 
     <lb/>
     will explain the fluctuation. These are seasonal 
     <lb/>
     workers, who only take the ore from the stock<lb break="no"/>piles and ship it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Thanks very much. I am not 
     <lb/>
     sure that I still understand it. On page 8, staff and 
     <lb/>
     mining employees for 1945, total 1,427; and for 
     <lb/>
     the years 1934 to 1945 the peak totals for the 
     <lb/>
     years were given, which averages 1,575 men. 
     <lb/>
     That's peak for the year, but in 1946 it is 2,800 
     <lb/>
     men. You see? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Obviously that's the peak per<lb break="no"/>manently employed on page 8. Yes, that's peak 
     <lb/>
     permanent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Was there any hour in 1946 
     <lb/>
     when the company at Bell Island was employing 
     <lb/>
     2,800 men? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't think so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> That's an error. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> One final point, and it is this, 
     <lb/>
     on page 12: "The Gander area was leased to the 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company ... 50 
     <lb/>
     years." Does that mean Crown land on which 
     <lb/>
     they were given outright grants for 50 years? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Do they pay anything for that? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> They have to pay rental. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> $2 a year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> As you know they are not operat<lb break="no"/>ing that themselves at all. They are getting their 
     <lb/>
     timber entirely apart from these leased areas and 
     <lb/>
     we... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Should that be allowed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why not? It gives more employ<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What about the way in which 
     <lb/>
     the country's timber is being denuded? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> One part is leased, and is not being 
     <lb/>
     used by them at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The country has reached the 
     <lb/>
     point where the timber should be conserved. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> In looking over the next section of 
     <lb/>the report I notice the committee... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Fogwill, will you please let 
     <lb/>
     us finish this question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Well it is relevant to this question. 
     <lb/>
     There is a difference of 3.45 cents.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think I might be able to clear that. 
     <lb/>
     The Labrador ore is a higher grade, about 60 - 
     <lb/>
     65%, while that of Bell Island is about 50 - 52%. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     The price of ore is based on 50% iron, and for any 
     <lb/>
     units over 50% iron they get 10 cents a unit. If the 
     <lb/>
     ore averages 50% iron for $5 a ton, another 20 
     <lb/>
     units would make it $6.50. I take it that that 
     <lb/>
     Labrador ore is based on that. The value of the 
     <lb/>
     ore on Labrador would be $6 a ton because it is 
     <lb/>
     a higher grade ore. The ore on Bell Island is not 
     <lb/>
     more than 52%. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The cost of smelting is very much 
     <lb/>
     cheaper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Would that make a difference of 
     <lb/>
     $3.50 per ton? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The figures may not be accurate, 
     <lb/>
     but the reason for the present deal with the 
     <lb/>
     government was on that basis. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Without holding up the motion at all 
     <lb/>
     it has been stated that on the basis of the produc<lb break="no"/>tion of one million tons, which was last year's 
     <lb/>
     figure, we could not seem to reconcile the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the company would be paying out this year 
     <lb/>
     $4 million in wages, when it was stated that the 
     <lb/>
     export value of the ore was $2.55. The facts are 
     <lb/>
     that they contemplated exporting to Sydney 
     <lb/>
     750,000 tons and to the United Kingdom from 
     <lb/>
     750,000 to 1 million tons. That is anywhere from 
     <lb/>
     1.5 million tons up. If you take it and multiply it 
     <lb/>
     by $2.55 you will get $3.8 million, they will be 
     <lb/>
     in the position to be able to pay out $4 million to 
     <lb/>
     the workers. I would remind the chairman of our 
     <lb/>
     last interview with Mr. Anson, there was some 
     <lb/>
     mention made of the fact that they would be 
     <lb/>
     losing a considerable amount owing to adverse 
     <lb/>
     conditions of the exchange on ore going to the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom. I think Mr. Anson covered that 
     <lb/>
     ground in our last interview.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I thought that was fairly well 
     <lb/>
     cleared up until we get specific information on it. 
     <lb/>
     I was on Bell Island for five years. They don't 
     <lb/>
     take out the ore and weigh it on scales; they take 
     <lb/>
     it out and put it in the ship until she has enough. 
     <lb/>
     It is never weighed. When the government got 
     <lb/>
     after the company to find out the export value, 
     <lb/>
     they agreed on a set export value to be placed on 
     <lb/>
     the ore so that they would come pretty near the 
     <lb/>
     export value of the ore. That is the explanation I 
     <lb/>
     am sure, but we could see if that's right or not for 
     <lb/>
     Monday. As to whether we can get the actual 
     <lb/>
     money credited to the company for the ore ex<lb break="no"/>ported, that remains in the hands of the company 
     <lb/>
     on Bell Island. We cannot force them to give it to 
     <lb/>
     us, but we will try to get it. 
     <lb/>

<p>
     I don't think it is proper or right for any man 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention, with a microphone six inches 
     <lb/>
     away from his nose, to be continually getting up 
     <lb/>
     and damning anybody in this country. Whether 
     <lb/>
     they have done wrong in the past or not, that's not 
     <lb/>
     our job. Our job is to get the facts and present 
     <lb/>
     them to the people. The idea of these 
     <lb/>
     microphones is not so that a man can get up and 
     <lb/>
     display himself as a patriot to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I do not agree that any man has a right 
     <lb/>
     to commandeer a microphone which is by his 
     <lb/>
     nose day after day, and give no other man a 
     <lb/>
     chance to speak. I say that with due respect to all 
     <lb/>
     the men who have the microphones near them. I 
     <lb/>
     do not intend to tolerate this. The thing has to be 
     <lb/>
     properly regulated or else the microphones will 
     <lb/>
     have to be taken away. No man should be able to 
     <lb/>
     get up and monopolise the air for three quarters 
     <lb/>
     of the time this Convention is sitting, and set 
     <lb/>
     himself up as a champion of the cause of the 
     <lb/>
     common man. I do not intend to stand this any 
     <lb/>
     longer, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having said that, we will go on to page 11, the 
     <lb/>
     point raised by Mr. Smallwood where he said 
     <lb/>
     there were 2,800 men or something. Any man 
     <lb/>
     who has any knowledge of mining knows that it 
     <lb/>
     is a pretty heavy job, and the men can't stay down 
     <lb/>
     in the mines day after day for 363 days in the year, 
     <lb/>
     and there is considerable absenteeism. Some of 
     <lb/>
     the men do not work more than three quarters of 
     <lb/>
     the workable days of the year. That's the explana<lb break="no"/>tion. You will find that in every mine in the world. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> About the weighing of the ore, 
     <lb/>I don't know how the compnay pays their men if 
     <lb/>it is not weighed. Is it by so much per ton? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> They pay them so much per day. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> At any rate it's got to be sent 
     <lb/>out by ships, and I presume it is sent out at a 
     <lb/>certain freight rate, which is so much per ton. I 
     <lb/>presume the ships can only carry so much, and 
     <lb/>they should know approximately the tons. That is 
     <lb/>one way of checking up on the weight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I would like to ask the convenor of 
     <lb/>
     the Mining Committee a question. How long do 
     <lb/>
     you figure it will take this Convention to reach 
     <lb/>
     Labrador if we travel along via St. Lawrence and 
     <lb/>
     the Rambler and the intermediate stations? That 
     <lb/>
     is if we are as long as we are at Bell Island? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We will probably need a diamond 
     <lb/>drill! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I hope that having got that off 
  

            <cb/>
         

     his chest Mr. Hollett feels happier, but I want 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett to know this — Lhat I am a hard man 
     <lb/>
     to scare and a hard man to talk down, and, within 
     <lb/>
     the rules of this House and this Convention, I will 
     <lb/>
     talk as often as I like, whether he likes it or not, 
     <lb/>
     microphones or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I was going to add a paragraph 
     <lb/>
     from the minutes we took at our meeting with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Anson that probably would explain a lot of 
     <lb/>
     the talk we have had: "On the ore we sold to the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom this year we finally came to a 
     <lb/>
     price agreement with them in March (1946). That 
     <lb/>
     price agreement was negotiated on the basis of 
     <lb/>
     what they wanted to buy for, and what we wanted 
     <lb/>
     to get. Eventually we got this figure, their last 
     <lb/>
     offer. We had to make estimates of what it would 
     <lb/>
     cost us to produce on that basis, which meant 
     <lb/>
     putting all mines into full operation and making 
     <lb/>
     our estimates based on production of prewar 
     <lb/>
     days. We thought we could ship for what they 
     <lb/>
     offered and make a few cents. Unfortunately it 
     <lb/>
     did not turn out this way. On all the ore we are 
     <lb/>
     shipping this year to England I expect to show a 
     <lb/>
     loss of 30 cents per ton. You cannot run a business 
     <lb/>
     that way. Their price is always negotiated in 
     <lb/>
     sterling. We have to convert into dollars. If 
     <lb/>
     England next year will buy the ore at the same 
     <lb/>
     price she paid us this year, due to the drop in 
     <lb/>
     sterling, and between that and the loss this year, 
     <lb/>
     we have got 60 or 70 tons to make up. We have 
     <lb/>
     got to sell the ore and break even. If somebody 
     <lb/>
     can tell us the answer to that one I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know it." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I give you that to think about when you are 
     <lb/>
     speaking of the big profits Wabana is supposed 
     <lb/>
     to be making. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> A short time ago I was reading an 
     <lb/>
     article on ore, etc., and the question of Wabana 
     <lb/>
     came up, and also the question of steel. It said that 
     <lb/>
     because of the low content of the ore from 
     <lb/>
     Wabana, the steel works in Sydney were up 
     <lb/>
     against it; also that the ore in Labrador was of a 
     <lb/>
     higher grade, a superior ore, and it looks like in 
     <lb/>
     the next few years when the Labrador mines 
     <lb/>
     come into effect that the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Canada would make a change, and in that case it 
     <lb/>
     would give the low grade ore of Bell Island a 
     <lb/>
     chance. I think they have been having it pretty 
     <lb/>
     tough as far as I can find out... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Before we move on I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask this question. We have touched on the

     matter of living conditions above ground (in the 
     <lb/>
     Buchans report they speak of the conditions the 
     <lb/>
     men work under), I was just wondering if they 
     <lb/>
     had gone into the matter of the underground 
     <lb/>
     working conditions. I don't see any reference to 
     <lb/>
     that. I don't know if you went down yourselves. 
     <lb/>
    
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The members of the Committee 
     <lb/>were underground, Mr. Harrington, and, the 
     <lb/>members of the Committee are not miners, but it 
     <lb/>did appear to our inexperienced eyes to be all 
     <lb/>right. We heard no complaints. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Did you hear anything about

     this silicosis that's supposed to affect miners?

 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Bearing on that, who carries 
     <lb/>out the Mines Regulations Act now? In the old 
     <lb/>days we used to get some member of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion wanting to know how many men had been 
     <lb/>injured or killed in the mines, and who had hand<lb break="no"/>led it, and what compensation had been paid. In

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I understand there is not a per<lb break="no"/>manent mine inspector, but there is a New<lb break="no"/>foundlander who is employed in Canada who

     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> In answer to Mr. Harrington's ques<lb break="no"/>tion, the members of the Mining Committee did 
     <lb/>
     go in all sections of the mine that they could 
     <lb/>
     possibly get into. I did not miss any opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to get to the lower depths, and I was pleasantly 
     <lb/>
     impressed by the conditions I found in every one 
     <lb/>
     of the cuts; and well out under Conception Bay 
     <lb/>
     you will find that there is a barn where horses are 
     <lb/>
     kept, which is much cleaner and much better than 
     <lb/>
     many human beings' houses in the city of 
     <lb/>
     St. John's. I have seen some of the places and I 
     <lb/>
     found the men quite satisfied. I was particularly 
     <lb/>
     interested in that phase of it because I am chair<lb break="no"/>man of the Health and Welfare sub-committee, 
     <lb/>
     and I missed no opportunity, as our chairman can 
     <lb/>
     testify, and I have yet to hear a single complaint 
     <lb/>
     of the working conditions. There were com<lb break="no"/>plaints of the high cost of living, but not of the 
     <lb/>
     conditions under which they work.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, we have a slight 
     <lb/>
     correction in the bottom of the report. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Thomas advises me today by telegram that 
     <lb/>
     the area leased from the AND Co. is 30 miles 
     <lb/>
     radius from center of shaft: "We pay running 
     <lb/>
     rates to AND Co. on 14 mile section of railroad 
     <lb/>
     from Millertown Junction to Buchans Junction. 
     <lb/>
     We own 22 mile section of railroad Buchans 
     <lb/>
     Junction to Millertown Junction." We hope you 
     <lb/>
     will remember that and make any necessary cor<lb break="no"/>rections yourself. With respect to the question 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Fogwill put concerning the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     report, I have since asked the government 
     <lb/>
     geologist the position with respect to that $6 
     <lb/>
     figure we quoted in our Labrador report, and we 
     <lb/>
     were informed that that figure is that quoted by 
     <lb/>
     the Lake Superior Iron Ore Producers Associa<lb break="no"/>tion. That would be the association of all iron ore 
     <lb/>
     producers in the Lake Superior district. That is 
     <lb/>
     the f.o.b. value of Lake Superior ores of 51% 
     <lb/>
     iron, the iron ore being laid down at Lake Supe<lb break="no"/>rior ports. Mr. Howse informs us that you have 
     <lb/>
     to figure into that $6 price the moisture, silica, 
     <lb/>
     manganese and phosphoms, there is a deduction 
     <lb/>
     made forthese. As you will rememberthe sulphur 
     <lb/>
     and phosphorus content of the Bell Island ore is 
     <lb/>
     quite high in comparison with the Lake Superior 
     <lb/>
     ore, and that would mean that off that $6 you 
     <lb/>
     would have to take all those deductions. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howse did not have the time to give me all 
     <lb/>
     that, but his opinion was that $2.55 is a very fair 
     <lb/>
     price. That is the figure we submitted in our 
     <lb/>
     report. Now Mr. Chairman shall we go on to 
     <lb/>
     fluorspar, St. Lawrence?

            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> In that interview quoted from 
     <lb/>Mr. Poynter, perhaps you can explain it, but it 
     <lb/>strikes me that with the relatively small produc<lb break="no"/>tion in St. Lawrence of 9,000 tons shipped to the 
     <lb/>USA in 1945 — of course the total production 
     <lb/>was 18,000 tons, but they have a 40% additional 
     <lb/>cost of supplies over and above their American 
     <lb/>competitors — how can they compete? Do they 
     <lb/>get any subsidy, or is there quite a profit in the 
     <lb/>production? They must be operating under such 
     <lb/>terrific handicaps that it must be quite a paying 
     <lb/>proposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Poynter says that they are 
     <lb/>
     operating under a handicap, they have no subsidy 
     <lb/>
     of any kind, and their labour prices are the same 
     <lb/>
     as the prices of their competitors, and they have 
     <lb/>
     that big difference of duty and the 40% increase 
     <lb/>
     on the supplies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Well, if they are paying the same

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I think that power cost was 
     <lb/>
     eliminated. The power company distributed for 
     <lb/>
     the mining companies in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     whereas in the States and Canada they buy the 
     <lb/>
     power and the company distributes.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> I notice in other reports it gave 
     <lb/>
     the rate of wages paid the workmen. Does the

     chairman of the Committee have any idea of the 
     <lb/>
     wage rates there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> We intended to put in a section on 
     <lb/>
     that, but did not have the facts at that time. We 
     <lb/>
     now have some correspondence which gives us 
     <lb/>
     some information on it. They pay the regular 
     <lb/>
     hourly rates from 52 cents to 80 cents per hour....

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Thank you. That would make

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Does that include a cost of living 
     <lb/>
     bonus which may be taken off as the cost of living 
 

            <cb/>
          

     goes down, or is it the basic rate?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> There is nothing mentioned as

     regards a cost of living bonus.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> St. Lawrence is highly unionised, 
     <lb/>
     and I imagine they would have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I might say in the report there is a 
     <lb/>
     reference to how well they are satisfied with their 
     <lb/>
     men.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That 52 cents is common labour? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Yes, that is common labour, and that 
     <lb/>is basic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> In fairness to the company it should 
     <lb/>
     be pointed out that they allow the men to come 
     <lb/>
     on deck in company time and dry their clothing 
     <lb/>
     and have their lunches. The St. Lawrence mines 
     <lb/>
     are very wet, and it adds greatly to the cost of 
     <lb/>
     production. They are given the hour with pay. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Still, a man working under 
     <lb/>those conditions should get more than 52 cents 
     <lb/>an hour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Apparently that's all they can af<lb break="no"/>ford to pay up there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> The wages would be about $700 a 
     <lb/>
     year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is it true that the people up in 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence just about made that development 
     <lb/>
     possible by their own working? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Definitely. The picture given us 
     <lb/>
     was that in the early part of that operation there 
     <lb/>
     was no money, the people running it now got 
     <lb/>
     practically no money, and the merchants of the 
     <lb/>
     place carried the production for quite a time. It 
     <lb/>
     was really co-operation of the very best kind. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, going further than that, Mr. Poynter said that 
     <lb/>
     he believed that there were a lot of other places 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland of a similar nature to 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence — no mineral of a quantity that 
     <lb/>
     would be of interest to a big corporation, but 
     <lb/>
     which might very well be worked by a corpora<lb break="no"/>tion such as theirs, people who would be willing 
     <lb/>
     to go in and work on a shoe-string, and eventually 
     <lb/>
     get up to where they can make it pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> My reason for raising that 
     <lb/>
     point is that the report says that the average wage 
     <lb/>
     paid in the mining industry proves it the most 
     <lb/>
     highly paid industry in the country. Now I took 
     <lb/>
     objection to that. Bell Island again — 58 cents an 
     <lb/>
     hour, and even adding on the 7 cents that they get, 
     <lb/>
     which gives them 65 cents, and they work 10 
     <lb/>
     hours a day. Now other industries have a basic 
     <lb/>
     rate for a nine hour day, with time and a half for

     the tenth hour. I think that's injustice to other 
     <lb/>
     industries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's the information we have 
     <lb/>
     and we can only pass along what we get.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> On page 4 you say: "We find that our 
     <lb/>
     labour is the equivalent of the mining labour of 
     <lb/>
     United States or Canada." Do you mean that they 
     <lb/>
     pay the same wages? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Did you understand that,

     Mr. Burry?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I thought he meant that they were 
     <lb/>
     perfectly satisfied with the work done for the 
     <lb/>
     money paid. Mr. Poynter gave me to understand 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundlanders were about the best 
     <lb/>
     workers in the world. Their production bonus 
     <lb/>
     enables them to step up their wages from 33 to 
     <lb/>
     52%, which ought to be considered in their 
     <lb/>
     favour.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> On the first page where you 
     <lb/>
     state the uses of fluorspar, as a flux for open- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     hearth steel, etc., I understood that one of the uses 
     <lb/>
     of this fluorspar is for certain war equipment. I 
     <lb/>
     was told it was used for goggles. I was wondering 
     <lb/>
     if that had anything to do with the increase in 
     <lb/>
     production and the drop in production, around 
     <lb/>
     1943 it is only 12,900 tons, and in 1944 it is up 
     <lb/>
     to 21,000, and then again when the war was over 
     <lb/>
     it dropped to 18,000.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You mean not so many goggles 
     <lb/>
     were sold?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Well, not only goggles; I 
     <lb/>
     thought that was only one of the items. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> No, I think it was because they 
     <lb/>
     could not meet competitive prices. They are 
     <lb/>
     sending fluorspar in from Mexico much cheaper 
     <lb/>
     than we can produce it here. Even with that long 
     <lb/>
     haul from Mexico they still seem to be able to sell 
     <lb/>
     much cheaper. I presume it is the labour price that 
     <lb/>
     makes the difference.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> That's the way I understood it. In 
     <lb/>
     1946 they did not export anything to the United 
     <lb/>
     States because they could not meet the price.

     and down to $48 in 1946. How does that jibe?

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We can't give you any more infor<lb break="no"/>mation. The two men gave us the information and 
     <lb/>we gave it to you. You can take your choice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> I don't see anything here as to 
     <lb/>the actual value in dollars and cents of this 
     <lb/>fluorspar exported from the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't think we have it, Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>Donald. We got whatever information we could, 
     <lb/>
     and what information we have is in front of you 
     <lb/>
     now. That's all we could get. The Mining Com<lb break="no"/>mittee did not visit St. Lawrence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I understand the reason for that was 
     <lb/>
     that the roads were in such a condition. Inciden<lb break="no"/>tally we asked Mr. Poynter about the road condi<lb break="no"/>tion, and he said it would be a grand thing if they 
     <lb/>
     could get to Burin. So far, after all these years, 
     <lb/>
     they have no road there. While I am on this 
     <lb/>
     subject of the connection of the roads between 
     <lb/>
     Burin and St. Lawrence. I have made some in<lb break="no"/>quiries relative to the condition of the roads on 
     <lb/>
     the Burin Peninsula, and l have been informed 
     <lb/>
     that fish costs about $1 per quintal more because 
     <lb/>
     of the condition of the roads. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> The exports of fluorspar in 1943- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     44, there was a total of 66,000 tons, valued at 
     <lb/>
     $1,360,000. That works out at about $20 per ton 
     <lb/>
     for export value. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     returns.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think it is pretty correct. 1 may say 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the figures that we did have the 
     <lb/>
     figures of export and the value, but the corpor<lb break="no"/>ation told us they would much prefer that we 
     <lb/>
     show them to the Convention but not make them 
     <lb/>
     public. It would be of very great detriment to their 
     <lb/>
     future trade. They have competitors outside the 
     <lb/>
     country, and if they got those figures it would not 
     <lb/>
     do their business any good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I just want to say that there seems to 
     <lb/>
     be a little conflict here. When first the mine began 
     <lb/>
     the going was very hard, and it was only real 
     <lb/>
     co-operation between labour and capital in 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence that brought those mines to this 
     <lb/>
     place in our economic structure today. I certainly 
     <lb/>
     believe, Mr. Hollett, that the road between Burin 
     <lb/>
     and St. Lawrence should be constructed immedi<lb break="no"/>ately, as it is very essential to the working of the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence mines.

     April 14, 1947 
     <lb/>

     Report of the Mining Committee:¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would suggest that to summarise<lb/>the paragraph on copper read on Saturday that the<lb/>table marked Table l, at the end of the section on<lb/>copper be read. That will summarise the report...<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>[The committee briefly discussed the sections on 
     <lb/>copper, gold, lead, asbestos, chrome, salt, 
     <lb/>petroleum, pyrophyllite, limestone, barite, nick<lb break="no"/>el, mica, and marble. The Secretary read the 
     <lb/>section on cement.] 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> When the report of the Local<lb/>Industries Committee was brought in here, that<lb/>report quoted a special memorandum prepared<lb/>for the Committee by the Industrial Development<lb/>Board, and I was particularly struck at the time<lb/>by the reference to cement. The Industrial<lb/>Development Board pointed out what a great pity<lb/>it was that the two main ingredients necessary to<lb/>make cement were separated from each other by<lb/>roughly the width of the country. One was on the<lb/>eastern side of the country, and the other on the<lb/>western. The cost of bringing the two together<lb/>was what caused it to be dropped. Now the Min<lb break="no"/>ing Committee brings a different light on the<lb/>matter. I remember after the remarks I made<lb/>when the Local Industries Report was being<lb/>debated I ran into the Mayor of St. John's, who<lb/>was very enthusiastic about the matter. He told<lb/>me that the St. John's Municipal Council uses<lb/>50,000 bags a year.... That's only one case. If you<lb/>could get cement in this country at reasonable<lb/>price there would be thousands of people using it<lb/>for foundations of their homes and for the erec<lb break="no"/>tion of buildings of all kinds, with remarkable<lb/>progress in construction and industry. This is<lb/>evidently one of the most important sections of<lb/>this report. It absolutely contradicts the report of<lb/>the Industrial Development Board.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>According to this, in the Port-au-Port area<lb/>there are very extensive deposits of gypsum,<lb/>limestone, and silica clay. These are the articles<lb/>necessary for the manufacture of cement. They<lb/>are all within a radius of two miles. The only thing<lb/>
            </p>

    

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>is, you have to import coal to create the heat for<lb/>dehydrating it, or else use hydro-electric power,<lb/>and we understand there is sufficient power in<lb/>that vicinity for this industry. I wonder if<lb/>Mr. Higgins could tell us if anyone is interested,<lb/>and if there is any move on foot to start a cement<lb/>industry, and could he throw a little light on this:<lb/>"The main question is, of course, whether or not<lb/>cement could be produced at a cost comparable<lb/>to the cost of the imported article." What is meant<lb/>by that? What would be the cost? There would be<lb/>the cost of mining and bringing them together to<lb/>the point of the hydro-electric development, etc.,<lb/>all which, surely, should not cost any more,<lb/>speaking generally, than anywhere else. Labour<lb/>is certainly no better paid in this country than in<lb/>Canada, generally speaking, and certainly no bet<lb break="no"/>ter than in the States. You can develop hydro<lb break="no"/>electric energy in this country as cheaply as<lb/>anywhere. What are the prospects of making<lb/>cement? Is there anything doing?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't know if I can enlighten you<lb/>more than I have on this matter. The last sentence<lb/>would be the cost of the finished product, that is<lb/>the selling price compared to the finished article.<lb/>With respect to our contradiction of the Local<lb/>Industries Report, we are satisfied that the infor<lb break="no"/>mation we have given you is correct as far as our<lb/>information goes....<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Why not develop cement out<lb/>there on a worldwide scale? Why not develop it<lb/>for export all over the world? In terms of that kind<lb/>we have to think. I have been watching, looking<lb/>for possibilities of using up our own raw mater<lb break="no"/>ials. I know cement is used all over the world.<lb/>When Mr. Higgins, Major Cashin and I form a<lb/>government, we must see what we can do with<lb/>that.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I think Mr. Smallwood answered his<lb/>own question. There is too big a cement plant in<lb/>Canada and the United States for us to have one.<lb/>
