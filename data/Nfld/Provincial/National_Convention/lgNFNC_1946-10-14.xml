<!--<p>
     Mr. Job I move that this report be adopted. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. MacDonald Does it mean that these re- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Commendations will be carried out? If it does, I 
     <lb/>hope that we are going to deal with the United 
     <lb/>States on reduction of tariffs, they will also con<lb break="no"/>sider other industries, such as paper, etc. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Pulp and paper have free entry into 
     <lb/>
     the United States. The Americans do not manu<lb break="no"/>facture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett What is meant by "adopting the 
     <lb/>
     report". There are several points to be brought up. 
     <lb/>
     If we adopt the report, what follows? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The Convention resolved itself 
     <lb/>
     into a committee of the whole to consider the 
     <lb/>
     report. Before that happened the report had to be 
     <lb/>
     read. Now the duty of the committee is to con<lb break="no"/>sider the report and having considered it, to rise 
     <lb/>
     and recommend that it be adopted by the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. After the committee rises that will be done. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hillier I move that we adjourn the debate 
     <lb/>until Monday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman There is a motion before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair that the report be adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Job I do not want to press mat if the Con<lb break="no"/>vention thinks it should be further debated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman There is a motion before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair that we rise and resume at 8 o'clock. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Before I can vote for the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of this report, I want to know why requests are 
     <lb/>
     made for action to be taken to get tariff conces<lb break="no"/>sions from the United States? I want to know 
     <lb/>
     why. Is it that the fresh fish industry cannot carry 
     <lb/>
     on longer at the present rates? If that is so, I would 
     <lb/>
     say adopt the report. But surely it must have some 
     <lb/>
     facts and figures to show that the fresh fish in<lb break="no"/>dustry is in danger of extinction by reason of 
     <lb/>
     tariffs placed on it by the United States. They 
     <lb/>
     must bring figures to show that. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     Canada, who has hitherto blocked our efforts, is 
     <lb/>
     anxious to help, the United States is anxious to 
     <lb/>
     help, other countries are anxious to help, but 
     <lb/>
     these things have to be debated before I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to adopt this report. I am not in favour 
     <lb/>
     of the motion to adopt the report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     Mr. Chairman Gentlemen, I feel sure that I 
     <lb/>
     echo your thoughts when I say how pleased we 
     <lb/>
     are to have Mr. K.M. Brown back again and we 
     <lb/>
     hope his condition has improved, permanently 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     so; and that Mr. Fudge is back with us again. I 
     <lb/>
     have to report that Mr. Figary will not be able to 
     <lb/>
     attend....

     Mr. Job I have been acting chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Committee during the absence of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown. He has now returned, and as there have 
     <lb/>
     been various comment on this report, I move that 
     <lb/>
     it be referred back to the Fisheries Committee for 
     <lb/>
     further consideration. I ask therefore that the 
     <lb/>
     committee rise.

            <p>Mr. Chairman This completes the orders of the 
     <lb/>day. I have to inform you that Mr. Hollett and Mr. 
     <lb/>Newell on behalf of the Education Committee 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     informed me this afternoon that the work of the 
     <lb/>
     committee is completed and that presently its 
     <lb/>
     report will be printed and placed before the Steer<lb break="no"/>ing Committee, and will come with the least 
     <lb/>
     possible delay before the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Is there any other matter you wish to discuss? 
     <lb/>
     If not, I will accept a motion to adjourn until such 
     <lb/>
     time as the Steering Committee is in a position to 
     <lb/>
     tell us when we may meet.
