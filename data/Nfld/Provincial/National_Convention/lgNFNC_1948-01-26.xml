     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Eventually we have been successful 
     <lb/>
     in eliciting from the Canadian government after 
     <lb/>
     a period of over three weeks a reply in connection 
     <lb/>
     to my questions on the Newfoundland Savings 
     <lb/>
     Bank. Again I will read the question: 
     <lb/>
     
 </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>1. I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask 
     <lb/>the Commissioner for Finance and/or the 
     <lb/>Commission of Government that, in the 
     <lb/>event of Newfoundland's becoming a pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Canada, what would happen to the 
     <lb/>deposits now laying in the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Savings Bank?  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. Would the Newfoundland Savings Bank 
     <lb/>continue as at present and would the 
     <lb/>depositors continue to receive the same rate 
     <lb/>of interest on their deposits as they now 
     <lb/>receive? 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>The Canadian government in their generosity 
     <lb/>sees fit to send us the following reply: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>1. Monies on deposit in the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Savings Bank at the time of union would 
     <lb/>remain the property of the depositor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. While Parliament has legislative jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion over banks and banking, inclusive of 
     <lb/>savings banks, there is no federal statute pur<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>
        

     porting to affect provincial government 
     <lb/>
     savingsinstitutions and the Province of On<lb break="no"/>tario has for a great many years operated a 
     <lb/>
     savings bank similar to that of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     without any interference by the federal 
     <lb/>
     authorities. 
     <lb/>
    </p></quote>


            <p>That is not a reply to my question. My question 
     <lb/>was, "Would the Newfoundland Savings Bank 
     <lb/>continue as at present and would the depositors 
     <lb/>receive the same rate of interest as they receive 
     <lb/>now?" Therefore that question is not answered 
     <lb/>yet, and this Convention is drawing to a close. I 
     <lb/>can put only one construction on it — they are 
     <lb/>net going to receive the same rate of interest. I 
     <lb/>know they will say the Province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will have to look after it, but will the 
     <lb/>depositors receive 2.7% interest which they are 
     <lb/>receiving today? There has been no reply. And 
     <lb/>there is not a statement that it will continue, even. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Yes, sir. I was going to say when

     interrupted, that I never expected to live long

     enough to see a bunch of Newfoundlanders trying 
     <lb/>
     to barter away their country under such a bare<lb break="no"/>faced pretence...

     <lb/>
     stages with a long-winded address, no more than 
     <lb/>
     I have done heretofore. Rather, I prefer to let it 
     <lb/>
     die in peace. There are, however, a few remarks 
     <lb/>
     I would like to make in regard to forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the confederation issue in particular, 
     <lb/>
     and in doing so I will confine myself chiefly to 
     <lb/>
     an aspect of the confederation proposition that to 
     <lb/>
     my way of thinking at any rate, has not been 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently stressed, and is one of the key points 
     <lb/>
     to the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First of all, however, may I take you back to 
     <lb/>
     October and November 1946, when the con<lb break="no"/>federation issue was first raised through a motion 
     <lb/>
     suddenly thrust upon this assembly to send a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Ottawa to seek terms of union. That 
 

            <pb n="1363" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1363.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1363</fw>
        

     was at a time when we had not gotten anywhere 
     <lb/>
     in our studies of our own country's affairs, but 
     <lb/>
     which up to that time we were all endeavouring 
     <lb/>
     to do, calmly and dispassionately. So it seems 
     <lb/>
     clear now, if it was not then, that there was 
     <lb/>
     something behind that move that certainly was 
     <lb/>
     not helpful to this Convention, because it 
     <lb/>
     definitely split us into two groups, and the gap 
     <lb/>
     created then has opened wider and wider through 
     <lb/>
     continuous confederation propaganda, until we 
     <lb/>
     find ourselves today lined up in two opposing 
     <lb/>
     sides awaiting a final decision. In pointing to the 
     <lb/>
     reason and cause why this Convention has not 
     <lb/>
     been able to perform the duties assigned it sooner 
     <lb/>
     can be definitely attributed to confederation 
     <lb/>
     propaganda, no matter what may be said to the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, I have come to believe that there was a 
     <lb/>
     planned scheme to try and sell out our country to 
     <lb/>
     Canada from the very beginning. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. "Planned 
     <lb/>
     scheme to sell out the country to Canada from the 
     <lb/>
     beginning." Every time this man gets off that kind 
     <lb/>
     of insulting remark, I am getting on my feet. I am 
     <lb/>
     a member of this Convention. I was elected here. 
     <lb/>
     I have the rights of a member. These rights say I 
     <lb/>
     shall not be insulted by a member's imputing 
     <lb/>
     dishonest motives to me, even by a man such as 
     <lb/>
     this man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am cognisant of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     you are a member of this Convention. I am com<lb break="no"/>pelled to rule that you are not permitted to use 
     <lb/>
     language that is calculated to impute dishonesty, 
     <lb/>
     and which is offensive in character, to any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the house. I have to rule that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's  point is well taken and I have to rule 
     <lb/>
     you out of order, Mr. Penney. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Could I be permitted to use the 
     <lb/>
     word "barter"? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not think you ought to use 
     <lb/>
     language to impute dishonest motives. You may 
     <lb/>
     disagree with his motives or his politics, but I do 
     <lb/>
     not think you are entitled to impute he is 
     <lb/>
     dishonest in his beliefs simply because of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that you do not agree with his beliefs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I was trying to follow down the 
     <lb/>
     history of confederation and to show it was a 
     <lb/>
     planned move in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Please do so, but do not impute 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty to any member of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> The one thing I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     is that when a motion was moved that we send a 


            <cb/>
    

     delegation to Washington, we were turned down 
     <lb/>
     flatly. Having opposed the first attempt (I was 
     <lb/>
     home with the flu when the second attempt was 
     <lb/>
     made) to force confederation over and above all 
     <lb/>
     else on this Convention, I feel it my duty to say I 
     <lb/>
     am opposed to all attempts to make terms with 
     <lb/>
     Canada at this time, until at any rate the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland have been given a fair chance 
     <lb/>
     to elect their own government and initiate trade 
     <lb/>
     talks with Washington, in the belief that no true- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     blooded Newfoundlander would dare consent to 
     <lb/>
     barter away — is that all right, Mr. Chairman? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, that is all right in that sense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Before making absolutely sure that 
     <lb/>the price is the very best obtainable and nothing 
     <lb/>less than the best, if and when we should be 
     <lb/>obliged to sell at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The so-called terms as contained in the Black 
     <lb/>
     and Grey Books are most certainly not the best 
     <lb/>
     obtainable for Newfoundland, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     the persistent and sustained efforts of the con<lb break="no"/>federate-in-chief and his supporters to try and 
     <lb/>
     make you believe otherwise. The pros and cons 
     <lb/>
     of these so-called terms have been debated since 
     <lb/>
     November 1947, so that now all are wise to their 
     <lb/>
     implications. The able addresses of delegates 
     <lb/>
     Job, Higgins, Cashin, Crosbie, Harrington, Butt, 
     <lb/>
     Fudge, Hollett, Reddy, Hickman, Cranford and 
     <lb/>
     others, have shown clearly what is involved in 
     <lb/>
     this proposition, while one could, I was going to 
     <lb/>
     say, smell the scent of senators' seats in some of 
     <lb/>
     the supporters of this scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. Is this man per<lb break="no"/>mitted under your guidance and under your con<lb break="no"/>trol to make these remarks, and then having made 
     <lb/>
     them, force me to a point of order after they are 
     <lb/>
     made? Is he going to defy your ruling? You have 
     <lb/>
     ordered that he is not to impute dishonesty. Now 
     <lb/>
     he has made the remark imputing dishonesty, that 
     <lb/>
     we who are advocating confederation are doing 
     <lb/>
     it for senatorships. Is that honest on his part? Is it 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary? Have I got to stand for it? Have 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ashbourne and Mr. Burry to stand for it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Never mind Mr. Ashbourne or 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Burry. You take your seat. I am compelled to 
     <lb/>
     remind you of the provisions of standing order 
     <lb/>
     21, "No member may use offensive or unbecom<lb break="no"/>ing words." This is the third time I have had to 
     <lb/>
     remind you. You are not to use any more offen<lb break="no"/>sive language. If you do I will definitely have to 
     <lb/>
     rule you out of order, and I will not be prepared

     to permit you to proceed with your address. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I would like to say that you are the 
     <lb/>
     only person, as Chairman of this Convention, that 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid of in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not like my job here 
     <lb/>
     anymore than perhaps you like the way I am 
     <lb/>
     doing my job. If I am appealed to, I have to 
     <lb/>
     enforce order as best I can. I do not think you are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to use unbecoming language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I accept your ruling. I do not intend 
     <lb/>
     to use any personal remarks, nor do I think I have 
     <lb/>
     done so, to this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Certain gentlemen are well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     known to be ardent confederates by this time — 
     <lb/>
     that is an inescapable conclusion. I do not want 
     <lb/>
     it to be misconstrued that you are speaking under 
     <lb/>
     my guidance. I have not seen your address. I can 
     <lb/>
     only deal with the points as they are delivered. 
     <lb/>
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Since I cannot convey the meaning 
     <lb/>I intended to convey, I will have to do the best I 
     <lb/>can. Now that we have reached the crossroads, 
     <lb/>surely it is a time when self-respect alone should 
     <lb/>compel us to stand firm. It is your country and 
     <lb/>mine, where in the outports every man and 
     <lb/>woman is comparatively free from special taxes; 
     <lb/>where we can obtain our living from land and sea 
     <lb/>unhampered by periodic calls from tax collectors. 
     <lb/>Why then give up your life-long freedom because 
     <lb/>champions of confederation ask you to do so? 
     <lb/>When you must feel in your heart and soul there 
     <lb/>is something behind the move? I dare not do 
     <lb/>anything or say anything to knowingly harm our 
     <lb/>future prospects, for posterity will eventually 
     <lb/>determine whether we are right or wrong. Believ<lb break="no"/>ing this, I cannot be a party to selling out our 
     <lb/>country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. That is once he 
     <lb/>
     has offended since you gave your ruling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I rise to a point of order. Mr. Penney 
     <lb/>
     stated he cannot tolerate the selling out of our 
     <lb/>
     country. What is this? We are making a deal; they 
     <lb/>
     are taking over our national debt, consequently 
     <lb/>
     we are handing them over something for some<lb break="no"/>thing. Therefore it is a sellout. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will deal with the point. I see 
     <lb/>
     nothing wrong with the word "sale" when it is 
     <lb/>
     employed in this sense. After all, if we go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, it is a contract of sale and there is 
     <lb/>
     no stigma to be attached to the sense in which you 
     <lb/>
     have employed the word "sale".... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Do I understand you right, there is 
  

            <cb/>
         

     no objection to the word "selling"? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you want to describe it that 
     <lb/>way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> It is, in effect, to me a sale and the 
     <lb/>
     price is those terms we have been discussing. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are at perfect liberty to 
     <lb/>refer to it as such. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Thank you. I have some words here 
     <lb/>
     you may not permit me to use — I had better not 
     <lb/>
     use them. I want to tell this Convention to act 
     <lb/>
     warily. Elect your own government first and 
     <lb/>
     foremost, controlled by the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, and represented by a body of selected New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, so that you may control the keys. 
     <lb/>
     Good men and true with adequate control of our 
     <lb/>
     treasury. The form of government we now have 
     <lb/>
     — am I allowed to refer to that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Not at this stage. You had better 
     <lb/>
     confine yourself to the form contained in the 
     <lb/>
     motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I will end it up this way. There are 
     <lb/>
     four days to go before this Convention dies, and 
     <lb/>
     I have no regret about that whatsoever. But I will 
     <lb/>
     not likely have another chance to talk to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention as a body, so I want to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks concerning the history of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, in closing. Now that our term of service here 
     <lb/>
     is approaching its end, for which I have no regret 
     <lb/>
     because it has lasted many months longer than it 
     <lb/>
     should have, and has been swerved from its path 
     <lb/>
     of duty because of the projection of controversial 
     <lb/>
     political questions in the early stages of our 
     <lb/>
     studies of Newfoundland affairs. This, however, 
     <lb/>
     is past history. Now as we come to the end of our 
     <lb/>
     service here ... may I say in closing that it was a 
     <lb/>
     great privilege to meet and know the delegates of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, most of whom I had not met or 
     <lb/>
     known before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The sad side of this get-together was almost at 
     <lb/>
     the very beginning of our Convention sessions 
     <lb/>
     when our revered and respected Chairman, in the 
     <lb/>
     person of the late Judge Fox, was claimed by 
     <lb/>
     death. The suddenness of his passing shocked us 
     <lb/>
     all, for we knew we had lost a Chairman of 
     <lb/>
     outstanding fitness for the tasks ahead, an 
     <lb/>
     eminent judge, whose guiding hand and sound 
     <lb/>
     judgement was recognised in the loyalty and 
     <lb/>
     respect of all delegates. May his soul rest in peace 
     <lb/>
     as his revered memory lives on. Then, too, this 
     <lb/>
     Convention lost another outstanding public 
     <lb/>
     leaderin the person of Mr. K. M. Brown who was 
 

            <pb n="1365" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1365.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1365</fw>
           

     taken suddenly ill while addressing this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and who has not recovered sufficiently to 
     <lb/>
     return to his service here. No member of this 
     <lb/>
     assembly can truly estimate what this Convention 
     <lb/>
     has suffered in this way, for we all know Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown had much experience in the public life of 
     <lb/>
     his country, was and is a father of the fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     a man of great leadership and ability. May I send 
     <lb/>
     him our greetings and best wishes for an early 
     <lb/>
     recovery, so that he may be able to participate in 
     <lb/>
     the testing days for this country ahead. To all 
     <lb/>
     delegates (I almost want to say friend and foe 
     <lb/>
     alike), may I wish good health, good luck in your 
     <lb/>
     service for the future generations of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. To our Chairman also who, I believe, holds 
     <lb/>
     the respect and goodwill of all, may I wish better 
     <lb/>
     health as soon as freed from honourable service 
     <lb/>
     here. You have, sir, in my opinion, served faith<lb break="no"/>fully and well under difficult testing conditions 
     <lb/>
     during heated debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I go on record as opposed to the confederation 
     <lb/>
    scheme to barter Newfoundland to Canada at this 
     <lb/>time, believing our future safely lies in the elec<lb break="no"/>tion of our own government as a first step on a 
     <lb/>plan suggested by Mr. Hickman, and for a better 
     <lb/>deal for Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> When last I rose, I rose to support a 
     <lb/>previous motion which had been brought to this 
     <lb/>house, with the understanding that these two 
     <lb/>political set-ups which were then introduced 
     <lb/>would be placed before the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland; because I was fully convinced that the 
     <lb/>people wished that to be so. They do wish it in 
     <lb/>the district which I happen to represent. They 
     <lb/>wish to have these political set-ups which I rose 
     <lb/>to support under those conditions at that time, 
     <lb/>placed before them. I again rise to support a 
     <lb/>motion. This time it is the motion which is at 
     <lb/>present before the Chair...

     felt that I was not called upon to do so. I had made 
     <lb/>
     up my mind that I wanted to see the whole pic<lb break="no"/>ture. I wanted to weigh matters thoroughly. I 
     <lb/>
     realise to the full that any political view which I 
     <lb/>
     might have might not be shared by all those I 
     <lb/>
     represent, and they could very properly say to me 
     <lb/>
     that they did not send me here to champion any 
     <lb/>
     particular form of government. We are going to 
     <lb/>
     decide that when that day comes. We came here 
     <lb/>
     to inquire into the general position of New<lb break="no"/>
  

            <cb/>

foundland, to find out all the facts possible, and 
     <lb/>
     to place these facts before the people in plain, 
     <lb/>
     simple language, as a means whereby they could 
     <lb/>
     be assisted when the day comes for making a 
     <lb/>
     grave decision. We came here to consider forms 
     <lb/>
     of government, and we were supposed to inquire 
     <lb/>
     as to the possibilities for Newfoundland under 
     <lb/>
     these respective political set-ups, and pass it on 
     <lb/>
     to the people. The people were to make the final 
     <lb/>
     decision, and any help we could give them, it was 
     <lb/>
     our bounden duty to give it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is quite possible in this world of ours to think 
     <lb/>
     independently. We live and move and have our 
     <lb/>
     being, as it were, in a certain political atmos<lb break="no"/>phere, and because we live in that political atmos<lb break="no"/>phere it is quite possible that we are going to be 
     <lb/>
     influenced thereby, and not at all times think and 
     <lb/>
     act completely independently. The influential 
     <lb/>
     powers around us will often take us out of the 
     <lb/>
     track into which we at first started. It is my 
     <lb/>
     personal feeling that this is one time in our history 
     <lb/>
     when we should think independently; for the 
     <lb/>
     question before us today is one which will con<lb break="no"/>cern us individually, and we should think inde<lb break="no"/>pendently after weighing the whole situation 
     <lb/>
     from every angle, and, having decided that we are 
     <lb/>
     on the right track, then it is an honourable thing 
     <lb/>
     for us to carry on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As we look out upon world conditions, and as 
     <lb/>
     we consider Newfoundland's general position, 
     <lb/>
     we consider the lack of industries in this country, 
     <lb/>
     and the irregular earnings of a large number of 
     <lb/>
     our people, that no one year compares with the 
     <lb/>
     other, that there is no section of our country in 
     <lb/>
     which in some year there is not a failure from a 
     <lb/>
     fishery point of view. I understand that three- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     quarters of our people are fishermen. Having 
     <lb/>
     therefore in mind this one burning question and 
     <lb/>
     looking back on this Convention and what we 
     <lb/>
     have learned, and weighing matters in general in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — there is this burning question: 
     <lb/>
     for what shall I vote in the national referendum? 
     <lb/>
     And it is a reasonable question. It is a question 
     <lb/>
     which I ask myself, and I know of lots that are 
     <lb/>
     asking the same question... I am fully aware ... 
     <lb/>
     that whatever form of government New<lb break="no"/>foundland may have in the future, our path will 
     <lb/>
     not be strewn with roses. There is the possible 
     <lb/>
     aftermath of war. What shape it will take I know 
     <lb/>
     not, but history usually repeats itself. We had a 
     <lb/>
     great depression after the last war, and it is pos<lb break="no"/>

     sible that we may have another, I do not know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To me, sir, it is a very serious question. I don't 
     <lb/>
     know if any person thinks the same as I do, but it 
     <lb/>
     is a question which has been tormenting me con<lb break="no"/>siderably ever since the first day I stepped into 
     <lb/>
     this assembly, and it will be a serious thing until 
     <lb/>
     the time comes and I go from this assembly and 
     <lb/>
     look about on the whole scene and weigh the 
     <lb/>
     matter from every angle, and then finally make a 
     <lb/>
     decision. When that decision is reached I shall 
     <lb/>
     vote as I then think, conscientiously, rightly or 
     <lb/>
     wrongly, to be in the interest and general welfare 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems to me, sir, with my little knowledge 
     <lb/>
     of public affairs in Newfoundland — I own I have 
     <lb/>
     not the experience which some of my good 
     <lb/>
     friends have in business and politics; I admit my 
     <lb/>
     shortcomings in that respect. I have never before 
     <lb/>
     come out in public or spoken in public, and this 
     <lb/>
     has been my first time speaking in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and it is an honour which I shall never forget, 
     <lb/>
     and it is something which I shall take with me to 
     <lb/>
     the end of my days. But I feel, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     — and I believe there are others who feel the 
     <lb/>
     same — whether now or in two or five years time 
     <lb/>
     I do not know, the people have to say, but I feel, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that Newfoundland will at some time or other 
     <lb/>
     be obliged to unite with some larger power for 
     <lb/>
     her general welfare and progress, and as I think 
     <lb/>
     of that I ask myself this question — I do not make 
     <lb/>
     a definite statement, but I ask myself this question 
     <lb/>
     — would it not be as well to do that now? I say 
     <lb/>
     we probably might do worse than unite with the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question, I realise to the full, rests with the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. I must be one of the 
     <lb/>
     many, as I remarked just now, not one of prelimi<lb break="no"/>nary experience, not one who has been connected 
     <lb/>
     with public life in this country as some here, or 
     <lb/>
     greatly associated with the business life of this 
     <lb/>
     country as many gentlemen on the other side. The 
     <lb/>
     question rests with the people, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This, Mr. Chairman, will be my last time 
     <lb/>
     appearing in public. It will be the last opportunity 
     <lb/>
     I shall have of standing in this assembly, but I 
     <lb/>
     have this to say, that I shall take back with me 
     <lb/>
     happy memories of association with fellow 
     <lb/>
     delegates from all over Newfoundland. It has 
     <lb/>
     been a great privilege and a great pleasure to meet 
     <lb/>
     these men, because I have from them gathered 
     <lb/>
     much valuable information. I have gathered 
 

            <cb/>
     

     something of what life is like in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     as a whole. I have been able to draw comparisons, 
     <lb/>
     and I find there is a great similarity all around 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. To all my listeners, sir, I say a 
     <lb/>
     cheery good luck, and good luck to Newfoundland! 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, I want to make a few 
     <lb/>remarks. They will only take a few, perhaps five 
     <lb/>or six minutes. I feel that I am one of the juniors 
     <lb/>here, that have not to speak too long, while the 
     <lb/>bigwig on my right, and the two bigwigs on my 
     <lb/>left will have a good deal to say, I expect. But I 
     <lb/>want to deal with this motion before the Chair. I 
     <lb/>am not at all opposed to giving our people the 
     <lb/>opportunity of expressing their views in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the well-considered plan for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with the great Dominion of Canada, and I 
     <lb/>want to make it absolutely and completely clear 
     <lb/>that I am not against confederation in principle, 
     <lb/>and on terms which would ensure justice to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. But I am definitely and positively 
     <lb/>opposed to the motion before the Chair for the 
     <lb/>following reasons. Now one of these reasons has 
     <lb/>already been dealt with quite nicely and exten<lb break="no"/>sively by the member for Carbonear, Mr. Penney, 
     <lb/>and I am not therefore going to go over that 
     <lb/>ground again, except that I feel that if we should 
     <lb/>enter into confederation before endeavouring to 
     <lb/>utilise our great strategic position as a basis for 
     <lb/>seeking joint help or assistance in some way from 
     <lb/>Great Britain, Canada and the United States on 
     <lb/>the lines I have advocated on several occasions, 
     <lb/>I think we would be casting away a most valuable 
     <lb/>bartering opportunity for seeking something 
     <lb/>which might be very much better for the future 
     <lb/>of this country than anything we can gain from 
     <lb/>confederation with Canada. I feel that if we con<lb break="no"/>clude arrangements with Canada on the basis of 
     <lb/>the terms indicated, without trying for something 
     <lb/>better, we shall live, or some of us will, to regret 
     <lb/>it, as the opportunity for expansion of our own 
     <lb/>resources, especially those of the fisheries on the 
     <lb/>basis of trade with America, will be lost forever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe it is entirely wrong in principle to 
     <lb/>
     place before the electorate, for a decision which 
     <lb/>
     will be irretrievable and irrevocable, terms which 
     <lb/>
     have not been the subject of negotiations in any 
     <lb/>
     form whatever, but which are simply the ideas of 
     <lb/>
     one of the parties as to a fair and equitable basis 
     <lb/>
     for union. And I further believe that the terms 
     <lb/>
     indicated can be improved upon, and unless they 
     <lb/>
     can be, we should be inviting future financial 


            <pb n="1367" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1367.jpg"/>

     trouble or financial discomfort by deliberately 
     <lb/>
     accepting a position which will leave us with a 
     <lb/>
     deficit in our financial budget. No reliable figures 
     <lb/>
     have been produced to show that under the terms 
     <lb/>
     indicated there would be sufficient revenue left 
     <lb/>
     to carry on our provincial duties on a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     scale without running into debt. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     with incomplete information to work upon, the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland will not be in a position 
     <lb/>
     to fulfill the condition imposed by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, as expressed in the letter dated 
     <lb/>
     29 October last from the Right Hon. the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Canada, to the effect that before fina<lb break="no"/>lising any arrangement for union, "the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland should indicate clearly and 
     <lb/>
     beyond all possibility of misunderstanding their 
     <lb/>
     will that Newfoundland should become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada." How can they come to a 
     <lb/>
     well-considered conclusion with incomplete in<lb break="no"/>formation before them? I ask also whether 
     <lb/>
     Canada's expression of views mentioned in the 
     <lb/>
     same letter has been carried out, namely, "that it 
     <lb/>
     is essential to have a complete and comprehen<lb break="no"/>sive exchange of information and a full and care<lb break="no"/>ful exploration by both parties of all the issues 
     <lb/>
     involved." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that the issues to be placed before the 
     <lb/>
     people in the forthcoming referendum will be 
     <lb/>
     seriously befogged and confused if this Canadian 
     <lb/>
     issue is included in the referendum. By excluding 
     <lb/>
     it, the people of Newfoundland will be much 
     <lb/>
     better able to come to a definite choice between 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and Commission 
     <lb/>
     government, and later on will have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of considering the confederation issue. If 
     <lb/>
     the confederation issue is on the referendum 
     <lb/>
     paper it can definitely be dealt with at some not 
     <lb/>
     far distant date, perhaps within six months from 
     <lb/>
     the date of the referendum, as it should then be 
     <lb/>
     put before the people as a single issue, instead of 
     <lb/>
     being mixed up with two real forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. These two forms of government, if unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory, can at some future date be discarded, 
     <lb/>
     while acceptance of confederation would be an 
     <lb/>
     irrevocable and irretrievable step. If this motion 
     <lb/>
     is turned down by the majority of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, as Ibelieve it will be, it must be remembered 
     <lb/>
     that the British government still has the option, if 
     <lb/>
     they deem it wise, of keeping the confederation 
     <lb/>
     issue in some form on the referendum paper. I 
     <lb/>
     hope that if they do so they will see that it is 


            <cb/>
    

     simply not common sense to place on the paper 
     <lb/>
     for final decision, <hi rendition="simple:italic">for final decision</hi>, a scheme 
     <lb/>
     which has not received the approval of any New<lb break="no"/>foundland government or assembly, and which is 
     <lb/>
     almost certainly capable of improvement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Just a few words more, sir, and I am finished. 
     <lb/>
     I must refer to Mr. Smallwood's statement that 
     <lb/>
     the whole truth should be put to the people, a 
     <lb/>
     point with which I entirely agree. In his, shall I 
     <lb/>
     say fiery speech of a few day ago, he made the 
     <lb/>
     statement, which I think was afterwards con<lb break="no"/>firmed by Mr. Ashbourne, that confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada would not be an irretrievable step, 
     <lb/>
     and in fact Mr, Smallwood indicated that it would 
     <lb/>
     be comparatively easy to get out of it should 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland find that she has made a mistake. 
     <lb/>
     I don't fear to state definitely that this is simply 
     <lb/>
     not true, as it has been definitely decided that the 
     <lb/>
     only way in which provinces can secede, or be 
     <lb/>
     expelled, is through an act of the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. In actual fact a select committee of 
     <lb/>
     Lords and Commons decided in 1935 that Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment was, by constitutional convention, not com<lb break="no"/>petent to deal with such a matter upon petition of 
     <lb/>
     a single province or state. Their decision em<lb break="no"/>phasised the fact that in practice, as well as in law, 
     <lb/>
     no right of secession rests with any state or 
     <lb/>
     province acting alone. If there is any doubt on that 
     <lb/>
     point, and if Mr. Smallwood would like confir<lb break="no"/>mation, I have quoted almost from the views of 
     <lb/>
     our own constitutional adviser, Professor 
     <lb/>
     Wheare, who issued a textbook on federal 
     <lb/>
     government and very strongly pointed that out, 
     <lb/>
     quoting the actual case on which I have based my 
     <lb/>
     views. I hope that Mr. Smallwood will correct his 
     <lb/>
     statement, before we "marry in haste and repent 
     <lb/>
     at leisure." I thank you. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, the question now 
     <lb/>before the Convention, as I see it, is simply this: 
     <lb/>is this Convention, having reviewed the terms 
     <lb/>and conditions of confederation as contained in 
     <lb/>the Black Books and the Grey Book, of the 
     <lb/>opinion that union with Canada should be recom<lb break="no"/>mended to our people as a possible form of 
     <lb/>government in the forthcoming referendum? On 
     <lb/>this we are, as representatives of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people, asked to make a decision. For 
     <lb/>myself, my conclusion in the light of all the 
     <lb/>information at my disposal is, that it would be 
     <lb/>neither wise nor profitable for us to recommend 
     <lb/>such a form of govemment to our people; and I

            <fw type="num">1368</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
     

     propose in my remarks to give my reasons for 
     <lb/>
     saying so. I will as best I can explain to you why 
     <lb/>
     I believe that the so-called proposals are not alone 
     <lb/>
     without the virtue of being properly negotiated 
     <lb/>
     terms, but that they fail to present either a true or 
     <lb/>
     complete picture of the real position. Indeed, for 
     <lb/>
     myself, I find them more remarkable for what 
     <lb/>
     they conceal than for what they actually tell us; 
     <lb/>
     that instead of being possessed of the dignity or 
     <lb/>
     standing of a legitimate contractual agreement 
     <lb/>
     between two countries, they resemble more the 
     <lb/>
     brief of a slick salesman trying to sell a defective 
     <lb/>
     bill of goods to a gullible people. In short, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I regard them as an insult to the intel<lb break="no"/>ligence of this Convention, and a reflection on the 
     <lb/>
     sound common sense of all the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have said, sir, that these terms are more 
     <lb/>
     remarkable for what they do not tell us than for 
     <lb/>
     what they do, and the glaring instance of this is 
     <lb/>
     given in the manner in which they deal with 
     <lb/>
     taxation. Some weeks ago I told this Convention 
     <lb/>
     that in the event of confederation with Canada the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland had better get out of 
     <lb/>
     their heads any idea that we were going to get 
     <lb/>
     lower taxation. I went further, and I said that 
     <lb/>
     instead of any decrease in taxation we would 
     <lb/>
     suffer from even a higher and much more oppres<lb break="no"/>sive burden under confederation. We have all 
     <lb/>
     witnessed Mr. Smallwood's failure to satisfac<lb break="no"/>torily balance the budget which he brought in 
     <lb/>
     here some weeks ago — his own personal budget, 
     <lb/>
     made to order, which contains his own chosen 
     <lb/>
     figures. Now I ask you, when this budget could 
     <lb/>
     not be balanced even in theory, how can we 
     <lb/>
     expect to measure up when the real thing comes 
     <lb/>
     along? And remember too, that in addition to this 
     <lb/>
     provincial budget we will have to pay, I say <hi rendition="simple:italic">have 
     <lb/>
     to pay</hi>, our definite share of taxation to the federal 
     <lb/>
     government. In commenting on this matter I es<lb break="no"/>timated that the people of Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     be called upon to find a total annual sum for 
     <lb/>
     taxation of nearly $80 million annually. I said 
     <lb/>
     that some weeks ago, and I am still waiting for 
     <lb/>
     someone to prove to me that my estimate was not 
     <lb/>
     correct. I have heard, as you have heard, pro-con<lb break="no"/>federates make somewhat feeble attempts to in<lb break="no"/>dicate how our provincial budget might be 
     <lb/>
     balanced, but not one of them gave us a satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory answer. Mr. Smallwood indeed seems to 
     <lb/>
     realise the awkwardness of his position in this 


            <cb/>
      

     respect, and so in the past whenever he is faced 
     <lb/>
     with an issue with which he is unable to deal he 
     <lb/>
     starts to duck, he dodges, he evades, and failing 
     <lb/>
     everything else he sends out a smokescreen, as 
     <lb/>
     you have heard him do when he tried to distract 
     <lb/>
     us from the issue by an attack on or vilification 
     <lb/>
     of those engaged in the business of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, no one has ever yet accused me of being 
     <lb/>
     champion of Mr. Smallwood's local million<lb break="no"/>aires, and I am not concerned with them as such 
     <lb/>
     in this debate, but I do realise, as everyone with 
     <lb/>
     intelligence must realise, the value of free 
     <lb/>
     enterprise. A11 democratic peoples know that 
     <lb/>
     capital and labour depend upon each other for 
     <lb/>
     existence. I know and you know, that without the 
     <lb/>
     so-called capitalists the great United States 
     <lb/>
     would not be where she is today. Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     much vaunted Canada, had her resources 
     <lb/>
     developed and her railways constructed, and their 
     <lb/>
     country opened up only through and with the 
     <lb/>
     driving power of capitalism, and the same thing 
     <lb/>
     applies to the British Empire, and if we look at 
     <lb/>
     our history we find that the same thing applies to 
     <lb/>
     this country. I know and you know, that today the 
     <lb/>
     country which is the envy of all the world, whose 
     <lb/>
     people enjoy the highest standard of living, is also 
     <lb/>
     the country which has the greatest number of rich 
     <lb/>
     individuals per square mile than any country on 
     <lb/>
     earth. Must we put two and two together? Do we 
     <lb/>
     not also know what happened to those countries 
     <lb/>
     in which agitators arose to turn the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country against those possessing money? Yes, 
     <lb/>
     these people destroyed the capitalists, but at the 
     <lb/>
     same time they destroyed their own country — a 
     <lb/>
     Hitler, a Mussolini, and a Stalin replaced the 
     <lb/>
     banker and industrialist and the merchant. Would 
     <lb/>
     anyone want that sort of thing to happen here? 
     <lb/>
     Listening to the heated abuse which Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood directed at the successful business 
     <lb/>
     organisations of this country, and the 
     <lb/>
     businessmen, the same businessmen who fur<lb break="no"/>nished the fishermen with their ships, the men 
     <lb/>
     who built the factories, the men who started new 
     <lb/>
     industries, the men who employ thousands of our 
     <lb/>
     people at union wages, the men who, is es<lb break="no"/>timated, pay large annual sums to our treasury by 
     <lb/>
     way of annual taxation. Listening to his un<lb break="no"/>reasonable attacks on these people on Friday, I 
     <lb/>
     somehow got the idea that for the first time a new 
     <lb/>
     and unsavory and even alien note had been in<lb break="no"/>jected into the proceedings of this Convention. It 


            <pb n="1369" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1369.jpg"/>

     seemed to me that a foreign influence was loose: 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of Trotsky, the virulent harangue of the 
     <lb/>
     soapbox orator playing on the discontent of an 
     <lb/>
     unthinking and innocent people. If patriotism, it 
     <lb/>
     has been said, is the last refuge of a scoundrel, 
     <lb/>
     then it seems to me to be equally true that the 
     <lb/>
     setting of class against class is the last refuge of 
     <lb/>
     the political demagogue. When all else fails, 
     <lb/>
     when his case can't be won on its merits, there is 
     <lb/>
     always available the red banner with the words 
     <lb/>
     inscribed upon it, "Down with the rich." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Political history shows that there is only one 
     <lb/>
     worse thing, and that is the setting of creed 
     <lb/>
     against creed. Let us hope that such a foul thing 
     <lb/>
     will never be allowed, as I am sure it will not be, 
     <lb/>
     to raise its ugly head in this country. The people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, in spite of Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     words, were always ready to put their trust in our 
     <lb/>
     businessmen. It has always been so in the past and 
     <lb/>
     it is just as true today, for have we not here in this 
     <lb/>
     very chamber many of them — prominent and 
     <lb/>
     well-known businessmen, some of them even 
     <lb/>
     representing Mr. Smallwood's hated corpora<lb break="no"/>tions? These men were selected by the people to 
     <lb/>
     represent them and to protect their interests, and 
     <lb/>
     I know, and our people themselves know, that 
     <lb/>
     these men will do their jobs as best they know 
     <lb/>
     how. Certainly, I admit that our businessmen and 
     <lb/>
     our Newfoundland corporations have made 
     <lb/>
     money, just as similar businessmen all over the 
     <lb/>
     North American continent have made money, 
     <lb/>
     and this applies, as I will show later on, even in 
     <lb/>
     that place of perfection, the Dominion of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Many Newfoundlanders are well aware of that 
     <lb/>
     because we send them each year some $40 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. But let us be fair about this matter. Let us 
     <lb/>
     see if our wealthy men are the evil characters that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood would have us believe. Is it not 
     <lb/>
     to these same individuals that a great portion of 
     <lb/>
     our people must look for wages? Union wages, 
     <lb/>
     sir, based on a mutual agreement between the 
     <lb/>
     worker and employer. Must we not also give 
     <lb/>
     them credit for keeping money in this country, 
     <lb/>
     circulating amongst our people instead of it being 
     <lb/>
     drained off by foreign corporations? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I admit that in some cases the prices charged 
     <lb/>
     our people are too high, but whose fault is that? 
     <lb/>
     Is it not the fault of the present Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government which, in order to get higher taxes, 
     <lb/>
     refused to put any ceiling prices on during the war 
     <lb/>
     years, and who incidentally, in order to increase 


            <cb/>
   

     the amount they could bleed from our business 
     <lb/>
     people and the people generally, passed a law 
     <lb/>
     practically forcing businessmen to charge higher 
     <lb/>
     prices than they wished to charge? Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood seems to forget that every single, 
     <lb/>
     solitary thing which he says about our local 
     <lb/>
     businessmen also applies, even to a greater ex<lb break="no"/>tent, to the businessmen in his beloved Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and even further, he is throwing these charges, he 
     <lb/>
     is launching these slurs upon the very men who 
     <lb/>
     are sitting in his own confederate camp. To this 
     <lb/>
     extent he is fouling his own nest. Let us take a 
     <lb/>
     glance, sir, for a moment, at some of the things 
     <lb/>
     he said. He went to great pains, and probably 
     <lb/>
     thought he was scoring a point, when he said that 
     <lb/>
     in 1945, 105 business concerns in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     made a total profit of $15 million (and I think paid 
     <lb/>
     taxation of $5 million out of that), but did he also 
     <lb/>
     tell you, this Convention and the country, that of 
     <lb/>
     these concerns by far and away the greatest in<lb break="no"/>dividual profits were made by the local branches 
     <lb/>
     of Canadian corporations and other foreign cor<lb break="no"/>porations, and that it follows that the greater part 
     <lb/>
     of these profits were shipped out of the country 
     <lb/>
     to Canada and other places? And did he tell you, 
     <lb/>
     or did he conveniently forget to tell us, that in that 
     <lb/>
     same year of 1945, 29 companies doing business 
     <lb/>
     in Canada — 29 — made a total profit of what? 
     <lb/>
     $250 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canada cannot afford to dissipate her re<lb break="no"/>venues much longer. I have already told you that 
     <lb/>
     Canada is in an unhealthy financial position, and 
     <lb/>
     that the time is not too far distant when a general 
     <lb/>
     cutting down of expenditures will take place if 
     <lb/>
     Canada hopes to remain solvent and continue its 
     <lb/>
     ambitious march to nationhood. Then again, did 
     <lb/>
     not Mr. Crummey, who was a member of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Ottawa, tell us in windingup the 
     <lb/>
     debate on this confederation issue, in committee 
     <lb/>
     of the whole, that the delegation was told in effect 
     <lb/>
     that it should not have gone to Ottawa when it 
     <lb/>
     did, that it was interfering, so to speak, with the 
     <lb/>
     political mood of the Canadian government at 
     <lb/>
     that time, and that it had been intimated that the 
     <lb/>
     delegation should return to Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     come back to Ottawa again in September? What 
     <lb/>
     does this indicate? It conveyed to me that it might 
     <lb/>
     be part of the plan of Dominions Office to stave 
     <lb/>
     off, as it staved off successfully the holding of our 
     <lb/>
     national referendum last August; so that the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government, through its local 
 

            <pb n="1370" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1370.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1370</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     agents, the Commission government, might fur<lb break="no"/>ther expend the monies of our treasury, which 
     <lb/>
     they have done and are continuing to do at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. Did not Mr. Crummey tell us that 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation was told that in case New<lb break="no"/>foundland could not successfully balance its 
     <lb/>
     provincial budget under the present Canadian 
     <lb/>
     proposals, that it would be necessary to impose 
     <lb/>
     additional taxation on our people to do so? Did 
     <lb/>
     not Mr. Crummey tell us that under the present 
     <lb/>
     laws of Canada there did not exist any legislation 
     <lb/>
     which would permit our Fishery Board to carry 
     <lb/>
     on as it is doing at the present, and that conse<lb break="no"/>quently it would be abolished, and that our 
     <lb/>
     fishery products would then come under the 
     <lb/>
     federal authorities, and that the present system of 
     <lb/>
     our marketing would cease to exist? Is it not a fact 
     <lb/>
     that some members of the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     advocated a subsidy of $8 million instead of the 
     <lb/>
     $3.5 million transitional grant, and were turned 
     <lb/>
     down? Other matters of great national impor<lb break="no"/>tance were also given attention and were not 
     <lb/>
     reported to this Convention because it does not 
     <lb/>
     suit the plan of the pro-confederates. I have stated 
     <lb/>
     in this assembly that the estimate of possible 
     <lb/>
     revenues which the Canadian experts made that 
     <lb/>
     Canada would derive from union of our two 
     <lb/>
     countries, amounting to slightly over $20 million 
     <lb/>
     annually, are fraudulent; that in my opinion the 
     <lb/>
     amount they would receive would be over $30 
     <lb/>
     million. And this does not take into consideration 
     <lb/>
     the possible increase in revenues that would ac<lb break="no"/>crue from the development of the Labrador iron 
     <lb/>
     ore project. I repeat that statement today, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I repeat that the deficit on the 
     <lb/>
     proposed provincial budget would be not less 
     <lb/>
     than $9 million annually, and that in order to 
     <lb/>
     balance that account increased taxes would have 
     <lb/>
     to be placed on our people in the way of further 
     <lb/>
     sales tax, hospital tax, property tax, educational 
     <lb/>
     tax, municipal tax, and God knows how many 
     <lb/>
     other kinds of taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know that the advocates of confederation do 
     <lb/>
     not look at this matter in the light of what would 
     <lb/>
     accrue for provincial administration. Their sole 
     <lb/>
     ambition is to stress to our people the advantages 
     <lb/>
     to our people that would accrue from the payment 
     <lb/>
     of baby bonuses, and the vilification of our mer<lb break="no"/>chants, etc. I know that is their policy, but I tell 
     <lb/>
     them now that knowingly or unknowingly they 
     <lb/>
     are traitors to their country. Some of us have been 


            <cb/>
         

     accused of national treachery...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, isn't that hitting 
     <lb/>
     a bit below the belt? If I were to tell Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     that he was a traitor to his country he would not 
     <lb/>
     like it.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well now, you are 50 pounds

     you do, and if it was the other way around, maybe

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> All right, I throw that insult back in

     <lb/>How is that?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I would throw that back at the faces 
     <lb/>
     of those who so accuse us, and tell them that the 
     <lb/>
     proposals contained in the Grey Book sent us by 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency the Governor by Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     King are not such as would constitute an equi<lb break="no"/>table basis of union of our two countries, and 
     <lb/>
     should not be submitted to the people at the 
     <lb/>
     coming national referendum. I tell those that 
     <lb/>
     would accuse us of national treachery, and who 
     <lb/>
     would advocate such proposals, that they them<lb break="no"/>selves can by their very own actions claim the 
     <lb/>
     first right and title to this dishonourable name. To 
     <lb/>
     me sir, it seems that any Newfoundlander, or 
     <lb/>
     group of Newfoundlanders, who deliberately set 
     <lb/>
     out to pass all that they are and have across the 
     <lb/>
     traitor's counter, I say such people owe an ex<lb break="no"/>planation of their attitude. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have yet to hear them give us that explana<lb break="no"/>tion. To trifle with a people and a country, to 
     <lb/>
     compromise the lives of future generations, are 
     <lb/>
     no small things. Yet that is the very thing that is 
     <lb/>
     now being attempted, to the end that we shall 
     <lb/>
     cease to exist as an independent country, and that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders shall be no longer New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. I would go on at much greater

     length than the time allotted to me in showing 
     <lb/>
     why this country of ours should not and must not 
     <lb/>
     allow itself and its nationhood to be absorbed by 
     <lb/>
     the dominion to the west of it, but I think that I 
     <lb/>
     should avail of the short time left to me in at<lb break="no"/>tempting to boil this whole thing down to its 
     <lb/>
     broad outlines, and see the thing at its proper 
     <lb/>
     worth. Does not all this confederation business 
     <lb/>
     come down to a matter of a cold, commercial 
     <lb/>
     business deal, whereby we were asked to sell out 
     <lb/>
     our country and our future to Canada for a certain 
     <lb/>
     sum of money? And speaking of this attitude, I 
     <lb/>
     confess it seems to me to be a terribly serious 
     <lb/>
     thing for any country or any people to place 
     <lb/>
     themselves in the balance against the pull of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian dollars. What is the price, or shall I say 
     <lb/>
     the bribe, they offer us? The prize bait seems to 
     <lb/>
     be that a certain number of our people will get 
     <lb/>
     this thing called the baby bonus. But do they tell 
     <lb/>
     us that this bonus is an unsubstantial thing, that it 
     <lb/>
     is something that we cannot depend upon? That 
     <lb/>
     it may vanish overnight, and that in the event of 
     <lb/>
     a depression in Canada it will die a quick death? 
     <lb/>
     Indeed, my own personal opinion is that it will 
     <lb/>
     not exist longer than two years. Do they tell us 
     <lb/>
     that when our babies reach the age of 16 they will 
     <lb/>
     spend the rest of their lives paying back to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government the amount of their bonus? 
     <lb/>
     Do they tell us that when our babies reach 
     <lb/>
     military age they will almost certainly be con<lb break="no"/>scripted into the Canadian military forces? Do 
     <lb/>
     they tell us that in the event of confederation a 
     <lb/>
     big percentage of these young people will have 
     <lb/>
     to emigrate from this country to seek employ<lb break="no"/>ment which cannot be found at home? Of course 
     <lb/>
     they do not tell us those things, because they 
     <lb/>
     know, and know well, that if we saw the truth of 
     <lb/>
     these things this baby bonus would be no longer 
     <lb/>
     able to bluff and deceive us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then they next offer us an enticement. Here 
     <lb/>
     again they cover the bitter pill with a thick coat<lb break="no"/>ing of sugar. You don't hear them tell you that 
     <lb/>
     many of those who receive this old age pension 
     <lb/>
     will have to surrender their property to the state, 
     <lb/>
     and that in the final result all it seems is that the 
     <lb/>
     pensioner has to sell his property to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government with the hope of getting paid back in 
     <lb/>
     some small monthly installments. Then there is 
     <lb/>
     the matter of our industries. Do they tell us that 
     <lb/>
     if confederation comes to this country it will 
     <lb/>
     mean death to many of our small industries? That 


            <cb/>
   

     it will close the doors of numerous factories 
     <lb/>
     which cannot hope to meet Canadian competi<lb break="no"/>tion, that hundreds, probably thousands, of our 
     <lb/>
     working people will find themselves jobless, and 
     <lb/>
     if they want work will have to get out of the 
     <lb/>
     country to find it? And that in many of our larger 
     <lb/>
     settlements our tradesmen or storekeepers will 
     <lb/>
     find that our dwindling population will do away 
     <lb/>
     with most of their customers and threaten them 
     <lb/>
     with bankruptcy? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to another matter, which means 
     <lb/>
     much to the religious and law-abiding people of 
     <lb/>
     our country. With us, the matter of our education<lb break="no"/>al system is one of great importance, and we have 
     <lb/>
     evolved our own system of denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools, which time has found to be most suitable 
     <lb/>
     to the wishes and requirements of New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. In the event of confederation there 
     <lb/>
     is a threat that, as Mr. Crummey has pointed out 
     <lb/>
     to this Convention, is a most serious threat to the 
     <lb/>
     destruction and overthrow of that system. He has 
     <lb/>
     pointed out to us that if Canadians take charge of 
     <lb/>
     our country in every probability we will have 
     <lb/>
     imposed on us, even forced on us, the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of non-denominational schools. What right have 
     <lb/>
     we to jeopardise the moral and religious lives of 
     <lb/>
     the coming generations in this matter? Why, to 
     <lb/>
     my mind this particular thing in itself is sufficient 
     <lb/>
     to warn us that the road to confederation is the 
     <lb/>
     wrong road for Newfoundland. But it seems that 
     <lb/>
     our people are asked to regard this matter from 
     <lb/>
     the standpoint of dollars and cents. Well, if we 
     <lb/>
     talk of dollars and cents we must also talk of 
     <lb/>
     taxes. Are the people of this country ready to take 
     <lb/>
     on a burden of taxation, the like of which they or 
     <lb/>
     their fathers have never known? Are they 
     <lb/>
     prepared to chip in an additional $35-40 million 
     <lb/>
     because you, Mr. and Mrs. Newfoundland, you 
     <lb/>
     are the ones, out of your pennies and dimes, who 
     <lb/>
     will have to pay for Mr. Smallwood's baby bonus. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now in this matter I am not speaking from 
     <lb/>
     hearsay. I have lived in Canada and I can speak 
     <lb/>
     from hard, actual experience, and I tell you that 
     <lb/>
     under confederation the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     will find themselves smothered and suffocated 
     <lb/>
     under an avalanche of federal, provincial and 
     <lb/>
     municipal taxation. I have heard Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     when asked some embarrassing questions about 
     <lb/>
     taxation, evade the issue by saying, "Oh, the 
     <lb/>
     federal government will not impose such and 
     <lb/>
     such a tax. That would be a matter for our own 


            <pb n="1372" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1372.jpg"/>

     provincial government." Now what difference 
     <lb/>
     does it make to us, Mr. Chairman, to whom we 
     <lb/>
     have to pay these taxes? We lose our money 
     <lb/>
     anyhow. Our dollars are taken from us. The 
     <lb/>
     fisherman, and I hope they hear my words, will 
     <lb/>
     have to pay taxes on every stick and article that 
     <lb/>
     he owns — his boats, his nets, his house, his 
     <lb/>
     barns, his cattle and his meadows. That is the 
     <lb/>
     price, or part of the price the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     fisherman will have to pay for the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     calling himself a Canadian. Mr. Chairman, it is 
     <lb/>
     no surprise to me that the people assembled in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, representing every district, rep<lb break="no"/>resenting every man, woman and child in this 
     <lb/>
     country, are, the great majority of them, absolute<lb break="no"/>ly opposed to having this country confederate 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. The reaction and the attitude of 
     <lb/>
     intelligent and patriotic Newfoundlanders could 
     <lb/>
     not be otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I see that my time is running short, and that I 
     <lb/>
     will be unable to proceed at any further length in 
     <lb/>
     showing why I am not voting for this motion. I 
     <lb/>
     wish to explain that irrespective of any of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which I have named, my main reason for 
     <lb/>
     being against it is because it is a violation of the 
     <lb/>
     1933 agreement, and I refuse to be a party to the 
     <lb/>
     violation of that agreement. In one of the early 
     <lb/>
     sessions of this Convention, delegate K. M. 
     <lb/>
     Brown of the district of Bonavista South, told you 
     <lb/>
     he had in his possession a letter which, if publish<lb break="no"/>ed, would kill this confederation issue absolutely 
     <lb/>
     and forever. I too have had access to a document 
     <lb/>
     which, if I were at liberty to publish, would show 
     <lb/>
     this country that a concerted plot, an international 
     <lb/>
     plot, was being hatched as far back as 1941... 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Publish it! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> To bring Newfoundland under 
     <lb/>
     Canadian control, by force if necessary. The 
     <lb/>
     question I ask you now, has that plot been put into 
     <lb/>
     effect? Are its agents in this country today, and 
     <lb/>
     are we witnessing the desperate attempts to force 
     <lb/>
     it though by the setting up of this Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     the frenzied attempts of those who are behind the 
     <lb/>
     scenes of this confederate issue? Soon I trust, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, our people will be called upon to once 
     <lb/>
     again mark their cross upon a national ballot 
     <lb/>
     paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Five minutes to go, Major. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> All right, thanks very much. That 
     <lb/>
     "X" will be written by every real New<lb break="no"/>foundlander on a day not too far distant. It too 


            <cb/>
   

     will indicate, if correctly placed, our love and our 
     <lb/>
     affection for the land of our birth. I ask you 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to ponder and hesitate before you 
     <lb/>
     make that little mark by which you, your 
     <lb/>
     children, and your children's children can be 
     <lb/>
     blessed or blasted. That cross must be the kiss of 
     <lb/>
     love given by every loyal citizen to our own 
     <lb/>
     mother — Newfoundland. Take care, I say, that 
     <lb/>
     it is placed with zeal and loyalty just where it 
     <lb/>
     belongs, just where she wishes it, and tremble 
     <lb/>
     like Iscariot ere you place it on your own shame 
     <lb/>
     and future despair, in the place that means your 
     <lb/>
     traitorous denial of your mother country's best 
     <lb/>
     interests. As Iscariot planted his traitor's kiss 
     <lb/>
     upon the Master's brow, once done it cannot be 
     <lb/>
     undone. It is final, irrevocable and unchangeable, 
     <lb/>
     if placed after "Confederation with Canada", 
     <lb/>
     should that be on the ballot paper. Incidentally, 
     <lb/>
     Iscariot had the decency to hang himself. Would 
     <lb/>
     that I could say to all traitors, "Go thou and do 
     <lb/>
     likewise." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In closing, I can think of no more appropriate 
     <lb/>
     words to say than that which I regard as having 
     <lb/>
     been prostituted for another purpose in this As<lb break="no"/>sembly a couple of weeks ago, for this is the time, 
     <lb/>
     this is the hour, this is the moment when from the 
     <lb/>
     hearts of every one of us who love this country, 
     <lb/>
     who wish her, well the prayer should go forth: 
     <lb/>
     "God guard thee, Newfoundland." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to the 
     <lb/>
     motion, but I would like an intermission if it is 
     <lb/>
     agreeable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would like a ten minute inter<lb break="no"/>mission very much if it is agreeable to the mem<lb break="no"/>bers. We will take a ten minute recess, the 
     <lb/>
     chamber is very hot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Short recess]</hi>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> First and foremost I want to draw 
     <lb/>
     your attention to a statement made by Mr. Hick<lb break="no"/>man two or three days ago referring to the Claren<lb break="no"/>ville boats. You will remember he asked a 
     <lb/>
     question, and the reply came back, and Mr. Hick<lb break="no"/>man stated how evasive that answer was. I would 
     <lb/>
     refer you to the BNA Act, 1867, and I think the 
     <lb/>
     answer is to be found there quite clearly and 
     <lb/>
     distinctly. Section 92: "In each province the 
     <lb/>
     legislature may exclusively make laws in relation 
     <lb/>
     to matters coming within the classes of subjects 
     <lb/>
     next hereinafter enumerated".... They go on to 
     <lb/>
     state the items on which the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment is empowered to make laws. Section 92

     sub-section 10:

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Local works and undertakings other than 
     <lb/>such as are of the following classes:

            <p>In other words, the Clarenville boats will be 
     <lb/>absolutely under the jurisdiction of the federal 
     <lb/>government, and therefore it will be up to the 
     <lb/>federal government to administer them and send 
     <lb/>them where they please. I want to point that out 
     <lb/>so that Mr. Hickman can rest assured that the 
     <lb/>answer was given in an evasive manner in order 
     <lb/>to cover up that particular point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman. Mr. Smallwood criticises 
     <lb/>
     what he calls "the responsible government 
     <lb/>
     majority" in this Convention for not wanting to 
     <lb/>
     recommend to the Commonwealth Office that 
     <lb/>
     confederation upon the basis submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention be placed on the ballot. I 
     <lb/>
     would point out to him that in addition to voting 
     <lb/>
     that responsible government go on the ballot, we 
     <lb/>
     have also voted to have Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment placed thereon. We have done that because 
     <lb/>
     we are being consistent, and demand that the 
     <lb/>
     British government fulfil their pledge to the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country. After all, it was to the 
     <lb/>
     people that they pledged their word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall vote against Mr. Smallwood's motion 
     <lb/>
     because I see in it a deliberate attempt to ignore 
     <lb/>
     all pledges and rush us into confederation regard<lb break="no"/>less of the welfare of our people. Who makes this 
     <lb/>
     deliberate attempt? In my opinion, sir, the British 
     <lb/>
     government and the Canadian government, and 
     <lb/>
     they are aided and abetted by the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government and their servants. Certain individ<lb break="no"/>uals amongst the legislative and administrative 
     <lb/>
     bodies in this country are working tooth and nail 
     <lb/>
     to implement this high imperial policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Do you seriously think, sir, that either Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain or Canada is deeply concerned about our 
     <lb/>
     people? Were they ever so concerned in the past? 
     <lb/>
     Decidedly not. But why, you ask, are they so 
     <lb/>
     anxious now that we should confederate? The 
     <lb/>
     answer is quite simple. How else, I ask you, can 
     <lb/>
     they get American troops off British soil? Under 
     <lb/>
     confederation it would be quite simple, for under 
 

            <cb/>
     

     the mutual defence pact between Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it would be quite an easy matter. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p>Let Mr. Smallwood answer me a few ques<lb break="no"/>tions if there is any doubt left in our minds about 
     <lb/>this imperial policy which the Commission of 
     <lb/>Government would assist. Why was the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion Act worded as it is: "form or forms"? Why 
     <lb/>was Mr. Smallwood sent to Canada by someone 
     <lb/>shortly after the election? 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He is implying that I was sent 
     <lb/>to Canada. He has no right to do that. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Either he is implying it or

     <lb/>call together certain people to a meeting held here 
     <lb/>in St. John's in August 1946? This was held

     <lb/>
     I have investigated the facts. I have not the facts

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Why were the microphones put in 
     <lb/>
     this building? Why, sir, did the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government arrange the trip to Canada, the Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa delegation? Why, sir, were the so-called 
     <lb/>
     proposals of Ottawa not delivered to us by the 
     <lb/>
     delegation? Mr. Chairman, I can answer all these 
     <lb/>
    questions to my own satisfaction, and I am sure 
     <lb/>every man in this Convention can do likewise. 
     <lb/>Now sir, I may not be against union with Canada 
     <lb/>under certain conditions, but I certainly am under 
     <lb/>these unnegotiated terms, terms which I honestly 
     <lb/>believe would redound to the economic sabotage 
     <lb/>of the country's resources and the country's fu<lb break="no"/>ture. Vote against putting confederation on the 
     <lb/>ballot? Of course I shall, knowing full well I shall 
     <lb/>incur the displeasure of some people in this 
     <lb/>country, but also knowing this full well that I am 
     <lb/>doing my duty by the people whom I serve. If our 
     <lb/>people want confederation, in Heaven's name let 
     <lb/>them elect a government with a clear mandate to 
     <lb/>negotiate. The delegation had no power to secure 
     <lb/>proposals. Why then did Canada send proposals 
     <lb/>to His Excellency the Governor of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, who afterwards passed them on to us? 
     <lb/>When the people elected us, did they authorise us 
     <lb/>to discuss proposals for union with Canada? No, 
     <lb/>they did not, and we exceeded our duty in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing them at all. It seems to me that we have 
     <lb/>discussed nothing much else than union with 
     <lb/>Canada since this Convention met. Have we, I 
     <lb/>ask you, discussed any other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment? Have we discussed the particular form of 
     <lb/>responsible government we may want? Have we 
     <lb/>discussed Commission of Government, or any 
     <lb/>amended form thereof? No, sir, we have not been 
     <lb/>allowed to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood complained on Friday that he 
     <lb/>
     had never had a chance to bring the facts of 
     <lb/>
     confederation before the people in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. I ask you sir, when has any other form but 
     <lb/>
     confederation been brought before the people in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention? Never, until Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     brought in his motion the other week. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood made much ado about monopoly and 
     <lb/>
     monopolists on Friday, and my friend Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin has referred to that already. I agree with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, I do not like monopolists either. 
     <lb/>
     I know that monopolies exist in this country in 


            <cb/>
        

     connection with the sale of Canadian war assets, 
     <lb/>
     and particularly do I refer to 6,000 Canadian 
     <lb/>
     blankets which were sold in Gander. The man 
     <lb/>
     who put the corner on these 6,000 blankets, was 
     <lb/>
     he or was he not a monopolist? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Smallwood, on Friday, very mag<lb break="no"/>nanimously gave us an opportunity to say a few 
     <lb/>
     words on taxes on property, and I availed myself 
     <lb/>
     of that opportunity. He spent two hours last week 
     <lb/>
     replying to me, telling us that the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not tax property. Whoever said they 
     <lb/>
     did? I did not, or that the provincial governments 
     <lb/>
     taxed real property. I now find out, however, that 
     <lb/>
     the provincial governments did tax real property. 
     <lb/>
     For instance, in Saskatchewan in 1943 the 
     <lb/>
     province collected altogether in taxes just over 
     <lb/>
     $11 million, and of this amount something over 
     <lb/>
     $3 million was collected on real and personal 
     <lb/>
     property. (These figures which I am quoting are 
     <lb/>
     taken from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Comparative Statistics of Public 
     <lb/>
     Finance</hi>). The Province of Alberta collected 
     <lb/>
     $1.25 million on real and personal property, and 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia $1.3 million, and the thought 
     <lb/>
     of the whole matter is that every province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, with the exception of Quebec, collected 
     <lb/>
     some taxes from real and personal property. But 
     <lb/>
     the point I endeavoured to explain was that 
     <lb/>
     generally the provinces, having the power to tax 
     <lb/>
     real and personal property, delegate this tax col<lb break="no"/>lecting power under the BNA Act to the 
     <lb/>
     municipalities or town councils, and herewith I 
     <lb/>
     submit some figures to show the great extent to 
     <lb/>
     which the municipalities have gone in collecting 
     <lb/>
     their necessary revenues by taxes on land, build<lb break="no"/>ings, farm equipment and fishing equipment, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, and other real property. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For instance, in the province of Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     1943 the total municipal taxes were $10 million, 
     <lb/>
     and $7.5 million of this came from taxes on real 
     <lb/>
     and personal property. In New Brunswick the 
     <lb/>
     municipal taxes amount to $5.8 million. Now of 
     <lb/>
     this, $4,417,000 came from taxes on real and 
     <lb/>
     personal property. In Quebec province the total 
     <lb/>
     taxes were $75 million, and of this $61 million 
     <lb/>
     came from taxes on real and personal property, 
     <lb/>
     on such things as I have quoted there, that is to 
     <lb/>
     say on land, buildings, farming equipment, fish<lb break="no"/>ing equipment and other real property. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Ontario the total municipal taxes were $114 
     <lb/>
     million, and of this $104 million came from taxes 
     <lb/>
     on real and personal property. In Manitoba the 


            <pb n="1375" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1375.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1375</fw>
      

     total municipal taxes were $19 million, and of 
     <lb/>
     this $17 million came from taxes on real and 
     <lb/>
     personal property. In Saskatchewan the total 
     <lb/>
     municipal taxes were $24 million, and of this $22 
     <lb/>
     million came from taxes on real and personal 
     <lb/>
     property. They had to get it off of that, there is 
     <lb/>
     nothing else to tax. No customs, no income tax 
     <lb/>
     — the federal government has it all. In British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia the total municipal taxes were 
     <lb/>
     $21,677,000, and of this $21,306,000 came from 
     <lb/>
     taxes on real and personal property. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now if anyone has any doubt in his mind on 
     <lb/>
     the system of taxation in Canada, which would 
     <lb/>
     and must be the system which would prevail in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland if we go into confederation, then 
     <lb/>
     I ask him to consider well these figures. These 
     <lb/>
     figures are correct, and only serve to show how 
     <lb/>
     largely the system of taxation in the provinces 
     <lb/>
     depends upon the taxation of land and buildings, 
     <lb/>
     farm machinery and fishing equipment, and other 
     <lb/>
     real and personal property. In the new province 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland there is being collected today, 
     <lb/>
     by means of such taxation, less than $600,000. In 
     <lb/>
     my estimate made a few days ago, I came to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that under the proposals forwarded to 
     <lb/>
     us by the Prime Minister of Canada we should 
     <lb/>
     find ourselves storing up deficits to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     over $5 million a year unless we resort to further 
     <lb/>
     taxation on real and personal property. I submit 
     <lb/>
     therefore, sir, that we shall find that within a 
     <lb/>
     period of two or three years under confederation 
     <lb/>
     anybody who is still living in this country will be 
     <lb/>
     able to find that the total municipal taxes were 
     <lb/>
     $5-6 million, and of this amount some $4 million 
     <lb/>
     or over will have been collected on real and 
     <lb/>
     personal property. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To show you how serious and how far-reach<lb break="no"/>ing this method of taxation in Canada is, I direct 
     <lb/>
     your attention to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ontario Gazette</hi> of Septem<lb break="no"/>ber 6, 1947, pages 1441 to 1462. You will find 
     <lb/>
     there listed some 542 lots of property which are 
     <lb/>
     listed under the heading "Treasury's Sale of Land 
     <lb/>
     for Arrears of Taxes." You remember, sir, last 
     <lb/>
     week I endeavoured to point out how the 
     <lb/>
     municipalities, and the provinces too for that 
     <lb/>
     matter, have the right to sell your property if you 
     <lb/>
     cannot pay your taxes. We have the right here in 
     <lb/>
     this country, but it has not been exercised. In the 
     <lb/>
     last 40 years here in the town of St. John's there 
     <lb/>
     has not been a piece of property sold for payment 
     <lb/>
     of taxes. That is an authoritative fact. Yes, they 


            <cb/>
       

     have the power, they must have the power, but 
     <lb/>
     they don't resort to it wholesale as they do in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. You will find listed some 542 lots of 
     <lb/>
     property under the heading "Treasury's Sale of 
     <lb/>
     Land for Arrears of Taxes." Now this is in the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Ontario alone. Here is one instance: 
     <lb/>
     "Widow, Frances M. Kelly, Lot No. 17, one 
     <lb/>
     half-acre of land, arrears of taxes $10.36 — cost 
     <lb/>
     $2, total $12.36." Now, sir, this widow, unable to 
     <lb/>
     pay $10.36, had her half acre of land sold by the 
     <lb/>
     municipality because she was unable to pay. And 
     <lb/>
     there were 542 pieces of a like nature in the said 
     <lb/>
     province in that particular quarter of the year. 
     <lb/>
     Yes, when our main sources of taxation have 
     <lb/>
     been taken over by the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood will have to resort very largely 
     <lb/>
     to taxation on such real and personal property as 
     <lb/>
     we have in this country. Let us point out, sir, that 
     <lb/>
     in the whole of Canada the total of their provin<lb break="no"/>cial and municipal taxes collected in 1943 was 
     <lb/>
     $649 million, and of this amount $274 million 
     <lb/>
     came from taxes on real and personal property. 
     <lb/>
     Now this is much more than one-third of the 
     <lb/>
     whole of the taxes collected by the provinces and 
     <lb/>
     municipalities. Apply this to the case of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I estimated a week or so ago that we 
     <lb/>
     would need some $17.3 million to run the country 
     <lb/>
     as a province, and I believe myself to be at least 
     <lb/>
     equally as capable as Mr. Smallwood when it 
     <lb/>
     comes to dealing with figures. I have pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that more than one-third of the taxes collected by 
     <lb/>
     the provinces and municipalities in Canada are 
     <lb/>
     derived from taxes on property. Is it not therefore 
     <lb/>
     reasonable to anticipate that we as a province 
     <lb/>
     would be collecting more than one-third of this 
     <lb/>
     $17.3 million, and that will make more than $5 
     <lb/>
     million? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I quite agree with that. There are many 
     <lb/>
     people holding vacant and unoccupied land, and 
     <lb/>
     I have no objection whatsoever to their being 
     <lb/>
     made to pay taxes, but when the taxes affect the 
     <lb/>
     primary producers of this country, then I feel in 
     <lb/>
     duty bound to warn those primary producers, 
     <lb/>
     such as the fisherman, the farmer, the miner and 
     <lb/>
     the logger, of what they can expect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I want to direct your attention to a ques<lb break="no"/>tion I directed to the Department of External 
     <lb/>
     Affairs at Ottawa as to the probable expenditure 
     <lb/>
     to be incurred by Canada in Newfoundland in the 
     <lb/>
     event of confederation. This item, you will 
     <lb/>
     remember, is found on page 16 of Annex IV of 


            <pb n="1376" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1376.jpg"/>
 
     <fw type="num">1376</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>   
     

  

the Grey Book.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> You will note there that under     
     <lb/>the tax agreement their estimate is $6,820,000.     
     <lb/>This amount, I pointed out, depended on the 
     <lb/>population of Newfoundland and the gross na<lb break="no"/>tional product of Canada, and I as these two were 
     <lb/>variables the amount could not be guaranteed as 
     <lb/>being $6,820,000, but that it should be listed as 
     <lb/>$6,211,756.60. That is to say the irreducible min<lb break="no"/>imum payment is the only amount which we can 
     <lb/>guarantee, or at least which the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment can guarantee to us. Under the next item you 
     <lb/>will see that they have listed for old age pensions 
     <lb/>an amount of $2 million to $2.6 million. Now this 
     <lb/>is merely guesswork. They admit that themsel<lb break="no"/>ves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     By the way, Mr. Smallwood has said very 
     <lb/>
     little about old age pensions of late, because he 
     <lb/>
     failed to point out in the first instance that the 
     <lb/>
     federal government demands that the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will have to assure it that the 
     <lb/>
     recipient of the old age pension has made over 
     <lb/>
     his property to the province, which on his death 
     <lb/>
     will be sold, the amount paid to the pensioner 
     <lb/>
     prior to his death to be taken therefrom and 
     <lb/>
     forwarded to the federal government. It is as<lb break="no"/>sumed, I take it, that the balance, if any, will be 
     <lb/>
     paid over to his heirs. But the main question in 
     <lb/>
     that particular item which I refer to was the sum 
     <lb/>
     of $9.4 million under the heading "Other 
     <lb/>
     Departmental Expenditures." You will remem<lb break="no"/>ber that I asked the Canadian government to 
     <lb/>
     break down that amount under the heading of the 
     <lb/>
     various services on which it would be spent. They 
     <lb/>
     have done that, and the answer is before you in 
     <lb/>
     that memorandum. I won't go through it now, I 
     <lb/>
     will just refer to some items. You will note that 
     <lb/>
     they intend to spend $1.7 million on Veterans' 
     <lb/>
     Affairs. That is to say, if we become a province, 
     <lb/>
     Canada proposes to spend $1.7 million on 
     <lb/>
     Veterans' Affairs in Newfoundland. Now let us 
     <lb/>
     look and see what we spent last year under 
     <lb/>
     Veterans' Affairs. You will find by reference to 
     <lb/>
     the government's estimates that we spent the 
     <lb/>
     following sum, that is to say: 
     <lb/>

            <p>Making a total of $2,141,935 as against $1.7 
     <lb/>million which they are to spend when they come 
     <lb/>here. How in the name of goodness can they 
     <lb/>expect to come in here and handle veterans' 
     <lb/>affairs in this country with $1.7 million? I don't 
     <lb/>know, and it's anybody's guess. Under the head<lb break="no"/>ing of Transport, Canada says she will spent 
     <lb/>$1,393,000; last year we spent $4.5 million. Take 
     <lb/>Posts and Telegraphs, Canada says she will spend 
     <lb/>$1,164,000, last year we spent $1,995,000. Take 
     <lb/>the Department of Fisheries, Canada says she 
     <lb/>will spend $600,000 when she comes in here 
     <lb/>(God forbid!). Our own government last year 
     <lb/>spent $1,031,000 as against $600,000. Finance, 
     <lb/>Canada will spend $275,000; last year we spent 
     <lb/>$507,000. Canada will spend $500,000 on the 
     <lb/>Royal Canadian Mounted Police (I suppose they 
     <lb/>are expecting some trouble, some disturbance); 
     <lb/>last year we spent $726,000 — the Ranger Force 
     <lb/>cost this country $726,000. Under the heading of 
     <lb/>National Revenue, including income tax, Canada 
     <lb/>says she will spend $325,000. We ourselves last 
     <lb/>year spent $665,000. 1 am drawing your attention 
     <lb/>to these figures, sir, in order to show how very 
     <lb/>unreliable are the estimates which Mr. Macken<lb break="no"/>zie King received from his various federal depart<lb break="no"/>ments of the cost of the existing services in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland, when they quoted the figure of 
     <lb/>$26.5 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would also like to draw your attention to 
     <lb/>
     footnote no. 3, on the same page 16 of Annex IV, 
     <lb/>
     where they state: "That any cost in respect of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Railway or the auxiliary steam<lb break="no"/>ship services taken over by Canada are not in<lb break="no"/>cluded in this $9.4 million" — and yet in this 
     <lb/>
     reply you have $1,393,000 under the heading of 
     <lb/>
     Transport in the breakdown of this $9.4 million. 
     <lb/>
     The more one looks at these terms in the light of 
     <lb/>
     the financial experiences of the various provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada during recent years, the more one has 
     <lb/>
     to come to the conclusion that Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie King surely thinks we are really too 
     <lb/>
     green to burn, and yet Mr. Smallwood has the 
     <lb/>
     temerity to tell his countrymen that these terms 
     <lb/>
     are generous! Well, a good many of his country<lb break="no"/>men have heard him tell his fairy stories before. 
     <lb/>
     They have heard him tell his bedtime stories in 
     <lb/>
     the north, the south, the east and the west, and by

     this time a good many of these people will know 
     <lb/>
     how to measure the credence or otherwise of this 
     <lb/>
     latest Superman thriller. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Has Mr. Smallwood told us what he is going 
     <lb/>
     to tax to make up for this deficit in the first or 
     <lb/>
     second year of confederation? He himself, sir, in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book, admits there will be a deficit. 
     <lb/>
     This deficit he admits is $1 million. It is called 
     <lb/>
     "Additional Provincial Taxation — $1 million". 
     <lb/>
     Actually it is $1.2 million. Very well, what is he 
     <lb/>
     going to put his taxes on to get this? In the second 
     <lb/>
     year of confederation he will have to find a fur<lb break="no"/>ther $350,000. As you will remember the transi<lb break="no"/>tional grant is reduced year by year for 12 years 
     <lb/>
     by $350,000 a year until it gets down to nothing, 
     <lb/>
     and so on year after year, until at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     12th year the Newfoundland people will be 
     <lb/>
     paying, mark you, $4.7 million in taxes more than 
     <lb/>
     they are paying today. They have to make that up. 
     <lb/>
     Very well. All I want to know, sir, from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is just what he is going to levy these 
     <lb/>
     taxes upon? It seems to me some indication ought 
     <lb/>
     to be given us. We enter confederation now with 
     <lb/>
     the prospect of having to raise more revenues 
     <lb/>
     year by year than we are raising now. Does this 
     <lb/>
     make sense? God knows we are taxed enough 
     <lb/>
     now. Most countries today are endeavouring to 
     <lb/>
     lower the taxation burden. We are told, however, 
     <lb/>
     "Oh no, you must be taxed more year by year if 
     <lb/>
     you desire this inestimable privilege of being a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian citizen." Any fool can see that accord<lb break="no"/>ing to these terms, ten years hence the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people will have to raise nearly $5 
     <lb/>
     million more by way of taxation than we are 
     <lb/>
     doing now. And all this makes no allowance 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever for new construction or repair to 
     <lb/>
     roads, schools, buildings and other construction, 
     <lb/>
     and makes no allowance whatever for increase in 
     <lb/>
     public health services, educational facilities or 
     <lb/>
     fishery improvement. Let us forget all this and 
     <lb/>
     merely ask Mr. Smallwood just how is he going 
     <lb/>
     to raise that money, that $5 million, say ten years 
     <lb/>
     hence? Is he banking on the possibility of having 
     <lb/>
     been gone by that time to his reward, eternal or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise? No, he won't tell us, but I have indi<lb break="no"/>cated a method to you, and I hope, sir, that you 
     <lb/>
     will be here to be witness to the truth of that which 
     <lb/>
     I have spoken. It may be, however, that by that 
     <lb/>
     time communism will have overrun the world, 
     <lb/>
     and that a suitable commissar will be found to 
     <lb/>
     rescue the Newfoundland people from the appall<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>

ing burden of taxation imposed through the 
     <lb/>
     machinations of present-day confederates. One 
     <lb/>
     thing I do know is that the present administration 
     <lb/>
     has set up such a huge spending machine, that 
     <lb/>
     whatever form of government the people decide 
     <lb/>
     on in the future, that government will be hard put 
     <lb/>
     to it to find the money necessary, for the greatest 
     <lb/>
     good to the greatest number of our people can 
     <lb/>
     only be achieved by the fullest development of 
     <lb/>
     all our natural resources. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this development government must lend a 
     <lb/>
     hand, and more than that, a controlling hand. 
     <lb/>
     How necessary therefore is it that govemment 
     <lb/>
     should be truly representative of the people. The 
     <lb/>
     brightest hope I have seen so far for the future is 
     <lb/>
     the present organisation of labour throughout the 
     <lb/>
     country. I have watched its development for a 
     <lb/>
     number of years, and after close association with 
     <lb/>
     some of its leaders I believe it to be the only 
     <lb/>
     development in self-government that has come to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland during all her past history. With 
     <lb/>
     wise leadership I believe that labour can save this 
     <lb/>
     country and her resources for the benefit of all. If 
     <lb/>
     labour cannot make this country a better place in 
     <lb/>
     which to live, then nobody else need try. One 
     <lb/>
     thing is absolutely essential, and that is a very 
     <lb/>
     close co-operation between all the unions in 
     <lb/>
     every branch of industry. They must get together 
     <lb/>
     and put up a solid co-operative front with capital 
     <lb/>
     to the end that all may benefit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Going back to the motion. I cannot support it. 
     <lb/>
     I would have supported Mr. Higgin's motion with 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government included, had it not 
     <lb/>
     been for the pledge of 1933. That pledge still 
     <lb/>
     stands, hence our legal choice in the matter can 
     <lb/>
     only be one of two forms, and it should be put to 
     <lb/>
     the people in this manner: "Do you desire the 
     <lb/>
     return of responsible government —answer 'yes' 
     <lb/>
     or 'no'." If the majority say "no", then Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government carries on. If the majority say 
     <lb/>
     "yes", then we get back our former status, and 
     <lb/>
     begin to put our house in order. Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>
     put it to you that is of the very essence of the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of the word "referendum". The diction<lb break="no"/>ary tells us that the meaning of the word is the 
     <lb/>
     "referring of some social or political question to 
     <lb/>
     the electorate, who will decide it by either a 'yes' 
     <lb/>
     or a 'no' vote". The introduction of this con<lb break="no"/>federation issue at this time prostitutes the very 
     <lb/>
     language in which it is written. It makes con<lb break="no"/>fusion worse confused. It renders the Convention

     act <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi> of law as handed out to us by the 
     <lb/>
     mother of parliaments, and its passing and 
     <lb/>
     implementation violates that which I humbly 
     <lb/>
     believe to be a sacred pledge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some of us, sir, have been accused of talking 
     <lb/>
     politics. Maybe we are. Mr. Bradley, in speaking 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Higgins' motion a few days ago, said that 
     <lb/>
     before he was elected he regarded the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion as a non-political party, but it had not turned 
     <lb/>
     out so. I am in accord with Mr. Bradley in that 
     <lb/>
     statement, but will the confederates get up and 
     <lb/>
     tell us about the secret gathering in St. John's in 
     <lb/>
     August 1946, after Mr. Smallwood's return from 
     <lb/>
     Canada, prior to the opening of this Convention? 
     <lb/>
     Will they tell us about the meeting of these 12 
     <lb/>
     members of the Convention in the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Hotel in 1946, shortly after the Convention 
     <lb/>
     opened? Will they tell us of their having Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood read them his speech which was to 
     <lb/>
     have been delivered on the introduction of the 
     <lb/>
     first confederation deliberation motion? Oh no! 
     <lb/>
     Do the 12 remember how he was advised not to 
     <lb/>
     give that political speech, and how he promised 
     <lb/>
     not to read it? But did he give that speech? I ask 
     <lb/>
     you gentlemen, did he give it? Oh yes, he gave it, 
     <lb/>
     and so brought into this Convention political 
     <lb/>
     controversy which has been present ever since. 
     <lb/>
     How futile, how silly, to now accuse some of us 
     <lb/>
     of playing politics. I wonder what you would call 
     <lb/>
     the speeches which the introducer of this motion 
     <lb/>
     made? Oh no, not political speeches, just little 
     <lb/>
     fireside chats, sir. Now I am not blaming Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood for talking politics. He is right in 
     <lb/>
     doing so. He believes in confederation I take it, 
     <lb/>
     just as I would deny it as being in the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of this country. As for me, I shall not be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     until every man and woman in this country is a 
     <lb/>
     politician, and then you may expect good govern<lb break="no"/>ment, whether it be confederation, responsible or 
     <lb/>
     Commission or some other form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, although I cannot conscientiously vote 
     <lb/>
     for this motion, there is very little doubt in my 
     <lb/>
     mind but that it will be placed on the ballot. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, unless Commonwealth Relations Office has 
     <lb/>
     had a change of heartl feel sure that it will be on 
     <lb/>
    the ballot. Incidentally I believe Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>visited my constituency, if you might call it that, 
     <lb/>a couple of weeks ago, and I believe he was asked 
     <lb/>a certain question relative to that very point, if I 
     <lb/>can lay hands on it. No. At any rate I remember 
     <lb/>it very well. He was asked this question a few 


            <cb/>
       

     weeks ago in Grand Falls: "Do you not really 
     <lb/>
     believe that it was the intention of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     and Canada to put Newfoundland into confed<lb break="no"/>eration when they drew up the Convention Act?" 
     <lb/>
     I am informed that Mr. Smallwood's answer was 
     <lb/>
     "yes". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's a lie, a black lie, who<lb break="no"/>ever informed you.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a minute, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett did not say you made the statement. 
     <lb/>
     He says, "I am informed that you made the state<lb break="no"/>ment." Don't interrupt, Mr. Smallwood, please.

     <lb/>
     it was a lie.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I have no objection to confederation 
     <lb/>
     going on the ballot whatsoever. I have pointed 
     <lb/>
     out that in my opinion it is not legal for it to go 
     <lb/>
     there. That's my opinion, and I may be a liar on 
     <lb/>
     that too, but as long as I live I shall express my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and let me say this: in answer to a nasty 
     <lb/>
     editorial which appeared in one of our evening 
     <lb/>
     papers on Saturday past, let me say that the 
     <lb/>
     Convention members who are lined up in favour 
     <lb/>
     of the restoration of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     have no fear for the results of the referendum; but 
     <lb/>
     let me also say that the Convention members who 
     <lb/>
     have lined up in favour of confederation are 
     <lb/>
     indeed a sorry, sorry group. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sometime ago when discussing these 
     <lb/>
     proposals for union with Canada I outlined brief<lb break="no"/>ly the history of the tax agreement which the 
     <lb/>
     federal government was endeavouring to reach 
     <lb/>
     agreement on with the various provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments, and I wound up by referring to Canada as 
     <lb/>
     "united in war, but divided in peace", and that is 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly a fact. Only the other day Premier 
     <lb/>
     Duplessis of Quebec hoisted his provincial flag 
     <lb/>
     with great fanfare. No longer will the Union Jack 
     <lb/>
     fly from the Quebec provincial legislature build<lb break="no"/>ing. They will consent to fly it over a side 
     <lb/>
     entrance however, should the Governor-General 
     <lb/>
     consent to visit Quebec. Are these the people 
     <lb/>
     with whom we are to federate? I realise of course 
     <lb/>
     that this is a gentle hint to the federal government 
     <lb/>
     to keep hands off as far as Quebec is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     but even Quebec cannot break away from con<lb break="no"/>federation is she wanted to, except by force of 
     <lb/>
     arms. Once we join up with Canada, we join up 
     <lb/>
     for keeps. We cannot secede. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     will tell you that we can, but of course he spoke

     out of turn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Speaking of Quebec, both Mr. Duplessis and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Godbout now wish to contest the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil award of 1927 with reference to Newfoundland- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador. They both want our Labrador. Said Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Godbout in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     on January 21 of this year, "Newfoundland, logi<lb break="no"/>cally speaking, should be annexed to Canada. We 
     <lb/>
     would be the first to bite our fingers if New<lb break="no"/>foundland, with its possibilities of vast natural 
     <lb/>
     wealth and natural resources, especially in its 
     <lb/>
     Labrador section, one day passed into the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the USA." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I suggest that we adjourn until 8 
     <lb/>
    o'clock.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, it is 6 o'clock, Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
    I will leave the Chair until eight.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> When we broke off for the day, I 
     <lb/>
    think I was saying something about Quebec. I 
     <lb/> would point out that any graciousness shown by 
     <lb/>Ottawa, Mr. Chairman, in the matter of con<lb break="no"/>federation, has been with Quebec's interest  
     <lb/>paramount. I have it on first-hand authority that 
     <lb/>Quebec has been endeavouring to force Ottawa's 
     <lb/>hand. Mr. Chairman, it is my considered opinion 
     <lb/>that union with Canada under these terms would 
     <lb/>lose us all control over these resources in 
     <lb/>Labrador, and all control over where we may ship 
     <lb/>our products, and it would be only a matter of 
     <lb/>time before we would be reduced to the status of 
     <lb/>the Canadian Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    
   
    

            <p>
     Believing this as I surely do, can I conscien<lb break="no"/>tiously vote to do anything which would help to 
     <lb/>
     put this country into confederation? If I were the 
     <lb/>
     only man in this country, sir, who was against 
     <lb/>
     confederation and believed as I do, I should vote 
     <lb/>
     against the motion. The same evening paper I 
     <lb/>
     referred to before, sir, states that we men of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention were not required to advise upon any 
     <lb/>
     one cause or the other. It definitely states that. I 
     <lb/>
     refer to this, because a good many people are 
     <lb/>
     lately thinking the same thing. I believe you will 
     <lb/>
     agree that section 3 of the act is quite clear on that 
     <lb/>
     point. I believe it states clearly that we are to 
     <lb/>
     make recommendations. How else can we make 
     <lb/>
    recommendations in an assembly of 45 men, 
     <lb/>other than by the vote? I will admit that London 
     <lb/>does not necessarily have to accept our recom<lb break="no"/>mendations. But I will submit that London would 
     <lb/>be creating a very serious situation did she ignore 
 

            <cb/>
          

     any recommendations which this assembly did 
     <lb/>
     make. We are a constituent assembly, elected by 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland to make recommen<lb break="no"/>dations on their behalf. We would not be worth 
     <lb/>
     our salt if we did not act on our own convictions, 
     <lb/>
     apart altogether as to whether or not these con<lb break="no"/>victions were in accord with those held in the 
     <lb/>
     sanctum sanctorum of some newspaper. My 
     <lb/>
     blood boils when I see such editorials. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood may feel aggrieved that he 
     <lb/>
     finds himself in the minority. God knows he used 
     <lb/>
     every effort to gain a majority. That is democracy 
     <lb/>
     at work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, I did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> We just have to accept that fact. If 
     <lb/>
     the dictatorial power at No. 9 Downing Street 
     <lb/>
     sees fit to ignore our recommendations, then, sir, 
     <lb/>
     we shall have to accept that too. For you see, as 
     <lb/>
     yet we are but the slaves of that dictatorial power, 
     <lb/>
     and we shall be the slaves of that dictatorial 
     <lb/>
     power just so long as we are governed under a 
     <lb/>
     regime like we are today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know of no other way to decide this issue 
     <lb/>
     here in this Convention than by the vote. How 
     <lb/>
     else can we do it? Suppose there were ten dif<lb break="no"/>ferent motions brought in here, for as many dif<lb break="no"/>ferent forms of government; obviously we could 
     <lb/>
     not recommend the ten of them. How then shall 
     <lb/>
     we eliminate what we consider the undesirables? 
     <lb/>
     How else than by the vote? That is exactly what 
     <lb/>
     we are doing now, and our whole desire is to point 
     <lb/>
     out the necessity for the restoration of our politi<lb break="no"/>cal liberties and the regaining of our self-respect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not intend to take any more time, except 
     <lb/>
     a moment. We have been here 16 months. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion we could have finished this job in four 
     <lb/>
     months but for certain things which happened. 
     <lb/>
     The country knows what happened. I am quite 
     <lb/>
     sure we could have finished the job in four 
     <lb/>
     months instead of dragging it on for 16 months. 
     <lb/>
     It just goes to show, one never knows. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have in Newfoundland today a position of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity; and I say that having due regard to the 
     <lb/>
     numbers of people who today in this country find 
     <lb/>
     it impossible to make a living. We all know that 
     <lb/>
     is something that is present in every other country 
     <lb/>
     in the world today, and without reference to 
     <lb/>
     Europe or Asia, without reference to these parts 
     <lb/>
     of the world, I say it is true of this side of the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic Ocean. Why, even in the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces 3,000 wage earners had to leave their 
  

            <pb n="1380" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1380.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1380</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
   

     homes and go to other parts of Canada and some 
     <lb/>
     to the USA, to earn a living. That is something 
     <lb/>
     which is apparently unavoidable. We are bound 
     <lb/>
     to have with us at all times, irrespective of our 
     <lb/>
     form of government, irrespective of our state of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, a percentage of people who find it 
     <lb/>
     difficult to make a living; we have them today. 
     <lb/>
     And with that qualification, I say that New<lb break="no"/>foundland today is more prosperous than ever in 
     <lb/>
     the past. The whole country is being developed 
     <lb/>
     slowly but surely. Her population has increased 
     <lb/>
     and is increasing, and I am quite sure that, given 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity, the people of this country can 
     <lb/>
     make the necessary industrial and commercial 
     <lb/>
     deals with other countries, whereby we can sell 
     <lb/>
     these things which we produce. We are produc<lb break="no"/>ing today much more than our ancestors or fore<lb break="no"/>fathers. They stood up and fought like men for 
     <lb/>
     the privilege of governing their own affairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we cast our minds back to those days of Dr. 
     <lb/>
     Carson, John Kent and many others — and, sir, I 
     <lb/>
     have heard what I consider disrespectful words 
     <lb/>
     used towards these ancestors of ours — I say they 
     <lb/>
     were brave men. They had nothing much to stand 
     <lb/>
     up for at that time, but still they believed in the 
     <lb/>
     right of mankind to have a say in the way in which 
     <lb/>
     they lived and the way in which they should be 
     <lb/>
     governed. They were brave men. God grant that 
     <lb/>
     this day and generation has produced enough 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders to see that we shall regain our 
     <lb/>
     political independence and thereby enhance our 
     <lb/>
     opportunities to achieve our economic inde<lb break="no"/>pendence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, the question now 
     <lb/>
     before the Convention is the one which is causing 
     <lb/>
     so much confusion in the minds of our people, 
     <lb/>
     and there are a very large number who cannot see 
     <lb/>
     why they should not, if they want to, vote for 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada in the referendum in 
     <lb/>
     the coming spring, and it is these very people who 
     <lb/>
     must be protected against themselves, for their 
     <lb/>
     fickle minds are their own worst enemies, for 
     <lb/>
     surely if such an important step is really good for 
     <lb/>
     this country, it is worthy of the closest study and 
     <lb/>
     negotiations between our two sovereign govern<lb break="no"/>ments, who on our side would have full powers 
     <lb/>
     to argue for the best possible terms for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. It is utter folly and nonsense for 
     <lb/>
     anyone to argue that Newfoundland has not got 
     <lb/>
     a much greater bargaining power today than ever 
     <lb/>
     before. It is also idle trash to argue that she is not 


            <cb/>
      

     in a better position today to take care of her own 
     <lb/>
     household, and for my part, if there is going to be 
     <lb/>
     any real serious outside bargaining done with the 
     <lb/>
     very thing we should value most — our liberty 
     <lb/>
     — it will be every step of the way with the power 
     <lb/>
     who will give the greatest liberty commensurate 
     <lb/>
     with the greatest amount of economic and social 
     <lb/>
     security. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the federal government of Canada will 
     <lb/>
     equalise our debts in some way or other so that 
     <lb/>
     we can enter the union on equal terms, and with 
     <lb/>
     a guarantee of sufficient revenue to balance our 
     <lb/>
     budget as a province, then and only then would I 
     <lb/>
     feel justified in recommending to our people that 
     <lb/>
     they vote for confederation this spring. The 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland elected us to do a job 
     <lb/>
     for them. We took it upon ourselves to study and 
     <lb/>
     place a value on a certain deal, the very serious 
     <lb/>
     matter of confederation. We have carefully 
     <lb/>
     studied this matter, and in the opinion of the great 
     <lb/>
     majority, the price or terms offered are not con<lb break="no"/>ducive to the best interest of our people. That 
     <lb/>
     being so, I would say to our critics, "Would it be 
     <lb/>
     honourable or honest on our part to advise our 
     <lb/>
     people to close the deal?" If Mr. Smallwood sent 
     <lb/>
     me out to look at a piece of land he was consider<lb break="no"/>ing buying, and I considered the land worth 
     <lb/>
     $2,000, and the price was $5,000, would Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood consider me honest and honourable 
     <lb/>
     to advise him to pay the five, at the same time 
     <lb/>
     knowing in my opinion it was not worth over 
     <lb/>
     two? If he would pay the five, would he not 
     <lb/>
     forever after curse and abuse me for falsely ad<lb break="no"/>vising him into a bad bargain? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are the trusted servants of the people who 
     <lb/>
     sent us here. We have a serious duty to perform, 
     <lb/>
     and that duty is to honestly represent the people 
     <lb/>
     who have commissioned us to do an intricate, 
     <lb/>
     serious and responsible piece of work. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     be swayed by our emotions, or the emotions of 
     <lb/>
     anyone else who may be grasping for the 
     <lb/>
     shadows without counting the cost. It is not cor<lb break="no"/>rect for anyone to even imagine that the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the members of the Convention are prejudiced 
     <lb/>
     against confederation, or even entertain one 
     <lb/>
     single hard feeling against Canada or Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     for it is an undeniable fact that as two separate 
     <lb/>
     countries, we are now the closest kin and the most 
     <lb/>
     united of any two countries on the face of the 
     <lb/>
     earth, and it is my considered opinion that unless 
     <lb/>
     the federal government is seriously lacking in

     ordinary good sense, a union of the two countries 
     <lb/>
     can be finalised within two years. I feel positive, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, that those who favour such an 
     <lb/>
     important step are not seriously considering the 
     <lb/>
     grave implications of what might be the result of 
     <lb/>
     a headlong plunge in the dark. Has the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie King not clearly intimated that the 
     <lb/>
     deal could only be finally negotiated with a 
     <lb/>
     sovereign government of Newfoundland? I am 
     <lb/>
     very, very doubtful that the British government 
     <lb/>
     would recognise a deal sponsored or negotiated 
     <lb/>
     by such an unauthorised and unofficial body as 
     <lb/>

     such matters, and we have no legal or moral right 
     <lb/>
     to attempt to bluff or pretend to our people that 
     <lb/>
     we have. In seeking a basis of terms for union, we 
     <lb/>
     have fully exhausted our rights in the matter and 
     <lb/>
     it now rests with the people who would favour 
     <lb/>
     union to elect a government to negotiate the best 
     <lb/>
     possible terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> has stated that 99 out of every 
     <lb/>
     100 of our people want confederation. How low 
     <lb/>
     does he think the mentality of our people has 
     <lb/>
     fallen to believe such trash? There may be, and 
     <lb/>
     no doubt are, a lot of people who want confedera<lb break="no"/>tion if they can get fair and equitable terms; but 
     <lb/>
     we all mix with most of the same people and we 
     <lb/>
     find that pretty close to nine out of every ten are 
     <lb/>
     a bit dubious about these so-called terms, and 
     <lb/>
     almost all feel we should have self-government 
     <lb/>
     restored, and the two parties enter the field and 
     <lb/>
     test the people fairly in a general election next 
     <lb/>
     fall. A lot of people wanted Commission, but 
     <lb/>
     cursed them less than a year after they were 
     <lb/>
     appointed. This business of confederation must 
     <lb/>
     be a matter put fairly on the shoulders of the 
     <lb/>
     people through their elected representatives, and 
     <lb/>
     if seven men can run the country by Commission, 
     <lb/>
     so can seven men run it by any other form of 
     <lb/>
     government. In my opinion the high number we 
     <lb/>
     have always had to run a one-man business has 
     <lb/>
     been responsible for many of our past ills. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> said our people are not going 
     <lb/>
     to be fooled again as they were in 1869, neither

     will they be fooled by the lies of 1948. I must 
     <lb/>
     agree with him. I give our people full credit of 
     <lb/>
     possessing good sense to judge fairly who is 
     <lb/>
     putting over the lies and false propaganda in 
     <lb/>
     1948. On the whole our people are a wise,

     of this Convention with a keen ear to every word,

            <p>
     We heard the best communistic speech here 
     <lb/>
     on Friday that was ever delivered in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. In fact, it surpassed anything I have 
     <lb/>
     ever heard on a soapbox in Hyde Park, and I 
     <lb/>
    venture the opinion that if the same speech was 
     <lb/>delivered in Canada, the USA or Great Britain, 
     <lb/>the party delivering it would be convicted in court 
     <lb/>for such utterances. It was only a few days ago 
     <lb/>Mr. Bevin said, "We should not foist our system 
     <lb/>on Soviet Russia and they have no right to foist 
     <lb/>theirs on us." Mr. Attlee said, "We cannot have 
     <lb/>theirs without sacrificing human rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ty." Mr. Bevin said, "We are resolutely opposed 
     <lb/>to the Communist way of life." Britain, he said, 
     <lb/>was opposed to the Communist conception of 
     <lb/>uniformity. "The essence of democracy is dif<lb break="no"/>ference of opinion, free discussion and tolerance 
     <lb/>of the other people's point of view. The world we 
     <lb/>want to see is one in which there are a number of 
     <lb/>diverse and different units as compared with the 
     <lb/>Communist world, in which, we might say they 
     <lb/>try to make Newfoundland a copy of Russia." Mr. 
     <lb/>Churchill supported both Mr. Attlee and Mr. 
     <lb/>Bevin in their views. I wonder what these 
     <lb/>gentlemen will think if they happen to drop in at 
     <lb/>the committee rooms to hear the recordings of the 
     <lb/>proceedings of the National Convention? Will 
     <lb/>Friday's proceedings not give them serious food 
     <lb/>for thought? I am all for co-operation. I am all for 
     <lb/>democratic socialism; but I am not for installing 
     <lb/>a communistic dictator in our midst; neither will 
     <lb/>labour or capital tolerate such an individual or 
     <lb/>group who attempt to foist it on an unsuspecting 
     <lb/>public. Canada is teeming with such soapbox 
     <lb/>orators, but now and then their activities are 
     <lb/>curbed.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I am of the opinion that a

     number of people both in the Convention and

    on a rock called Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>With a carefree roll our caribou stroll 
     <lb/>Through the brush of our hinterland. 
     <lb/>But our populace brave, tries our pride to 
     <lb/>save, 
     <lb/>Our appeal will soon be heard, 
     <lb/>The Lords and Peers of the British heirs 
     <lb/>will examine just what occurred. 
     <lb/>Two-thirds, they will say, must have their 
     <lb/>way, 
     <lb/>That's democracy simple and pure. 
     <lb/>Confederation is out, there is now no doubt, 
    
            <cb/>
         

     It must be settled next year on the floor. 
     <lb/>
     Then the terms we have scanned, will be 
     <lb/>
     improved grand, 
     <lb/>
    By our neighbours on Cabot Strait shore.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think they are intrigued by 
     <lb/>
     your poetic endeavours, like I am myself. I am 
     <lb/>
     forced to remind you that time is running out and 
     <lb/>
     the time limit for this debate is to expire in 
     <lb/>
     expressly 24 hours. I hope there is not going to

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEN3">Mr. Spencer</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the 
     <lb/>
     motion before the Chair. I am strongly of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that this Convention must recommend 
     <lb/>
     confederation to be put before the people in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. I cannot see how even one member 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention can vote against letting our 
     <lb/>
     people decide this question. It is the solemn duty 
     <lb/>
     of every member here to give the people the 
     <lb/>
     chance to say if they want confederation, or if 
     <lb/>
     they do not want it. We all have the same duty, 
     <lb/>
     whether we personally favour confederation or 
     <lb/>
     not. We should not let personal likes or dislikes 
     <lb/>
     enter into the picture at all. After all, we in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention are not deciding which form of 
     <lb/>
     government our country shall have, for that is the 
     <lb/>
     people's right. If we of this Convention had the 
     <lb/>
     right to decide the question, then there would be 
     <lb/>
     no need for holding a referendum. We were sent 
     <lb/>
     here to recommend forms of government to be 
     <lb/>
     laid before the people for their choice. That is as 
     <lb/>
     far as we can go; and it is the plain duty of every 
     <lb/>
     man here to support this motion to place con<lb break="no"/>federation before the people. I, for one, will be 
     <lb/>
     perfectly satisfied for the people to decide 
     <lb/>
     whether our future government will be con<lb break="no"/>federation or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In seconding the motion, Mr. Banfield said he 
     <lb/>
     was voicing the feeling of the southwest coast. I 
     <lb/>
     know that is true. I also know that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the southwest coast want confederation to be on 
     <lb/>
     the ballot in the referendum — yes, and are 
     <lb/>
     anxiously awaiting the opportunity to vote for it. 
     <lb/>
     I do not suppose any man would stand in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention and say the people of the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast are not Newfoundlanders. I think you 
     <lb/>
     would all agree that they are good New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, and that our fishermen are amongst 
     <lb/>
     the finest in the country. How can any member 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention vote to deny those thousands 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundlanders the chance to vote for the 


            <pb n="1383" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1383.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1383</fw>
      

     form of government they want? Would any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this Convention say to those people of the 
     <lb/>
     southwest coast, "I do not care if you want con<lb break="no"/>federation or not, I am not going to give you a 
     <lb/>
     chance to vote for it?" But that is exactly what 
     <lb/>
     you will be saying if you vote against this motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But it is not only the people of the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast who want confederation to go on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     paper. There are thousands all around this 
     <lb/>
     country and in Labrador who want it; and right 
     <lb/>
     here in St. John's there are many people who 
     <lb/>
     would vote for it. Is any member of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion going to deny those people the chance to vote 
     <lb/>
     for what they want in the referendum? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If this motion is voted down in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, it will only make confederation stronger in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Our people have a strong sense 
     <lb/>
     of fair play, and they will know what to think of 
     <lb/>
     members who vote to deprive them of a free 
     <lb/>
     choice in the referendum this spring. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people of Newfoundland, sir, have 
     <lb/>
     learned a great many things in late years, and they 
     <lb/>
     have begun to realise that we are too small a 
     <lb/>
     country to stand alone. We have a small popula<lb break="no"/>tion scattered over a very large area. We do not 
     <lb/>
     have a large variety of natural resources. Our 
     <lb/>
     whole economy depends upon three industries — 
     <lb/>
     fishery, forestry and minerals. No doubt our 
     <lb/>
     fishery could stand further development, and we 
     <lb/>
     may some day see more mineral developments 
     <lb/>
     than we now have; but it is doubtful if we shall 
     <lb/>
     see any marked increase in our forestry develop<lb break="no"/>ment. Except for our paper mills, we have no 
     <lb/>
     highly developed industry. We are a country of 
     <lb/>
     primary production. We still have to depend too 
     <lb/>
     much on one industry, the fisheries, and when 
     <lb/>
     something happens to upset that industry our 
     <lb/>
     whole economy suffers. We still have too many 
     <lb/>
     eggs in one basket, so to speak. When one goes 
     <lb/>
     down, they all go down and our people are left 
     <lb/>
     penniless. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What we have to beware of, Mr. Chairman, is 
     <lb/>
     another depression. Some of our members here 
     <lb/>
     assure us that we need not fear another depres<lb break="no"/>sion. They have told us that there are no shadows 
     <lb/>
     on the road ahead. Well, maybe they are right. I 
     <lb/>
     sincerely hope they are; but can we depend on our 
     <lb/>
     not having another depression? I do not think we 
     <lb/>
     can. That is one of the dangers we must keep in 
     <lb/>
     mind. For if another depression strikes us, and we 
     <lb/>
     are on our own trying to paddle our own canoe, 


            <cb/>
        

     where shall we be? Back where we were in 1933. 
     <lb/>
     Then we would be wishing we were linked up 
     <lb/>
     with a larger country, and that is one of the things 
     <lb/>
     we must bear in mind when the vote is taken on 
     <lb/>
     this motion. We all know what conditions were 
     <lb/>
     like in 1933 and up until the last great war. We 
     <lb/>
     have very vivid memories of our people trying to 
     <lb/>
     exist on six cents a day, and many who were 
     <lb/>
     unwilling to accept relief, working for almost 
     <lb/>
     nothing, to keep their families alive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You may ask, would confederation guarantee 
     <lb/>
     that these things would not happen again? Per<lb break="no"/>haps it would not. But as part of a larger country,  
     <lb/>
     with free trade with that country, the lower cost 
     <lb/>
     of living would better fit us to meet a depression 
     <lb/>
     if it came; and if under confederation a depres<lb break="no"/>sion did come, the Canadian family allowance 
     <lb/>
     would see to it that our children under 16 years 
     <lb/>
     of age have something better than six cents a day 
     <lb/>
     to look forward to; and the increased old age 
     <lb/>
     pension would guarantee our old people who 
     <lb/>
     needed it a fair share of the necessities of life. I 
     <lb/>
     am afraid the answer to all these questions is 
     <lb/>
     already known to our people. Our people have 
     <lb/>
     already asked themselves these questions, sir, 
     <lb/>
     and they have already answered them as well. 
     <lb/>
     And that is why so many thousands of them have 
     <lb/>
     made up their minds to vote for confederation. 
     <lb/>
     There is not a member of this Convention who 
     <lb/>
     will deny that there are many thousands of con<lb break="no"/>federates in our country today. That being so, it 
     <lb/>
     becomes the duty of every one of us here to vote 
     <lb/>
     for this motion.

            <fw type="num">1384</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
   

     which I direct your attention, is put only with the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the Chairman. I know you were only 
     <lb/>
     trying to assist me, but as the floor is now oc<lb break="no"/>cupied by Mr. Cranford, I will defer putting the 
     <lb/>
     motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRAN1">Mr. Cranford</persName> Mr. Chairman, for five weeks the 
     <lb/>
     proposals for confederation with the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada was debated in this chamber, and I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if the people of this country understand 
     <lb/>
     those proposals any better than they did when we 
     <lb/>
     began. There is one thing that I am sure of, and 
     <lb/>
     that is our people do not know how they are going 
     <lb/>
     to be taxed in order to finance a province if we 
     <lb/>
     decided to become a province of Canada. That is 
     <lb/>
     one thing I am sure of, as I have taken a very keen 
     <lb/>
     interest in this matter, and as yet I do not know, 
     <lb/>
     and the fact is it has not been outlined to us and 
     <lb/>
     it cannot be expected for any person outside of 
     <lb/>
     this chamber to know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been said in Canada that we are a touchy 
     <lb/>
     and suspicious people, of which I plead guilty, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the goings-on in our political life. If we 
     <lb/>
     were not touchy and suspicious, it would be very 
     <lb/>
     little interest we would have in the support of our 
     <lb/>
     families. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, much has been said about 
     <lb/>
     direct and indirect taxes. Now let us consider for 
     <lb/>
     one moment which of the two is best for a fisher<lb break="no"/>man. If the tax is direct, fishermen will have a 
     <lb/>
     yearly amount to pay, good voyage or bad voyage 
     <lb/>
     — that direct tax must be paid or charged against 
     <lb/>
     him. If the tax is indirect, it is the same as we are 
     <lb/>
     used to. The years of a good voyage we spend all 
     <lb/>
     our money on all necessities of life to replace the 
     <lb/>
     badly worn, and to buy extras that we were not 
     <lb/>
     able to buy when we have a bad voyage. In the 
     <lb/>
     years of a bad voyage we curtail our spending 
     <lb/>
     wherever possible and we mend and re-mend our 
     <lb/>
     clothing and make other things do us for that year, 
     <lb/>
     in order to try and balance our budget; and 
     <lb/>
     believe me, in years of bad voyages we do not 
     <lb/>
     pay much in the form of customs duty, when we 
     <lb/>
     consider the principal part of a fisherman's food 
     <lb/>
     is on the free list. Therefore Mr. Chairman, in<lb break="no"/>direct taxes are better for a fisherman; because 
     <lb/>
     how is a fisherman going to pay a direct tax in a 
     <lb/>
     year of a bad voyage or even an average voyage, 
     <lb/>
     when he can just square his family account and 
     <lb/>
     try and find something to do in order to try and 
     <lb/>
     carry him through to the next season? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you can imagine 


            <cb/>
        

     how odd it sounds to me when a person asks the 
     <lb/>
     question about the political feeling in any district, 
     <lb/>
     when they ask how do the people take the con<lb break="no"/>federation issue? To me, sir, this question sounds 
     <lb/>
     out of place, inasmuch as I am sure there is not a 
     <lb/>
     person in Newfoundland today who knows what 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada would mean to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. On one hand we are offered family 
     <lb/>
     allowances and so on. On the other hand, we are 
     <lb/>
     asked to give our God-given rights together with 
     <lb/>
     an assurance that we will not use our surplus that 
     <lb/>
     will foster our industries that will be in competi<lb break="no"/>tion with Canadian industries. Now, sir, that 
     <lb/>
     means we are asked to allow Canada monopolies 
     <lb/>
     that would be against us. The word "monopolies" 
     <lb/>
     stinks in my nostrils. I am a man that is against 
     <lb/>
     monopolies — we have had a few to contend 
     <lb/>
     with, and because we have had a few, will I for 
     <lb/>
     spite give the whole of our trade to another 
     <lb/>
     country to be monopolised? Sir, in view of this 
     <lb/>
     how can any person decide on confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada? I think, sir, the advocates of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion should he held responsible for all the 
     <lb/>
     promises made, as I feel sure they are made to be 
     <lb/>
     broken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Chairman, you may consider what I have 
     <lb/>
     just said to be in the nature of a joke, but I was 
     <lb/>
     never more serious in my life, as I consider this 
     <lb/>
     confederation issue of grave concern to all of us, 
     <lb/>
     since in the past we have been made into a 
     <lb/>
     political football without any consideration for 
     <lb/>
     the welfare of the people. It is time for us to hold 
     <lb/>
     someone responsible for their doings. As we all 
     <lb/>
     realise, all the changes that have taken place in 
     <lb/>
     our political life have been done by a few and not 
     <lb/>
     by the majority of the people, and I say it is high 
     <lb/>
     time we call a halt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Chairman, I am not one of those who can 
     <lb/>
     be deluded by any flowery offer or promise of 
     <lb/>
     any person, and I would like to call the attention 
     <lb/>
     of this house and the country in general to the 
     <lb/>
     words of Mr. Smallwood when he polished off 
     <lb/>
     his address on Wednesday, January 14, when he 
     <lb/>
     said that $16 million would be given by Canada 
     <lb/>
     yearly to the province of Newfoundland if we 
     <lb/>
     should become such, and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada regards that amount as mere chicken 
     <lb/>
     feed. Now, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe one 
     <lb/>
     word of that statement, not one word. And the 
     <lb/>
     fact is, that statement has caused me to take all 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Smallwood has said on this matter with 
 

            <pb n="1385" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1385.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1385</fw>
      

     a pinch of salt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
  Mr. Chairman, during my business life I have 
     <lb/>
     had business dealings with Canadians, and I have 
     <lb/>
     found some of them to be as crooked as God is 
     <lb/>
     straight; and if we give them the monopoly of our 
     <lb/>
     trade that Mr. Smallwood advocates, I predict 
     <lb/>
     that within five years, if we can survive at all, the 
     <lb/>
     majority of Newfoundlanders will be obliged to 
     <lb/>
     leave their island home and seek refuge in some 
     <lb/>
     foreign land, or be no better situated than if we 
     <lb/>
     all lived on the most northerly part of Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     I really believe that. After all, Canadians, in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government or out, are only ordinary 
     <lb/>
     individuals and are as subject to taking advantage 
     <lb/>
     from monopolies as people from any other land. 
     <lb/>
     And I do not blame them, no more than I do the 
     <lb/>
     people who have the monopoly of trade in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I do blame the governments who give 
     <lb/>
     these monopolies to the people who enjoy them 
     <lb/>
     to the detriment of the people in general. If we go 
     <lb/>
     into confederation with Canada, and that country 
     <lb/>
     takes advantage of the monopolies given, which 
     <lb/>
     is only natural to expect them to do, I will blame 
     <lb/>
     it on the advocates of confederation, and on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood in particular. No one in this chamber 
     <lb/>
     knows better than Mr. Smallwood how bitter I am 
     <lb/>
     against monopolies. I do regard them as parasites, 
     <lb/>
     because they are sure to eat into the life of any 
     <lb/>
     business into which they are allowed to apply. It 
     <lb/>
     is senseless, criminal, devilish and the worst 
     <lb/>
     thing to happen in any country. It is a scourge that 
     <lb/>
     everybody in this country should fight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Hear! Hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRAN1">Mr. Cranford</persName> Talk about the TB scourge! Why 
     <lb/>
     the TB germs in this country are only angels 
     <lb/>
     compared with that monstrous parasite called 
     <lb/>
     monopoly, because there is no cure. It is 
     <lb/>
     protected by the laws of the land to devour us. It 
     <lb/>
     has been in the past, and if we the people do not 
     <lb/>
     crush it in its infancy, there is no hope for us. If 
     <lb/>
     there had been no monopolies in this country, I 
     <lb/>
     would have never been seen in this assembly. I 
     <lb/>
     am sure it is the root of all our troubles, and I 
     <lb/>
     would like to go on record in advising the advo<lb break="no"/>cates of confederation to be very careful in their 
     <lb/>
     offers and promises that may cause the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country to make a mistake by voting for 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada; a mistake they will 
     <lb/>
     make if that germ monopolies is given as outlined 
     <lb/>
     in the Grey Book. If that happens, and it turns out 
     <lb/>
     within a few years that the people have made a 


            <cb/>
      

     mistake, I assure these gentlemen there will be a 
     <lb/>
     reaction and Newfoundlanders will be fooled just 
     <lb/>
     once too often. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I intended to speak when the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     proposals for confederation was taking place and 
     <lb/>
     to ask Mr. Smallwood a few questions, but after 
     <lb/>
     hearing Mr. Smallwood's answers to questions 
     <lb/>
     put forward by other members, I took it for 
     <lb/>
     granted that Mr. Smallwood was on a political 
     <lb/>
     campaign and the Black Books were his manifes<lb break="no"/>to — and a dirty one with that, as they can be 
     <lb/>
     subjected to deception, or in any light they would 
     <lb/>
     persuade the electorate to vote for confederation, 
     <lb/>
     without giving it any consideration if it was bad 
     <lb/>
     or good for this country; and I, not being inter<lb break="no"/>ested in any party politics, did not feel inclined to 
     <lb/>
     take part in a political campaign at that time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, as I said before, we New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders were accused of being touchy and 
     <lb/>
     suspicious, of which I plead guilty. I will admit 
     <lb/>
     my suspicions have been greatly aroused during 
     <lb/>
     the past five weeks, and time alone will show me 
     <lb/>
     if my suspicions were well-founded; and the fact 
     <lb/>
     that monopolies have been introduced in the offer 
     <lb/>
     of confederation with Canada. I cannot support 
     <lb/>
     the motion. My not supporting this motion does 
     <lb/>
     not mean that I am taking away the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     the people from voting for confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada; because the advocates of confederation 
     <lb/>
     can vote for responsible government to be placed 
     <lb/>
     on the ballot paper in the referendum this spring, 
     <lb/>
     and if responsible government wins, they can 
     <lb/>
     place a party in the field and issue a manifesto 
     <lb/>
     setting forth just what taxes we will be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to pay if we become a province of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and guarantee the electorate that we will not be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to give Canada the monopoly of all 
     <lb/>
     our trade; also that the province will not be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to pay any property tax, and no settlement 
     <lb/>
     will be forced against the people's will to form 
     <lb/>
     town councils, as promised by Mr. Smallwood — 
     <lb/>
     this will be giving the people something definite 
     <lb/>
     to vote for. If that is done, I will be one of the 
     <lb/>
     most ardent supporters of confederation in this 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, in June 1946, in my radio 
     <lb/>
     address to the electors of Trinity Centre, I said 
     <lb/>
     that I was fully convinced that one of the pests 
     <lb/>
     that ate the prop from under our economic struc<lb break="no"/>ture was monopolies, and this Convention has 
     <lb/>
     confirmed my conviction. I am sure that everyone 


            <pb n="1386" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-26_Page_1386.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1386</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
       

     in the hearing of my voice knows there was only 
     <lb/>
     a portion of our trade monopolised under respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, which can, at this enlightened 
     <lb/>
     age, be remedied by ourselves. But to give 
     <lb/>
     Canada, or any country, a monopoly of all our 
     <lb/>
     trade is ridiculous. What is behind it all? Are 
     <lb/>
     there any selfish motives? That is the question we 
     <lb/>
     may ask ourselves also. What do we see in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian proposals that may cause us to throw 
     <lb/>
     in our all to them, and give them the monopoly 
     <lb/>
     of all our trade, and leave it to the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to say who we shall deal with or who 
     <lb/>
     we shall not deal with? To me, the idea is 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous. I have come to the conclusion that the 
     <lb/>
     information that we now have is not conducive 
     <lb/>
     enough to cause us to leap in the dark by voting 
     <lb/>
     for confederation with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, maybe this is the last time that 
     <lb/>
     I may have the privilege of rising in this chamber 
     <lb/>
     to speak, but I am sure there are members here 
     <lb/>
     today who will be back. I would like to ask them 
     <lb/>
     that whenever anything arises that is not in the 
     <lb/>
     best interest of the country, such as monopolies, 
     <lb/>
     to think of me. Thank you and God bless you all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is a motion before the<lb/>

     Chair that the debate be now adjourned. I have 
     <lb/>
     the discretion of withholding or putting that mo<lb break="no"/>tion. I am reluctant to put it unless I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that no member wishes to address himself on the 
     <lb/>
     business before the Chair. But again, lest my 
     <lb/>
     position on this matter be in any way 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood, I am personally ready to sit here 
     <lb/>
     until seven o'clock tomorrow rather than have 
     <lb/>
     any suggestion subsequently arise that I was 
     <lb/>
     hindering directly or indirectly any member from 
     <lb/>
     addressing himself to the business before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. But again I have to remind members that 
     <lb/>
     according to the schedule laid down for me by the 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention, the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     motion is scheduled to end tomorrow evening. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Could you ascertain how many 
     <lb/>members would like to speak? We have had ten 
     <lb/>speak up to now, that leaves 34 still to speak 
     <lb/>between three o'clock tomorrow afternoon and 
     <lb/>11 tomorrow night. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is why I warn members

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't know 
     <lb/>
     whether the order of the day is open for debate 
     <lb/>
     now, is it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is just one matter I want 
     <lb/>
     to dispose of first. Members will recall that on 
     <lb/>
     Thursday the 22nd inst. there was a resolution 
     <lb/>
     passed by the House, requiring me to record the 
     <lb/>
     vote of any member on forms of government who 
     <lb/>
     was absent through illness or through other un<lb break="no"/>controllable or unforseen circumstances. In the 
     <lb/>
     case of the Hon. Mr. Brown, who the House 
     <lb/>
     knows has been convalescing for some time on 
     <lb/>
     his doctor's orders, it was not possible for him to 
     <lb/>
     be in the House at the time the vote on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins' motion on responsible government and 
     <lb/>
     Commission government was taken, and I have 
     <lb/>
     received a note from Mr. Brown that he was in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the motion, but he had no preference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     In conformity with the spirit of the motion I have 
     <lb/>
     requested the Secretary to record Mr. Brown as 
     <lb/>
     supporting Mr. Higgins' motion, and also stating 
     <lb/>
     that he had no preference between the two forms 
     <lb/>
     of government included in that motion. In the 
     <lb/>
     case of the member for Bell Island, Mr. Jackman, 
     <lb/>
     he was also absent because of illness; he con<lb break="no"/>sulted me about the matter today, and I told him 
     <lb/>
     I would feel duty bound to report his attitude on 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins motion, and he is to instruct me in 
     <lb/>
     writing. That Mr. Jackman proposes to do, and 
     <lb/>
     upon receipt of his instructions in writing, like in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Mr. Brown and Mr. Job, I propose to 
     <lb/>
     record Mr. Jackrnan's views on the motion itself, 
     <lb/>
     together with any preference that he may express 
     <lb/>
     between the two forms of government covered by 
     <lb/>
     the motion. Will you take notice of that, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Secretary?
