     controlled entirely away from this country — 
     <lb/>
     railway, telegraph, control of roads in an emer<lb break="no"/>gency, our government marine fleet, our broad<lb break="no"/>casting corporation. In short, we are giving up the 
     <lb/>
     control of all our essential communications, and 
     <lb/>
     all that might mean to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland if (and God forbid) we should get into 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. We are giving up the control of our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. We are giving up the right to decide on 
     <lb/>
     the question of conscription for ourselves, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that we have down through our history 
     <lb/>
     prided ourselves that we have always turned out 
     <lb/>
     on a voluntary basis enough people to do as 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     much, and probably more than our share in the 
     <lb/>
     defence of freedom. We are giving up this too, 
     <lb/>
     the right to fix our own rates of taxation, and on 
     <lb/>
     that I would like to have one word on sales tax 
     <lb/>
     alone. I am not going into the question of taxation 
     <lb/>
     fully. I am going to say one thing on what was 
     <lb/>
     not brought out particularly, the general sales tax; 
     <lb/>
     that is an indirect tax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As the hour is late, I now move that the com<lb break="no"/>mittee rise and report progress. 
     <lb/>
     [The committee rose and reported progress, and 
     <lb/>
     the Convention adjourned]

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I give notice that I will tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     ask His Excellency the Governor in Commission 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain from His Majesty's Government the 
     <lb/>
     following information: In the referendum that is 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be held in the spring of 1948, will 
     <lb/>
     such a referendum will be decided and a future 
     <lb/>
     form of government selected on the basis of (a) 
     <lb/>
     the form of government on the ballot which 
     <lb/>
     received 51% of the total votes cast; (b) the form 
     <lb/>
     of government which received the majority of 
     <lb/>
     votes cast; (c) the form of government which 
     <lb/>
     receives a greater number of votes than any

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I again draw to your attention 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the question regarding the Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada has not been answered. I drew it to your 
     <lb/>
     attention yesterday, and I have asked you to find 
     <lb/>
     out whether or not we're going to get an answer. 
     <lb/>
     If they are not going to answer, let them say so 
     <lb/>
     right here and now. That's number one. Second<lb break="no"/>ly, I asked the question with regard to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Savings Bank. And I just want to say 
     <lb/>
     this, that if I don't get a satisfactory answer to 
     <lb/>
     both of these questions tomorrow, I'm going to 
     <lb/>
     take some other steps. These are questions, 
     <lb/>
     proper questions put on the order paper and if you 
     <lb/>
     ignore them — I don't say the Savings Bank 
     <lb/>
     question is being ignored, because it's only been 
     <lb/>
     there since yesterday, but the other one has been 
     <lb/>
     there since the end of November and has been 
     <lb/>
     deliberately ignored. I want an answer to that

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your question relating to the

     it yesterday, I requested the Secretary to get in 
     <lb/>
     touch with W. J. Carew, the Secretary to the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     so, with what result I'm unfortunately unable to

     <lb/>
     in this Convention, but if that question is not 
     <lb/>
     answered tomorrow, I'm going to take some 
     <lb/>
     other steps. I'll certainly take steps in connection 
     <lb/>
     with our own Savings Bank. I have all kinds of 
     <lb/>
     information regarding it. It's my job to find that 
     <lb/>
     kind of thing out. I'll have very good information 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the Bank of Canada. But I want the 
     <lb/>
     information officially. Unless they are prepared 
     <lb/>
     to come along with that, I can't see why they 
     <lb/>
     chuck terms at us; they're not prepared to tell us 
     <lb/>
     their financial position.

     <lb/>
     — there's nothing in the Black Books about it, or

     <lb/>
     happen to the Newfoundland Savings Bank in the 
     <lb/>
     event of Newfoundland becoming the tenth 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. I know, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     in Canada there's no government savings bank, 
     <lb/>
     none. To date the Newfoundland people have $20 
     <lb/>
     million approximately in that bank ... and the 
     <lb/>
     average rate of interest paid to depositors last 
     <lb/>
     year works out to practically 2.75%. Now if that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Savings Bank is to be abolished, 
     <lb/>
     the only interest that people would get on their 
     <lb/>
     monies in the ordinary Canadian chartered banks 
     <lb/>
     today would be 1.5% and in some instances they 
     <lb/>
     won't get that. Now, what is 2.75% interest on

     $20 million? It's over $500,000 a year, and that's 
     <lb/>
     to be reduced as I see it by over $200,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     If that is so, Mr. Chairman, I want to know it; and 
     <lb/>
     the depositors ought to be told it. The Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation ought to be able to tell us that, but 
     <lb/>
     they're not. Because there's nothing in the Black

     <lb/>
     official source besides Mr. Smallwood. If that 
     <lb/>
     was told them in Ottawa, it should have been 
     <lb/>
     included in one of these 25 cent books. I haven't 
     <lb/>
     seen it in any of the secret documents. If I don't 
     <lb/>
     know officially tomorrow, I'm going to bring the 
     <lb/>
     matter to the attention of the country. We're not 
     <lb/>
     taking Mr. Smallwood's word for that, he 
     <lb/>
     wouldn't take mine. Furthermore, he hasn't even 
     <lb/>
     told us about the Bank of Canada.

     for a moment.... I was referring yesterday to a 
     <lb/>
     motion introduced by Mr. Jackman some time in 
     <lb/>
     the early part of our proceedings,<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     when this Convention had almost unanimously 
     <lb/>
     turned it down, I had been approached by people 
     <lb/>
     asking where I got the right to do such things. I 
     <lb/>
     generally refused, and said that a number of other 
     <lb/>
     members had also been censured by various 
     <lb/>
     people. At that time Mr. Smallwood interrrupted 
     <lb/>
     and said nobody had spoken to him on the matter. 
     <lb/>
     That's the statement as well as I recollect it. 
     <lb/>
     Nobody had spoken to him. Now either Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has lost his memory or else he's not 
     <lb/>
     telling the truth, because I was informed by a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman today that he had spoken to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, and had asked him what was the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of it, and that gentleman's name is Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Walter Dillon, who's a very prominent taxi-man 
     <lb/>
     of this town. It's merely for the purpose of the 
     <lb/>
     record, sir. that I intervene in this matter.

     he has to believe Mr. Walter Dillon or believe me, 


            <cb/>
         

     has his choice of behaving which of us he prefers. 
     <lb/>
     To put the matter straight, I did not say that no

     one had approached me. What Mr. Higgins sug<lb break="no"/>gested is pure waste of breath.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think it's time to put an end to 
     <lb/>
     this, gentlemen.... Mr. Butt you have the floor. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Yesterday, Mr. Chairman, I was 
     <lb/>enumerating some of the things which I consider 
     <lb/>of great importance, which Newfoundland, under 
     <lb/>the terms of confederation as given to us here, 
     <lb/>would have to give up. I did digress for a moment 
     <lb/>to say a word on the sales tax. I did that, sir, 
     <lb/>because I feel that there is a lot of misunderstand<lb break="no"/>ing on the point. Mr. Smallwood touched on it 
     <lb/>yesterday to a certain extent. For example, there's 
     <lb/>such a thing as a retail sales tax, which means that 
     <lb/>if you go and buy an article costing $1 in a store 
     <lb/>and the tax is 2%, the two cents is tacked on to 
 

<note xml:id="fn_02">[1] The motion was to send a delegation to Washington. Above, p.473.</note> 


            <pb n="1131" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1131.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1131</fw>
     

     that $1. But the sales tax referred to in these Black 
     <lb/>
     Books is an indirect tax. Its effect on the con<lb break="no"/>sumer is exactly the same as a customs duty. For 
     <lb/>
     example, if an article cost 50 cents either from the 
     <lb/>
     importer or the manufacturer to the retailer, the 
     <lb/>
     first thing he does is add on the 8% tax, which 
     <lb/>
     would make the article 54 cents. After that it's on 
     <lb/>
     the 54 cents that the retailer puts his markup or 
     <lb/>
     profit. An article which cost 50 cents ... would 
     <lb/>
     cost 76 cents. I've taken one item at 50 cents, but 
     <lb/>
     that is the principle that we must have in mind 
     <lb/>
     when we think of a sales tax. It is exactly the same 
     <lb/>
     in principle as a customs duty. It should be borne 
     <lb/>
     in mind that there has been in the last 16 months 
     <lb/>
     a considerable amount of discussion on the profit 
     <lb/>
     that is made on customs duties, and on the profit 
     <lb/>
     on profit. That's the way it's been said, exag<lb break="no"/>gerated beyond words to my mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was referring to the things we would give up, 
     <lb/>
     and in doing that I really moved on to clause 5 of 
     <lb/>
     the proposed arrangements. But there is clause 4 
     <lb/>
     and some people may have thought that I 
     <lb/>
     proposed to avoid clause 4, which concerns wel<lb break="no"/>fare services. Nothing was further from my mind. 
     <lb/>
     The welfare services enumerated in clause 4 are 
     <lb/>
     all good. Some such schemes must in the future 
     <lb/>
     be applied to Newfoundland if we are to keep 
     <lb/>
     abreast of the times. Any scheme however, that 
     <lb/>
     is applied to Newfoundland must be consistent 
     <lb/>
     with ....<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> national minimum standards, for the 
     <lb/>
     sole purpose of avoiding want, when the earnings 
     <lb/>
     of parents with large families for example, are 
     <lb/>
     either cut off or insufficient to avoid that want. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, it is wasteful and unjustified to 
     <lb/>
     pay family allowances, for example, to a man 
     <lb/>
     earning $5,000-$10,000 a year. I'll put this on a 
     <lb/>
     personal basis. I have never been able in my life 
     <lb/>
     to earn very much more then $3,000 a year. I have 
     <lb/>
     two children, and family allowances on the scale 
     <lb/>
     given by the Canadian federal government would 
     <lb/>
     be very nice. But I honestly feel that I am not 
     <lb/>
     entitled to family allowances as long as there are 
     <lb/>
     people in this country who earn way less than 
     <lb/>
     $3,000 a year, especially when I can offset my 
     <lb/>
     family allowances against what I would normally 
     <lb/>
     pay in income tax, which is the principle applied 
     <lb/>
     in the family income allowances in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     People in the same category may or may not face 
     <lb/>
     up to that position.... In England they have a 
 

            <cb/>
    

     family allowance scheme and the first child is 
     <lb/>
     exempt. That's one way of getting over the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty. I do not want to give you the impression 
     <lb/>
     that I'm an expert on social services, family al<lb break="no"/>lowances, or any of the welfare schemes. But I 
     <lb/>
     am concerned in the view which I have just 
     <lb/>
     expressed by reference to the Beveridge Report.<ref target="#fn_04">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     Anyone who wants to check on what I have said, 
     <lb/>
     a reasoned basis for it will find it on page 154 of 
     <lb/>
     that report. Also I would like members to read 
     <lb/>
     page 115 of a book which has been referred to 
     <lb/>
     many times in this Convention, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Quick Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Facts</hi>. Bear in mind sir, that what I have said must 
     <lb/>
     not be taken to mean that I am or will be in the 
     <lb/>
     future opposed to social welfare services 
     <lb/>
     wherever and whenever we can handle them. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever form of government we have in the 
     <lb/>
     future, these things must and will be brought 
     <lb/>
     about, provided we can find a solid basis for 
     <lb/>
     paying for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let's take the old age pension. Here 
     <lb/>
     again, I am all for it. I believe it is the measure of 
     <lb/>
     a people, the standard of civilisation, the way in 
     <lb/>
     which the younger generation will take their part 
     <lb/>
     in doing the fighting for their country, and also in 
     <lb/>
     the protection of both the young and the old.... I 
     <lb/>
     want you to look for one minute at the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Year Book</hi>, page 795. You will find there, that in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia for 1945-46 the average monthly 
     <lb/>
     payment on family allowances was $1 million. 
     <lb/>
     The population of Nova Scotia is 620,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That's right now — 620,000. The 
     <lb/>
     population of Newfoundland now is 320,000.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> 327,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> 327,000 — that makes it better from 
     <lb/>
     my point of view.... The point I am making is this 
     <lb/>
     and it's only a matter of half a million dollars or 
     <lb/>
     so, but our population is half the population of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. The payments there are at $12 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Half $12 million should be $6 million. The 
     <lb/>
     estimate given here for family allowances is 
     <lb/>
     $8,350,000.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> To begin with, the basis you 
     <lb/>
     were taking for Nova Scotia is merely the last 
     <lb/>
     three months of 1945. It's not a sufficiently long 
     <lb/>
     period on which to base anything. The other point

     is this. From province to province the actual 
     <lb/>
     payments made will depend upon the age group<lb break="no"/>ing of the population. If you compare our age 
     <lb/>

     of North America perhaps, you will find that we 
     <lb/>
     have a larger proportion of our population in the 
     <lb/>
     low age groupings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I'm coming to that, Mr. Smallwood. 
     <lb/>
     I'll take the first point — it's hardly a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     period on which to make an average..." It seems 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to say for practical purposes that the 
     <lb/>
     average amount paid in Nova Scotia is around $1 
     <lb/>
     million a month or $12 million a year. In New<lb break="no"/>foundland it ought to be six, make it seven. 
     <lb/>
     There's the difference of $1 million. That throws 
     <lb/>
     some doubt upon this probable estimate of expen<lb break="no"/>ditures, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let's turn now to the old age pensions. 
     <lb/>
     Remember now the population of Nova Scotia is 
     <lb/>
     just double that of Newfoundland. I found that 
     <lb/>
     the contributions for 1945 would be $2,879,000 
     <lb/>
     — half of that should be $1,400,000 for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The figure given in the possible es<lb break="no"/>timate of expenditure is $2 million for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, $2 to $2.6 million. Now, when 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood talks about the age group, it may 
     <lb/>
     be quite true that we have more children in New<lb break="no"/>foundland then they have in Nova Scotia propor<lb break="no"/>tionately. It is also therefore true that we have 
     <lb/>
     more old people in Newfoundland, on the basis 
     <lb/>
     of this estimate. Now if one is right the other can't 
     <lb/>
     be right, as I see it. To borrow a phrase from you, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I'm driven to the conclusion that we must be 
     <lb/>
     a very hardy people to produce more old aged 
     <lb/>
     people than they do in Nova Scotia, or that this 
     <lb/>
     estimate is wrong, and that it isn't true, as we 
     <lb/>
     heard some years ago, that the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland died before they reached the age of 40. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot accept the probable expenditure without 
     <lb/>
     a greater amount of study than I am capable of 
     <lb/>
     giving it....<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was designed relatively lately in the world 
     <lb/>
     to take care of a better distribution in highly 
     <lb/>
     industrialised countries. We in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     have not reached that stage yet, and consequently 
     <lb/>
     when you read in the Black Book the things to 
     <lb/>
     which unemployment insurance does not apply, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that from Newfoundland's point of 
  

            <cb/>
        

     view, we will get practically no benefits out of 
     <lb/>
     it....<ref target="#fn_06">[2]</ref> It must be remembered that one-fifth 
     <lb/>
     must be paid by the federal government, two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fifths by the employer, and two-fifths by the 
     <lb/>
     employee himself. If you apply the whole scheme 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland, taking into consideration the 
     <lb/>
     fact that we are not yet a highly industrialised 
     <lb/>
     country, you will find that it is not something 
     <lb/>
     upon which we ought to have based the question 
     <lb/>
     of political union with another country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to the sick mariners' fund.... It 
     <lb/>
     is shown in the Black Book that the expenditure 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> boiled down to $3 per seaman treated. 
     <lb/>
     It is specifically pointed out that it is not a health 
     <lb/>
     scheme, in spite of the fact that we have heard a 
     <lb/>
     lot of loose talk about the building of sanatoria in 
     <lb/>
     this country under that scheme.... The whole 
     <lb/>
     scheme is now being applied to Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     a different form, and will be further applied if and 
     <lb/>
     when we get cottage hospitals and more facilities. 
     <lb/>
     You will find that if a man gets taken ill or has an 
     <lb/>
     accident on a ship and he puts into port, then he 
     <lb/>
     is treated, put into hospital if necessary and the 
     <lb/>
     funds to pay are found, by himself if he can afford 
     <lb/>
     it, or by his employer; or if he cannot afford to 
     <lb/>
     pay anything, by the government. Sir, that 
     <lb/>
     scheme is actually in effect at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the moment, I am going to pass over 
     <lb/>
     clauses 4 and 5, which refer to things which 
     <lb/>
     Canada would take over, and pass on to our debts. 
     <lb/>
     This creates one of the greatest intellectual dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties that I found in this book. In fact, if it 
     <lb/>
     weren't serious, I would just slap it down and be 
     <lb/>
     amused. "Canada will assume and provide for the 
     <lb/>
     servicing and retirement of the 3% stock issue 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed by the United Kingdom govern<lb break="no"/>ment." I ask you to listen closely. "This, in the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the Canadian government, represents 
     <lb/>
     a fair estimate of the amount of debt incurred for 
     <lb/>
     purposes which would presumably have been the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of the Government of Canada, had 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland been a province when the debt 
     <lb/>
     was incurred." On page 253 of the Amulree 
     <lb/>
     Report is a list of the items upon which the $100 
     <lb/>
     million debt that was incurred in this country was 
     <lb/>
     spent. It starts with $34 million for railways, it 
     <lb/>
     has $13 million for war purposes, it goes on to 
     <lb/>
     highroads and other roads, and it goes all the way 
     <lb/>
     down through the picture till it comes to deficits

     on current account including railway, 
     <lb/>
     $24,460,000. Now when Mr. Smallwood speaks, 
     <lb/>
     I would like him. to tell me how any group of 
     <lb/>
     experts in Canada was able to break that down 
     <lb/>
     and then say that this part of it which they're 
     <lb/>
     going to take over, represents that part which 
     <lb/>
     would have been the responsibility of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada if Newfoundland had 
     <lb/>
     been a province. The second part is more inter<lb break="no"/>esting still. "All sinking funds against this portion 
     <lb/>
     of the debt will be taken over by Canada". But 
     <lb/>
     the argument has been that that amount of the 
     <lb/>
     debt which they are taking over would have been 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore Newfoundland was not bound to find 
     <lb/>
     any part of the sinking fund, or service of the debt, 
     <lb/>
     or anything of the kind. Therefore, if it makes 
     <lb/>
     sense, and I think it does, the $9 million belongs 
     <lb/>
     to us.... That is the position, it is our money. It is 
     <lb/>
     money that we would have had in this country if 
     <lb/>
     that amount of money had been taken over by 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and this argument which they put here is 
     <lb/>
     right. I would like to ask the Ottawa delegation if 
     <lb/>
     that was put to the Canadian government. You 
     <lb/>
     will note that in the part of the debt which is left 
     <lb/>
     to us, we are left with our own sinking fund. 
  </p>

            <p>Next, our accumulated financial surplus. I got 
     <lb/>hot under the collar about that once before, and 
     <lb/>I'm not going to get so again. But I will point out 
     <lb/>that "Newfoundland will have the right within 
     <lb/>one year of union to deposit with the Government 
     <lb/>of Canada all or any part of the surplus held in 
     <lb/>dollars, and to receive interest at the rate of 2 
     <lb/>5/8% annually during a maximum period of ten 
     <lb/>years after union on the minimum balance out<lb break="no"/>standing at any time in the year preceding pay<lb break="no"/>ment of interest". I would draw your attention to 
     <lb/>the fact, that the people of Newfoundland today 
     <lb/>have on deposit with the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>an amount which must certainly be equal to, if 
     <lb/>not more than the surplus which the government 
     <lb/>has in hand, in that we have Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment bonds and our deposit of money is with the 
     <lb/>Government of Canada. We do not have to have 
     <lb/>any special wording put in here, if and when we 
     <lb/>wish to deposit money with the Government of 
     <lb/>Canada. We do not even have to have a limit of 
     <lb/>ten years.... It must be $20 million which is 
     <lb/>actually on deposit today with the Government of 
     <lb/>Canada.... That really annoys me. I am sick and 
     <lb/>tired of hearing people tell the people of New<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
      
foundland that they got to be protected against 
     <lb/>
     themselves, and that can be the only reason that 
     <lb/>
     clause was put there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now to contract rights arising from the ad<lb break="no"/>vance of public funds. Well I suppose that if you 
     <lb/>
     were drawing any kind of a draft agreement, there 
     <lb/>
     are certain things which you would have to put 
     <lb/>
     in. That's the only excuse that I can see for putting 
     <lb/>
     that in there, for the simple reason it is our money. 
     <lb/>
     It's part of what we might have had if we hadn't 
     <lb/>
     put it out as a surplus. It might have been added 
     <lb/>
     to our surplus.... Subsidies to the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government. $180,000 a year and 80 cents per 
     <lb/>
     head — $1.1 million. It isn't an awful lot of 
     <lb/>
     money, but it's all to the good. It's something 
     <lb/>
     which Newfoundland can do with — an extra 
     <lb/>
     million dollars.... Clause 12 — tax agreement. 
     <lb/>
     Prior to 1939, the provincial governments of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, taken together, were spending more 
     <lb/>
     money than the federal govemment.... As a result 
     <lb/>
     of two world wars and the institution of certain 
     <lb/>
     federal welfare services, the federal government 
     <lb/>
     has had to get into its hands, to take care of 
     <lb/>
     Canada as a whole, a lot more money. During the 
     <lb/>
     last war they made war tax agreements with the 
     <lb/>
     various provinces. Since that time, tax agree<lb break="no"/>ments have been made with seven out of the nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces for short periods. Whether they were 
     <lb/>
     good or bad, I don't know but what we are 
     <lb/>
     asked to do is to assume that a tax agreement will 
     <lb/>
     be applied to Newfoundland, the equivalent of 
     <lb/>
     which in Canada has been the subject of bitter 
     <lb/>
     controversy for quite a few years. The formula 
     <lb/>
     itself Mr. Smallwood skipped over, because he 
     <lb/>
     knew that nobody in the room would understand 
     <lb/>
     it, and yet we are asked to assume that a tax 
     <lb/>
     agreement would be applied to Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and we are given the probable expenditure of a 
     <lb/>
     tax agreement payment for 1947 of $6,820,000. 
     <lb/>
     Now the point I'm trying to make is this, that we 
     <lb/>
     ought not to expect either this Convention or the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to agree to an assump<lb break="no"/>tion that we would go into a tax agreement until 
     <lb/>
     it is very carefully studied by people who know 
     <lb/>
     precisely what they're doing. Now we come to 
     <lb/>
     transitional grant. We are going to get $3.5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion for three years and that's going to tail off in 
     <lb/>
     the twelfth year. After that we get a reassessment 
     <lb/>
     of our position ...

     eight years, before we come to $1,750,000 a year, 
     <lb/>
     we are going to have a reassessment of our posi<lb break="no"/>tion to tell us if we are to go get any more help, 
     <lb/>
     having respect to our ability to pay taxation in 
     <lb/>
     line with the other provinces of Canada. That can 
     <lb/>
     only be read one way, and that is that we are to 
     <lb/>
     get transitional grants for a period until we are 
     <lb/>
     able to develop revenue producing services, so 
     <lb/>
     that we can pay our own taxes. That's the only 
     <lb/>
     way in which I can read it. I said yesterday that 
     <lb/>
     we would become the baby province of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     This transitional grant, I hope it's not being 
     <lb/>
     facetious, makes me feel that while we are the 
     <lb/>
     baby province we will get a few rattles and a few 
     <lb/>
     diapers, and we'll be kept clean and we'll be fed 
     <lb/>
     the extra bottle of milk, and we'll be played with 
     <lb/>
     to a certain extent, but when you grow up eight, 
     <lb/>
     ten years from now, you carry your own bur<lb break="no"/>den.... Representation: I'm going to skip over it 
     <lb/>
     — the fact that we're going to get six senators is 
     <lb/>
     really delightful. The fact that we're going to 
     <lb/>
     have seven people up in Ottawa, miles and miles 
     <lb/>
     away, to plead our cause is also delightful.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> ....Now sir, we come to transportation. 
     <lb/>
     I can see that the application of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Freight Rate to Newfoundland may be of help. 
     <lb/>
     Why, in the name of fortune we haven't asked for 
     <lb/>
     some concessions like that, in view of the 
     <lb/>
     favourable balance of trade that Canada has with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, I don't know. Why couldn't we 
     <lb/>
     ask for it in the future? I took the $40 million that 
     <lb/>
     we bought in Canada last year and I assumed that 
     <lb/>
     they would make 20%, which turns out to be $8 
     <lb/>
     million that's made by the producers of goods in 
     <lb/>
     Canada on their sale of goods to New<lb break="no"/>foundland.... I'm talking about the markup and 
     <lb/>
     the profits which will be made by the producer or 
     <lb/>
     the manufacturer. I don't see that there's any 
     <lb/>
     earthly excuse for this country's not asking for 
     <lb/>
     concessions of that kind. It's only because we sit 
     <lb/>
     down on the job that we don't get these things. 1 
     <lb/>
     don't know whether I'm very young and foolish, 
     <lb/>
     but these things really make me boil. There is a 
     <lb/>
     definite inertia that comes over the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and they're prepared to sit down 
     <lb/>
     under anything without asking for concessions 
     <lb/>
     from other people. It seems to me to be a stupid 
  

            <cb/>
     

     sense of pride, or that we're altogether too naive. 
     <lb/>
     If we wait long enough, if we find the money to 
     <lb/>
     produce the roads and build upour tourist traffic, 
     <lb/>
     we'll get a ferry. I don't know how much the ferry 
     <lb/>
     is going to cost. I know our present boat cost $2 
     <lb/>
     million, and we found it ourselves. Why couldn't 
     <lb/>
     we find an extra $2 million to find a ferry? If we 
     <lb/>
     want to go after the tourist business, if we're 
     <lb/>
     going to find the roads that are necessary, if 
     <lb/>
     we've got to find that money ourselves to build 
     <lb/>
     the roads, if we've got to find the money to pay 
     <lb/>
     for the lodges and cabins and all the other or<lb break="no"/>ganisations, I think that we've stretched the point. 
     <lb/>
     We may be able to find another million or two to 
     <lb/>
     put a ferry on the Gulf. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The government employees — I don't sup<lb break="no"/>pose, Mr. Smallwood, that it would be fair to 
     <lb/>
     criticise you, in making up your budget, for leav<lb break="no"/>ing out one item because I don't see how it would 
     <lb/>
     ever occur to you. It did occur to me, however, 
     <lb/>
     because I was one time a civil servant. The point 
     <lb/>
     is this, you will find the civil servants are on scale, 
     <lb/>
     that there are yearly increments that are going to 
     <lb/>
     civil servants. That that has to be paid. It has to 
     <lb/>
     be found this year, it has to be find again next 
     <lb/>
     year.... These increments will have to go on for 
     <lb/>
     quite a few years, because a number of young 
     <lb/>
     people at the lower part of the scales are being 
     <lb/>
     taken into the civil service. I suggest that in the 
     <lb/>
     budget made up by Mr. Smallwood you could 
     <lb/>
     completely wipe out one item which he put in 
     <lb/>
     there this year, and that you would have to double 
     <lb/>
     it next year. That particular item is $254,000 from 
     <lb/>
     refunds. One man estimated for me that within 
     <lb/>
     the civil service the yearly increments alone next 
     <lb/>
     year would cost practically 10% of the amount 
     <lb/>
     paid to the civil service normally. I'll be accused 
     <lb/>
     of propaganda if I say any more about this.... It 
     <lb/>
     only means one thing, that if you cut out that item, 
     <lb/>
     and I'm not talking about extra increases that the 
     <lb/>
     civil service are looking for now, you have to add 
     <lb/>
     an equal amount to your budget, which means 
     <lb/>
     that you have to add another $2,400,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     to your provincial budget, which can only be 
     <lb/>
     found out of direct taxation on the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I would also point out that 
     <lb/>
     federal employees may get better wages than 
     <lb/>
     employees in the Newfoundland government. If 
     <lb/>
     they do, and if they have got to make contribu<lb break="no"/>tions to the pension fund, then in all fairness, 
     <lb/>
     those that are kept by the provincial government,

     who have given years of service, should be given 
     <lb/>
     equal treatment with those that are passed to 
     <lb/>
     another government. In fair play that should be 
     <lb/>
     done. There is no reason why one man in one 
     <lb/>
     department who has served ten years shouldn't 
     <lb/>
     get equal treatment with another man who'll be 
     <lb/>
     taken over by the federal government, and has 
     <lb/>
     also served ten years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We passed the unemployment benefit. I have 
     <lb/>
     nothing further to say about it. I'm going to say 
     <lb/>
     nothing about education except this: that I don't 
     <lb/>
     see any earthly reason for putting it in there at all. 
     <lb/>
     It's a purely provincial matter, and as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it we can do exactly as we wish and carry 
     <lb/>
     on as at the present time. I would like to point out 
     <lb/>
     though, and here I refer to something that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bailey has been trying to get across, that a lot of 
     <lb/>
     the school money which has been paid by the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government has been found 
     <lb/>
     through municipal taxation. The point that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bailey, I take it, was trying to make is this: that 
     <lb/>
     if you want to progress in education and social 
     <lb/>
     welfare, and want to run your government on the 
     <lb/>
     same basis as in Canada, we in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will have to follow the same pattern. If you don't 
     <lb/>
     want to do these things, then as Mr. Bailey says, 
     <lb/>
     you can remain as you are. But don't say on the 
     <lb/>
     one hand that you're going to have the standard 
     <lb/>
     that they have in Canada if you do not apply the 
     <lb/>
     same formula. The taxes have to be found some<lb break="no"/>where. The whole scheme of municipal govern<lb break="no"/>ment in Canada is an integral part of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of government in that country. I'm not against 
     <lb/>
     local councils, I'm all for them. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     see them built up. I would point out this though, 
     <lb/>
     that under the provincial budget that has been 
     <lb/>
     arranged, nothing has been left except the amount 
     <lb/>
     which we have at the present time ...<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> and I will 
     <lb/>
     say, from personal experience with these matters, 
     <lb/>
     that if you are going to develop local councils in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, you've got to give them not only 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary maintenance services, but some<lb break="no"/>thing to build up so that they can carry on. That 
     <lb/>
     accounts for what the present government is 
     <lb/>
     doing, in giving large grants so that local com<lb break="no"/>munities can build their roads and keep themsel<lb break="no"/>ves in a position where their normal revenue will 
     <lb/>
     maintain them. I contend that you must add a very 
     <lb/>
     considerable amount to this provincial budget 
     <lb/>
     which has been produced for us, whether it's the 
 

            <cb/>
         

     one taken out of the Black Book or the one 
     <lb/>
     produced by Mr. Smallwood himself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, I've been talking a long time, but I 
     <lb/>
     want to say one or two things more. I want to 
     <lb/>
     come to oleomargarine. It says that we can 
     <lb/>
     produce it but we mustn't ship it outside of the 
     <lb/>
     country. When you read that you made a speech 
     <lb/>
     and you ended up by having oleomargarine 
     <lb/>
     produced in a magnificent factory on Lemarchant 
     <lb/>
     Road, and sold across Canada. I think it's only 
     <lb/>
     fair to say though, that a little small company, it 
     <lb/>
     can't be bigger then a small empire, like Lever 
     <lb/>
     Brothers is very likely to establish branches in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, if the time ever comes that they can 
     <lb/>
     produce oleomargarine there. And as far as our 
     <lb/>
     plant here is concerned, we could not count on a 
     <lb/>
     great increase in production which would bring 
     <lb/>
     extra wages. Modern oleomargarine is made 
     <lb/>
     from vegetable oil, as against the old-time fish 
     <lb/>
     oil, and it doesn't seem reasonable that Levers 
     <lb/>
     would come to Newfoundland, ship in its 
     <lb/>
     vegetable oil make its margarine and ship it to 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I mention this fact, because an exag<lb break="no"/>gerated statement of that kind is likely to create 
     <lb/>
     the impression that we are going to get much 
     <lb/>
     more then we can find from the evidence in the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book or the Black Books. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The pièce de resistance, clause 22. I under<lb break="no"/>stand Mr. Smallwood is very proud of this one.... 
     <lb/>
     What is proposed is that we should go into 
     <lb/>
     Canada first, and then find out what is in this 
     <lb/>
     country, rather then staying out, finding out what 
     <lb/>
     is in this country, and seeing if we can make 
     <lb/>
     better terms as a result of it. We know what we 
     <lb/>
     can get without an economic survey. We don't 
     <lb/>
     know what we can get with an economic survey. 
     <lb/>
     I can understand now why there was such a 
     <lb/>
     deadset on the proposal suggested by the chair<lb break="no"/>man of the Industrial Association.... We are told 
     <lb/>
     that we'll get the services of technical personnel 
     <lb/>
     and agencies to assist in the work. Surely people 
     <lb/>
     must know that Montreal brought in experts, not 
     <lb/>
     from Ottawa, but from the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America. Surely they must know that two provin<lb break="no"/>ces brought in experts from America. And yet we 
     <lb/>
     were given the bait, that if we get into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion they will send the experts to carry on this 
     <lb/>
     survey. Mr. Chairman, I suggest to you that the 
     <lb/>
     only common sense thing to do is to find out what 
     <lb/>
     we have in Newfoundland first, and then find out

     if we have greater bargaining power which can 
     <lb/>
     give us more than we can get now. We might be 
     <lb/>
     able to get a lot more as a result of that survey. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p>I'm not going to touch any of this general stuff 
     <lb/>—it only makes us Canadian citizens and applies 
     <lb/>Canadian law, and so on. On the war veterans' 
     <lb/>service, one man rang me up indignantly and 
     <lb/>said, "Don't the people down there know that 
     <lb/>what we're doing here in Newfoundland is based 
     <lb/>upon what they're doing in Canada?" I do. I'm 
     <lb/>going to skip over the public debt and the tax 
     <lb/>agreement, which I can't understand. I doubt that 
     <lb/>there's more then one or two people that could 
     <lb/>approach it. Then I come to federal revenue and 
     <lb/>expenditure. I don't propose to go into them. I 
     <lb/>don't propose to go into the proposed provincial 
     <lb/>budget, because I hope I'm not hurting anyone's 
     <lb/>feelings — it seems to me to be too silly to merit 
     <lb/>much time to be spent on it. I have seen a budget 
     <lb/>prepared. I have seen dozens and dozens of 
     <lb/>people work for months, people actually dealing 
     <lb/>with these matters. I have seen that budget 
     <lb/>brought forward to the minister, and he has had 
     <lb/>a go at it and I have seen it in the end torn up by 
     <lb/>the responsible government of the day.... And 
     <lb/>then I am asked to accept a budget which is based 
     <lb/>upon a short study and also has in it the normal 
     <lb/>capital expenditures ... taken from our surplus. 
     <lb/>And we are asked to believe that that goes with a 
     <lb/>province that is self-supporting. I would say this, 
     <lb/>that looking at Newfoundland over a long period, 
     <lb/>when the transitional grants and our surplus have 
     <lb/>come to an end, and on the basis of the figures 
     <lb/>produced here now, not allowing for the normal 
     <lb/>increase, that you'll find in the accounts, as 
     <lb/>governments progress, that the government 
     <lb/>would have to find $9 million more. It is now 
     <lb/>finding according to this $3.3 million. It is now 
     <lb/>finding from the interest from its own surplus, 
     <lb/>$600,000 under this budget. It is now finding 
     <lb/>$250,000 just to pay the normal increments in the 
     <lb/>civil service, $250,000 from refunds, mind you, 
     <lb/>from refunds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You mean the normal growth 
     <lb/>of civil service pay, $250,000 a year?

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Yes.

            </p>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In ten years, that would be how 
     <lb/>
     much? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I don't know how far it can go. I 
     <lb/>
     specifically told you, it was because of the age 
     <lb/>
     grouping.... The civil service has been reor<lb break="no"/>ganised over the past few years and they've 
     <lb/>
     brought in men who are younger than the average 
     <lb/>
     civil service in an older established country 
     <lb/>
     which hadn't been reorganised, would be.... The 
     <lb/>
     point is, that we're finding here under this budget 
     <lb/>
     $250,000 out of refunds from money which I 
     <lb/>
     doubt is paid yet. And if it isn't paid yet, and the 
     <lb/>
     government just balances its budget this year, 
     <lb/>
     then the money to pay for these steamers will 
     <lb/>
     have to come out of surplus, and your $28 million 
     <lb/>
     will get another grant of a few million dollars. If 
     <lb/>
     they keep balancing as they are at the present 
     <lb/>
     time, and there's no surplus this year, that money 
     <lb/>
     will have to come out of surplus. Then the tax 
     <lb/>
     rental, well I already spoke about that. How any 
     <lb/>
     person could recommend to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland that they should accept that just be<lb break="no"/>cause seven provinces have accepted it, is beyond 
     <lb/>
     me. Several provinces which carry, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     about two-thirds of the population of Canada, do 
     <lb/>
     not accept it. Gas and electricity — $50,000. I 
     <lb/>
     would point out that that represents half that 
     <lb/>
     would be collected from these companies. In<lb break="no"/>cidentally I thought they were public utilities — 
     <lb/>
     publicly owned. I may be wrong. That involves 
     <lb/>
     taxation of $100,000 — on some of it. That's 
     <lb/>
     what they pay now, I think. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We get half. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Now we come to the transition grant, 
     <lb/>
     and to the new taxation to be imposed of 
     <lb/>
     $1,236,000, that has to be found in direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. In addition we are to take out $3 million a 
     <lb/>
     year from our surplus to spend on ordinary capital 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. It's the sort of thing that must be 
     <lb/>
     taken into consideration when you're consider<lb break="no"/>ing the working of a govemment.... I contend that 
     <lb/>
     the surplus should not be touched under any 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, except in the case of national 
     <lb/>
     emergency. If I were a member of a government, 
     <lb/>
     I would suggest that if we didn't have a surplus, 
     <lb/>
     that we would build one up. And my reason is 
     <lb/>
     this: because we have not developed to the point 
     <lb/>
     of self-sufficiency. When we must depend upon 
     <lb/>
     the outside world, we must take care of emergen<lb break="no"/>cies.... I contend it is criminal to get rid of our 
     <lb/>
     surplus, I don't care what kind of a government

     we have... We need it, in case of national emer<lb break="no"/>gency.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The point that I've been trying to make is this: 
     <lb/>
     that it is positively stupid, wicked, to ask a group 
     <lb/>
     of people organised as we are, who cannot, be<lb break="no"/>cause we have not had the experience, deal with 
     <lb/>
     matters of this kind, and to ask the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, who spend their time catching their fish, 
     <lb/>
     tilling their farms, going to church ... to decide a 
     <lb/>
     matter of this kind. The only way in which it can 
     <lb/>
     be done is to get a properly organised group, who 
     <lb/>
     understand all the implications of these matters, 
     <lb/>
     to lay it out so as the people can understand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A number of things have been said here I 
     <lb/>
     would like to refer to, but I want to pick one or 
     <lb/>
     two only. Mr. Vincent said he was ashamed of 
     <lb/>
     the price of a loaf of bread in this country. I would 
     <lb/>
     point out that if you were to go to Puerto Rico, 
     <lb/>
     that the Puerto Rican would probably be equally 
     <lb/>
     ashamed at the price that he has got to charge the 
     <lb/>
     poor Puerto Ricans for Newfoundland salt cod<lb break="no"/>fish. Instead of being ashamed of a thing like that, 
     <lb/>
     it is up to you to find out why these things cost as 
     <lb/>
     much, and see if it can be settled so that it will 
     <lb/>
     not. I think it is up to you to point out that the 
     <lb/>
     wheat, that price of the flour that sells in New<lb break="no"/>foundland did not originate in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     but in Canada. And that's the reason why the 
     <lb/>
     price of a loaf of bread has got to be 18 cents. 
     <lb/>
     There are dozens of other things which have been 
     <lb/>
     told to this country which are wrong in essence 
     <lb/>
     and in spirit. I cannot and will not take the time 
     <lb/>
     now, but they will, I am sure, be said to the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country. We're going to have, I think, an 
     <lb/>
     extra 1,000 employees in the government if we 
     <lb/>
     become a province. In 1937, Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie King pointed out that one of the big 
     <lb/>
     problems of Canada was the fact that they had 
     <lb/>
     such a small population in such a big area. And I 
     <lb/>
     would only point out this one thing. If New<lb break="no"/>foundland is going to have an extra 1,000 
     <lb/>
     employees because we're going to have an extra 
     <lb/>
     government imposed upon us, then presumably 
     <lb/>
     it's equally true all the way across Canada; which 
     <lb/>
     means that in time the civil service is bound to 
     <lb/>
     cost the people of Canada, including the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, much, much more than is 
     <lb/>
     necessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I sit down I go back to one thing that I 
     <lb/>
     spoke about yesterday. I laid some emphasis on 
     <lb/>
     the question of morale. I expect it to be sneered 


            <cb/>
     

     at in certain quarters. I expect it to be said that 
     <lb/>
     you can't eat morale. I am well aware of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that you cannot eat morale, that it is all very well 
     <lb/>
     to have morale in a family, but that a child has 
     <lb/>
     got to have boots and shoes and clothing. But I 
     <lb/>
     would say this, and I want to repeat it. That if the 
     <lb/>
     scrounging for material things is important, so is 
     <lb/>
     morale. When England was practically on her 
     <lb/>
     knees in 1940, she didn't ask where the materials 
     <lb/>
     were coming from, in fact she didn't have them. 
     <lb/>
     But she did have guts. As a result, you got the 
     <lb/>
     salvation of England. What happened? Once they 
     <lb/>
     produced the morale, the material was forthcom<lb break="no"/>ing. I leave you with this thought. The people of 
     <lb/>
     England today are facing up to their problem, and 
     <lb/>
     as a result of it, in the end they will come out on 
     <lb/>
     top, in spite of the fact that at the moment they do 
     <lb/>
     not know where the material things are coming 
     <lb/>
     from. What I am fighting against in this country 
     <lb/>
     is inertia, against something taking hold of the 
     <lb/>
     whole world — gross materialism. That's why I 
     <lb/>
     spent the time that I did yesterday on the question 
     <lb/>
     of morale. That's why I say to you, that if you 
     <lb/>
     give away the advantage that might come from 
     <lb/>
     your strategic position; if you give away your 
     <lb/>
     control of your communications; if you give 
     <lb/>
     away control of your fisheries; if you give away 
     <lb/>
     the right to settle your own taxation and methods 
     <lb/>
     of taxation; if you give away the right to discuss 
     <lb/>
     as an entity in the family of nations your 
     <lb/>
     geographical position in an age which is just 
     <lb/>
     coming; if you give yourself into the hands of 
     <lb/>
     Canada so that you will be bound by laws and 
     <lb/>
     regulations to purchase your goods solely there 
     <lb/>
     instead of in the open market; if you give away 
     <lb/>
     these things to find the easiest way out, then 
     <lb/>
     you've lost your morale and you've lost the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages which give you the material things 
     <lb/>
     which bring about the social welfare and progress 
     <lb/>
     of this or any other country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I have not used up much of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention's time over the proposed terms of 
     <lb/>
     confederation now before the Chair. I figure that 
     <lb/>
     it is a job for an elected government, and that is 
     <lb/>
     why I voted against sending a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Now sir, none of the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     said very much about the Canadian divorce law. 
     <lb/>
     This is a very important matter. The Good Book 
     <lb/>
     still says, "What God has joined together, let no 
     <lb/>
     man put asunder." This, gentlemen, this is very 
     <lb/>
     important. Surely we're not going to allow this to

     be part and parcel of the terms to confederation? 
     <lb/>
     Are we going to allow this divorce question to 
     <lb/>
     come in, to sow the seeds of unrest amongst us? 
     <lb/>
     I hope not. We are a happy and contented people. 
     <lb/>
     We want to remain happy, and I pray to God we 
     <lb/>
     will. I would like to ask Mr. Smallwood, when 
     <lb/>
    the time comes in his rebuttal, if he would turn  
     <lb/>back to the Black Books, part 2, appendix 4, and 
     <lb/>explain something about marriage and divorce. If 
     <lb/>he does I'll have no more to say on this matter. 
     <lb/>Will you do that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Thank you. Mr. Chairman, after 
     <lb/>
     studying the Grey Book and the Black Books, 
     <lb/>
     and after many weeks of listening attentively and 
     <lb/>
     patiently, I find the issue of confederation be<lb break="no"/>coming more and more bewildering, conflicting, 
     <lb/>
     and confusing. And I fear that this can be said of 
     <lb/>
     many people in our island home today. They 
     <lb/>
     haven't as yet got a clear picture. However, much 
     <lb/>
     credit is due to Mr. Hollett, Mr. Fogwill and 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin, for their great pains in trying to 
     <lb/>
     reveal the truth, as they saw it, regarding taxation 
     <lb/>
     and confederation. Sir, our people must be en<lb break="no"/>lightened on this very important matter. The 
     <lb/>
     people want to know the whole truth and the truth 
     <lb/>
     shall make them free. You cannot light a candle 
     <lb/>
     and put it under a bushel, for if you do, you cannot 
     <lb/>
     get a very effective light. This can be applied to 
     <lb/>
     our people. They are still groping and wandering 
     <lb/>
     around in darkness over the issue of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion and taxation. Sir, whatever be the form of 
     <lb/>
     government, we shall still have to pay taxes. But 
     <lb/>
     the vital and burning question now being asked 
     <lb/>
     is, are the federal, provincial and town council 
     <lb/>
     taxes, all three combined, more than the taxes 
     <lb/>
     now being paid under Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment? This is what the country is asking, and is 
     <lb/>
     demanding of us as members of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention. We must in all honesty and sincerity 
     <lb/>
     give the answer to the best of our knowledge and 
     <lb/>
     ability. We must be honest with ourselves and the 
     <lb/>
     people and explain every note and angle of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. Then, and only then, can the people have a 
     <lb/>
     clearer picture of the proposed terms of union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. We cannot, we dare not, allow 
     <lb/>
     ourselves to make a leap in the dark... There must 
     <lb/>
     be nothing hid, not one single iota. There can be 
     <lb/>
     no misunderstanding then, and everything shall 
     <lb/>
     and will be open and above board; and we will 
     <lb/>
     have fulfilled our tasks. We then can leave the 
  

            <cb/>
    

     whole matter in the hands of the people, and make 
     <lb/>
     no mistake about it, they will decide. In closing, 
     <lb/>
     the terms of confederation are not in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     very attractive or encouraging, especially when 
     <lb/>
     one has to borrow to pay one's budget. But be 
     <lb/>
     that as it may, as with all these things, let the facts 
     <lb/>
     be known to the country, and may the great 
     <lb/>
     Master of all guide and direct our people when 
     <lb/>
     the time comes to decide. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Mr. Chairman, this Convention has 
     <lb/>
     been dubbed as a glorified debating society. To 
     <lb/>
     my mind I think that's wrong, because so far it 
     <lb/>
     seems that everybody is on one side, the negative, 
     <lb/>
     I think I'll speak from the affirmative side, be<lb break="no"/>cause it makes it more interesting to the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country. It's not my intention to go into a 
     <lb/>
     long speech about taxation, federal, provincial, 
     <lb/>
     or municipal. In my opinion this House is already 
     <lb/>
     familiar with all forms of taxes, and the people 
     <lb/>
     will remember the taxes they had to pay under 
     <lb/>
     responsible government as well as those under 
     <lb/>
     the present form of government. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that we are concerned with one member being 
     <lb/>
     interested in the moving picture business and the 
     <lb/>
     amusement tax in Lewisporte in particular. I am 
     <lb/>
     not concerned if any one member is doing busi<lb break="no"/>ness for an outport or a junk dealer in Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     whether he is selling merchandise to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland shopkeepers or selling ships and coals 
     <lb/>
     to the Newfoundland Railway. If a member feels 
     <lb/>
     obligated to repay money, then let him pay it, and 
     <lb/>
     he will have the admiration of all concerned. But 
     <lb/>
     why all this bickering and filibustering at a cost 
     <lb/>
     of $1,000 day? We have heard all about our 
     <lb/>
     country being sold down the St. Lawrence over 
     <lb/>
     and over again. For two years over the radio, 
     <lb/>
     every Saturday night, how did we miss the intro<lb break="no"/>duction of that beautiful record, the Banks of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland?

     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Mr. Chairman, when Major Cashin

     And it reads thus: "The best interests and present 
     <lb/>
     and future prosperity of British North America 
     <lb/>
     will be promoted by a Federal Union under the 
     <lb/>
     Crown of Great Britain, provided such Union can 
     <lb/>
     be effected on principles just to the several 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. In the Confederation of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces, the system of 
     <lb/>
     government best adapted under existing cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances to protect the diversified interests of 
     <lb/>
     the several Provinces, and secure efficiency, har<lb break="no"/>mony, and permanency in the working of the 
     <lb/>
     Union, is a General Government charged with 
     <lb/>
     matters of common interest to the whole country, 
     <lb/>
     and Local Governments for each of the Canadas, 
     <lb/>
     and for the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, charged with the control of local 
     <lb/>
     matters in their respective sections, provision 
     <lb/>
     being made for the admission into the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, on equitable terms, of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, the North West Territory, 
     <lb/>
     and British Columbia. The Executive Authority 
     <lb/>
     or Government shall be vested in the Sovereign 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
     <lb/>
     Ireland, and be administered according to the 
     <lb/>
     well-understood principles of the British Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, by the Sovereign (meaning the King), 
     <lb/>
     or by the representative of the Sovereign, duly 
     <lb/>
     authorised." So I think that there's not much to 
     <lb/>
     this talk about us being sold up the St. Lawrence. 
     <lb/>
     Let us for a moment give a little thought to the 
     <lb/>
     value of the Black Books. One member has stated 
     <lb/>
     they're not worth 25 cents — remembering of 
     <lb/>
     course, that the same gentleman said this Con<lb break="no"/>vention is a fraud, and said so before it came into 
     <lb/>
     being. Still, you let him become a part of it, and 
     <lb/>
     he is still with it. With the knowledge the thing is 
     <lb/>
     wrong, he still remains in it. Is it too much to 
     <lb/>
     assume that the same member knows responsible 
     <lb/>
     government is wrong, as far as the working man 
     <lb/>
     is concerned? Whether he is activated by per<lb break="no"/>sonal motives or the well-being of the people may 
     <lb/>
     be debateable... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I rise to a point of order at this 
     <lb/>
     point... I gather that Mr. Starkes intimated that I 
     <lb/>
     was actuated by personal motives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He doesn't know — one or the 
     <lb/>
     other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, he had better find out. It's just 
     <lb/>
     as well for him to understand right now about the 
     <lb/>
     personal motives. I have only one personal mo<lb break="no"/>tive, I'm a Newfoundlander. And as far as New<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>

foundland is concerned, I have probably done just 
     <lb/>
     as much in the interest of Newfoundland as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Starkes has done. And if he reaches to cross 
     <lb/>
     swords with me in that respect, I don't know 
     <lb/>
     who's going to come off second best. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He stated he didn't know 
     <lb/>
     whether you were motivated by personal motives 
     <lb/>
     or the interest of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Politically, if I look at that angle, if 
     <lb/>
     I was a confederate I would have just as much 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of going into politics as I would have 
     <lb/>
     with responsible government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Better. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh, no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh yes, better. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> This is entirely irrelevant. Will 
     <lb/>
     you please proceed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Personal income tax. It is true that 
     <lb/>
     income tax is owed in Canada. But what does it 
     <lb/>
     amount to? For example, take a married man with 
     <lb/>
     no children in Newfoundland. He would pay no 
     <lb/>
     income tax up to $2,000, but he pays at least 15% 
     <lb/>
     on the $2,000 that he spends in this country, 
     <lb/>
     which means that he pays in duty $300 to the 
     <lb/>
     importer of the goods he buys, and he also pays 
     <lb/>
     that importer at least 20% on the profit on the 
     <lb/>
     duty, making a total of at least $360 that family 
     <lb/>
     man paid at the present time. In union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada he would pay no duty if he imported 
     <lb/>
     goods from Canada, but he would pay sales tax 
     <lb/>
     on say $1,000 of the $2,000, because over 50% 
     <lb/>
     of what he was buying would be exempted from 
     <lb/>
     sales tax. Therefore, on the $1,000 that he spent 
     <lb/>
     he pays 8%, which is $80. That is sales tax. So 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada takes from that man $80; 
     <lb/>
     while responsible or Commission government 
     <lb/>
     takes from that same man approximately $360. 
     <lb/>
     That is to say he is paying $280 more each year 
     <lb/>
     than he would have to pay under confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Now take a married man earning the same 
     <lb/>
     amount, with three children in the family. He 
     <lb/>
     would pay no taxes in Newfoundland under 
     <lb/>
     $2,000 except the duties. He now pays, as already 
     <lb/>
     stated, around 15% and the profit, which totals 
     <lb/>
     $360. Under union with Canada, he would pay 
     <lb/>
     the $80 sales tax only, and he would receive from 
     <lb/>
     Canada at least $250 family allowance — that 
     <lb/>
     man would save $360 plus $250 family allowan<lb break="no"/>ces, which gives him a total of $610. And he pays 
     <lb/>
     out $80 sales tax only. He therefore has ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $530 more to spend under con<lb break="no"/>

     federation then he would have under responsible 
     <lb/>
     or the present form of government. The personal 
     <lb/>
     income tax in Canada is being reduced each year 
     <lb/>
     since the war. A single man earning $750 in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland pays no income tax. But on 
     <lb/>
     spending that money, he pays at least 15% duty 
     <lb/>
     on his goods — that is $112, plus the profits on 
     <lb/>
     that duty, 20%, which is $22 or a total of $134 
     <lb/>
     extra. In union with Canada, he pays only 8% on 
     <lb/>
     approximately half his items. That is around $30 
     <lb/>
     sales tax compared with $135 under responsible 
     <lb/>
     or Commission form of government. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, that young lad would save at least $105 
     <lb/>
     under union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Take the retail prices in Canada. The tax on a 
     <lb/>
     fur coat from Canada was mentioned the other 
     <lb/>
     day. We'll say a fur coat in Canada cost around 
     <lb/>
     $150. An importing agent in Newfoundland first 
     <lb/>
     pays $55 duty which is $82.50, and with a 20% 
     <lb/>
     profit to the importer, the total duty and profit on 
     <lb/>
     that coat is $99. The coat costs the purchaser a 
     <lb/>
     total of $249. Under union with Canada, you 
     <lb/>
     would have to pay no duty whatever on that coat. 
     <lb/>
     Take an alarm clock — and by the way, we're 
     <lb/>
     thinking of the fishermen fishing 20 hours a day 
     <lb/>
     out of 24 off Cape St. John, and the man using 
     <lb/>
     the bucksaw in the woods down in Bishop Brook 
     <lb/>
     all day, working long hours and having only a few 
     <lb/>
     hours to rest, who might need an alarm clock. If 
     <lb/>
     he wishes to buy one from Canada, and it cost 
     <lb/>
     him $3.50 in Eaton's catalogue, he pays 60% 
     <lb/>
     duty on that $3.50, which amounts to $2.10, and 
     <lb/>
     on that $2.10 the importer has his profit, making 
     <lb/>
     a total $2.50 ... and that makes the alarm clock 
     <lb/>
     cost $6. Under union with Canada, he pays only 
     <lb/>
     the sales tax of 8%, which is 30 cents, making the 
     <lb/>
     total cost $3.80. Therefore, under union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada the poor fisherman or the lumberman will 
     <lb/>
     get his clock $2.20 cheaper. Now we'll come to 
     <lb/>
     shoes. The shoes on my feet cost in Canada $7. 
     <lb/>
     The duty on those shoes is 40%, which is $2.80. 
     <lb/>
     And to the importer who has his profit of 20%, 
     <lb/>
     we must pay the total $3.35, so the shoes will cost 
     <lb/>
     me $10.35. Under union with Canada, the 8% 
     <lb/>
     sales tax would cost 50 cents, so the shoes would 
     <lb/>
     cost not over $7.56. Therefore, my shoes would 
     <lb/>
     be $2.80 cheaper under union with Canada than 
     <lb/>
     they cost today. We'll take a suit of overalls, say 
     <lb/>
     they cost $5 in Canada, plus the duty of 40% 
     <lb/>
     coming into Newfoundland, which means there's 
     <lb/>
     $2 duty, 20% profit on that $2 is a total of $2.50 
   

            <cb/>
        

     which gives a total cost of $7.40 for the suit of 
     <lb/>
     overalls. Under union with Canada you'll get 
     <lb/>
     them with only a sales tax of 8%, and the same 
     <lb/>
     overalls would be $2 cheaper. Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     mentioned playing cards, I think he said there 
     <lb/>
     were two jokers in a pack. If so, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     there are three at the present time. Two in the 
     <lb/>
     pack and one in the Newfoundland customs, 60% 
     <lb/>
     duty. If, for instance, a champion player of 45's 
     <lb/>
     wants a pack of good cards, and decides to pay 
     <lb/>
     $2 for them in Canada, on that pack of cards he 
     <lb/>
     pays $1.20 duty and 25 cents profit on the duty, 
     <lb/>
     a total of $1.45, making the total for the cards 
     <lb/>
     $3.25. Under union with Canada he would save 
     <lb/>
     that duty of 60% and pay 25 cents tax per pack. 
     <lb/>
     He would then have the cards for $2.25 and save 
     <lb/>
     $1.20, which would give a good player a chance 
     <lb/>
     to reach the jackpot. Even a bottle of Milk of 
     <lb/>
     Magnesia can be purchased 25 cents cheaper in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal than in St. John's, so if a man has a 
     <lb/>
     hangover after drinking, he can get a straightener 
     <lb/>
     in Canada cheaper then he can in Newfoundland.

     Pickled beef and pork in barrels. It was stated 
     <lb/>
     here that under confederation pickled beef and 
     <lb/>
     pork imported from the United States would cost 
     <lb/>
     under sales tax, $369,000. This figure must be 
     <lb/>
     wrong. The total number of barrels imported 
     <lb/>
     from the United States last year was ap<lb break="no"/>proximately 34,144, and at the present rate today, 
     <lb/>
     $4 a barrel, this would be $136,488. We also 
     <lb/>
     imported 26,223 barrels from Canada, being 
     <lb/>
     8,000 barrels less than from the States. Having 
     <lb/>
     consulted with three Canadian packing firms in 
     <lb/>
     this country, they state that they can sell pickled 
     <lb/>
     beef and pork in Canada considerably cheaper 
     <lb/>
     than they can import it from the States. In the 
     <lb/>
     magazine <hi rendition="simple:italic">Maritime Merchant</hi> there are three 
     <lb/>
     pages giving prices of food, and only in three 
     <lb/>
     instances can I see any reference to sales tax, on 
     <lb/>
     bacon, shortening (but not on pure lard) and 
     <lb/>
     barrelled beef.

     Some have taken the total of our imports from 
     <lb/>
     Canada for the fiscal year which ended in March, 
     <lb/>
     approximately $43 million, putting them in the 
     <lb/>
     categories of sales, excise and luxury to get the 
     <lb/>
     total we would pay — forgetting that in Canada 
     <lb/>
     there are thousands of items which are not taxed. 
     <lb/>
     Railway travel tax — to base the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government 15% travel tax on the number of 
     <lb/>
     tickets sold by our railway, to get the figure for 
     <lb/>
     this tax, cannot be correct. In Canada, the first

     class railway fare is 3.45 cents a mile, plus 15% 
     <lb/>
     sales tax, as against 7 cents a mile in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Instead of travelling costing us more, 
     <lb/>
     it would be considerably less. For instance, a 500 
     <lb/>
     mile ticket in Canada would cost less than $20. 
     <lb/>
     In Newfoundland, a 500 mile ticket at 7 cents per 
     <lb/>
     mile would cost $35. Therefore, if we were in 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada, the traveller would get that 
     <lb/>
     ticket $15 less then he is paying in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     today.

            <p>
     Newfoundland government credit — while 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner James stated that our surplus is 
     <lb/>
     around $38 million, it has been said that it is only 
     <lb/>
     $30 million. I'm satisfied to take the official 
     <lb/>
     figures. I was not a party to the last parliament of 
     <lb/>
     this country, nevertheless there is one fact which 
     <lb/>
     cannot be overlooked; only by default on the 
     <lb/>
     interest on our bonds could we have been able to 
     <lb/>
     carry on. It may be recalled that the late F.C. 
     <lb/>
     Alderdice, during the campaign of 1932, said that 
     <lb/>
     if elected he would get all the money he wanted 
     <lb/>
     within 48 hours. He was elected and what did we 
     <lb/>
     find? We found he couldn't get a cent. I am 
     <lb/>
     stating this to show that we had very little in<lb break="no"/>fluence as a dominion in raising a loan. We could 
     <lb/>
     not put our own currency on the market as it 
     <lb/>
     would not be accepted as legal tender in Canadian 
     <lb/>
     banks. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge 
     <lb/>
     the last 14 years, but we did not then and we do 
     <lb/>
     not today exert very much influence in the world. 
     <lb/>
     If prices soar in Canada, from which country we 
     <lb/>
     import the bulk of our goods, they will affect our 
     <lb/>
     prices throughout Newfoundland, and the same 
     <lb/>
     applies to other countries from which we import. 
     <lb/>
     It is too bad that some people have great doubts 
     <lb/>
     about Canada being solvent. I suppose they're 
     <lb/>
     what the Finance Minister would call a reconcila<lb break="no"/>tion account — even in that, very much attacks a 
     <lb/>
     country where the grand national income for this 
     <lb/>
     fiscal year is around $13 billion. And you deduct 
     <lb/>
     her national debt, an amount of $3 1/2 billion 
     <lb/>
     arising out of the war, and a billion dollars spent 
     <lb/>
     on the rehabilitation of the personnel of the fight<lb break="no"/>ing forces the wealth for one year is almost equal 
     <lb/>
     to her accumulated debt of 80 years of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I don't feel the crushing burden as being so 
     <lb/>
     great after this review. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Not one family in 80% of our population will 
     <lb/>
     pay one cent in taxes on personal income, be<lb break="no"/>cause they do not earn enough to come within the 
     <lb/>
     range of the taxable sale. Any Newfoundlander 


            <cb/>
        

     can check on this. In basing the amount New<lb break="no"/>foundland would pay in personal income tax, 
     <lb/>
     corporation and succession taxes, the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government took the returns of the past fiscal 
     <lb/>
     year, and I'm satisfied the figures are correct. 
     <lb/>
     What the amount will be under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     nobody can accurately foretell. Using the figures 
     <lb/>
     of the last fiscal year on the basis of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     scale, gives you the actual account if we had been 
     <lb/>
     under confederation that year. Future returns can 
     <lb/>
     only be estimated... Naturally we would not pay 
     <lb/>
     any duty on goods produced within the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Of the $25 million we purchased in 
     <lb/>
     the United States last fiscal year, 80% of this 
     <lb/>
     would be bought in Canada under union. There 
     <lb/>
     is an average duty paid of 25%, being $6.25 
     <lb/>
     million; that would be saved, plus a cheaper 
     <lb/>
     freight rate from Quebec to St. John's, 20% less 
     <lb/>
     than at the present. Are we going to import animal 
     <lb/>
     and poultry feed from the United States when we 
     <lb/>
     can import it freight free from Winnipeg under 
     <lb/>
     confederation? I cannot understand any person 
     <lb/>
     saying that the Canadian government's estimate 
     <lb/>
     of customs revenues is guesswork. The Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government has complete returns of the $43 mil<lb break="no"/>lion they exported to Newfoundland in the last 
     <lb/>
     fiscal year, and it would be easy to get returns of 
     <lb/>
     what came into our country from the United 
     <lb/>
     States, Great Britain and the rest of the world. The 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government figures would surely be 
     <lb/>
     more accurate than an individual expressing a 
     <lb/>
     viewpoint that is mere assumption. The same 
     <lb/>
     applies to the Canadian government's liquor es<lb break="no"/>timates... Surely a government which compiles 
     <lb/>
     statistics of millions of dollars each year, would 
     <lb/>
     be more likely to be accurate then any one in<lb break="no"/>dividual in Newfoundland. Of course, I am not a 
     <lb/>
     connoisseur of liquor, but I venture to guess that 
     <lb/>
     Seagrams whiskey had the same potency in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal during the past Christmas season as in 
     <lb/>
     the city of St. John's.

     <lb/>Duplessis that the provinces had not been ap<lb break="no"/>proached before terms of confederation were for<lb break="no"/>warded to the Governor. He said it was not 
     <lb/>necessary to consult the provinces as provision 
     <lb/>had been made in the British North America Act 
     <lb/>for the inclusion of Newfoundland in confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. How can we negotiate on terms that are 
     <lb/>provincial if the British North America Act 
     <lb/>provides the conditions under which a province 
     <lb/>can enter the union? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The family allowance immoral! It is strange 
     <lb/>
     that 22 nations have adopted these immoral fami<lb break="no"/>ly allowances. Can it not be realised that there's 
     <lb/>
     a very great principle behind government assis<lb break="no"/>tance for children of families? If we will not 
     <lb/>
     admit the justice of these monthly grants, so that 
     <lb/>
     our future men and women will be brought up 
     <lb/>
     better by being able to buy more food, we must 
     <lb/>
     condemn progress and social justice. If we cannot 
     <lb/>
     recognise that as a progressive step, it would be 
     <lb/>
     just as well to go back to the cave man days. Here 
     <lb/>
     it is in a nutshell: a greater distribution of the 
     <lb/>
     produced wealth to benefit children of fathers in 
     <lb/>
     lower earning classes. Even in Great Britain, they 
     <lb/>
     are endeavouring to provide money to pay family 
     <lb/>
     allowances as outlined in the Beveridge plan. Not 
     <lb/>
     so long ago I read in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadian Yearbook</hi> that 
     <lb/>
     family allowances were introduced for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of equalising opportunity for the children of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. What is immoral about this, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man?

     Veterans Act before us, and also the New<lb break="no"/>foundland act. This I know very little about, 
     <lb/>
     except I feel sure that if the officials of the Great 
     <lb/>
     War Veterans' Association were questioned on 
     <lb/>
     the difference between the benefits from Canada 
     <lb/>
     compared with those from Newfoundland, they 
     <lb/>
     would agree that the Canadian war veterans' 
     <lb/>
     agreement is at least 70% better than the present 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland agreement.

            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> I was told one instance, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, that I'm very much interested in. Take a 
     <lb/>man who returns from the war after 19 months, 
     <lb/>and during that time, through no fault of his own, 
     <lb/>he fails to make application for assistance in the 
     <lb/>manner of children. Under the Newfoundland act 
     <lb/>he is not entitled to anything, except the Great 
     <lb/>War Veterans' Association and the Women's 
     <lb/>Patriotic Association would take it up with the 
     <lb/>government and do their best to get something. I 
     <lb/>know for a fact that in some cases the returns they 
     <lb/>received were nothing except dole, which is 
     <lb/>facing the unemployed civilians. That is how the

     It is the overall picture that counts. Making our 
     <lb/>
     deductions, not on opinions or hearsay, but 
     <lb/>
     wherever possible on statistics, is confederation 
     <lb/>
     a good thing for the country or is it not? In 
     <lb/>
     arriving at our conclusion, we must be guided by 
     <lb/>
     history. It is over 450 years since this country was 
     <lb/>
     discovered. It's only 80 years since confederation 
     <lb/>
     took place in Canada. Why has Canada 
     <lb/>
     developed into a large industrial nation while we 
     <lb/>
     have not made the same progress? The position 
     <lb/>
     should be reversed, considering that Canada was 


            <cb/>
      

     discovered a very long time after this country. 
     <lb/>
     Average standard of wages. Isn't there a higher 
     <lb/>
     average standard of wages in Canada than in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? Hasn't the dollar more purchas<lb break="no"/>ing power in the Dominion of Canada than in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? Forget about hidden taxes and 
     <lb/>
     figments of the imagination. There is not one here 
     <lb/>
     but will admit that a dollar has at least 25% more 
     <lb/>
     value in the Dominion of Canada. You can be 
     <lb/>
     assured that if prices soar in Canada they will be 
     <lb/>
     much higher here in a country that has to import 
     <lb/>
     about 80% of its requirements. There's a book 
     <lb/>
     here, Mr. Chairman, that costs 25 cents. Some 
     <lb/>
     member said that you could get all the informa<lb break="no"/>tion you want in this book in connection with 
     <lb/>
     taxes, I think 120-odd taxes on shoes, 150 or 160 
     <lb/>
     taxes on something else, and so forth. Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, we've been paying that all our lifetime. 
     <lb/>
     Under union with Canada we would have to pay 
     <lb/>
     in no more; and we wouldn't have to pay any 
     <lb/>
     duty.

     Major Cashin was a member of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Mr. W.S. Monroe, who tried to sell our 
     <lb/>
     Labrador to the province of Quebec for $15 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Now there are some who say that Duplessis 
     <lb/>
     is scheming to take it away from us. It is good to 
     <lb/>
     know that some realise the value of this territory 
     <lb/>
     today, but he should know that it is remotely 
     <lb/>
     impossible for Quebec or other provinces getting 
     <lb/>
     out territory. The tendency is to overestimate the 
     <lb/>
     power of 3.5 million French Canadians. Only in 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Quebec do French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     have a majority of the population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Municipal taxes. Those who state that in the 
     <lb/>
     event of confederation the property tax will be 
     <lb/>
     enforced on fishermcn's motor boats, stages, 
     <lb/>
     houses, etc., are not stating facts. As far as New<lb break="no"/>foundland is concerned, after confederation no 
     <lb/>
     property tax will be imposed. Mr. Chairman, all 
     <lb/>
     down through my life I've often heard the story 
     <lb/>
     that if we went in confederation with Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     glass in our windows would be taxed, our motor 
     <lb/>
     boats, fishing lines, and everything else would be 
     <lb/>
     taxed to the limit. If we turn to the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, clause 125, it states: "No land or 
     <lb/>
     property belonging to Canada or any province 
     <lb/>
     shall be liable to taxation." Now that's what we 
     <lb/>
     have got to go by — with the exception of 
     <lb/>
     municipal taxes, municipal councils and outport 
     <lb/>
     town councils. There is not one act of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada or the provinces that states that 
 

            <pb n="1144" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1144.jpg"/>

    <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> 
  <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
     

     it is compulsory to tax property, or compulsory 
     <lb/>
     to have such municipal governments. Neverthe<lb break="no"/>less, some communities might consider it to their 
     <lb/>
     advantage to ask for a town council, and the 
     <lb/>
     people there would elect their representatives and 
     <lb/>
     decide the amount of tax to be imposed on the 
     <lb/>
     people. I'm merely pointing this out to show that 
     <lb/>
     I am not against municipal government, if certain 
     <lb/>
     improvements could be carried out with the small 
     <lb/>
     taxation the people of the place can afford. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p>Newfoundlanders residing in Canada. It is 
     <lb/>being stated that there are over 100,000 New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders or descendants of Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers residing in Canada. In Verdun, Quebec, 
     <lb/>alone there are over 11,000, most of them hold 
     <lb/>responsible positions there. Some of them 
     <lb/>employ large numbers of men. With very few 
     <lb/>exceptions they are strong in their conviction that 
     <lb/>Newfoundlanders would benefit by confedera<lb break="no"/>tion.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, can Mr. Starkes

     <lb/>seems that there's something getting under his

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I had to rule you out of order

            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Unemployment. There is un<lb break="no"/>employment at the present time in Canada as well 
     <lb/>as in Newfoundland, the number there being 
     <lb/>around 65,000 or a half of 1%. The number 
     <lb/>unemployed in Newfoundland is very much 
     <lb/>higher proportionately. Canada is bringing 
     <lb/>monthly over 10,000 people from Europe, so this 
     <lb/>would indicate that the country is in flourishing 
     <lb/>condition. Prime Minister King stated some time 
  

            <cb/>
        

     ago that there were more people employed than 
     <lb/>
     at any other time. The federal government has set 
     <lb/>
     up an advisory committee of experts who are 
     <lb/>
     advising on public works to be started in a period 
     <lb/>
     of recession. They have allocated in the last few 
     <lb/>
     months $400 million worth of new public works 
     <lb/>
     to cushion this recession period, and they propose 
     <lb/>
     some very large expenditures this year. Taking 
     <lb/>
     all in all, if conditions get bad in the world the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian unemployed will be better off than in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. For instance in 1934 there were 
     <lb/>
     80,000 unemployed Newfoundlanders living on 
     <lb/>
     6 cents a day. At that period, in the whole of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, you could not find from coast to coast 
     <lb/>
     80,000 living in such poverty. This is a very 
     <lb/>
     serious matter, and the people should endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to find out the truth for themselves, and not be 
     <lb/>
     guided by the ravings of a few who may not be 
     <lb/>
     working in the best interests of the people as a 
     <lb/>
     whole.

     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> As this debate proceeded ... I found 
     <lb/>
     myself, sir, more and more satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that I was able to come to from a few 
     <lb/>
     months ago, after we finished our work in Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa. That conclusion is that the political, 
     <lb/>
     economical, and industrial life of this country 
     <lb/>
     should be more closely tied in with the great 
     <lb/>
     neighbour of ours to the west, if we are to avoid 
     <lb/>
     some of the pitfalls that we have experienced in 
     <lb/>
     the past. I am very conscious that it is easy to 
     <lb/>
     make a statement like that. But I can assure you 
     <lb/>
     that I have not come to that position easily, or by 
     <lb/>
     any haphazard process of reasoning. It has not 
     <lb/>
     been a hasty decision, and I don't think I have 
     <lb/>
     been persuaded by sentiment. I certainly do not 
     <lb/>
     have any political aspirations. I have been often 
     <lb/>
     kidded since I went to Ottawa that I might get a 
     <lb/>
     senatorship but I have no aspirations for that at 
     <lb/>
     all. I certainly do not want to take any part in 
     <lb/>
     federal or provincial politics.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> That may be, sir. I hope that we all 
     <lb/>
     will. I have got enough politics during the past 15 
     <lb/>
     or 16 months, although I must say that I am not 
     <lb/>
     too disappointed with the way that things have 
     <lb/>
     gone here in this National Convention that has 
     <lb/>
     been so much abused by the public. I am not 
     <lb/>
     disgusted with our discussions here, and the way 
     <lb/>
     they have been carried out. There have been some 
     <lb/>
     pretty rough spots and I've felt sometimes like

     raising my voice in protest at some of the things 
     <lb/>
     that have gone on, and I know that some of my 
     <lb/>
     friends outside have expected me to do that. But 
     <lb/>
     seeing it from inside this chamber and seeing it 
     <lb/>
     from outside is different; and 45 men getting 
     <lb/>
     together here, knowing human nature as I do, I 
     <lb/>
     don't think that we have done so badly. I am 
     <lb/>
     bound to say that there's been too much politics 
     <lb/>
     in it. I didn't bargain for that when I came to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. I didn't think there was going to be 
     <lb/>
     any politics at all associated with it. But that 
     <lb/>
     shows just how innocent I was, and just how 
     <lb/>
     ignorant I was about politics. But on the whole, 
     <lb/>
     while I have had to hang on to my chair some<lb break="no"/>times to keep myself from rising in protest at the 
     <lb/>
     way that some of the members have acted, yet I 
     <lb/>
     have allowed discretion to be the better part of 
     <lb/>
     valour and I have held my chair, although I have 
     <lb/>
     been much criticised for not sometimes rising... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want no part of politics in the future. There<lb break="no"/>fore I don't think that the decision that I have been 
     <lb/>
     able to make has been prejudiced. I have come to 
     <lb/>
     that decision as a result of a careful and intelligent 
     <lb/>
     analysis of the facts that I have been able to 
     <lb/>
     gather; and of the experience that I gained with 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation, the study that we were 
     <lb/>
     able to make of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     and of the federal system of government in 
     <lb/>
     general... I have come to the conclusion that this 
     <lb/>
     country's future should be tied up to the great 
     <lb/>
     country to the west of us.... I feel certain that I am 
     <lb/>
     right, and I have a reason to say it, that this 
     <lb/>
     country's future is definitely tied up within the 
     <lb/>
     federal system of government that we have so 
     <lb/>
     close to us.... Long before this Convention 
     <lb/>
     started, in the days of Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment — I believe with all my heart that we've 
     <lb/>
     seen the best days of government in this country 
     <lb/>
     under the Commission of Government, they've 
     <lb/>
     done some very, very fine things, but I've always 
     <lb/>
     thought that it is not the form of government that 
     <lb/>
     we should continue to have. While we were under 
     <lb/>
     the Commission and before the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion was thought of, I was thinking that when the 
     <lb/>
     time came to think of getting back to a more 
     <lb/>
     democratic form of government, that at least we 
     <lb/>
     should give this federal system an opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     be surveyed. When the National Convention was 
     <lb/>
     announced and it came to my notice, I thought 
     <lb/>
     that this was a splendid opportunity to do that... 
     <lb/>
     I have made the study, and as I say, as faithfully 
    

            <cb/>
          

     and as carefully as I can, and I have come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that my thoughts along that line have 
     <lb/>
     many things to justify them. Our destiny, our 
     <lb/>
     future, if we are to have anything better than we 
     <lb/>
     have had in the past, is definitely tied up with a 
     <lb/>
     federal system of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I'm encouraged by the fact that some of my 
     <lb/>
     friends within the city and around this country, 
     <lb/>
     men and women who could not be said to be 
     <lb/>
     biased in any way, who are detached from politics 
     <lb/>
     and business life, whose minds have been trained 
     <lb/>
     to think things through objectively, many of them 
     <lb/>
     think the same as I do. My mind is made up. It 
     <lb/>
     has been made up for a few months now, since I 
     <lb/>
     have been able to study it with the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion. I will admit that it is not made up in such a 
     <lb/>
     way, closed in such a way that it is incapable of 
     <lb/>
     being changed... If anyone can show me why we 
     <lb/>
     should not go into federal union with Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     if anyone can show me that this country will be 
     <lb/>
     worse off, that our people will suffer more under 
     <lb/>
     confederation, I am perfectly willing to change 
     <lb/>
     my mind and to work just as hard for that form of 
     <lb/>
     government which will give our people the very 
     <lb/>
     best that they deserve. Having made up my mind 
     <lb/>
     and done it as seriously as I can, with as much 
     <lb/>
     thought as I am capable of, I think I am in a 
     <lb/>
     position to advise the delegates here, and through 
     <lb/>
     them the country in general, to give this type of 
     <lb/>
     government a careful consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have done it here as carefully as we can. 
     <lb/>
     We've all been serious about it. There have been 
     <lb/>
     some arguments against it, but I have not been 
     <lb/>
     swayed to the point that I am able to make a 
     <lb/>
     change in the position that I have taken. There 
     <lb/>
     have been some arguments that have had some<lb break="no"/>thing to justify them. But they can be refuted... 
     <lb/>
     Some of the arguments, and I don't say it unkind<lb break="no"/>ly, have tended to drive me into confederation, 
     <lb/>
     even if I didn't feel that I could support it intel<lb break="no"/>ligently. But that's by the way.... The issue is soon 
     <lb/>
     going to be put into the hands of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     I would say to my fellow delegates that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to see to it, whatever our opinions are, that the 
     <lb/>
     people get the opportunity to express themselves 
     <lb/>
     on this matter. And not only that, but we ought to 
     <lb/>
     see to it that they get the opportunity to express 
     <lb/>
     themselves on other forms of government as well. 
     <lb/>
     They are the final judges and they have a right to 
     <lb/>
     have the final say. Perhaps never before have they 
     <lb/>
     had, or will they have such a fair opportunity to 
 

            <pb n="1146" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1146.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1146</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
     

     express themselves, because before, when they 
     <lb/>
     have been called upon to vote upon certain issues, 
     <lb/>
     it has been tangled up with politics. I think that 
     <lb/>
     the people should have an opportunity to express 
     <lb/>
     themselves on the form of government that they 
     <lb/>
     want for this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, as far as the terms are concerned, the 
     <lb/>
     terms laid down in this Grey Book that has been 
     <lb/>
     so much talked of, I find myself agreeing with my 
     <lb/>
     colleague from the Ottawa delegation, Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins, when he says that they are the best possible 
     <lb/>
     terms that Canada could offer. Of course, he 
     <lb/>
     qualified it by saying "under the conditions." I 
     <lb/>
     can put in that qualification also but I do not 
     <lb/>
     consider the circumstances as unfavourable as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins does. It is true that we did not have 
     <lb/>
     a battery of experts with us in Ottawa, it is true 
     <lb/>
     we were not experts ourselves, it is true we did 
     <lb/>
     not have any of the civil servants which we tried 
     <lb/>
     to obtain before we went, but were denied. If we 
     <lb/>
     had had these civil servants with us, I feel sure 
     <lb/>
     that we would not have spent three months in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. But while we weren't experts ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     and while we didn't have civil servants with us, 
     <lb/>
     make no mistake about it gentlemen, we had the 
     <lb/>
     facts about this country. Members of this delega<lb break="no"/>tion who don't like confederation can say a lot of 
     <lb/>
     things to deny that, but I want to tell you that we 
     <lb/>
     had facts, the facts about this country; and we had 
     <lb/>
     men on that delegation who could present these 
     <lb/>
     facts. We had men who were very capable of 
     <lb/>
     presenting the facts. I don't claim to be one of 
     <lb/>
     them. I took a small part, as faithfully as I could. 
     <lb/>
     And what is just as important, we had men of 
     <lb/>
     goodwill. We had men with a good spirit backing 
     <lb/>
     them, and men who gained the respect of the 
     <lb/>
     federal government officials in Ottawa. With 
     <lb/>
     that, with the facts before us, and with goodwill, 
     <lb/>
     we made what I consider to be the right and 
     <lb/>
     proper approach. We laid the facts before them. 
     <lb/>
     And together, in an atmosphere of respect for one 
     <lb/>
     another, and in an atmosphere of trust and sin<lb break="no"/>cerity, we worked out a plan whereby New<lb break="no"/>foundland might fit into the federal system of 
     <lb/>
     government and operate as the tenth province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now it's been said that we didn't get good 
     <lb/>
     terms; we didn't get the financial end of it very 
     <lb/>
     generous. But in my estimation, take it for what 
     <lb/>
     it's worth, we got just as good terms as we could 
     <lb/>
     possibly get, recognising the fact that the federal 
     <lb/>
     system is made up of different provinces that 
 

            <cb/>
      

     have their claims; they came into the union, and 
     <lb/>
     they were brought in on certain terms, and we had 
     <lb/>
     to come in on certain terms, and if we had been 
     <lb/>
     given more generous terms.... It wouldn't be fair 
     <lb/>
     for the federal government to go too far to give 
     <lb/>
     us special services, special concessions when 
     <lb/>
     they have to consider that there are other mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the family who have to live within the 
     <lb/>
     family. To go in at all, we must go in on equal 
     <lb/>
     terms, and we are going to need to go in with 
     <lb/>
     these terms. I'm not convinced that, these are not 
     <lb/>
     generous terms under the circumstances. I think 
     <lb/>
     they are generous terms; what is worrying me is 
     <lb/>
     whether the Parliament of Canada will ratify 
     <lb/>
     these terms or not. And I wonder if they do not 
     <lb/>
     feel that they are so generous that perhaps they 
     <lb/>
     will not be ratified. But I feel that they will, they 
     <lb/>
     are generous, and I would pay a lot of attention 
     <lb/>
     to the arguments that Mr. Butt made here so ably 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon. If I were thinking that New<lb break="no"/>foundland under federal union to be an ideal 
     <lb/>
     place, one which will have after union unlimited 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, I would pay a lot of attention to the 
     <lb/>
     arguments being made. But I don't see that it can 
     <lb/>
     be an ideal state, or that we will have unlimited 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. I don't see the road ahead of us as too 
     <lb/>
     straight, with too many roses. I feel that we have 
     <lb/>
     a hard uphill climb to make. We have got a hard 
     <lb/>
     country to live in. We haven't got the natural 
     <lb/>
     resources that other countries have, don't let us 
     <lb/>
     kid ourselves. We're not too generously supplied 
     <lb/>
     with natural resources, and the means of making 
     <lb/>
     them a good living. It's going to be a hard job for 
     <lb/>
     us to do it. But I am of the opinion that we can do 
     <lb/>
     it better within the federal system of Canada, than 
     <lb/>
     we can do it on our own. I agree with Mr. Butt, 
     <lb/>
     when he raised his voice in the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     morale of our people and all that, but there's a 
     <lb/>
     limit to it. And our people will have the morale 
     <lb/>
     and the spirit, and respect for themselves, when 
     <lb/>
     they find that they're getting somewhere. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that we'll get somewhere under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and our people's respect for themselves will be 
     <lb/>
     forthcoming when they see that. That's all I have 
     <lb/>
     to say on that line. I would like to reply, though, 
     <lb/>
     to my friend Major Cashin's contention that we 
     <lb/>
     went representing a subservient people, begging 
     <lb/>
     for help — Major, you know that statement, 
     <lb/>
     something like that.

     that statement, sir, I contend that you're wrong. 
     <lb/>
     We went there representing not a subservient but 
     <lb/>
     a brave people, a financially strong country, and 
     <lb/>
     a people capable of good government. That 
     <lb/>
     would be the general tone, I think, of the delega<lb break="no"/>tion which went to Ottawa and worked there for 
     <lb/>
     three months. We were led in that spirit by our 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, Mr. Bradley, when he made his two 
     <lb/>
     masterly replies to the addresses of welcome 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. Mackenzie King on the first meeting in 
     <lb/>
     his country club and the next morning when he 
     <lb/>
     made the official welcome speech. Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>
     made two masterly replies to these speeches. I am 
     <lb/>
     told that they did not appear in our newspapers in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland If they didn't, it's just too bad. 
     <lb/>
     Those pieces should have appeared in our papers, 
     <lb/>
     and when the history of Newfoundland is written, 
     <lb/>
     they should be put into that history to give our 
     <lb/>
     people something like the Gettysburg address 
     <lb/>
     that is so respected by the people of America. 
     <lb/>
     That's how I feel about these replies that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley made, and the spirit of them. He pointed 
     <lb/>
     out among other things in those replies that we 
     <lb/>
     were not a crippled people, and we did not come 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa looking for economic crutches to lean 
     <lb/>
     upon, and other things along that line.<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> That 
     <lb/>
     whole spirit was maintained through-out our dis<lb break="no"/>cussions. We weren't a subservient people. We 
     <lb/>
     went there representing a bold, courageous 
     <lb/>
     people and tried to hold our end up as best we 
     <lb/>
     could. I think the Major is absolutely wrong, and 
     <lb/>
     I think he's unfair. If he'd examine the facts I 
     <lb/>
     think that he would find that we did not do badly 
     <lb/>
     and that we did do a good job. Now sir, I don't 
     <lb/>
     know if I have more time to continue. Do you 
     <lb/>
     want to be in till 6 o'clock? I think I'll be finished 
     <lb/>
     in a quarter of an hour.

     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> When the committee rose for the

     <lb/>
     Major Cashin has made that the delegation went 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa representing a subservient people beg<lb break="no"/>ging for help. I was trying to point out that as far

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of

     <lb/>
     memory serves me correctly, that the delegation 


            <cb/>
    

     went to Ottawa in a subservient manner, not as 
     <lb/>
     representatives of a proper and prosperous 
     <lb/>
     people. I can remember my words. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> ....Now sir, I do not intend to reply 
     <lb/>
     to the many, varied arguments made in this Con<lb break="no"/>vention against the terms that we have here in the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book. I think that this Ottawa delegation is 
     <lb/>
     acting the part of wisdom when it allowed Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood to reply to those who had spoken 
     <lb/>
     on the question. I think that it's wise to do that, 
     <lb/>
     not only because he is in my estimation the most 
     <lb/>
     capable person of doing it, without casting a 
     <lb/>
     reflection on any other member of the delegation, 
     <lb/>
     but his doing it naturally limits and conserves 
     <lb/>
     time in this debate. But there is one matter that I 
     <lb/>
     would like to draw attention to. As we all know, 
     <lb/>
     Labrador has played a prominent part in these 
     <lb/>
     discussions and rightly so. It is an important part 
     <lb/>
     of our territory, made all the more important 
     <lb/>
     because of the great iron ore deposits already 
     <lb/>
     found there and the timber wealth that we know 
     <lb/>
     it possesses. But I have a feeling, sir, that some<lb break="no"/>times that importance is altogether warped out of 
     <lb/>
     shape when some member or members are trying 
     <lb/>
     to make a point and ... sometimes I feel that we 
     <lb/>
     are boosting a little too much in making claims 
     <lb/>
     for the great wealth of Labrador, as much as I feel 
     <lb/>
     that it is a value to this country and will be in the 
     <lb/>
     future. It has been said here that Labrador is so 
     <lb/>
     important that Canada is intending to get it at all 
     <lb/>
     costs, by hook or by crook. That I am not able to 
     <lb/>
     follow. My experience at Ottawa and what I 
     <lb/>
     know about the Canadian ambitions do not lead 
     <lb/>
     me to that conclusion. We all know that Canada 
     <lb/>
     has great vast territories to the west and to the 
     <lb/>
     north and it has great natural resources. The 
     <lb/>
     resources that we think of as ours in Labrador — 
     <lb/>
     the mineral wealth there, the iron ore that's found 
     <lb/>
     there — one must remember that we only possess 
     <lb/>
     a part of it. When the Mining Committee brought 
     <lb/>
     in its report sometime last year we were able to 
     <lb/>
     say that the deposits were fairly equal. But I 
     <lb/>
     understand that that would not be true today, that 
     <lb/>
     the better part of the deposits of iron ore are being 
     <lb/>
     discovered on the Quebec side. But there are 
     <lb/>
     great deposits on our side also. I'm not so much 
     <lb/>
     afraid that we are going to lose the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     possession as some of the members seem to be.... 
     <lb/>
     I place my trust, sir, in the Privy Council and also

     in the sense of justice that they're building up in 
     <lb/>
     this great western hemisphere of ours. I don't feel 
     <lb/>
     that we have much to worry about in the fear that 
     <lb/>
     we might lose our Labrador possession, seeing 
     <lb/>
     that it is legally handed down to us by the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council, and seeing that we're living on this side 
     <lb/>
     of the world, this western hemisphere where 
     <lb/>
     there is such a high sense of justice. I feel that we 
     <lb/>
     might have more reason to be afraid of losing our 
     <lb/>
     Labrador territory not so much from anyone out<lb break="no"/>side taking a hold of it, not so much that Quebec 
     <lb/>
     will come and take it from us but perhaps there 
     <lb/>
     might be some weakness within our own selves, 
     <lb/>
     or in our governments of the future which might 
     <lb/>
     succumb to offers made for Labrador and we 
     <lb/>
     might lose it in that way. We are reminded here 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon that a deal was contemplated in 
     <lb/>
     selling it for $15 million. We had a question 
     <lb/>
     asked here the other day whether there was an 
     <lb/>
     offer made recently for the sale of Labrador at 
     <lb/>
     $150 million. These are very attractive figures, 
     <lb/>
     and there is a possibility that sometime our own 
     <lb/>
     government might succumb to accepting such an 
     <lb/>
     amount as that and thereby lose a great posses<lb break="no"/>sion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am very proud to represent that great 
     <lb/>
     country, that great territory in the north which 
     <lb/>
     means will mean so much to us as a country. But 
     <lb/>
     the concern that has been expressed so far in this 
     <lb/>
     National Convention about Labrador has been a 
     <lb/>
     concern about the iron ore deposits and the great 
     <lb/>
     timber resources that we have there. We must not 
     <lb/>
     forget that there is in Labrador a population of 
     <lb/>
     over 5,500 human souls.... These great people in 
     <lb/>
     the north have received very little consideration 
     <lb/>
     from governments of this island in the past. They 
     <lb/>
     have been sadly and wilfully neglected by our 
     <lb/>
     responsible governments in the past.... It might 
     <lb/>
     almost be described as a shame and a disgrace on 
     <lb/>
     past governments, the way that Labrador has 
     <lb/>
     been neglected, until we found some iron ore 
     <lb/>
     deposits and became conscious of its great timber 
     <lb/>
     resources and so forth. If we as delegates were to 
     <lb/>
     go to the people of Labrador and ask them what 
     <lb/>
     they think of governments of Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     the past, I'm afraid that we would get answers 
     <lb/>
     that would humiliate us, as I have been 
     <lb/>
     humiliated very often when talking to people in 
     <lb/>
     that country about governments of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and trying to uphold the governments 
 

            <cb/>
    

     that we have had in the past, and making excuses 
     <lb/>
     for the way that they have been treated.... Why I 
     <lb/>
     bring this matter up, sir, is that recently two 
     <lb/>
     members of the Convention pointed out that 
     <lb/>
     when Mr. Smallwood brought in his budget for 
     <lb/>
     provincial expenditure, he omitted to put in 
     <lb/>
     $10,000 for dole for the Labrador people. That 
     <lb/>
     was pointed out by two members of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion and I was asked on one occasion what I 
     <lb/>
     thought of it. It was pointed out also on that 
     <lb/>
     occasion that responsible governments in the past 
     <lb/>
     made provision for dole for Labrador and that's 
     <lb/>
     very true.... But very little other consideration 
     <lb/>
     was given to these people. Now in the plan that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood had for the government of the 
     <lb/>
     future, there was preparation made for the health 
     <lb/>
     of the people in Labrador.... There were plans 
     <lb/>
     made for the people of Labrador in that govern<lb break="no"/>ment envisaged by Mr. Smallwood as he brought 
     <lb/>
     in that provincial budget. Now dole, it is true, was 
     <lb/>
     something that legitimately belongs to them and 
     <lb/>
     some plansmade for them whereby they might 
     <lb/>
     be able to earn a decent living. From the family 
     <lb/>
     allowances, from one source alone there will go 
     <lb/>
     to the people of Labrador every year...<ref target="#fn_09">[1]</ref>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> ....It's not my intention to speak at 
     <lb/>
     length on the question of confederation because 
     <lb/>
     I am still prepared to cover the whole ground 
     <lb/>
     under forms of government, and I wish to avoid 
     <lb/>
     as much repetition as possible. I realise that a very 
     <lb/>
     large proportion of what has been said will be 
     <lb/>
     said again before the final date of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. Those who advocate confederation will talk 
     <lb/>
     very little else in the debate to follow, what 
     <lb/>
     should or should not go on the ballot paper. I 
     <lb/>
     think the digest of whatl have prepared to the last 
     <lb/>
     question was given over VOCM and published in 
     <lb/>
     the daily press on December 27. My position was 
     <lb/>
     stated unequivocally, and I have never seen any 
     <lb/>
     real reason to alter the views I have always enter<lb break="no"/>tained, that our people in this modern, civilised, 
     <lb/>
     Christian age should be permitted to think, act, 
     <lb/>
     pray and manage their own affairs.... As I view 
     <lb/>
     it, taking the English-speaking world as an ex<lb break="no"/>ample, we have Great Britain, the United States 
     <lb/>
     of America and Canada strongly contesting for 
     <lb/>
     the central seat of government; and well-wishers 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, 
     <lb/>
     South Africa and the British and American 
     <lb/>
     colonies in the West Indies. Now all these people

     are being speedily forced together by various sets 
     <lb/>
     of circumstances... Now to summarise the posi<lb break="no"/>tion regarding Newfoundland, let it be made 
     <lb/>
     clear, that it's not our people, our economy, or 
     <lb/>
     both, which interests that group, or any member 
     <lb/>
     of it, but rather our clearly defined geographical 
     <lb/>
     or strategical position, the Gibraltar of the west. 
     <lb/>
     It is from this angle rather than our intrinsic value 
     <lb/>
     as the possessor or producer of wealth that we 
     <lb/>
     should lay a special emphasis on, stressing our 
     <lb/>
     real worth as a proposed partner with any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of that group. Notwithstanding the fact that 
     <lb/>
     our virgin territory in the Labrador may possess 
     <lb/>
     much valuable wealth, I am of the very definite 
     <lb/>
     opinion that Newfoundland is controlled and will 
     <lb/>
     be more fully controlled in the future by an inter<lb break="no"/>national body in which Great Britain, the USA 
     <lb/>
     and Canada will be represented. The unfortunate, 
     <lb/>
     unsettled and troubled conditions in the world 
     <lb/>
     today makes this impossible to avoid. But the 
     <lb/>
     interest of our population and Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     a whole could best be served by a revised form 
     <lb/>
     of self-government for our country. And I would 
     <lb/>
     not agree to more than 15 members serving on 
     <lb/>
     that body. The basis of terms may have appeared 
     <lb/>
     at first sight to be generally fair to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     But the more we examine them the more we are 
     <lb/>
     reminded of a huge iceberg which starts to sway 
     <lb/>
     toward the sea.... Mr. Chairman, unless our 
     <lb/>
     Canadian friends are prepared to equalise our 
     <lb/>
     national debt, putting aside the difference to be 
     <lb/>
     spent for the development of this country, and 
     <lb/>
     accept us as equal partners and prove we are to 
     <lb/>
     be treated as such, I fail to see how any fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minded Newfoundlander can vote for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. We have all heard sufficient proof from both 
     <lb/>
     sides since the day it started. We should know by 
     <lb/>
     now what is fair and what is not fair in these 
     <lb/>
     terms. There must of necessity be inherent in 
     <lb/>
     every man such a thing as reason. And regardless 
     <lb/>
     of how they vote I'll give to every man the credit 
     <lb/>
     of possessing a fair and equal proportion of this 
     <lb/>
     gift. Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled to appeal to 
     <lb/>
     every member of this Convention to put both 
     <lb/>
     conscience and reason to the test. This is not a 
     <lb/>
     matter that we should take lightly. It is very, very 
     <lb/>
     serious. And it would be nothing short of an act 
     <lb/>
     of betrayal of your people's trust, to ask them to 
     <lb/>
     vote for a form of government which has not been 
     <lb/>
     fully explored or negotiated by a properly con<lb break="no"/>stituted or elected government of the people of 
  

            <cb/>
         

     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have a serious task to perform, and it is our 
     <lb/>
     right and duty not to fail the people at this crucial 
     <lb/>
     hour. I advise you, gentlemen, to put New<lb break="no"/>foundland and our people first, and never let them 
     <lb/>
     down. You must know that when we voted to get 
     <lb/>
     these terms, we were all anxious to give New<lb break="no"/>foundland the best form of government possible, 
     <lb/>
     subject of course to the final wishes of the people. 
     <lb/>
     We are undeveloped solely because our progress 
     <lb/>
     has been incessantly retarded ever since 1497 by 
     <lb/>
     the ancient and worn-out colonial policy of the 
     <lb/>
     mother country, and by the constant fear and 
     <lb/>
     dread in the minds of our past governments of 
     <lb/>
     creating too great a national debt. Spend $13 
     <lb/>
     million a year for the next ten years on develop<lb break="no"/>ment work in Newfoundland, and our social and 
     <lb/>
     economic structures will be above what Canada's 
     <lb/>
     are today; and we would still have a much lower 
     <lb/>
     per capita debt. This debt must be breached, in 
     <lb/>
     addition to receiving sufficient back from the 
     <lb/>
     federal government to balance our provincial 
     <lb/>
     budget. I strongly think then that is reasonable. 
     <lb/>
     Supposing my friend Mr. Ballam... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Gentlemen, would you kindly 
     <lb/>
     refrain from talking, please?.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Supposing my friend Mr. Ballam 
     <lb/>
     and I decide we're going into partnership. We're 
     <lb/>
     going to buy a schooner together. We put $1,000 
     <lb/>
     each in the deal. Now let us say that Mr. Ballam 
     <lb/>
     owes Mr. Hickman on my left $200, and I owe 
     <lb/>
     him $1,400, just the same proportion as we have 
     <lb/>
     between Canada's and Newfoundland's debt 
     <lb/>
     today. Would it look fair to Mr. Ballam or the 
     <lb/>
     public for the partnership to pay the two bills? 
     <lb/>
     Someone may say, but this is different, this is a 
     <lb/>
     country, a piece of land. All right, we will call it 
     <lb/>
     a piece of land. Now Mr. Ballam's land is un<lb break="no"/>cleared, undeveloped and he owes only $200. 
     <lb/>
     Mine is cleared, has a nice farmhouse on it, a 
     <lb/>
     good road through it, hothouse, machinery to do 
     <lb/>
     the work, but I owe for it all. Would it be right for 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ballam to assume my bills unless lpaid into 
     <lb/>
     a trust fund sufficient cash to develop my 
     <lb/>
     partner's property to the level of my own? That's 
     <lb/>
     exactly the picture as I see it, and I'm trying to 
     <lb/>
     make it plain to the people. That's about as plain 
     <lb/>
     as I can go and that is exactly how I view the plans 
     <lb/>
     before us. I am not really prejudiced. I want what 
     <lb/>
     is best for our people but no outside partnership 
     <lb/>
     would ever prove best unless a sound basis of

            <fw type="num">1150</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     common reason is used. And a lot of the argu<lb break="no"/>ments we've heard here are not what any intel<lb break="no"/>ligent person could call sound reasoning. Our 
     <lb/>
     people are not as gullible as some persons may 
     <lb/>
     think.... The arguments in many cases are weak. 
     <lb/>
     Let us have faith first in ourselves, for without 
     <lb/>
     trust and confidence in our own ability we will 
     <lb/>
     not be much of an asset to any country. Let us 
     <lb/>
     pave the future with courage and devotion to the 
     <lb/>
     land that gave us what we have. If we are hurt in 
     <lb/>
     the process, let us try to do better, and the same 
     <lb/>
     hand that guides all nations cherish such ambi<lb break="no"/>tions, and faith in themselves will bring New<lb break="no"/>foundland to her reward. I recommend an 
     <lb/>
     independent country on her own, or a proud 
     <lb/>
     partner in a larger family. Thank you, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> Mr. Chairman, with your kind per<lb break="no"/>mission, I wish to make a few remarks of a 
     <lb/>
     general nature. During the past few days, I have 
     <lb/>
     had the privilege to listen to some eloquent 
     <lb/>
     speeches bearing on matters now before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. They made recommendations on which 
     <lb/>
     confederation might be considered. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin in his forcible address made reference to 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of a comparable future in consider<lb break="no"/>ing the entry into confederation; to that I agree. 
     <lb/>
     He also gave evidence that the ancient political 
     <lb/>
     spirit is not dead. Mr. Higgins, among other 
     <lb/>
     things, pointed out that by reason of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land's geographical position she gradually grew 
     <lb/>
     in influence. He felt that under the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation had done a good job and 
     <lb/>
     that the recommendations before us were a good 
     <lb/>
     basis for future negotiations. He stated further 
     <lb/>
     that confederation could be taken up at some 
     <lb/>
     future date. He gave me the impression that he 
     <lb/>
     had a feeling that at some future date it would be 
     <lb/>
     to the advantage of Newfoundland to unite with 
     <lb/>
     a larger power. I might say in passing that there 
     <lb/>
     are those who share our view. Mr. Harrington 
     <lb/>
     gave us a historical picture of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     leading us step by step to her present importance. 
     <lb/>
     Other speakers have had their quota of interesting 
     <lb/>
     information. The majority, I think, advocated a 
     <lb/>
     return to responsible government realising of 
     <lb/>
     course that the final say rests with the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland.... I have but one vote and after 
     <lb/>
     careful consideration of the whole question con<lb break="no"/>fronting us, I shall do what I feel is in the general 
     <lb/>
     interest of this country.... The debate on the terms 
     <lb/>
     is shortly to be concluded, as is the Convention 
 

            <cb/>
          

     itself. In connection with the latter I say that it is 
     <lb/>
     high time. On the former, I am led to wonder to 
     <lb/>
     what extent have our people been helped in the 
     <lb/>
     making of the great and serious decision they will 
     <lb/>
     eventually be called upon to make. Personally sir, 
     <lb/>
     I feel they have not by this Convention been 
     <lb/>
     given the help they expected, and could and 
     <lb/>
     should have been given. I am convinced, further, 
     <lb/>
     far too much time has been taken up in airing our 
     <lb/>
     special political views. In consequence our 
     <lb/>
     people are left in mid-air, left to decide a great 
     <lb/>
     question based on knowledge they have acquired 
     <lb/>
     apart largely from that which was drawn out 
     <lb/>
     through the medium of this Convention. I said 
     <lb/>
     some time ago that this Convention would go 
     <lb/>
     down in history. It certainly shall, and be remem<lb break="no"/>bered for one of two things: either what it did or 
     <lb/>
     did not accomplish for the common good of our 
     <lb/>
     fellow man. During the Christmas recess, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I met and conversed with men from 
     <lb/>
     districts other than my own and I am more than 
     <lb/>
     ever convinced that a lot of our people are disap<lb break="no"/>pointed because of the lack of helpful informa<lb break="no"/>tion thus far emanating from this Convention.... 
     <lb/>
     I would have to say that it is not too late yet. The 
     <lb/>
     choosing of forms of government sir, is some<lb break="no"/>thing which should not be treated lightly.... It is 
     <lb/>
     generally felt that the mischief started in the early 
     <lb/>
     stages of the Convention by the entry of party 
     <lb/>
     politics which still is in evidence, that it has 
     <lb/>
     retarded somewhat the real purpose and work of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention. Some have expressed themsel<lb break="no"/>ves in favour of responsible government. Some 
     <lb/>
     have expressed themselves as favourable to 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada. That is their right.... Per<lb break="no"/>sonally, because I feel that the question of con<lb break="no"/>federation calls for careful thought based on 
     <lb/>
     definite and reliable facts, I refrain from express<lb break="no"/>ing my opinion as to the wisdom or otherwise of 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada. I do not mean to infer that the 
     <lb/>
     facts before us are not reliable or that I am hostile 
     <lb/>
     to confederation. I feel that at some time in the 
     <lb/>
     not too distant future, it will be much to the 
     <lb/>
     advantage of Newfoundland to unite to some 
     <lb/>
     larger power than herself, whatever that power 
     <lb/>
     may be. Every man and woman in this land will, 
     <lb/>
     in due time, be called upon to consider and make 
     <lb/>
     a choice of forms of government submitted to 
     <lb/>
     them. How necessary it is then, that they be well, 
     <lb/>
     impartially and correctly informed on all matters 
     <lb/>
     and that any personal ambitions of ours which 
 

            <pb n="1151" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1151.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1151</fw>
         

     might induce us to make things appear other then 
     <lb/>
     they really are should be kept in the background. 
     <lb/>
     We know that the most solid foundation of a true 
     <lb/>
     democracy is a well-informed electorate. I am 
     <lb/>
     personally not aspiring to any place in any future 
     <lb/>
     political service of this country. But I do desire 
     <lb/>
     that which will produce the most good for the 
     <lb/>
     most people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Going back briefly to touch on the document 
     <lb/>
     before us on the question of confederation ... I 
     <lb/>
     believe that I am correct in saying that the 
     <lb/>
     average man ... wants some definite information, 
     <lb/>
     something he can clearly understand, and I think 
     <lb/>
     I am correct in saying that he wishes to have this. 
     <lb/>
     One, what will be the purchasing ability of his 
     <lb/>
     dollar under the Canadian set-up as compared 
     <lb/>
     with the present? Two, what taxes in every par<lb break="no"/>ticular and the nature of those taxes payable as 
     <lb/>
     compared with ours. Three, he wishes so far as is 
     <lb/>
     possible to have a fair knowledge of the whole 
     <lb/>
     confederation question that he may place that 
     <lb/>
     knowledge side by side with the knowledge he 
     <lb/>
     has of Commission of Government and respon<lb break="no"/>sible government and act accordingly. He wants 
     <lb/>
     the comparative picture all around so far as that 
     <lb/>
     is possible to give.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, speaking of faith, faith in our<lb break="no"/>selves, faith in our neighbours, we can only show 
     <lb/>
     our faith in the common sense, sound reasoning 
     <lb/>
     power and good judgement of our fellow men by 
     <lb/>
     being honest and above-board, by furnishing 
     <lb/>
     truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
     <lb/>
     The people of this country do not expect to get 
     <lb/>
     something for nothing. They have not been 
     <lb/>
     brought up that way. And because they have not 
     <lb/>
     been brought up that way, all who are respon<lb break="no"/>sible, they want to know how much they have to 
     <lb/>
     contribute towards providing these things. 
     <lb/>
     Speaking of family allowances, old age pensions 
     <lb/>
     — these are good things, without a doubt. I have 
     <lb/>
     for years been greatly interested in the question 
     <lb/>
     of providing a decent pension for our old age 
     <lb/>
     fishermen. I introduced a scheme at the opening 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention but the Convention having no 
     <lb/>
     legislative powers, nothing could be done about 
     <lb/>
     it.... I find myself not quite in agreement with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian pension scheme as outlined in the act 
     <lb/>
     before us. First, the age is quite unsuitable.... It is 
     <lb/>
     too late in life and then again there is the claim of 
     <lb/>
     the pension authorities upon the estate of the 
     <lb/>
     pensioner. I do not like the scheme and am con<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
     
vinced that very few in Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     approve of in its present form. But I feel that it's 
     <lb/>
     possible to improve that scheme and so make it 
     <lb/>
     suit our people I believe, in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     old age fishermen's pension, that it should come 
     <lb/>
     about through the medium of contributions on 
     <lb/>
     their part either directly or indirectly, because it 
     <lb/>
     is common knowledge that one appreciates to a 
     <lb/>
     greater extent that to which they made a contribu<lb break="no"/>tion than that which comes to them apart from 
     <lb/>
     that.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am most anxious that the Convention finish 
     <lb/>
     its work as quickly as possible. So I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to speak at length. I sincerely hope that 
     <lb/>
     between now and the day of the referendum, that 
     <lb/>
     our people will have gleaned a general 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the possibilities for Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     under the forms of government which are to be 
     <lb/>
     placed on the ballot paper, and from which they 
     <lb/>
     shall have to make a choice. Whatever our future 
     <lb/>
     form of government may be ... its path will be by 
     <lb/>
     no means strewn with roses. We will acquire, 
     <lb/>
     whatever the form of government, strong, fair, 
     <lb/>
     sincere men at the helm. Co-operation will be 
     <lb/>
     necessary between government and people and 
     <lb/>
     there must be a full realisation of the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     each to each. The time will eventually come sir, 
     <lb/>
     when we shall be called upon to make a grave 
     <lb/>
     decision, such a decision as we have never been 
     <lb/>
     called upon in our day to make, a most serious 
     <lb/>
     decision upon which will depend what may be the 
     <lb/>
     future welfare of our children and our children's 
     <lb/>
     children. In the light of that, Mr. Chairman, God 
     <lb/>
     grant that our decision may be based on sound 
     <lb/>
     reasoning and not on selfishness and fear.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I'm not going to use up much 
     <lb/>
     of the precious time we have left talking 
     <lb/>
     generalities. I'm going to use my share of it 
     <lb/>
     answering point by point the almost countless 
     <lb/>
     wrong charges made against these terms of con<lb break="no"/>federation. But there is one general remark I do 
     <lb/>
     want to make because it badly needs to be made. 
     <lb/>
     We've been told by speaker after speaker how 
     <lb/>
     complicated these terms are. They've been tell<lb break="no"/>ing us again and again how hard they are to 
     <lb/>
     understand. They tried to paint a picture of some<lb break="no"/>thing so hard to understand, so complicated, so 
     <lb/>
     mixed up and confused, so inaccurate and so 
     <lb/>
     lacking in information that it would be just a 
     <lb/>
     waste of time for our people to try to understand 
 

            <pb n="1152" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1152.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1152</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
          

     it. I suppose after painting that picture, their play 
     <lb/>
     is to vote against submitting them to the people 
     <lb/>
     on the grounds that if they can't understand them, 
     <lb/>
     how could the people understand them? Well, 
     <lb/>
     you can lead a horse to the well but you can't 
     <lb/>
     make him drink. None so blind as those who will 
     <lb/>
     not see. There is nothing complicated or hard to 
     <lb/>
     understand about these terms, as I shall show 
     <lb/>
     before I sit down. They are plain, simple, 
     <lb/>
     straightforward, and they can be understood by 
     <lb/>
     any average Newfoundlander. But first we must 
     <lb/>
     strip away the tangled brush of wrong statements 
     <lb/>
     and twisted thinking that has been thrown all 
     <lb/>
     around us. When we have done so, these terms 
     <lb/>
     will stand out bright, understandable and attrac<lb break="no"/>tive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, I wish first to address myself to some 
     <lb/>
     of the points made by Major Cashin in his speech. 
     <lb/>
     It was very noticeable that during the three weeks 
     <lb/>
     we were debating these confederation terms, 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin remained silent except for one or 
     <lb/>
     two remarks he interpolated as we went along; 
     <lb/>
     but now it seems that he was saving up his breath, 
     <lb/>
     saving it up for one big effort to destroy con<lb break="no"/>federation with one big blow. So like the big, bad 
     <lb/>
     wolf, sir, in the fairy tale, he huffed and he puffed 
     <lb/>
     in a long straining effort to blow the house down. 
     <lb/>
     For three days he blew and what did he ac<lb break="no"/>complish? He only made confederation stronger 
     <lb/>
     than ever. Indeed, his effort was so feeble that I'm 
     <lb/>
     forced to conclude either that he has a soft spot 
     <lb/>
     in his heart for confederation and didn't want to 
     <lb/>
     hurt it, or else that he really wanted to hurt it but 
     <lb/>
     didn't know how because he didn't know enough 
     <lb/>
     about it and hadn't studied it enough. Certainly, 
     <lb/>
     if his speech was the great, expected, big gun that 
     <lb/>
     was going to thunder against confederation, the 
     <lb/>
     big gun turned out to be only a pea-shooter and a 
     <lb/>
     not very good pea-shooter at that. As might have 
     <lb/>
     been expected, Major Cashin got off his usual 
     <lb/>
     stuff about plots and conspiracies. This Conven<lb break="no"/>tion he tells us again is just a plot, just a con<lb break="no"/>spiracy, deliberately planned to confuse the 
     <lb/>
     people; planned to kill responsible government; 
     <lb/>
    planned to force Commission government upon 
     <lb/>us. Well, I won't waste time commenting on that. 
     <lb/>Major Cashin evidently believes it, certainly he 
     <lb/>has said it often enough. I don't believe there's 
     <lb/>one single word of truth in it. Now he tells us that 
     <lb/>my introduction of the confederation question, 
     <lb/>four or five weeks after the Convention opened, 
   

    
            <cb/>
        

     had the effect of dividing what should have been 
     <lb/>
     a united Convention. Isn't he forgetting some<lb break="no"/>thing? Isn't he forgetting that he himself divided 
     <lb/>
     the Convention weeks and weeks before I ever 
     <lb/>
     even mentioned confederation? Surely, surely he 
     <lb/>
     has not forgotten that inside of a week after the 
     <lb/>
     Convention opened, he launched an attack upon 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, upon the Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment and upon the British government itself. He 
     <lb/>
     told us that this Convention was dripping with 
     <lb/>
     treachery, that it was a glorified stall, something 
     <lb/>
     to fool us into Commission government. He told 
     <lb/>
     us that we should have responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     and that responsible government was the only 
     <lb/>
     thing we should discuss; all that in the very first 
     <lb/>
     week of the Convention's life, and now he turns 
     <lb/>
     around and says thatI am the one who divided 
     <lb/>
     the Convention by introducting my confedera<lb break="no"/>tion motion five or six weeks after he had made 
     <lb/>
     his famous speech, the very speech which threw 
     <lb/>
     down the gauntlet for responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     Then Major Cashin tells us that for 14 years 
     <lb/>
     the British government has been controlling 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's treasury, that is Newfound<lb break="no"/>land's public chest. For 14 years the British 
     <lb/>
     government has been controlling Newfound<lb break="no"/>land's treasury and confederation means that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government would control it. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, if the Canadian government controls 
     <lb/>
     our treasury as decently, as efficiently and as 
     <lb/>
     honestly as the British government has done it 
     <lb/>
     these past 14 years, it will be a grand thing for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to be a province of Canada, for 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada has fashioned its fis<lb break="no"/>cal system fairly and squarely after the British 
     <lb/>
     system, than which there is none better in the 
     <lb/>
     world, none cleaner, none more decent, none 
     <lb/>
     more efficient and none more honest. It will not 
     <lb/>
     go down well with our Newfoundland people as 
     <lb/>
     an argument against confederation to say that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government will control our treasury if 
     <lb/>
     we become a province as the British government 
     <lb/>
     has controlled it in the last 14 years. Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     tells us that it's the historical policy of the im<lb break="no"/>perial government of Great Britain for the past 80 
     <lb/>
     years, for Newfoundland to go into confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. He tells us that the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the Commission government are both 
     <lb/>
     in favour of confederation, that they're both 
     <lb/>
     promoting and backing confederation. Mr. Har<lb break="no"/>rington, incidentally, sir, told us the same thing. 
  

            <pb n="1153" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1153.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1153</fw>
          

     I don't know how true this is. But there's one 
     <lb/>
     thing I do know. If Major Cashin can convince 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland that the British 
     <lb/>
     government and the Commission government 
     <lb/>
     believe in confederation, if he can convince our 
     <lb/>
     people that the British government and the Com<lb break="no"/>mission government want us to vote for con<lb break="no"/>federation, if he can convince our people that the 
     <lb/>
     mother country thinks that confederation would 
     <lb/>
     be the best thing for us, if he can convince our 
     <lb/>
     people of these things, then nothing on earth, 
     <lb/>
     nothing on earth, will hold our people back from 
     <lb/>
     voting for confederation. As a confederate, I say 
     <lb/>
     now that I hope with all my heart that Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin is right.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At several points Major Cashin compared our 
     <lb/>
     railway with Canada's superb and world-famous 
     <lb/>
     transportation system. Mr. Chairman, didn't he 
     <lb/>
     realise that there's something comical about 
     <lb/>
     comparing our 600 miles with Canada's tens of 
     <lb/>
     thousands of miles of railways which happen to 
     <lb/>
     be amongst the very finest railways in the whole 
     <lb/>
     world? He spent practically an hour here telling 
     <lb/>
     us of the hundreds of millions and the thousands 
     <lb/>
     of millions of dollars that Canada's government 
     <lb/>
     has spent on her railways....<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin told us that the Bank of Canada 
     <lb/>
     made $150 million out of Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     United States dollars... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That it made $150 million worth in 
     <lb/>
     the transaction makes a different light in the 
     <lb/>
     terms.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh, no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The note I have made here, I 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood Major Cashin and the last thing I 
     <lb/>
     want to do... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I'm sorry if I... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It was such an amazing state<lb break="no"/>ment. I was going to go on here, but I won't go 
     <lb/>
     on if you didn't make that statement, I'm glad you 
     <lb/>
     didn't make it because that $150 million struck 
     <lb/>
     me between the two eyes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin told us this, I jotted it down, I 
     <lb/>
     won't guarantee, sir, that it's the identical words 
     <lb/>
     he used, pretty close. He said if we go in, we can't 
     <lb/>
     get out. Incidentally, it's a good slogan.... Mean<lb break="no"/>ing, of course, if we go into confederation, we got 
     <lb/>
     to stay there. Now sir, that statement is just about 
     <lb/>
     as true as a lot of others we've had flung at us in 


            <cb/>
          

     this debate. What is the simple truth of the mat<lb break="no"/>ter? If, when we go in, we find it a good thing, 
     <lb/>
     then we won't want to get out.... If we find it a 
     <lb/>
     bad thing, we cannot be kept in. We cannot be 
     <lb/>
     kept in against our will. There are nine provinces 
     <lb/>
     in the Canadian union, four of them came in in 
     <lb/>
     1867, one in 1869, one in 1871, another in 1873, 
     <lb/>
     and two of them in 1905. Not one, not one of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces has ever tried to get out. No province 
     <lb/>
     can be forced into confederation and no province 
     <lb/>
     can be forced to stay in against its will. All right, 
     <lb/>
     let's look at that for a moment. It's quite impor<lb break="no"/>tant. Let us say that in the referendum our people 
     <lb/>
     vote for confederation and that we become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. Let us say that after ten or 
     <lb/>
     15 years or 20 or 30 years we don't like it.... What 
     <lb/>
     can we do about it? Can Canada force us to stay 
     <lb/>
     in against our will? Can't we get out if we want 
     <lb/>
     to get out? Of course we can get out. We've got 
     <lb/>
     to want to get out. It's not enough for half a dozen 
     <lb/>
     people to want to get out. You have in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia today one man, at least one man, who 
     <lb/>
     thinks Nova Scotia should get out. And on July 1 
     <lb/>
     every year, which is Dominion Day, the first day 
     <lb/>
     of confederation, that one man flies his flag half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     mast. It's not enough for one man to want to get 
     <lb/>
     out. It's not enough for ten men. It's not enough 
     <lb/>
     for 50% of the people. But if the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland wanted to get out of confederation, if 
     <lb/>
     they really wanted to get out, nothing on earth, in 
     <lb/>
     earth or out of it can keep us into confederation, 
     <lb/>
     if we want to get out. Just in the same way that 
     <lb/>
     nothing will keep us from responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment if we really want it. Nothing will keep us 
     <lb/>
     from Commission government if we really want 
     <lb/>
     it, but we must want it. We must want to get out 
     <lb/>
     of confederation and if we do, nothing can keep 
     <lb/>
     us in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To go from the sublime to the ridiculous. 
     <lb/>
     Maj or Cashin told us that we wouldn't be allowed 
     <lb/>
     to import a fur coat from the United States. That, 
     <lb/>
     sir, will be bad news to our fishermen and espe<lb break="no"/>cially bad news to the thousands who are on the 
     <lb/>
     dole this winter. They won't be allowed, under 
     <lb/>
     confederation, to import a fur coat from the USA; 
     <lb/>
     if they import a fur coat it'll have to be from 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to take up a point made by Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin that Mr. Burry has touched upon here in 
     <lb/>
     his speech today, when the Major said that the

     Ottawa delegation went to Ottawa hat in hand — 
     <lb/>
     those were his words — begging from Ottawa — 
     <lb/>
     those were his words — hat in hand, begging 
     <lb/>
     from Ottawa. Now nothing could be further from 
     <lb/>
     the truth. The truth is the exact opposite of what 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin said. We went to Ottawa holding 
     <lb/>
     our heads high. We gave Newfoundland the 
     <lb/>
     highest kind of a name. We told Canada that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was sitting on top of the world. In 
     <lb/>
     all our newspaper interviews, and there were 
     <lb/>
     dozens of them, we kept up Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     name. In his speech at the very opening session 
     <lb/>
     of our conferences in Ottawa, our Chairman Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley said this, and I quote his exact words. He 
     <lb/>
     said: "Should these talks produce an under<lb break="no"/>standing between us, and that understanding be 
     <lb/>
     endorsed by the country in the forthcoming 
     <lb/>
     referendum and Newfoundland becomes the 
     <lb/>
     tenth province of your Canadian union, you will 
     <lb/>
     be receiving a proud people eager and deter<lb break="no"/>mined to pull their weight in generous measure. 
     <lb/>
     For make no mistake, union of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Canada will never take place, while our 
     <lb/>
     people have the decision, unless New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders are convinced that they have a con<lb break="no"/>tribution to make towards the general good of the 
     <lb/>
     partnership in which they share.".... It was broad<lb break="no"/>cast over the entire network of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Broadcasting Commission, and thousands of our 
     <lb/>
     own people heard it that night here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. As for myself, as I go back over the 
     <lb/>
     clippings of the interviews I gave to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     newspapers, I find that I made this public state<lb break="no"/>ment and I quote my exact words: "Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood termed Labrador the richest area in 
     <lb/>
     the world today". Is that letting the country 
     <lb/>
     down? Is that putting on the poor mouth? Is that 
     <lb/>
     giving Newfoundland a bad name? "Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood termed Labrador the richest area in 
     <lb/>
     the world today", God forgive me, and though I 
     <lb/>
     may not be so far off, I don't know. But I didn't 
     <lb/>
     put on the poor mouth. Again I made this state<lb break="no"/>ment: "While we have survived for 450 years in 
     <lb/>
     isolation and made tremendous progress, we will 
     <lb/>
     never reach our maximum strength in isolation, 
     <lb/>
     we must be part of North America." You might 
     <lb/>
     take note, sir, of the words "while we have sur<lb break="no"/>vived for 450 years in isolation and made tremen<lb break="no"/>dous progress". Then again I said, 
     <lb/>
     "Newfoundland is not bankrupt but blooming". 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I could go on quoting dozens of statements 
  

            <cb/>
         

     like that made by me to the newspapers of Canada 
     <lb/>
     during our visit to that country. It may suit Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin to say that we went up there running the 
     <lb/>
     country down or putting on the poor mouth or as 
     <lb/>
     beggars, but it simply isn't true. The exact op<lb break="no"/>posite is the truth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, one thing I hardly expected was that 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin would trot out Premier Duplessis 
     <lb/>
     again, but he did. He still professes to be afraid 
     <lb/>
     that the Quebec fascist, I beg your pardon, the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec premier will somehow or other manage 
     <lb/>
     to rob us of our Labrador. And while Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin was discussing this matter of Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     he gave utterance to what surely must be the 
     <lb/>
     strangest remark ever heard in this building since 
     <lb/>
     it was erected over 100 years ago, he said this, 
     <lb/>
     what dependence can we place on a mere 
     <lb/>
     decision of the Privy Council? What dependence 
     <lb/>
     can we place on a mere decision of the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council? Was Major Cashin serious? Did he 
     <lb/>
     mean that question to be taken seriously? Would 
     <lb/>
     he, a former cabinet minister, a former minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Crown, would he seriously suggest to the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country that no dependence can be 
     <lb/>
     placed on a decision of the Privy Council of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain? Can Major Cashin name any other court 
     <lb/>
     in the whole world whose verdicts and judgments 
     <lb/>
     merit and receive such universal respect and 
     <lb/>
     which are so binding as those of the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil? He cannot and no man can. But he finds 
     <lb/>
     himself straight up against what is for his argu<lb break="no"/>ment a very awkward fact, the fact that the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council has laid down the boundaries of our 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. So what did he do? He makes the futile 
     <lb/>
     and foolish attempt to throw doubt upon the 
     <lb/>
     validity of that Privy Council award and makes 
     <lb/>
     the extremely foolish statement that no depend<lb break="no"/>ence can be placed upon their famous decision on 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador boundary. And then he makes this 
     <lb/>
     further statement. The only inducement, he says, 
     <lb/>
     for Canada wanting Newfoundland is to get 
     <lb/>
     Labrador's mineral wealth. In fact, he says that 
     <lb/>
     when he was in Montreal the other day, some 
     <lb/>
     businessmen he met told him so. I won't dignify 
     <lb/>
     that statement with a reply, for any fifth form 
     <lb/>
     schoolboy could tell Major Cashin that it's highly 
     <lb/>
     unlikely that the petty businessmen that he met 
     <lb/>
     in Montreal would be in the confidence of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. Let's look at this matter 
     <lb/>
     clearly and squarely. Is that why Canada wants 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, to get the minerals of Labrador? 
     

            <pb n="1155" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-13_Page_1155.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1155</fw>
         

     Who has the minerals of Labrador right now? 
     <lb/>
     Isn't it the Labrador Mining and Exploration 
     <lb/>
     Company? Isn't that company spending millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars to develop those mineral deposits? And 
     <lb/>
     isn't this company a Canadian company with 
     <lb/>
     American capital in with them? What more could 
     <lb/>
     Canada want? They have Labrador's mineral 
     <lb/>
     wealth right now tied up safe and secure. And our 
     <lb/>
     Commission government gave it to them under 
     <lb/>
     an act of parliament. Canada already has the 
     <lb/>
     mineral wealth of Labrador. For goodness sake, 
     <lb/>
     let's keep our feet on the ground and not be led 
     <lb/>
     astray by such foolish statements. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Several times since this debate began it has 
     <lb/>
     been hinted or bluntly stated that if we go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation the Newfoundlanders working on 
     <lb/>
     the American bases would lose their jobs. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin apparently couldn't resist the temptation 
     <lb/>
     to make the statement. If this were true, if those 
     <lb/>
     2-3,000 Newfoundlanders now working on the 
     <lb/>
     American bases were to lose their jobs because 
     <lb/>
     of confederation, or if they could be made to 
     <lb/>
     believe that they'd lose their jobs, that would 
     <lb/>
     mean many thousands of votes against con<lb break="no"/>federation. Now what's the truth? Every member 
     <lb/>
     of the Ottawa delegation knows the truth, for the 
     <lb/>
     matter was raised by me in our talks with the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada, and every member of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation remembers what happened. We were 
     <lb/>
     told bluntly that the American bases would 
     <lb/>
     remain here. Mr. St. Laurent told us bluntly that 
     <lb/>
     the American bases would remain here as 
     <lb/>
     American bases. They would not be disturbed, 
     <lb/>
     and that the men would not lose their jobs through 
     <lb/>
     confederation. More than that, we were assured 
     <lb/>
     that an official statement would be made in Par<lb break="no"/>liament this winter to this very effect. And I see 
     <lb/>
     that since then Mr. St. Laurent in a public an<lb break="no"/>nouncement in Canada, sir, at a press conference 
     <lb/>
     has announced publicly to the world that the 
     <lb/>
     American bases in Newfoundland will not be 
     <lb/>
     disturbed by confederation. The American bases 
     <lb/>
     will go right on as though nothing had happened. 
     <lb/>
     And later this year there will be a statement in the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of Canada itself, an official statement 
     <lb/>
     to that effect, saying that in plain words. The 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders working on the bases may be<lb break="no"/>come deceived on this matter for a short while, 
     <lb/>
     but they'll know the full truth before the referen<lb break="no"/>dum takes place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, something of the same situa<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     tion exists with regard to the 4,000 men who are 
     <lb/>
     employed on our railway system. A strong effort 
     <lb/>
     has been made to persuade our railroaders that 
     <lb/>
     some of them would lose their jobs under con<lb break="no"/>federation. The cold-blooded truth of course is 
     <lb/>
     that their only hope of not losing their jobs is 
     <lb/>
     confederation, their only hope. Sixty men have 
     <lb/>
     lost their jobs in the last few days already in 
     <lb/>
     Port-aux-Basques.... If we don't get confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, if our transporation system is not taken over 
     <lb/>
     by the Canadian National Railways, then 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of railroaders are doomed to layoffs and 
     <lb/>
     wage cuts. Confederation is their only hope of 
     <lb/>
     security, stability, steady wages and expanding 
     <lb/>
     opportunities. When the matter came up early in 
     <lb/>
     the debate, I said I would settle it once and for all. 
     <lb/>
     I addressed the following question to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada: "To ask His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor in Commission to ask the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to state whether in the event of union 
     <lb/>
     and the consequent operation of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland railway steamship system by Canada, 
     <lb/>
     whether it would be the policy of the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to continue in their employment all the 
     <lb/>
     employees of the system at the time of union, 
     <lb/>
     with the rights and privileges with respect to 
     <lb/>
     continuity of employment that are accorded to 
     <lb/>
     employees of the Canadian National Railway." 
     <lb/>
     Now I ask you to note carefully how I worded 
     <lb/>
     that question, for you may be sure that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government noted the wording very 
     <lb/>
     carefully. I did not ask if it would be their policy 
     <lb/>
     to hold on to some of the employees of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway, but all the employees existing at the 
     <lb/>
     date of union. That's why it breaks my heart to 
     <lb/>
     see 60 men laid off today in Port-aux-Basques. I 
     <lb/>
     want to see no railroader laid off until after this 
     <lb/>
     referendum, not another man. Because all who 
     <lb/>
     are employed on the railway at the date of union 
     <lb/>
     will be kept on and it's a shame to see a man laid 
     <lb/>
     off before that. I did not ask if it would be the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government's policy to hold on to some 
     <lb/>
     of the employees, but all the employees existing 
     <lb/>
     at the date of union.... My question was unmis<lb break="no"/>takable in its meaning. And what was the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government's answer? I'll read it to 
     <lb/>
     you:

            <p>Could words be plainer? If we enter confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, our railroaders will be offered employment 
     <lb/>by the CNR, not some of them, not nearly all of 
     <lb/>them, but all of them. Not only will they all be 
     <lb/>employed, but employed with all the same rights 
     <lb/>and privileges of permanent or continued 
     <lb/>employment of other employees of the CNR. Mr. 
     <lb/>Chairman, it will take some twisting to change 
     <lb/>the meaning of that. There's no crowd of men 
     <lb/>who will gain more from confederation than our 
     <lb/>railroaders.... Their unions are all connected with 
     <lb/>the railroad unions of Canada, and under con<lb break="no"/>federation the Canadian National will stretch all 
     <lb/>the way from St. John's to Vancouver. And 
     <lb/>they'll have the satisfaction of seeing passenger 
     <lb/>rates, freight rates and express rates in New<lb break="no"/>foundland brought down to the same rates as in 
     <lb/>Canada. They'll have the satisfaction of seeing 
     <lb/>the wages of some of them brought up to the 
     <lb/>Canadian level. Above all, their professional 
     <lb/>pride in the railway will be pleased by a great 
     <lb/>program of improvement and rehabilitation of 
     <lb/>their railway system by the CNR, for we're told 
     <lb/>by the CNR experts that $17 million will have to 
     <lb/>be spent by Canada in the first ten years to put 
     <lb/>our transportation system in satisfactory shape.

            <p>Sir, as we have only one stenographer, I think 
     <lb/>the thought was that we might rise till tomorrow. 
     <lb/>In that case sir, I move the adjournment of the

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, speaking to

     <lb/>fact that the sands of time are running out not only

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, having told us that, I would

     There's no reason that I know of why any mem<lb break="no"/>ber desiring to speak to this debate shouldn't do 
     <lb/>
     so after I have completed. There's no thought in 
     <lb/>
     my part of using up all the remaining time in this 
     <lb/>
     debate. I believe there are a number of members 
     <lb/>
     who do wish to speak... I have no intention 
     <lb/>
     whatever of replying to any member who speaks 
     <lb/>
     after I have finished. I don't guarantee that I 
     <lb/>
     won't. I'm quite sincere about it. To the best of 
     <lb/>
     my knowledge and belief, I will not speak any 
     <lb/>
     more after I have finished this speech that I began 
     <lb/>
     tonight. But if something outrageous comes up, 
     <lb/>
     something that I think I absolutely must answer, 
     <lb/>
     well then, I can't guarantee that I won't answer 
     <lb/>
     it. But honestly sir, I have no intention of making 
     <lb/>
     another speech beyond the one I'm making now. 
     <lb/>
      </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before I put the motion to ad<lb break="no"/>journ the actual position is that the order paper 
     <lb/>tomorrow will of necessity contain a closure mo<lb break="no"/>tion. I've intimated already to the House and I 
     <lb/>reaffirm that ruling now, that I have a discretion 
     <lb/>as to when that motion should be put. Unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, a number of members have seen fit to 
     <lb/>quite improperly telephone me or communicate 
     <lb/>with me in my private offices and at my home, to 
     <lb/>make sure that I could guarantee them that they'd 
     <lb/>be able to speak. Of course I can give no such 
     <lb/>guarantee to any members, and I think Major 
     <lb/>Cashin with his very wide parliamentary ex<lb break="no"/>perience can quite sympathise and agree with me 
     <lb/>in this. I have to give the floor according to the 
     <lb/>rules to any man that occupies the floor at any 
     <lb/>given time. But in view of the fact that there is a 
     <lb/>closure motion coming up, and in view of the fact 
     <lb/>that some members have not been able to address 
     <lb/>themselves on this matter and desire to address 
     <lb/>themselves on the matter, I will have to consider 
     <lb/>when that closure motion is to be put. In doing 
     <lb/>so, I naturally want to facilitate members who 
     <lb/>have not been able to address themselves on this 
     <lb/>question, because I'd be very reluctant by prema<lb break="no"/>turely putting a closure motion to abridge or take 
     <lb/>away the rights to speak that they would other<lb break="no"/>wise have had. Therefore the actual position is 
     <lb/>simply this. While this closure motion is coming 
     <lb/>up tomorrow, I may conceivably not put it tomor<lb break="no"/>row. Not saying when, I'll have to be guided by 
     <lb/>the temperament and the assistance of the House 
     <lb/>in trying to determine the time at which that 
     <lb/>closure motion should be put. But meanwhile, to

     <lb/>towards the end of our business, and in order to 
     <lb/>properly facilitate it, I move that as the first order

     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee on the Economic Report

     <lb/>tabled on November 21, I have had a reply quite

     <lb/>the reply is not yet completed: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask His

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>1. What pension (superannuation) rights 
     <lb/>have the employees of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Railway acquired under Newfoundland law? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. In the event of the Newfoundland Rail<lb break="no"/>way being taken over and operated by the 
     <lb/>Canadian National Railways, who will be 
     <lb/>liable for the payment of pensions payable to 
     <lb/>employees of the Newfoundland Railway 
     <lb/>presently retired and receiving pensions?

     Dear Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reply to question No. 1 submitted by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. F.D. Fogwill, and forwarded to me with 
     <lb/>
     your letter of November 24, 1947, the reply 
     <lb/>
     is that employees of the Newfoundland Rail<lb break="no"/>way have no statutory rights to pensions.

     Annual allowances calculated on the basis 
     <lb/>
     established by the Civil Service Act, 1926, as 
     <lb/>
     amended, are allowed ex gratia to railway 
     <lb/>
     employees on retirement in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the terms of a Minute of Commission of

     1934.

     With regard to question No. 2 submitted 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Fogwill, as it is addressed to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government in the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, enquiries are being made as to 
     <lb/>
     whether that government would be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to accept and deal with it.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Mr. 
     <lb/>Hollett I beg to move the following resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I move that immediately before the order of 
     <lb/>the day is called on Wednesday the 14th day 
     <lb/>of January, 1948, on resuming the debate on 
     <lb/>the motion, that the Convention resolve itself 
     <lb/>into a committee of the whole to further 
     <lb/>consider and discuss the proposals received 
     <lb/>on November 6 from the Right Honourable 
     <lb/>the Prime Minister of Canada, and the said 
     <lb/>debate shall not be further adjourned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Higgins, while I am not 
     <lb/>rejecting the motion, my feeling is that, being a 
     <lb/>closure motion, it should be deferred; that is to 
     <lb/>say, that I should defer receiving and putting the 
     <lb/>motion at the present time. As you, Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>particularly, and perhaps members generally will 
     <lb/>be aware, there is not, nor has there ever been, 
     <lb/>strangely enough, any statute covering closure in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. Now, standing order 54 reads as 
     <lb/>follows: "Whenever any matter arises in the 
     <lb/>course of the proceedings of the Convention ... 
     <lb/>which, in the opinion of the Chairman, is not 
     <lb/>covered by these Standing Orders, reference shall 
     <lb/>be made to the rules and orders of the House of 
     <lb/>Assembly in Newfoundland, and the matter 
     <lb/>decided in accordance with these rules, save that 
     <lb/>where the said rules are silent upon the matter the
