<!-- GL, 2017-08-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
<!--<p>
     item what would not be in it if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province, and the total is $11 million. Now that 
     <lb/>
     $11 million off $25 million, and what is left? 
     <lb/>
     What is left is what the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     would have to find and the amount, if my arith<lb break="no"/>metic is right, is $14 million. On the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     estimate of the Economic Committee, which I did 
     <lb/>
     not make and which is not my estimate, if we take 
     <lb/>
     off from that those expenditures and expenses 
     <lb/>
     which the Government of Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     not have to pay if we became a province, what 
     <lb/>
     would be left for the provincial government to 
     <lb/>
     find would be $14 million, not $17 million as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman suggested, not $19 million as Mr. Hol- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     lett suggested, not even the $15 million that I 
     <lb/>
     brought in myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is still repetitious. Can't we go 
     <lb/>
     on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will walk out. I will resign 
     <lb/>
     myself. I will hold myself in sir, but... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now, Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't want to turn on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins, but ifI do someone will be hurt, and I 
     <lb/>
     won't be the one that will be hurt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> So what, Mr. Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You will find out if I tum on 
     <lb/>
     you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood, you are not 
     <lb/>
     going to turn on any other member, nor is any 
     <lb/>
     other member going to turn because he wants to. 
     <lb/>
     I quite agree that if the figure is $14 million there 
     <lb/>
     is no occasion for you to go on and say $19 
     <lb/>
     million and $17 million and $15 million... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I said, sir, that it is $14 million. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Please don't repeat it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I am most eager to co<lb break="no"/>operate with you. I am equally eager to stand on 
     <lb/>my rights in this Convention, and I do represent 
     <lb/>a section of this country, but I bow to you as I 
     <lb/>have always done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite agree, but I still say that 
     <lb/>
     if you are going to avoid the charge of tedious 
     <lb/>
     repetition, in quoting a certain figure it is not four 
     <lb/>
     or five or ten other figures. If it is something come 
     <lb/>
     right out positively and say what it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But as I was replying to a 
     <lb/>
     speech made by Mr. Hollett, and as Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     in that speech put it at $19 million, am I not 
     <lb/>
     entitled to point out that it is $14 million and not 
     <lb/>
     the $19 million that Mr. Hollett said — that and 
     <lb/>
     nothing else? That is exactly what I was doing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am glad now, sir. $14 million is what would 
     <lb/>
    take for the provincial government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to carry on. Not the $15 million that I 
     <lb/>formerly estimated, not the $17 million that Mr. 
     <lb/>Hickman estimated, and not the $19 million that 
     <lb/>Mr. Hollett estimated, but $14 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not what you said before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, sir, I was under the im<lb break="no"/>pression that I had. Possibly my memory on that 
     <lb/>is defective. We have to find it in one way and 
     <lb/>another, some from the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>in taxation, some as I have shown in other ways 
     <lb/>from other sources. Incidentally, it has been 
     <lb/>pointed out to me by Mr. Hollett that I have taken 
     <lb/>the $28 million cash surplus that we have and put 
     <lb/>it on deposit with the Government of Canada at 
     <lb/>2.63% interest, and I have taken the interest for 
     <lb/>the first four years as $600,000 a year, and then 
     <lb/>for the second four years I have averaged it as 
     <lb/>$299,000, roughly $300,000 a year. I admit on 
     <lb/>the objection from Mr. Hollett that I won't have 
     <lb/>$28 million to put on deposit with the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. I will go a little further, and say 
     <lb/>that I will have $38 million, which Major Cashin 
     <lb/>has told us is the surplus in this country. I will 
     <lb/>now take the 2.63% interest on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Now sir, it is 5.45 pm, and you have asked me 
     <lb/>
     kindly to rise the House at this time. If we are 
     <lb/>
     meeting tonight... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't think it is possible to 
     <lb/>
     continue the debate tonight, and perhaps not for 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the week, and I don't think we will be 
     <lb/>
     able to come this evening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You mean that we can't meet 
     <lb/>
     for the rest of the week in the night, but we can 
     <lb/>
     in the day? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Oh yes, definitely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In that case I move that the 
     <lb/>
     committee rise and report progress and ask leave 
     <lb/>
     to sit again tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>[The committee rose and reported progress. The<lb/>remaining orders of the day were deferred, and<lb/>the Convention adjourned]<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, before we go into 
     <lb/>
     committee of the whole this afternoon, there is a 
     <lb/>
     matter that I want to raise, and I think this is the 
     <lb/>
     time to do it. Yesterday afternoon I had occasion 
     <lb/>
     to interject on two occasions when Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood was replying to Mr. Hollett; on both of 
     <lb/>
     these occasions I used the term "tedious repeti<lb break="no"/>tion of irrelevant matters". On the second oc<lb break="no"/>casion Mr. Smallwood made a statement, of which 
     <lb/>
     I have not all the words, but I have sufficient that 
     <lb/>
     I want to repeat them today. Mr. Smallwood said, 
     <lb/>
     "I don't want to turn on Mr. Higgins, but if I do 
     <lb/>
     someone will be hurt, and I won't be the one that 
     <lb/>
     will be hurt. I am holding myself in." As far as I 
     <lb/>
     am concerned that was a reflection on me, both 
     <lb/>
     offensive and unbecoming, and many of the 
     <lb/>
     members here today think that Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     has something on me. That is the general tenor of 
     <lb/>
     the remarks, and the impression they got. That's 
     <lb/>
     not only here, but outside of the Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     I want a ruling on that. If Mr. Smallwood has any 
     <lb/>
     reflection to give on me, now is the time and place 
     <lb/>
     for him to say it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think I am in duty bound to 
     <lb/>
     hold that Mr. Smallwood was out of order, under 
     <lb/>
     standing order 31, which provides: "No member 
     <lb/>
     may use offensive or unbecoming words in ref<lb break="no"/>erence to any member of the Convention". It is a 
     <lb/>
     fair inference to draw that the words were offen<lb break="no"/>sive, but if there should be any doubt, I think it is 
     <lb/>
     clear that the words were unbecoming, and if the 
     <lb/>
     words are either offensive or unbecoming, the 
     <lb/>
     member using the words is entirely out of order. 
     <lb/>
     I personally feel that the words were both offen<lb break="no"/>sive and unbecoming, and it might well be that 
     <lb/>
     there was a serious innuendo contained in the 
     <lb/>
     words. I am asked to decide whether or not stand<lb break="no"/>ing order 31 was violated by Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     when he employed the language to which my 


            <cb/>
          

     attention has been drawn by Mr. Higgins. I hold 
     <lb/>
     and rule that the language employed, while per<lb break="no"/>haps in the heat of the moment, was both offen<lb break="no"/>sive and unbecoming, and certainly was not 
     <lb/>
     calculated to preserve to the distinguished mem<lb break="no"/>ber for St. John's East, and all other members of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, the dignity and respect to which 
     <lb/>
     they are fairly entitled, and the responsibility for 
     <lb/>
     which is laid on my shoulders. I feel that the 
     <lb/>
     dignity, and perhaps the integrity of the member 
     <lb/>
     for St. John's East has been perhaps seriously 
     <lb/>
     affected by the language employed. Before going 
     <lb/>
     any further with the matter, if there is anything 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Smallwood would want to say I would 
     <lb/>
     be very glad to hear from him. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, if it will please 
     <lb/>Mr. Higgins, or reassure him, let me say that what 
     <lb/>I had in mind when I Spoke as I did yesterday, 
     <lb/>was nothing secret, nothing confidential. I cer<lb break="no"/>tainly had no thought that I had anything on him. 
     <lb/>What I had in mind, sir, was rather something that 
     <lb/>was extremely public, that all the members of this 
     <lb/>Convention and most of the people in this country 
     <lb/>know all about. That's what I had in mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, if you don't mind... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I am making an explana<lb break="no"/>tion. So far as I am concerned no member of this 
     <lb/>Convention has had as much to take and contend 
     <lb/>with as I have. I suppose I am the only member 
     <lb/>here who has been called a "Quisling" and a 
     <lb/>"Judas Iscariot". I did not object. I have been in 
     <lb/>this chamber in one capacity or another since 
     <lb/>1915, and I have learned to let things of that 
     <lb/>nature be as water on a duck's back. The man who 
     <lb/>called me a "Quisling" and a "Judas Iscariot" is 
     <lb/>perfectly well accustomed to calling and being 
     <lb/>called names in the past 25 years, and he rarely 
     <lb/>objects when anyone says anything to him, and I 
     <lb/>rarely object. What I had in mind yesterday was 
     <lb/>the continual process of being nagged at by Mr. 
     <lb/>Higgins. That's what I had in mind, and so I said 
     <lb/>that if I turned on him somebody would be sorry, 
     <lb/>and it would not be me. Perhaps I would have 
     <lb/>been sorry, but I would not be the only one. What 
     <lb/>I meant was that I would turn loose on him a 
     <lb/>verbal barrage. I have nothing on Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>except that since we returned from Ottawa I have 
     <lb/>been continually nagged at by him — in a very 
     <lb/>polite and mild way, but nevertheless nagged at, 
     <lb/>and I resent that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now while I am on my feet and speaking to a

     point of privilege, I want to draw your attention 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that I have been charged publicly with 
     <lb/>
     having challenged Mr. Fudge to go outside and 
     <lb/>
     fight. This is untrue. It was Mr. Fudge who waved 
     <lb/>
     and pointed to the door. Now that was not broad<lb break="no"/>cast, what was heard was me saying, "What, go 
     <lb/>
     outside and fight?" He said nothing, butI saw the 
     <lb/>
     motion, and a few people in this House saw it, 
     <lb/>
     and my remarks were made after his gesture to 
     <lb/>
     the door —- "What, go out and fight?" Maybe the 
     <lb/>
     reporters were not looking up and around the 
     <lb/>
     chamber. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Never mind the reporters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, that is where the report 
     <lb/>
     went. I may be this and that, but I don't want to 
     <lb/>
     be a rowdy. I have been the victim of that sort of 
     <lb/>
     thing and I have said nothing about it. I can take 
     <lb/>
     it as well as try to give it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before you take your seat, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, I feel compelled to rule that you used 
     <lb/>
     unbecoming and offensive language towards the 
     <lb/>
     member for St. John's East, and whatever doubt 
     <lb/>
     I may otherwise have had upon my finding, it was 
     <lb/>
     resolved by your statement that you had nothing 
     <lb/>
     on Mr. Higgins beyond the fact that you have 
     <lb/>
     been irritated by the manner in which he has 
     <lb/>
     debated certain measures before the Chair with 
     <lb/>
     you at various times. With the source of your 
     <lb/>
     irritation I am not concerned; I am seriously 
     <lb/>
     concerned, however, over the fact that members 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention and members of the public 
     <lb/>
     should labour, or be left under the dangerous 
     <lb/>
     misapprehension by words employed by you, and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps at a time when you did not intend to 
     <lb/>
     convey any such misapprehension, that you had 
     <lb/>
     something on Mr. Higgins. According to you, 
     <lb/>
     beyond being irritated in the course of debate, 
     <lb/>
     you had nothing on Mr. Higgins, and there is 
     <lb/>
     nothing factual to justify yourleaving the impres<lb break="no"/>sion with anybody that you had something on 
     <lb/>
     him, in other words that his integrity and his 
     <lb/>
     honesty was in question. Now, no man can afford 
     <lb/>
     to disregard what each needs for his own protec<lb break="no"/>tion, and it is my duty to preserve you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, or any other member, from loose 
     <lb/>
     charges of dishonesty, and that is exactly what I 
     <lb/>
     propose to do as long as I am in this Chair for the 
     <lb/>
     obvious reason that all members stand equal 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair. In the circumstances therefore, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, I think you will agree that the 
     <lb/>
     fair and proper thing to do is to apologise to Mr. 


            <cb/>
          

     Higgins for the inferences which were gathered, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps quite unfairly so, but none the less effec<lb break="no"/>tively, by other members of the Convention and 
     <lb/>
     sections of the public outside. I must ask if you 
     <lb/>
     would be good enough to unqualifiedly retract, 
     <lb/>
     and apologise for any inconvenience or worry 
     <lb/>
     which perhaps you have quite unintentionally 
     <lb/>
     occasioned to Mr. Higgins by the utterance of the 
     <lb/>
     words. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have explained, but I have no 
     <lb/>
     apology to make. I have explained what I said and 
     <lb/>
     that eliminates the need of apology. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I rise to a point of privilege. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood tried to kill two birds at one shot. He 
     <lb/>
     says I offered him a challenge yesterday after<lb break="no"/>noon. That is not correct. When he did get a wee 
     <lb/>
     bit excited, I suppose I did make motions with my 
     <lb/>
     hand to the gallery and to the people there. That 
     <lb/>
     was all that was in my mind. Eventually he said, 
     <lb/>
     "I am not afraid of you", and he offered to chal<lb break="no"/>lenge me outside. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry for 
     <lb/>
     that, because I am not a rowdy. I can get along 
     <lb/>
     with people. But I am not prepared to accept a 
     <lb/>
     challenge from Mr. Smallwood and lie down on 
     <lb/>
     it. That is not my type. I do not permit Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood or anyone else to put anything over 
     <lb/>
     the air that would blacken my character. There<lb break="no"/>fore, if Mr. Smallwood thought, by the motion of 
     <lb/>
     my hand, it was a challenge to him to fight, he 
     <lb/>
     must have something. There was no such thing in 
     <lb/>
     my mind. When he offered the challenge, yes, I 
     <lb/>
     gladly accepted. That is all for now. That chal<lb break="no"/>lenge still stands in faimess to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country whom I represent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am going to call a ten minute 
     <lb/>
     recess. Before I do so, is there anything further 
     <lb/>
     you wish to say, Mr. Higgins? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood, this is perhaps 
     <lb/>
     even more painful to me than it is to you; but 
     <lb/>
     having regard to all the attendant circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     I am inescapably driven to the conclusion that 
     <lb/>
     there was definite violation of standing order 31 
     <lb/>
     yesterday. If I am correct, and I feel I am, the 
     <lb/>
     language employed by you was offensive and 
     <lb/>
     unbecoming. That being so, it becomes my duty 
     <lb/>
     to rule you were out of order on the occasion in 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is very clear thatl was out of 
     <lb/>
     order. I did violate rule 34, or whatever it is. There

     is nothing painful on my part about apologising 
     <lb/>
     to the Chair for my breach of that rule yesterday. 
     <lb/>
     Furthermore, I will go a little step over that and 
     <lb/>
     say I will gladly offer my apologies to the Chair 
     <lb/>
     for any rules I may break, if I am reminded of it.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have no intention of proceed<lb break="no"/>ing with any remarks. I concluded my remarks at 
     <lb/>
     the time we rose the committee yesterday after<lb break="no"/>noon. One thing I would like to say now: during 
     <lb/>
     the debate a number of questions came before the 
     <lb/>
     committee and were directed to the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. A number of replies arrived yesterday 
     <lb/>
     and these replies were read. It seems to be 
     <lb/>
     desirable that these be dealt with in somewhat 
     <lb/>
     greater detail in committee of the whole than was 
     <lb/>
     possible in formal session. Two of these were of 
     <lb/>
     the utmost importance and need to be explained. 
     <lb/>
     You will remember in the Grey Book, the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada gave its estimate of what 
     <lb/>
     revenue it would collect, and what money it 
     <lb/>
     would spend in Newfoundland. Two questions 
     <lb/>
     were directed to the Government of Canada on 
     <lb/>
     that estimate: Major Cashin, feeling the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government had been conservative on the wrong 
     <lb/>
     side, they would collect more, and on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand Mr. Hollett, being dissatisfied with one item 
     <lb/>
     showing what they would spend. We listed the 
     <lb/>
     various headings under which they would expect 
     <lb/>
     to spend money here. One of these headings was 
     <lb/>
     departmental expenditures, $9.4 million. No 
     <lb/>
     detail was given. Mr. Hollett asked for a break<lb break="no"/>down. They gave it. He read it yesterday after<lb break="no"/>noon. I fear few of us had the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     getting the details. I asked them to show us how 
     <lb/>
     they arrive at the estimate of $20 million a year 
     <lb/>
     they would expect to collect from the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. In their reply to me, which I read 
     <lb/>
     out without comment, they gave details. While 
     <lb/>
     the debate is on, it is highly desirable that both 
     <lb/>
     answers be repeated, and something done by us 
     <lb/>
     here to analyse and explain the meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     two answers. I do not propose to do it at this 
     <lb/>
     moment.

     to debate the information contained therein.

      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Since Christmas recess, I have con<lb break="no"/>cerned myself quite a lot with federal taxation, in 
     <lb/>the event of Newfoundland embracing union 
     <lb/>with Canada. We have had quite a debate on 
     <lb/>probable revenues and expenditures. I am not 
     <lb/>concerned with that, although I realise in that 
     <lb/>event we shall have to collect from the people 
     <lb/>probably $6-7 million. What I am concerned with 
     <lb/>is the different taxes imposed by the federal 
     <lb/>government. It was laid down in the Black Books, 
     <lb/>on which I received communications and 
     <lb/>answers to questions making inquiry as to the list 
     <lb/>of all the items coming under federal sales tax; 
     <lb/>also regulations in respect of transportation tax. I 
     <lb/>got the information and I have been informed 
     <lb/>what items are covered by the excise tax of 1947. 
     <lb/>During the Christmas recess, I applied the 
     <lb/>general sales tax to all imports coming into New<lb break="no"/>foundland in the fiscal year 1946-47. I may be in 
     <lb/>error, if so I will gladly admit it; if I am right, I 
     <lb/>ask members to admit it. I am not intending to 
     <lb/>quote all these taxes. Hams, salt beef, etc., sales 
     <lb/>tax would be $369,000. You have canned beef 
     <lb/>and other products, sales tax $65,458. Tea, sales 
     <lb/>tax $81,366. On confectionery, $52,000. All 
     <lb/>these are federal taxes; they go up the river. 
     <lb/>Boots, clothing, rubber boots, etc., $78,000. 
     <lb/>Tobacco, cigarettes, plug or pipe tobacco, 
     <lb/>$102,000. And so on the sad story goes. The total 
     <lb/>I arrived at, based on ourimports of last year, was 
     <lb/>$3,818,000. That does not take in local manufac<lb break="no"/>turing, which I shall come to by and by. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have here the excise tax act of Canada and I

     we imported $31 million worth of goods from 
     <lb/>
     outside Canada. It has been assumed that would 
     <lb/>
     be reduced to one-third. l have transferred one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     third of the imports to Canada, making a total of 
     <lb/>
     36,960 gallons of whiskey, $11 excise tax, 
     <lb/>
     revenue to the federal government — $406,000. 
     <lb/>
     Whiskey will give the federal government a 
     <lb/>
     revenue of $100,812. But the importation of gin 
     <lb/>
     has been alternating. The excise duty of $11 per 
     <lb/>
     gallon will give a revenue to the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment of $18,084. Now the other item, rum. We 
     <lb/>
     imported last year 123,740 gallons at a value of 
     <lb/>
     $284,574. The importations of Canadian rum 
     <lb/>
     amounted to 1,271 gallons, and if you add one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     third of the other imports you will get 42,096 
     <lb/>
     gallons. If you impose the excise duty you get a 
     <lb/>
     revenue to the Canadian government of 
     <lb/>
     $463,056. Other imports of rum will give a 
     <lb/>
     revenue to the Canadian government of 
     <lb/>
     $989,728. Brandy imports would give a revenue 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian government of $9,459. Other 
     <lb/>
     imports of brandy $24,876. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now tobacco, firm pressed and manufactured, 
     <lb/>
     total 149,041 pounds, multiplied by 77 cents per 
     <lb/>
     pound, which is the duty, will give us a revenue 
     <lb/>
     to the Dominion government of $114,761. Other 
     <lb/>
     tobacco imports 157,000 pounds, import duty $1 
     <lb/>
     per pound, will give us a revenue of $157,000. 
     <lb/>
     On top of that there is an excise tax of 2 cents per 
     <lb/>
     ounce. Now we have Newfoundland manufac<lb break="no"/>tured tobacco — 773,000 pounds; under federal 
     <lb/>
     union at 77 cents per pound, it would give the 
     <lb/>
     federal government $595,000. The duty on raw 
     <lb/>
     leaf tobacco is 20 cents per pound, will give a 
     <lb/>
     revenue to the Canadian government of 
     <lb/>
     $300,000. Last year we had an import of cigaret<lb break="no"/>tes of 545,860 pounds, a total on imported 
     <lb/>
     cigarettes of $1,402,551; and to that must be 
     <lb/>
     added an import tax on cigarettes which will be 
     <lb/>
     $568,000. Now then, we have our local manufac<lb break="no"/>tures. Last year we manufactured 159,962,000 
     <lb/>
     cigarettes. The excise duty of $6 per thousand and 
     <lb/>
     excise tax of 2 cents per pound equals 1 cent on 
     <lb/>
     each cigarette, which will give a revenue to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government of $1,589,620. Cigar im<lb break="no"/>ports: that will give a revenue to Canada of 
     <lb/>
     $30,846.

            <p>
     Letters and post cards, you will see in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book, 2 cents in addition to postage.... If 
     <lb/>
     we leave it at $100,000 I think I would be fair.

     they are collecting approximately $50,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     on a 10% tax, and the federal amusement tax is 
     <lb/>
     20%. I figure in St. John's we will collect a tax

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's abolished.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> When was it abolished?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Very recently. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> It must be recently. Telegraphs and 
     <lb/>
     cables, the tax amounts to 7 cents on each mes<lb break="no"/>sage. The total number of messages issued and

     transmitted in Newfoundland in 1946 amounted 
     <lb/>
     to one million, which will amount to $77,000, and 
     <lb/>
     that will go up the river too. Then we have a 3% 
     <lb/>
     tax on imports. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     ed and I want to know when it was abolished. I 
     <lb/>
     am very interested in these figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Well, I am interested now that you 
     <lb/>
     bring up the point. When was it abolished, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The taxing of amusements was 
     <lb/>
     done by the provinces and during the war by the 
     <lb/>
     federal government, and now again by the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. That was one of the causes of the dispute 
     <lb/>
     between Premier Angus MacDonald and the 
     <lb/>
     provinces about the tax agreement, and he would 
     <lb/>
     not sign until the federal government decided to 
     <lb/>
     hand it back to the provincial governments. He 
     <lb/>
     would not sign until it was settled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> What was the date? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I can't tell you the date of it. 
     <lb/>
     Send a letter to the provinces if you want to know. 
     <lb/>
     Forget it. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> If Mr. Smallwood is deliberately. 
     <lb/>trying to break up the harmony of the house he is 
     <lb/>not going to succeed as far as I am concerned. 
     <lb/>(Cries of Hear! Hear!) Tax on imports. I have 
     <lb/>applied the Canadian customs tariff to several 
     <lb/>hundred items of Newfoundland imports and I 
     <lb/>have arrived at the conclusion that the average 
     <lb/>rate will be 15%, and 15% on $20 million, on all 
     <lb/>imports except spirits and tobacco, which I have 
     <lb/>done separately, are $19 million, Because of the 
     <lb/>fact that I have taken some out, the excise on all 
     <lb/>imports will amount to $600,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Transportation tickets. On the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     tickets sold by the Newfoundland Railway, 
     <lb/>
     which I believe was $6 million, and taking into 
     <lb/>
     consideration the hire of buses and other means 
     <lb/>
     of transport in Newfoundland, and the tax on 
     <lb/>
     airways on people leaving Newfoundland, and on 
     <lb/>
     water transport, I have concluded that the figure 
     <lb/>
     of $400,000 is reasonable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On clocks and watches I figure there will be a 
     <lb/>
     tax of $36,064 collected; on jewellery and plated 
     <lb/>
     ware, a tax of $49,478, and on ornaments a tax of 
     <lb/>
     $2,481. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And a 25% luxury tax on top of that.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> All these excise taxes are common<lb break="no"/>ly called luxury taxes.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would Mr. Fogwill permit me 
     <lb/>
     to ask a question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> No, I won't. Well, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I am prepared to challenge any one member of 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation on the figures which I have 
     <lb/>
     here. I did suggest before the Christmas recess 
   

            <cb/>
        

     that we should have a committee going to work 
     <lb/>
     on these taxes, and it was not accepted with very 
     <lb/>
     good grace by the members at that private ses<lb break="no"/>sion. We had several answers to questions by 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention, and even before the 
     <lb/>
     Christmas recess I thought to myself that what 
     <lb/>
     information we had at that time was all the infor<lb break="no"/>mation we were going to get, and that's why I dug 
     <lb/>
     down to try and get the facts myself, so that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country would know the facts of 
     <lb/>
     the taxes they would have to pay under con<lb break="no"/>federation. I have a total of excise taxes and 
     <lb/>
     excise duties of $7,916,000, and I have got to add 
     <lb/>
     to that the excise duty on imported cigarettes, 
     <lb/>
     which is $568,000, which makes $8,484,000. 
     <lb/>
     Customs duties I have laid down $5,544,000, 
     <lb/>
     sales tax local —in Newfoundland we have quite 
     <lb/>
     a lot of local production. For instance we have 
     <lb/>
     beer and tobacco and soft drinks, and those three 
     <lb/>
     items, Mr. Chairman, amount to $4,334,000. 
     <lb/>
     Then we have canned codfish, salmon, lobster, 
     <lb/>
     rabbit, berries, pickles, jams and jellies, sweet 
     <lb/>
     biscuits, etc., all comes under sales tax, and 
     <lb/>
     household furniture, boots and shoes, soaps, 
     <lb/>
     vinegar, confectionery products, lime juice and 
     <lb/>
     fruit syrups etc.; newsprint etc. is free from sales 
     <lb/>
     tax I agree, but the newsprint used here in our 
     <lb/>
     printing offices is not free from sales tax. Head 
     <lb/>
     stones and monuments, except for war veterans, 
     <lb/>
     rope 1/2" in diameter, which is 1 1/2" in circum<lb break="no"/>ference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I did ask Mr. Smallwood a question 
     <lb/>
     when this debate first started, whether fishery salt 
     <lb/>
     was subject to sales tax. I believe now that it is, 
     <lb/>
     and if so it means over $40 million which the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen will have to pay on salt to process fish. 
     <lb/>
     I think you will find that fishery salt is subject to 
     <lb/>
     sales tax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, it's not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I have laid down $3,818,000 to post 
     <lb/>
     office revenue. Our estimates for this year in post 
     <lb/>
     office revenue in the government estimates is 
     <lb/>
     $1,700,000. I don't think it is reasonable to think 
     <lb/>
     it would be reduced more than 40%, so I have laid 
     <lb/>
     that down at $1 million. I have a total of sales tax 
     <lb/>
     and miscellaneous taxes of $20 million. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government estimate of the same is 
     <lb/>
     $9,150,000. I have a difference of $10,896, and I 
     <lb/>
     am prepared to challenge any one member of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation on these figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I did not quite get all the figures,

     Mr. Fogwill. Do you mean to say that you are 
     <lb/>
     only taking now the excise tax and excise duties, 
     <lb/>
     and the general customs duties? Is that what you 
     <lb/>
     are adding up that figure on, and if so would you 
     <lb/>
     give us the total figure of $30 million, I think it 
     <lb/>
     was? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> The total figure I have is $10 mil<lb break="no"/>lion different from the Canadian government es<lb break="no"/>timate. In other words, $10 million higher. $30 
     <lb/>
     million would go up the river. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> That would be all federal taxes 
     <lb/>
     instead of provincial? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> On that score, if these figures are 
     <lb/>
     correct — they may not be — I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     back them up — in addition, there are some 
     <lb/>
     increases in income tax which I am not competent 
     <lb/>
     to assess. Then you have provincial government 
     <lb/>
     tax which we have heard so much about these last 
     <lb/>
     few days. It is estimated at $59 million. In addi<lb break="no"/>tion, the increase in income tax will probably 
     <lb/>
     bring up taxes to $36-37 million separate and 
     <lb/>
     apart from corporation tax, which may remain 
     <lb/>
     substantial as it is now.

            </p>

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> No.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder, would Mr. Fogwill 
     <lb/>
     mind telling me his basis for the figure arrived at 
     <lb/>
     of $400,000 through the travel tax he thinks the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada would get from New<lb break="no"/>foundland? He says he applied, I believe, 15% on 
     <lb/>
     the actual value of tickets sold by the Railway last 
     <lb/>
     year; is that what I understand? And he found out 
     <lb/>
     the value of tickets sold on steamers and trains 
     <lb/>
     last year, and having got the value of that he 
     <lb/>
     merely applied 15% to that value sold by the 
     <lb/>
     Railway last year? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I applied it to your own Transpor<lb break="no"/>tation and Communications Report. I did not 
     <lb/>
     apply 15% tax to sleeping berths or parlour car 
     <lb/>
     seats. I applied it to the amount of tickets sold by 
     <lb/>
     the railway and steamers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think we have it fairly clear 
     <lb/>
     now. The Newfoundland Railway charges cer<lb break="no"/>tain rates for passenger fares on trains and boats. 
     <lb/>
     I believe on trains it is 5 - 7 cents a mile. In 
     <lb/>
     Canada, when you buy a ticket on a train or plane 
     <lb/>
     or any kind of transport, besides the amount of 
     <lb/>
     the ticket, the railway or airline collects 15% tax 
     <lb/>
     from you, which they pass back to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government. The fare and the tax, together, 
    

            <cb/>
        

     comes to 3 1/2 cents a mile. If that is true, con<lb break="no"/>federation would mean this: with our transport 
     <lb/>
     system operated by the CNR, and with the rates 
     <lb/>
     being charged, we would pay 15% travel tax 
     <lb/>
     when we buy the ticket and that tax and the fare 
     <lb/>
     would come to 3.5 cents a mile, where now we 
     <lb/>
     have to pay 5-7 cents a mile. If Mr. Fogwill would 
     <lb/>
     take the total value of tickets sold last year by the 
     <lb/>
     Railway, deduct from that what would have been 
     <lb/>
     paid at the Canadian rate, then add 15%, instead 
     <lb/>
     of $400,000, it would be half. He can cut that in 
     <lb/>
     half. On top of that, our people would be 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands of dollars in pocket by 
     <lb/>
     getting cheaper travel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think Mr. Fogwill's point was 
     <lb/>
     merely the additional monies the federal treasury 
     <lb/>
     would get, not the question of rates being 
     <lb/>
     cheaper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Why not take the value of tick<lb break="no"/>ets and apply the Canadian rate to it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> All right, reduce it 50%. I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Why was not the value of tickets 
     <lb/>
     sold in Canada put in the report? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is not an Encyclopedia Brit<lb break="no"/>tanica — Eaton's Catalogue is not in it; Simp<lb break="no"/>son's is not in it. He estimates the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government will take $20 million in taxes. One 
     <lb/>
     of the items he takes is travel tax, $400,000. I 
     <lb/>
     asked him how he arrived at that figure. Now he 
     <lb/>
     says, "Cut it in half." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I said I was willing to cut it in half. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He said he added 15% to the 
     <lb/>value of tickets sold last year by the Railway. But 
     <lb/>that value was Newfoundland value — these 
     <lb/>were rates charged by the Newfoundland Rail<lb break="no"/>way. The Canadian government is not going to 
     <lb/>take 15% travel tax from us unless we become a 
     <lb/>province, and if we become a province, one of the 
     <lb/>conditions would be that the rates charged on the 
     <lb/>railway would be the CNR rates.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What are the Canadian rates?

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> 3.5 cents a mile, including tax, 
     <lb/>
     as against 5-7 cents in Newfoundland. Mr. Fog<lb break="no"/>will says, "Cut it in half", and you would collect 
     <lb/>
     $200,000.

            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All that boils down to is you 
     <lb/>
     pay 15% on travel tickets and 15 cents for berth.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> 35 cents.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right; if Newfoundland rail<lb break="no"/>ways become CNR and you have to pay less than 
     <lb/>
     half what we are charged now, if you can get a 
     <lb/>
     berth for half what we are paying now, you will 
     <lb/>
     be glad to pay 35 cents tax. You are still saving 
     <lb/>
     dollars and dollars. The other question is, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fogwill has compiled a lot of figures with great 
     <lb/>
     industry — I know what it is to pore over docu<lb break="no"/>ments for hours and he must have worked hard. 
     <lb/>
     He has prepared a table showing to his own 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction where the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     would take from us $20 million. One of the 
     <lb/>
     figures he has to make up that $20 million is 
     <lb/>
     completely wrong. Another basis for his com<lb break="no"/>putation is, he figures the average Canadian duty 
     <lb/>
     as being 15% as applied to Newfoundland. Let us 
     <lb/>
     agree, for the sake of argument that that is correct. 
     <lb/>
     I think I know his reasoning, and there is a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount of common sense there. In Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     average is 10%. That is because of the large 
     <lb/>
     quantities of raw materials transported to go into 
     <lb/>
     their industries, which beings it down to an over<lb break="no"/>all rate of 10%. Whereas, in Newfoundland, we 
     <lb/>
     have mostly consumable goods coming in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Do you agree with the 15%? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It may be 17% or it may be 
     <lb/>
     12%. I think that is a nice job for some Customs 
     <lb/>
     man to work out; I doubt my ability to do it and 
     <lb/>
     Idoubt Mr. Fogwill's ability to do it. He has made 
     <lb/>
     a stab at it. I agree it would be more than the 
     <lb/>
     average in Canada, which is 10% and in New<lb break="no"/>foundland 25%. Under confederation it would be 
     <lb/>
     something over 10%. Mr. Fogwill insists it would 
     <lb/>
     be 15%. I daresay if Mr. Howell were assisted by 
     <lb/>
     some of his officials and were to spend several 
     <lb/>
     weeks, dropping everything else, they may be 
     <lb/>
     able to work out the figure for us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> He could do it in six or seven hours. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He says 15% the Government 
     <lb/>of Canada will collect on all goods we get in from 
     <lb/>countries other than Canada. He is on reasonably 
     <lb/>safe grounds there. What grounds has he for 
     <lb/>saying only one—third less would come into New<lb break="no"/>foundland from countries other than Canada 
     <lb/>under confederation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> That is in the Black Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. We had quite a debate on 
     <lb/>
     that, Mr. Crosbie and myself. That is what they 
     <lb/>
     have not done. I pointed out in the debate, the 
     <lb/>
     total amount the government collects is 4.28%. I 
     <lb/>
     said two millions is actually 10% of twenty mil<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
   lions. That was my estimate, not the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada's. Mr. Fogwill applied Canadian tax 
     <lb/>
     to our imports — to what they were before con<lb break="no"/>federation. He applied the Canadian rates to two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thirds. I quarrel with that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I applied the Canadian taxes to 
     <lb/>
     3-400 items and I arrived at 15%. If you want to 
     <lb/>
     refute it, get down and try and work it out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It would be more than 10% but 
     <lb/>
     far less than 25%. What has he done? The average 
     <lb/>
     duty he says is 15%. What is he collecting 15% 
     <lb/>
     from? Two possibilities — (1) To collect 15% 
     <lb/>
     from all the imports shown in the Blue Book--ex<lb break="no"/>cept from Canada. (2) In theory, he could es» 
     <lb/>
     timate how much goods, under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     would come in from Canada; then apply 15% to 
     <lb/>
     the goods coming in from countries other than 
     <lb/>
     Canada. He has made an estimate. He says we are 
     <lb/>
     collecting "X" amount of goods from the world; 
     <lb/>
     so much from Canada, and the rest from the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the world — two-thirds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> We are talking about the average 
     <lb/>
     tax. Take rum — we imported last year 123,740 
     <lb/>
     gallons. Under confederation we would have to 
     <lb/>
     pay $12 per gallon — right there you have 400%. 
     <lb/>
     What are you talking about? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I object to the little elements of 
     <lb/>
     sauce that Mr. Fogwill gets off. Let us take the 
     <lb/>
     15% figure. What is he going to apply the 15% 
     <lb/>
     to? He says 75% of what we are now importing 
     <lb/>
     is from non-Canadian countries. Why not say 
     <lb/>
     50%? How does he know it will be only one-third 
     <lb/>
     of what we import from the United States, British 
     <lb/>
     West Indies, the United Kingdom and the 
     <lb/>
     Mediterranean? Of the total of all the countries 
     <lb/>
     we are now importing from, not Canadian, how 
     <lb/>
     does he know in the future what we will be 
     <lb/>
     importing from Canada? Let us get down to brass 
     <lb/>
     tacks. I am interested in this confederation. If we 
     <lb/>
     become a province, no doubt there will be a 
     <lb/>
     change in our trade. Goods coming in from 
     <lb/>
     Canada will be duty free; and if you can get the 
     <lb/>
     goods from Canada, will not more be bought 
     <lb/>
     there rather than from other countries when you 
     <lb/>
     would have to pay duty? You will buy as much 
     <lb/>
     as you can from Canada, if Canada has it to sell. 
     <lb/>
     You cannot buy what she has not got. In some 
     <lb/>
     cases you may buy from other countries and pay 
     <lb/>
     the duty and still save money, compared to what 
     <lb/>
     you would have to pay in Canada. There will be 
     <lb/>
     cases like that. What these cases are, I do not

     know. The United States is famous for producing 
     <lb/>
     certain kinds of products; the United Kingdom is 
     <lb/>
     famous for producing other kinds of products. If 
     <lb/>
     we become part of Canada, we will be importing 
     <lb/>
     all we can from Canada. On the things we import 
     <lb/>
     from the United States and the United Kingdom, 
     <lb/>
     we will pay Canadian rates of duty. But what I 
     <lb/>
     would like Mr. Fogwill to tell me is how he 
     <lb/>
     figures customs duties on what we will import 
     <lb/>
     from countries other than Canada; how does he 
     <lb/>
     know what we will import from other countries 
     <lb/>
     under confederation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I do not know any more than you 
     <lb/>
     do. I know what we are importing now.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am trying to be fair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Page 123, Volume 1, of the Black 
     <lb/>
     Book, there is a chapter on indirect taxes. On that 
     <lb/>
     point we, in this country, import most of our 
     <lb/>
     clothing, food and machinery from abroad. Last 
     <lb/>
     year we imported from other countries, apart 
     <lb/>
     from Canada, $31 million worth of goods. I have 
     <lb/>
     assumed that our imports will be reduced from 
     <lb/>
     other countries other than Canada, and I have 
     <lb/>
     assumed that the figure of $20 million will be 
     <lb/>
     reasonable After all, we have got to sell our 
     <lb/>
     produce in the world. We have got to sell it to 
     <lb/>
     England and Spain and Italy, and to Portugal and 
     <lb/>
     the West Indies and the United States. Surely 
     <lb/>
     goodness, you can't expect Newfoundland to sell 
     <lb/>
     all her goods to other people and import all her 
     <lb/>
     needs and wants from the mainland of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     We can't expect to sell everything to other people 
     <lb/>
     and import everything from Canada. I think our 
     <lb/>
     reasonable imports from Canada would be $20 
     <lb/>
     million.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now we are getting some<lb break="no"/>where. Last year we imported $30 million worth

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> $31 million.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's as it is now. Now under 
     <lb/>
     confederation. On the $43 million worth of goods 
     <lb/>
     we imported from Canada, we paid customs duty 
     <lb/>
     on some of them, and some came in duty free. 
     <lb/>
     Well, all goods will come in duty free if we are 
     <lb/>
     into confederation.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> It won't all come in duty free, it will

     be <hi rendition="simple:italic">customs</hi> duty free.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, import duty free. What we 
     <lb/>
     usually call customs import duty, ad valorem and 
     <lb/>
     specific rates when they come into the country. 
     <lb/>
     There will be none of that on goods coming in 
     <lb/>
     from Canada. On that $43 million that we brought 
     <lb/>
     in last year, or $86 million if you like, it will be 
     <lb/>
     without paying any import duty. Mr. Fogwill says

     true, therefore as everything would come in duty 
     <lb/>
     free, we will bring in more than we have in the 
     <lb/>
     past", and he begins to figure how much more. 
     <lb/>
     He says, "Last year we brought in $30 million 
     <lb/>
     from the rest of the world, I wonder how much 
     <lb/>
     we would bring in under confederation?" He says 
     <lb/>
     he will lop off $11 million. He says we will bring 
     <lb/>
     in $20 million from the rest of the world, and $1 1 
     <lb/>
     million of this $31 million we will bring in from 
     <lb/>
     Canada. So that it will be this: $54 million we 
     <lb/>
     would bring in from Canada, and $20 million 
     <lb/>
     from the rest of the world. Now what I want to 
     <lb/>
     know is, and he has based his table on that 50% 
     <lb/>
     and the $30 million, what I want to know is this: 
     <lb/>
     is that a guess, and if so, is it based on something 
     <lb/>
     fairly concrete? Because I will confess that I am 
     <lb/>
     absolutely stumped when I come to try and figure 
     <lb/>
     exactly what the proportion of these imports 
     <lb/>
     under confederation will come in from Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and what proportion will come in from the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the world. I am not sufficient of a trader, I don't 
     <lb/>
     know the trade of this country. I can't, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, say, "Microphones, where do they come 
     <lb/>
     from — Canada or the United States?" I can't say 
     <lb/>
     whether it would pay to bring them in from the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom, or Canada or the United States. 
     <lb/>
     I don't know enough about the trading practices 
     <lb/>
     of our country. I doubt if Mr. Fogwill does. He 
     <lb/>
     says last year we brought in $31 million worth 
     <lb/>
     from the rest of the world, but under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion it will be $20 million. How does he get that? 
     <lb/>
     Otherwise we can't accept his figure. How does 
     <lb/>
     he arrive at that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I am not asking anybody to accept 
     <lb/>
     it. I have done these figures for my own personal 
     <lb/>
     information, and I don't have to prove it to you 
     <lb/>
     or anyone else; but it is on this that I will make 
     <lb/>
     up my mind in this Convention, and not on what 
     <lb/>
     anyone else is going to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, he is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     entitled to do that, but when he brings in figures 
     <lb/>
     and lays them before us in this Convention, he 
     <lb/>
     goes beyond the point of doing them for his own

     satisfaction. In my consideration of it, I am mere<lb break="no"/>ly asking the perfectly reasonable question: how 
     <lb/>
     does Mr. Fogwill figure, how does he estimate 
     <lb/>
     that if we imported $31 million from the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the world with no confederation, <hi rendition="simple:italic">under</hi> con<lb break="no"/>federation, with everything coming in duty free 
     <lb/>
     from Canada, how does he figure that we will 
     <lb/>
     bring in $20 million from the rest of the world? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think the point is well taken by 
     <lb/>Mr. Fogwill. I know that I never advance an 
     <lb/>argument in the Supreme, or any other court, until 
     <lb/>I am satisfied myself that the argument is as it 
     <lb/>should be. Having satisfied myself, then I en<lb break="no"/>deavour to try and satisfy the judge and the jury 
     <lb/>that my argument is sound. Mr. Fogwill has 
     <lb/>broken down these figures, and assigned certain 
     <lb/>reasons, and in the course of his observations, if 
     <lb/>I understood him correctly, he stated that from 
     <lb/>that $31 million imported from countries other 
     <lb/>than Canada last year, his estimate would be, 
     <lb/>having regard to the type of article, where it 
     <lb/>comes from, etc... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, he estimates that the $31 
     <lb/>
     million figure, having regard to all these cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, would be $20 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am only asking him to explain 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You may think it is unscientific, 
     <lb/>
     but he says it is to his satisfaction, and I presume 
     <lb/>
     that is as far as he wishes to go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not quite. His act of giving us 
     <lb/>
     these figures implies that he wishes us to consider 
     <lb/>
     these figures. Every man who stands up here, he 
     <lb/>
     naturally expects that his remarks are going to be 
     <lb/>
     analysed and broken down and examined. The 
     <lb/>
     net result of his speech is that he disagrees with 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada. He doubles it, and 
     <lb/>
     surely it is fair to ask Mr. Fogwill to explain the 
     <lb/>
     basis of his argument. At one point he has ex<lb break="no"/>plained it. He is taking 15% average duty coming 
     <lb/>
     in from other countries than Canada. OK, we will 
     <lb/>
     accept that. He is not far out, but we will say it is 
     <lb/>
     15%. Now the next question is, so that he can 
     <lb/>
     build up his table, what will the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment collect that from? How much other imports 
     <lb/>
     apart from Canada? So Mr. Fogwill lops off $11 
     <lb/>
     million, and still says we will import $20 million 
     <lb/>
     from countries other than Canada, and from that 
     <lb/>
     he collects 15% duty. I am asking on what basis 
     <lb/>
     does he figure that the trade of this country, under 
  

            <cb/>
         

     confederation, will change to this effect ... that 
     <lb/>
     where we imported $31 million from countries 
     <lb/>
     other than Canada, we will now import $20 mil<lb break="no"/>lion What is the basis of that estimate? If he is 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to tell us, for instances if he were to 
     <lb/>
     admit that it is a pure flat guess, his whole table 
     <lb/>
     comes tumbling doWn, On the other hand, if he 
     <lb/>
     says it is worked out realistically, the best country 
     <lb/>
     to get this and that from, and that there we could 
     <lb/>
     definitely import $20 million, then he is in the 
     <lb/>
     right. How can he do that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't have to 
     <lb/>
     prove it, but I have been here 45 years, and in fact 
     <lb/>
     I know some of the people's taste, and a lot of 
     <lb/>
     people in this country like to wear English 
     <lb/>
     clothes, and like to use Spanish goods, or <choice><sic>Portugese</sic><corr>Port<lb break="no"/>uguese</corr></choice> goods... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> And American cars.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> They like to use things that are not 
     <lb/>
     entirely manufactured in Canada. American 
     <lb/>
     cigarettes for instance — some people smoke no 
     <lb/>
     other. I won't be able to smoke at all if they get 
     <lb/>
     them from Canada I don't see the point of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood asking me the basis on which I ex<lb break="no"/>press the opinion of $20 million imports. I don't 
     <lb/>
     see the point, and I think it is only labouring this 
     <lb/>
     debate and has no purpose at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It has purpose all right — a

     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I know you have something in 
     <lb/>
    mind there, but I am not going to be caught. I 
     <lb/>don't care personally if Mr. Smallwood wipes out 
     <lb/>the $20 million, and says that everything we 
     <lb/>import will come from Canada. It will only make 
     <lb/>a difference of $2 million in the total, because the 
     <lb/>general sales tax will be applied to the great 
     <lb/>majority.

     congratulations to my friend, Mr. Fogwill, for the 
     <lb/>
     effort he has put into building these various statis<lb break="no"/>tics. With regard to Mr. Smallwood's request, 
     <lb/>
     asking him to give some concrete basis for his 
     <lb/>
     estimate, we have witnessed in this House, since 
     <lb/>
     this thing was placed on the table six weeks ago,

     that the Ottawa delegation themselves have not 
     <lb/>
     been able to explain one figure of what is con<lb break="no"/>tained in the Grey Book — <hi rendition="simple:italic">not one figure</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, in rising to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks on this confederation issue now before 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, I must confess that I do so with 
     <lb/>
     a sense of some discouragement and even disap<lb break="no"/>pointment. For when I consider the political 
     <lb/>
     situation which exists in Newfoundland today, 
     <lb/>
     the bewilderment which has been created in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of some of our people, the disgust and even 
     <lb/>
     the bitterness in others, it proves to me beyond all 
     <lb/>
     doubt that far more harm has come out of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention than good. It tells me that neither 
     <lb/>
     myself nor any other delegate can take any great 
     <lb/>
     pride in the position we have helped to create. It 
     <lb/>
     is said that sometimes good comes out of evil, but 
     <lb/>
     such has not been the case of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     When I look back over the long period that we 
     <lb/>
     have spent in fruitless discussion, wasting our 
     <lb/>
     own time and the people's money, in trying to do 
     <lb/>
     something which we should not have been asked 
     <lb/>
     to do — in allowing ourselves to be diverted into 
     <lb/>
     this political cul-de-sac — I honestly feel that we, 
     <lb/>
     all of us, owe an apology to the people who sent 
     <lb/>
     us here. For months, I think about 16 months, we 
     <lb/>
     have been engaged in what I regard as a wasteful 
     <lb/>
     task of finding out the economic condition of this 
     <lb/>
     country, when the truth is that we could have been 
     <lb/>
     told every last detail concerning our financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic condition on the very first day this 
     <lb/>
     Convention opened its doors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For months we have been squabbling over 
     <lb/>
     matters which have already been decided by 
     <lb/>
     those who control this country — seeking solu<lb break="no"/>tions to questions, the answers to which were 
     <lb/>
     already stored away in the files of some govern<lb break="no"/>ment office. But even more regrettable than the 
     <lb/>
     useless friction and bad feeling which has been 
     <lb/>
     created in this Convention, is the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which this present set-up has affected and upset 
     <lb/>
     the temperament of the people of the country. 
     <lb/>
     This mock parliament, it is obvious, has spread 
     <lb/>
     its harmful influence of political controversy to 
     <lb/>
     every town and settlement in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Through the government radio broadcast the 
     <lb/>
     people have been invited, even encouraged, and 
     <lb/>
     given ringside seats at this political burlesque. 
     <lb/>
    And, like the spectators at any street brawl, they 
     <lb/>have been infested with the spirit of animosity, 
     <lb/>argument and abuse which has been broadcast 
 

            <cb/>
 

     from this very chamber. What isthe result? It is 
     <lb/>
     that which I forecast on the first week this Con<lb break="no"/>vention assembled. Settlement is divided against 
     <lb/>
     settlement, district against district, neighbour 
     <lb/>
     against neighbour. Everyone has been infected 
     <lb/>
     with his own particular political ideas, irrespec<lb break="no"/>tive of whether they understand what they are 
     <lb/>
     talking about or not. I say, Mr. Chairman, that this 
     <lb/>
     was the preconceived idea of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government and the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government, when they jointly brought about this 
     <lb/>
     Convention idea. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, this setting of our people 
     <lb/>
     at one another's throats is one of the things for 
     <lb/>
     which those who have set up this stupid Conven<lb break="no"/>tion should never be forgiven. There is no excuse 
     <lb/>
     for it. But what makes this even worse is the fact 
     <lb/>
     that there are indications, strong indications, that 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing was deliberately planned to cre<lb break="no"/>ate political disorder in our country, to muddle 
     <lb/>
     the people's minds with a hotch-potch of ideas. 
     <lb/>
     And this, remember, in the case of a people which 
     <lb/>
     has been kept in political ignorance for 14 years. 
     <lb/>
     To expect them, the average man or woman in 
     <lb/>
     this country, to understand and separate the 
     <lb/>
     qualities attaching to such varied forms of 
     <lb/>
     government as responsible government, Com<lb break="no"/>mission government, confederation with Canada, 
     <lb/>
     union with the United States of America and what 
     <lb/>
     have you — to expect I say, our people to have a 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of these forms of government, to un<lb break="no"/>derstand the multitude of debatable issues which 
     <lb/>
     go with them, to be able to say to what extent we 
     <lb/>
     would benefit or suffer by attaching themselves 
     <lb/>
     to any one of them — I say, to set this Convention 
     <lb/>
     and the people of the country to such a task, I 
     <lb/>
     regard as being inspired either by a sense of 
     <lb/>
     stupity or with the deliberate desire of injuring us. 
     <lb/>
     To repeat what I have so often stated before: was 
     <lb/>
     there ever such a farce perpetrated on an innocent 
     <lb/>
     people? It is my personal opinion that it is all 
     <lb/>
     simply the working out of a shrewdly conceived 
     <lb/>
     plan. First Newfoundland would be divided 
     <lb/>
     politically, and then it would be destroyed politi<lb break="no"/>cally. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I remember I was one of those who went on a 
     <lb/>
     wild-goose chase with a delegation to England, 
     <lb/>
     half expecting that we would be able to do some<lb break="no"/>thing on behalf of the people. But when I look 
     <lb/>
     back now, my feeling is that if I were a wealthy 
     <lb/>
     man I would repay to the treasury of this country 
 

            <pb n="1058" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-06_Page_1058.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1058</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     the amount which our trip cost the taxpayers of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I would regard it as conscience 
     <lb/>
     money. Because the fact is that that delegation, 
     <lb/>
     in addition to being coldly received and treated 
     <lb/>
     as children, was simply wasting the people's 
     <lb/>
     money, and I am now convinced that the same 
     <lb/>
     situation applies in the case of the delegation 
     <lb/>
     which went to Ottawa this past summer. What did 
     <lb/>
     we get for that three month trip? What have we 
     <lb/>
     got, I ask, to justify hanging up this Convention 
     <lb/>
     for more than 100 days? What have we got to 
     <lb/>
     justify the spending of around $30,000 of the 
     <lb/>
     people's money? As far as I can see, all we have 
     <lb/>
     got for all this is two books with black covers and 
     <lb/>
     another one with a grey cover. And as far as they 
     <lb/>
     are concerned, it is my opinion that you could go 
     <lb/>
     into any bookstore in Ottawa and for about a 
     <lb/>
     dollar get a book containing the Canadian facts 
     <lb/>
     and figures. The Newfoundland part of the book 
     <lb/>
     could have been obtained locally for the expen<lb break="no"/>diture of another 50 cents. Yet, the three books in 
     <lb/>
     question cost us nearly $30,000. Why Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, if the collectors of rare books knew that we 
     <lb/>
     were in possession of such valuable volumes, 
     <lb/>
     they would come running to have a glance at 
     <lb/>
     them. You wouldn't have to pay that amount for 
     <lb/>
     a first edition of Shakespeare. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But these famous books we are asked to regard 
     <lb/>
     as containing the terms upon which Canada 
     <lb/>
     would be prepared to adopt us. Of course they are 
     <lb/>
     not called terms. That seems to be a dangerous 
     <lb/>
     word, and they are called proposals. The Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation, by the way, was neither entitled to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate nor to arrange terms, but it is quite 
     <lb/>
     obvious that they have done both these things. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now my first impulse, and that of many other 
     <lb/>
     delegates to this Convention when these terms 
     <lb/>
     were introduced here, was to have nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with them — to throw them out the window for 
     <lb/>
     the worthless things they were. But we did not do 
     <lb/>
     this, for the simple reason that if we did, some 
     <lb/>
     people might think that we were trying to hide the 
     <lb/>
     wonderful offering which Canada was making to 
     <lb/>
     us. Or they might think we were afraid to discuss 
     <lb/>
     them. They might think we were afraid of the 
     <lb/>
     effect they may have on our people. But sir, it was 
     <lb/>
     not for these reasons that I did not favour them. 
     <lb/>
     My attitude was then as it is now, that the contents 
     <lb/>
     of these books were worthless, for the simple 
     <lb/>
     reason that they only give us half the story, they 
     <lb/>
     are half-truths, what they tell us is what the 


            <cb/>
 

     pro-confederates want us to know. I condemn 
     <lb/>
     them because the information they should give us 
     <lb/>
     is not to be found, because the things we should 
     <lb/>
     know are kept from us, because the estimates 
     <lb/>
     they contain are the wildest kind of guesswork, 
     <lb/>
     because the figures in these estimates are false. 
     <lb/>
     Because, in a word, these three books represent 
     <lb/>
     the biggest fraud that was ever perpetrated in the 
     <lb/>
     history of our time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to weary you by dealing in 
     <lb/>
     detail with the contents of these Canadian 
     <lb/>
     proposals. For there is not an item, not a figure 
     <lb/>
     which is not open to correction, criticism and, in 
     <lb/>
     many cases, suspicion. Let me give you an ex<lb break="no"/>ample: when I received my copies of these books, 
     <lb/>
     the first thing I set out to look for was the present 
     <lb/>
     Canadian national debt. I felt that if we were to 
     <lb/>
     go into partnership with Canada, it was proper 
     <lb/>
     that we see how our prospective partner stood 
     <lb/>
     financially. I therefore went through the books, 
     <lb/>
     page by page, from cover to cover and from 
     <lb/>
     beginning to end. And did I find what I looked 
     <lb/>
     for? I did not, because it was not there. It had been 
     <lb/>
     left out. I asked myself why it had been left out. 
     <lb/>
     I became suspicious. I concluded that it must be 
     <lb/>
     in the interest of the pro-confederates to leave this 
     <lb/>
     out, or it would be there, lined up with all the 
     <lb/>
     other attractive items. Well, I finally did dig it up 
     <lb/>
     in another way. I got it by discovering that the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation had brought home other docu<lb break="no"/>ments which they had not produced, some of 
     <lb/>
     which, I understand, were labelled "secret" in big 
     <lb/>
     red letters. It would appear that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country were not supposed to know about these 
     <lb/>
     secret documents, even the Convention was not 
     <lb/>
     supposed to know about them. But murder will 
     <lb/>
     out, and so what I looked for, I found. I found 
     <lb/>
     that, according to this secret information given 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation by the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the total federal debt of Canada amounts to 
     <lb/>
     over $18 billion, or a per capita debt on every 
     <lb/>
     man, woman and child in Canada of $1,492. 
     <lb/>
     From information taken from the Report of the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General of Canada, we find that the total 
     <lb/>
     interest charge on Canada's national debt is close 
     <lb/>
     to $450 million annually, or at the rate of $35 for 
     <lb/>
     every Canadian. But just compare this with our 
     <lb/>
     own country's finances. Our national debt is 
     <lb/>
     roughly $70 million as against Canada's $18 
     <lb/>
     billion. Our per capita debt is $213 as against 
     <lb/>
     Canada's $1,492. Our total interest charge, 
  

            <pb n="1059" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-06_Page_1059.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1059</fw>
 

     together with sinking fund payments, is 
     <lb/>
     $3,375,000 or slightly over $10 per head, as 
     <lb/>
     against Canada' s $35 per head. Therefore we find 
     <lb/>
     that the difference between the national debt of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and that of Newfoundland on a per capita 
     <lb/>
     basis is approximately $1,200 in excess of ours, 
     <lb/>
     which means that if Newfoundland were to be<lb break="no"/>come a Canadian province upon the terms offered 
     <lb/>
     us, our country would have to become respon<lb break="no"/>sible for this extra debt, which would amount to, 
     <lb/>
     in all, nearly $400 million as Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     proportionate share of the entire debt of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada. It would mean that every 
     <lb/>
     man, woman and child in Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     pay in annual taxes, directly and indirectly, about 
     <lb/>
     $230 instead of $120 which is our present per 
     <lb/>
     capita tax annually. In all, the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would have to pay an additional $38- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     40 million each year in taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But that is not the worst of it. Canada, we are 
     <lb/>
     told, in the event of confederation will be gen<lb break="no"/>erous enough to take over our sterling debt, which 
     <lb/>
     amounts to approximately $64 million. On the 
     <lb/>
     face of it, this would look like Canada was giving 
     <lb/>
     us something for nothing, but in actuality it is 
     <lb/>
     nothing like that. It means that for this $64 mil<lb break="no"/>lion Canada will buy Newfoundland — our rail<lb break="no"/>ways, public buildings, wharves, lighthouses, 
     <lb/>
     telegraph system, docks, steamers and harbours, 
     <lb/>
     everything for a paltry $64 million. Why, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood himself gives the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment the valuation of our railways and its sub<lb break="no"/>sidiaries, just one item, as being $72 million. If 
     <lb/>
     ever there was a one-sided bargain, this is it. If 
     <lb/>
     ever there was a pig-in-a-bag transaction, this is 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>And speaking again of our railroad, these 
     <lb/>Canadian proposals make much of the deficits 
     <lb/>incurred by our Newfoundland Railway. But they 
     <lb/>say nothing about the losses incurred by the 
     <lb/>Canadian National Railway system. Now, 
     <lb/>anyone who knows anything about the history of 
     <lb/>the Canadian National Railway system, operated 
     <lb/>by the Canadian government, knows that they 
     <lb/>have been a continual political headache. They 
     <lb/>have lost and cost Canada not millions, but bil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars. True, the Newfoundland Railway 
     <lb/>has cost the country a deficit each year since it 
     <lb/>was taken over by the government in 1923 at a 
     <lb/>cost of $2 million. Now, when the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion were discussing this railway matter with the 


            <cb/>
   

     Canadian government, it would appear that they 
     <lb/>
     did not ask any embarrassing questions about the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railways — what they had 
     <lb/>
     cost the taxpayers of Canada, or what was the 
     <lb/>
     average annual loss sustained. Although we have 
     <lb/>
     not this information officially, it is general 
     <lb/>
     knowledge that the Canadian National Railways 
     <lb/>
     originally cost the Canadian government in the 
     <lb/>
     vicinity of $1 billion and they have cost the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian taxpayer uncounted millions since it 
     <lb/>
     came under government control. Indeed, it is a 
     <lb/>
     matter of record that the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     actually defaulted on the preferred stock out. 
     <lb/>
     standing by the Grand Trunk Railway system 
     <lb/>
     when the government took it over — which ac<lb break="no"/>tion, by the way, caused great concern and dis<lb break="no"/>pleasure to the English investors holding these 
     <lb/>
     securities amounting to millions and millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars. Incidentally, with regard to the CNR and 
     <lb/>
     CPR, it was a story of graft from beginning to 
     <lb/>
     end. The directors looted the Bank of Montreal 
     <lb/>
     in order to finance the CPR and then went to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister and asked him to keep them out 
     <lb/>
     of jail. They told him the story of what they had 
     <lb/>
     done to complete the transcontinental railway. 
     <lb/>
     The CNR was taken over in 1919 or 1920. 
     <lb/>
     Originally, a great portion of this system was 
     <lb/>
     called the Canadian Northem Railway, the con<lb break="no"/>struction of which was begun by two Toronto 
     <lb/>
     financiers, Mackenzie and Mann (Bill and Dan), 
     <lb/>
     who received vast concessions from the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government for the purpose of building 
     <lb/>
     another line across Canada. They operated this 
     <lb/>
     system for a short period and then got into finan<lb break="no"/>cial difficulties. In addition, the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Railway and the ICR got into difficulties. These 
     <lb/>
     two systems were operating in the eastern part of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Why I mention this, sir, is because we 
     <lb/>
     have been told by Mr. Smallwood that the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Railway is nothing more or less than a 
     <lb/>
     heap of scrap. Well, I wonder what Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and the Ottawa delegation thought of 
     <lb/>
     that part of the Canadian National system that 
     <lb/>
     runs from Sydney to Truro. I tell you, that from 
     <lb/>
     what little knowledge I have of railroading, that 
     <lb/>
     this particular part of the system is a disgrace to 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I will go further, its rolling stock, its 
     <lb/>
     roadbed and its general administration are most 
     <lb/>
     inefficient. I have travelled from one end of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the other — take the Prime Minister's 
     <lb/>
     own constituency, the line from Moose Jaw into 
   

            <pb n="1060" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-06_Page_1060.jpg"/>

     Prince Albert. I would like the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     to have a look at that and then come back to 
     <lb/>
     criticise our own. Then if we take the whole 
     <lb/>
     Canadian railway system, we find that the road<lb break="no"/>beds from the Atlantic to the Pacific have been 
     <lb/>
     overtaxed, particularly during the period of 
     <lb/>
     World War Two, and like our own New<lb break="no"/>foundland Railway which is now being re<lb break="no"/>equipped, the Canadian systems require 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of dollars capital expendi<lb break="no"/>tures in order to put the roadbeds and rolling 
     <lb/>
     stock in proper shape. Again, I say, it would be 
     <lb/>
     interesting to know also, what the deficits of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railways have been since 
     <lb/>
     1919, what capital expenditures have been in<lb break="no"/>curred on them, and then compare these deficits 
     <lb/>
     and capital expenditures on a per capita basis 
     <lb/>
     with similar ones on our own Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     railway system. I venture the offhand opinion 
     <lb/>
     that our own Railway, with its various sub<lb break="no"/>sidiaries, has been operated on a more economic 
     <lb/>
     basis than those of the Canadian National system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are matters on which the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
    delegation should have been informed during 
     <lb/>their three months' stay at Ottawa. But it appears 
     <lb/>to me that instead of this delegation meeting the 
     <lb/>representatives of the Canadian government on 
     <lb/>equal, if not superior grounds, that they ap<lb break="no"/>proached the Canadians in a more or less subser<lb break="no"/>vient manner. It would appear from information 
     <lb/>dragged from Mr. Smallwood during the course 
     <lb/>of this long and somewhat tiring debate, that the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland delegation to Ottawa went there 
     <lb/>not as representatives of a proud and independent 
     <lb/>people, but rather did they talk as a delegation 
     <lb/>from a bankrupt country and a pauperised people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, we did not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You did not ask them anything 
     <lb/>about their own affairs. You tell us nothing about 
     <lb/>the CNR. I want to know what is behind their 
     <lb/>money. Before we go into partnership, we have 
     <lb/>to know what is the standing of the Bank of 
     <lb/>Canada at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     With respect to this railway situation, the point 
     <lb/>
     which concerns our people is, that should we go 
     <lb/>
     into confederation we will have to shoulder our 
     <lb/>
     share of the losses incurred by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     National system. How much greater this will be 
     <lb/>
     than our own, no one can tell us, not even Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. You will not find Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     telling us anything about such drawbacks. Are 
   

            <cb/>
         

     these important particulars contained in either of 
     <lb/>
     the Black Books or the Grey Book? Not at all! 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has everything painted a rosy 
     <lb/>
     pink. He apparently ran out of all his black paint 
     <lb/>
     when he was trying to smear up our Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report and our Financial Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is mention made of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Airport which was bought by us from the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government at a cost of $1 million. We 
     <lb/>
     are, it seems, supposed to throw this into the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian jackpot as a present to Canada. Here 
     <lb/>
     again is a case of our being deprived of a possible 
     <lb/>
     source of future income. This airport is valuable, 
     <lb/>
     not alone because of its commercial possibilities, 
     <lb/>
     buteven more so because of its strategic position. 
     <lb/>
     And it is my firm conviction that, properly 
     <lb/>
     operated and properly managed, it could be a 
     <lb/>
     source of permanent national worth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, this precious Grey Book tells us that, 
     <lb/>
     under confederation, we will have to set aside one 
     <lb/>
     third of our accumulated surplus, which would 
     <lb/>
     amount to roughly $10 million, in trust with the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada — to be used only, so the 
     <lb/>
     orders run, only for expenditure on current ac<lb break="no"/>count of the Province of Newfoundland. The rest, 
     <lb/>
     we are told, we can use in the development of our 
     <lb/>
     local resources. But there is a string to this. We 
     <lb/>
     must not, and we will not be allowed to use our 
     <lb/>
     own money to subsidise our own sources of 
     <lb/>
     production if they compete with similar 
     <lb/>
     Canadian products. In other words, Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister King says we will not be allowed to assist 
     <lb/>
     with our own money our fisheries, our forests or 
     <lb/>
     such other Newfoundland industries. This we are 
     <lb/>
     told we must agree with before we are granted the 
     <lb/>
     priceless privilege of being allowed to call our<lb break="no"/>selves Canadians. Is not this, I ask you, an ex<lb break="no"/>ample of unmitigated gall? For 14 years the 
     <lb/>
     agents of the British government have been doing 
     <lb/>
     what they like with our treasury, and now the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government proposes to step in and do 
     <lb/>
     the same thing. In short, we are asked to exchange 
     <lb/>
     one form of dictatorship for another. Miss New<lb break="no"/>foundland seems to be in a position of a wealthy 
     <lb/>
     heiress these days, who is being wooed, and the 
     <lb/>
     matrimony business seems to be a matter of 
     <lb/>
     money. Let us look a little closer at John 
     <lb/>
     Canuck's proposals: let us see if he can keep Miss 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in the style to which she is accus<lb break="no"/>tomed! Let us see what we can find out about his 
     <lb/>
     financial standing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     Now, of course, it is no good in our looking in 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book or the Black Books for this infor<lb break="no"/>mation. But there are other places we can look, 
     <lb/>
     fortunately, and what we see there is not so good. 
     <lb/>
     For instance, we find that in 1931 Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     had to go off the gold standard in order to save 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian chartered banks from bankruptcy. 
     <lb/>
     We know that Newfoundland depositors in these 
     <lb/>
     banks lost some $20 million through the raising 
     <lb/>
     of the price of gold in 1933, and that the central 
     <lb/>
     bank of Canada made this large profit at the 
     <lb/>
     expense of Newfoundland depositors. We know 
     <lb/>
     that during World War Two, the same Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada had the advantage of having the use of 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of American dollars spent 
     <lb/>
     in this country, and though the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland made nothing, it is estimated that the 
     <lb/>
     Bank of Canada made upwards of $150 million 
     <lb/>
     from such sources. We know that this same 
     <lb/>
     Canada is at this very moment sending an SOS to 
     <lb/>
     Uncle Sam for financial help, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people are being forced to take the first 
     <lb/>
     steps on the hard road of austerity, that road 
     <lb/>
     which the people of Great Britain have travelled 
     <lb/>
     so long. Is it any wonder then, that in view of 
     <lb/>
     these things we fail to be able to see Canada as a 
     <lb/>
     land of milk and honey, which Mr. Smallwood so 
     <lb/>
     enthusiastically described and to which he wants 
     <lb/>
     us to come? Is it strange that we feel like asking 
     <lb/>
     such questions now, as what is the exact financial 
     <lb/>
     position of the central bank of Canada? What is 
     <lb/>
     the total of Bank of Canada notes now in circula<lb break="no"/>tion? What amount of gold is in reserve as 
     <lb/>
     security against this paper currency? In short, we 
     <lb/>
     want to know, and I say we are entitled to know, 
     <lb/>
     what is the actual financial position of this 
     <lb/>
     country that wants us to go into partnership. We 
     <lb/>
     want to know and we must know if Canada today 
     <lb/>
     is a solvent country. Is she financially sound? 
     <lb/>
     And we also want to know before we consider 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada, what would become of the 
     <lb/>
     $110 million in our local Canadian banks? What 
     <lb/>
     would happen to the Newfoundland Savings 
     <lb/>
     Bank and to the money of our Newfoundland 


            <cb/>
         

     depositors in these banks and in Canadian bonds? 
     <lb/>
     Incidentally, speaking of Canadian bonds, when 
     <lb/>
     I took up the morning paper today, the first thing 
     <lb/>
     I saw was that Canadian bonds had slumped a 
     <lb/>
     couple percent. Canada's financial position 
     <lb/>
     might not be so hot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are vital questions, Mr. Chairman. They 
     <lb/>
     should be known to this Convention, to the 
     <lb/>
     country and to the Newfoundland people. They 
     <lb/>
     represent the very basis of this whole discussion. 
     <lb/>
     But we do not know them. They are not to be 
     <lb/>
     found in either the Grey Book or the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books. I have asked these questions in this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, but as yet I have received no reply. 
     <lb/>
     Yesterday I received an evasive answer, 
     <lb/>
     deliberately evasive. Mr. Smallwood has not told 
     <lb/>
     us. No member of the Ottawa delegation has told 
     <lb/>
     us anything about them. To all appearances, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, the Ottawa delegation has absolutely 
     <lb/>
     failed in its duty, in not getting this information 
     <lb/>
     for us while in Canada. Do they think, does 
     <lb/>
     anybody think, that we Newfoundlanders are 
     <lb/>
     going to allow ourselves to be dragged into this 
     <lb/>
     sort of a transaction and buy a pig in a bag? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the present time Canada is all out trying to 
     <lb/>
     bank itself to the future on the Marshall Plan. If 
     <lb/>
     the Plan does go through, it will mean expendi<lb break="no"/>tures by the United States for $67 billion worth 
     <lb/>
     of goods a year for European countries, and some 
     <lb/>
     of these purchases will be made in Canada and 
     <lb/>
     will be paid for in American funds to Canada. If 
     <lb/>
     the Plan does not go through, none of us knows 
     <lb/>
     what might happen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, in moving the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the debate, I might say with regard to this 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting — I want to make it known, as far 
     <lb/>
     as having the debate broadcast or not, a lot of 
     <lb/>
     people want to hear themselves over the radio. I 
     <lb/>
     am not one of those. What talking I have done, I 
     <lb/>
     have not gotten it gratis from the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government over the radio. 
     <lb/>

     Mr. Fudge I give notice that I will on tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     ask the Commissioner for Natural Resources if 
     <lb/>
     during the past six months he has received an 
     <lb/>
     offer for the purchase of Labrador for a sum of 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     $150 million. If so, to table a copy of such offer 
     <lb/>
     for the information of the Convention and to 
     <lb/>
     further advise the Convention if any negotiations 
     <lb/>
     are now taking place regarding such offer.
