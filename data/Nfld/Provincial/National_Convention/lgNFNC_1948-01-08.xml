<!-- GL, 2017-08-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     look at this mysterious proposal, this personal 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood plan for the proposed administration 
     <lb/>
     of the affairs of Newfoundland as a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It is not a budget in the strict sense of the 
     <lb/>
     word. This thing does not contain any explana<lb break="no"/>tions of the various items of revenue and expen<lb break="no"/>ditures in its few and scattered pages and 
     <lb/>
     guesswork estimates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When Mr. Smallwood went in to hysterics in 
     <lb/>
     his feeble effort to tear to pieces the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, he ridiculed the Finance Committee for 
     <lb/>
     its attempt to introduce a document which 
     <lb/>
     forecast the future of Newfoundland for a period 
     <lb/>
     of three years. He now has the impudence to 
     <lb/>
     come into this chamber and introduce a con<lb break="no"/>cocted document based on practically nothing, 
     <lb/>
     but he tells us, and he tells the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, he is making his forecast, not for three 
     <lb/>
     years mind you, but for a period of eight years. 
     <lb/>
     He practically tells the world, as Mr. Reddy so 
     <lb/>
     aptly put it, that he alone, Joseph R. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     is the only individual in this Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     ours who should be permitted, and who is capable 
     <lb/>
     of producing such a forecast. He tells us, so to 
     <lb/>
     speak, that he is infallible, and that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the country, north, south, east and west, must 
     <lb/>
     recognise in the delegate from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     the only individual in the country who knows 
     <lb/>
     what will happen within any given period. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Pretty clever, what? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Smallwood has stressed the 
     <lb/>
     infallibility of Canadian experts. He now evi<lb break="no"/>dently has taken upon himself the role of 
     <lb/>
     astrologer or fortune teller for the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood himself 
     <lb/>
     has admitted that the forecasts which the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation, of which he was secretary, gave to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     revenues and expenditures of a Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     provincial government were incorrect, and in 
     <lb/>
     view of that fact he has taken upon himself to 
     <lb/>
     present a corrected estimate on his own. In the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book, Volume 2, is to be found the es<lb break="no"/>timates of expenditures of Newfoundland as a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. These amount to $14.4 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Today the estimates of expenditure 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     presented by Mr. Smallwood for the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of the province of Newfoundland come to 
     <lb/>
     approximately $15.5 million, or $1 million more 
     <lb/>
     per annum than contained in the Black Book. 
     <lb/>
     This deficiency was made up by the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation forgot to include in their ex<lb break="no"/>penditures approximately $500,000 in interest 
     <lb/>
     and sinking fund on our local debt, as well as an 
     <lb/>
     additional $100,000 for civil pensions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we peruse these estimates what do we find? 
     <lb/>
     We find that at least 1,200 civil servants will be 
     <lb/>
     laid off from work, but Mr. Smallwood tells us 
     <lb/>
     that once we become a province these people who 
     <lb/>
     have been dispensed with provincially will be 
     <lb/>
     employed in other departments of the federal 
     <lb/>
     government established in Newfoundland. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, he went so far as to say that an additional 
     <lb/>
     1,000 people would be required to administer the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the Canadian federal government. This 
     <lb/>
     to my mind was a wild and incorrect statement, 
     <lb/>
     and there is no evidence contained in any of the 
     <lb/>
     documents to show that this will occur. Rather do 
     <lb/>
     I hazard the opinion, my personal opinion, that 
     <lb/>
     many hundreds of our civil servants would be put 
     <lb/>
     on the unemployed list. In the estimates for 
     <lb/>
     Public Health and Welfare as contained in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book we are told by the OttaWa delegation 
     <lb/>
     that an amount of $4,767,000 will be sufficient. 
     <lb/>
     However, Mr. Smallwood has increased this by 
     <lb/>
     another half million dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us survey the various departments 
     <lb/>
     which would have to be financed by the province 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland should our people decide that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would unite with Canada. What 
     <lb/>
     do we find? We find that the following depart<lb break="no"/>ments would be those over which the control of 
     <lb/>
     expenditure would come within the scope of the 
     <lb/>
     province: Education, Justice, Natural Resources, 
     <lb/>
     Public Works, Public Health and Welfare, the 
     <lb/>
     Liquor Control, Home Affairs and provincial 
     <lb/>
     treasury. All these departments, according to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, would involve an annual expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of approximately $15.5 million. Let us see 
     <lb/>
     what these departments are disbursing now in 
     <lb/>
     comparison to Mr. Smallwood's estimate.... 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     noon Mr. Higgins had about the same complaint 
     <lb/>
     as I had, and I thought one dose of that stuff for 
     <lb/>
     one afternoon would be sufficient; but with your 
     <lb/>
     permission I would like to refer to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....I was personally attacked by the delegate 
     <lb/>
     from Bonavista Centre in language that was as 
     <lb/>
     dirty as could come from the slums of St. John's, 
     <lb/>
     rather than from a leader of this Convention. The 
     <lb/>
     words used to describe my person, as I under<lb break="no"/>stood them at the time, and all delegates present 
     <lb/>
     could hear, were that I was acting as a clown, a 
     <lb/>
     brainless thing with some money, and an old 
     <lb/>
     fossil, who thought that his money gave him 
     <lb/>
     some privileges. This dirty stuff was snapped 
     <lb/>
     across the floors of this assembly just before the 
     <lb/>
     committee rose for adjournment, written into the 
     <lb/>
     records of this Convention and broadcast to the 
     <lb/>
     country, before I had a chance to say a word. I 
     <lb/>
     presume, sir, it was the desire and intent of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     J.R. Smallwood to blast a man's character be<lb break="no"/>cause he dared to disagree with him. It is not my 
     <lb/>
     proposal to reply to what I believe to be scan<lb break="no"/>dalous charges, because I am not looking for 
     <lb/>
     recommendations of character from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood or anyone. Imuch prefer to leave that 
     <lb/>
     to the people of the District of Carbonear, and the 
     <lb/>
     town of Carbonear in particular, where I have 
     <lb/>
     lived all my life. They sent me here to represent 
     <lb/>
     them, and as far as I am concerned, unsolicited 
     <lb/>
     According to Mr. Smallwood, however, they sent 
     <lb/>
     here a brainless thing, unfit to represent anything; 
     <lb/>
     yet it is a fact that the majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Carbonear did this with their eyes open, and I 
     <lb/>
     submit that the people of the community and 
     <lb/>
     district of Carbonear are as intelligent as any 
     <lb/>
     other community in the island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think that's beyond question, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Penney.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> The language used in this vicious 
     <lb/>
     attack was as much applicable to them as to their 
     <lb/>
     representative. It was also an attack on the dignity 
     <lb/>
     and honour of this assembly, as well as every 
     <lb/>
     delegate present who regards decency and fair 
     <lb/>
     play as a gentleman's code of honour. It is very 
     <lb/>
     distasteful and unpleasant to me to be put in a 
     <lb/>
     position at the beginning of the New Year to have 
     <lb/>
     to refer to this at all. I would not do this, only it 
     <lb/>
     is the first time that I have been able to attend 
     <lb/>
     sessions since the attack was made, and such a 
     <lb/>
     dirty scroll should not be left inscribed on the 
     <lb/>
     records of this Convention. May I ask you then, 
  

            <cb/>
       

     Mr. Chairman, that the words complained of be 
     <lb/>
     deleted from the records, since, as I understand 
     <lb/>
     it, the rules and regulations of this assembly may 
     <lb/>
     afford protection....? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Penney, I recall generally 
     <lb/>
     the incident to which you refer, but have you any 
     <lb/>
     recollection as to the date on which the language 
     <lb/>
     was used? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I believe it was Friday afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     November 28, for the next day I was obliged to 
     <lb/>
     go home. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have no com<lb break="no"/>ment whatever to make on the remarks of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Penney, beyond saying this: that what I said to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Penney that day was I believe at that time, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe now, to be fully merited because 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Penney, possibly he was unconscious of the 
     <lb/>
     fact and unaware of it, but Mr. Penney was most 
     <lb/>
     grossly and inexcusably rude to me on that oc<lb break="no"/>casion, and what he got was tit for tat. Any time 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Penney presumes to be insulting to me, 
     <lb/>
     whether he realises it or not, he is going to get just 
     <lb/>
     as hard as he sends. Now I want to add one word. 
     <lb/>
     WhatI said was to him and not to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Carbonear. I know the people of Carbonear, and 
     <lb/>
     have been connected with them for 20-odd years, 
     <lb/>
     and for them I have the greatest of respect and 
     <lb/>
     admiration.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Mr. Chairman, the statements I 
     <lb/>
     made at that time I can prove, and I am willing to 
     <lb/>
     prove before you in a private session, or in your 
     <lb/>
     room, but I decline to say it over the microphone. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have tried to emphasise time 
     <lb/>and time again the maxim that "words are 
     <lb/>dangerous things"...it is very distressing that I 
     <lb/>should be put in the position of trying to vindicate 
     <lb/>the honesty and integrity, the intelligence and 
     <lb/>dignity of members of this chamber, to which 
     <lb/>they must surely have been entitled, otherwise 
     <lb/>they would never have been sent here by the 
     <lb/>respective constituencies. In View of the fact, Mr. 
     <lb/>Penney, that this thing occurred some consider<lb break="no"/>able time ago, I wonder if you would have any 
     <lb/>objection to my deferring a ruling until tomor<lb break="no"/>row, because I would like to get the transcript and 
     <lb/>the exact remarks before me, rather than to deal 
     <lb/>with the matter in the abstract now.... Would you 
     <lb/>have any objection to this? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> None whatever, Mr. Chairman. I 
     <lb/>
     much prefer that you would take time to think it 
     <lb/>
     over. It is on the records, sir.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, when I concluded 
     <lb/>
     my remarks yesterday afternoon I was about to 
     <lb/>
     begin the breaking down of Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     proposed budget. But this afternoon, before I go 
     <lb/>
     into it any further I must crave the indulgence of 
     <lb/>
     the House and go back a little, and I don't think 
     <lb/>
     it will be tedious repetition, but additional infor<lb break="no"/>mation. I now refer to the general sales tax which 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government says they will collect 
     <lb/>
     in amount of $4 million in Newfoundland should 
     <lb/>
     we become a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think I showed yesterday conclusively that, 
     <lb/>
     by the application of a method which they them<lb break="no"/>selves applied here the other day in answer to a 
     <lb/>
     question, instead of $4 million they would collect 
     <lb/>
     $8 million. The simple reason is that in 1946-47 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian federal government collected $328 
     <lb/>
     million in general sales tax, that is 8%, and work<lb break="no"/>ing it out on a per capita basis it means $25 a head 
     <lb/>
     for every man, woman and child in Canada; 
     <lb/>
     applying the same yardstick in Newfoundland, it 
     <lb/>
     would mean $8 million here. Now, sir, in speak<lb break="no"/>ing of these taxes, my attention has been drawn 
     <lb/>
     to a small pamphlet which probably contains all 
     <lb/>
     the information that is in the Black Book and only 
     <lb/>
     costs 25 cents, whilst our two Black Books and 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book cost nearly $30,000. If you will 
     <lb/>
     turn to page 16 of this book you will find "Quick 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Facts", and under the section "Hidden 
     <lb/>
     Taxes" you will see this:

            <p>
     In addition to personal income tax, 
     <lb/>
     Canadians pay a number of indirect or 
     <lb/>
     'hidden' taxes in their normal purchases of 
     <lb/>
     consumer goods. A pair of shoes, for ex<lb break="no"/>ample, carries 126 taxes, a gallon of gasoline, 
     <lb/>
     from the crust of the earth until it reaches the 
     <lb/>
     car, carries 205 different taxes. Medicines are 
     <lb/>
     heavily taxed — some under as many as 328 
     <lb/>
     headings — and the common milk of mag<lb break="no"/>nesia bears 178 separate taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Other ordinary goods under multiple taxa<lb break="no"/>tion are: a farmer's wire fence, 191 taxes; a 
     <lb/>
     loaf of bread, 52 taxes; a bar of soap, 154 
     <lb/>
     taxes; overalls, 148 taxes; a cotton dress, 125 
     

            <cb/>
        

     taxes; a suit of clothes, 105 taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On men's and women's clothing, the 105 
     <lb/>
     taxes are made up as follows: the rancher 
     <lb/>
     who raises the sheep (and they have a few 
     <lb/>
     ranches still in Alberta) pays ten taxes, from 
     <lb/>
     country through to gasoline impost; transpor<lb break="no"/>tation companies hand over 16 separate 
     <lb/>
     taxes; raw materials handlers, ten; textile 
     <lb/>
     mills, 15; the manufacturers of the garment, 
     <lb/>
     l2; wholesaler, 16; and the retailer another 
     <lb/>
     14. In addition, extra taxes borne by most of 
     <lb/>
     the preceding number 11, and on top of it all, 
     <lb/>
     the sales tax paid by the consumer -ie 8%.

     Now we were told that we would have no

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You did. You said it would not be

     <lb/>Now other taxes. Moving pictures — 25% on 
     <lb/>admissions. I understand there is a gentleman 
     <lb/>here in the moving picture business, or consider<lb break="no"/>ing going into it. If a man or woman or child 
     <lb/>wants to go to a movie, in addition to the 30 or 
     <lb/>40 cents they pay the man who operates that 
     <lb/>house, they have to pay a 25% amusement tax.

     now if my memory serves me right again, there 
     <lb/>
     is $87,000 on telegrams, which is not provincial 
     <lb/>
     but federal revenue, but I am asking for con<lb break="no"/>tradiction, or to be corrected if necessary, and if 
     <lb/>
     I live till tomorrow morning I will know.... Furs. 
     <lb/>
     We talked about furs yesterday. Co-incidentally, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, a party handed me this clipping 
     <lb/>
     this morning. We are talking furs now, and this 
     <lb/>
     comes from Ottawa, January 3. "Canada today 
     <lb/>
     faces an austerity area much greater than that in 
     <lb/>
     England...". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. I have barrels of 
     <lb/>
     clippings from magazines which I would like to 
     <lb/>
     quote and if Major Cashin is permitted to do so I 
     <lb/>
     will claim the same right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You need not quote it, Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> All right. Mr. Starkes asked me 
     <lb/>
     yesterday what the duty on furs was now. Restric<lb break="no"/>tions have been placed on furs coming in from 
     <lb/>
     the United States and Canada, and would it be 
     <lb/>
     information for him to know that there was $10.5 
     <lb/>
     million worth of fur imported into Canada last 
     <lb/>
     year from the United States? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> What is the tax? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> 10-15% I think. Now in addition to 
     <lb/>
     that there is a special 25% excise tax on the list. 
     <lb/>
     These taxes are paid on the wholesale prices, so 
     <lb/>
     that the consumer pays not only the 8%, but the 
     <lb/>
     profits that the wholesaler and retailer adds to the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the goods. The provinces of Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec have a provincial sales tax. Now 
     <lb/>
     there is another tax, in addition to the 8%. For 
     <lb/>
     example, in Montreal the purchase of a suit of 
     <lb/>
     clothes involves 8% federal tax, and 4% provin<lb break="no"/>cial tax, and the purchase of a fisherman's net — 
     <lb/>
     I have been in this house and heard it all over the 
     <lb/>
     country: "Lines and twines should be free", and 
     <lb/>
     they are, in this country, but in Canada it involves 
     <lb/>
     8% and 4% tax.... We were going to have no 
     <lb/>
     taxes; it would make you sick! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now another matter was brought to my atten<lb break="no"/>tion since I left this chamber yesterday afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     and I am not permitted to read the document, so 
     <lb/>
     I will give it to you to the best of my knowledge. 
     <lb/>
     When I was talking in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     balance of our surplus, I referred to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     if the government has disbursed sterling because 
     <lb/>
     of the sale of codfish this year, they would have 
     <lb/>
     $4 million or $5 million left. I had the privilege 
     <lb/>
     of a drive down to Bonavista, and I must say it is 
   

            <cb/>
    

     beautiful country, the people are wonderful, and 
     <lb/>
     along the way I find squid hanging up to dry. 
     <lb/>
     Squid are sold to the Chinese market, and these 
     <lb/>
     people were led to believe that the squid would 
     <lb/>
     be bought from them, but the Chinese buyers 
     <lb/>
     were unable to find the necessary dollars to do so. 
     <lb/>
     The point I want to make is this: if we have got 
     <lb/>
     to go into business to convert sterling to buy 
     <lb/>
     codfish, those people are just as much entitled to 
     <lb/>
     be able to sell their squid, and the government 
     <lb/>
     should convert the Chinese money into dollars. 
     <lb/>
     But they did not, and there are instances in that 
     <lb/>
     section of the country today where people are 
     <lb/>
     very badly off, and I just bring that matter up this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, not that it means much in the con<lb break="no"/>federation issue. But I think it should be drawn to 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the country and the government, 
     <lb/>
     that if they are going to slap our money right and 
     <lb/>
     left to help out one industry, they have got to do 
     <lb/>
     it for the others.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is a special War Revenue Act also in 
     <lb/>
     effect in Canada — excise duty on playing cards 
     <lb/>
     and wines. Now in this country we all play cards, 
     <lb/>
     or a lot of us do. I am an expert. I think Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman and Mr. Crosbie will acknowledge that 
     <lb/>
     I am one of the expert forty-fives players in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This morning I took up the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> and 
     <lb/>
     read the statement made by Mr. Abbott, the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Minister of Canada, and I read that 
     <lb/>
     Canada has, at the present time, an adverse 
     <lb/>
     balance of nearly $9 million, and they anticipate 
     <lb/>
     that soon it will be $1 billion. What does it mean? 
     <lb/>
     I pointed out yesterday that this $300 million, that 
     <lb/>
     they got as a part loan from the United States the 
     <lb/>
     other day, will have to be applied to that, and the 
     <lb/>
     balance of that money has to be found in gold, or 
     <lb/>
     else they have to restrict their trade with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and they are doing that and slap<lb break="no"/>ping embargoes on all kinds of goods to come in 
     <lb/>
     from the United States, and here's the country we 
     <lb/>
     are asked to go into partnership with. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, tomorrow, if we want into confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada, my friend Mr. Starkes would not be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to import a fur coat from the United 
     <lb/>
     States, because they put on legislation a few days 
     <lb/>
     ago to stop it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I finished yesterday afternoon, I think I 
     <lb/>

     Justice, Natural Resources, Public Works, Public 
     <lb/>
     Health and Welfare, the Liquor department, 
     <lb/>
     Home Affairs and the provincial treasury. All 
     <lb/>
     these departments, according to Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     would involve an annual expenditure of ap<lb break="no"/>proximately (I am speaking in round figures) 
     <lb/>
     $15.5 million. Let us see what these departments 
     <lb/>
     are disbursing now in comparison with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's estimates. Mr. Smallwood drew his 
     <lb/>
     figures from the Economic Report. He pointed 
     <lb/>
     out that our total expenditures were $25 million, 
     <lb/>
     and he took off $11 million, and made it $14 
     <lb/>
     million as a provincial expenditure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First, the Department of Education vote for the 
     <lb/>
     year 1947-48 amounts to $3,622,300. In the 
     <lb/>
     forecast by Mr. Smallwood, this amount has been 
     <lb/>
     reduced to $3,107,000 or a decrease in annual 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of over $500,000 annually... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Nonsense. Why do you not be 
     <lb/>
     fair? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Listen to who is talking about being 
     <lb/>
     fair! Mr. Chairman, if we turn to the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report which Mr. Smallwood took so much 
     <lb/>
     trouble trying to destroy, we forecast an annual 
     <lb/>
     expenditure for education of $5.75 million and 
     <lb/>
     this did not include any capital expenditures. In 
     <lb/>
     the report of the Education Committee given here 
     <lb/>
     over 12 months ago — and, mind you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood was a member of that committee — 
     <lb/>
     the importance was stressed of an increased vote 
     <lb/>
     for education, and it is generally acknowledged 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country today that we must make 
     <lb/>
     every effort to advance the education of our 
     <lb/>
     children. Yet, right here in these estimates, under 
     <lb/>
     a provincial government, Mr. Smallwood tells us 
     <lb/>
     in so many words that we should decrease that 
     <lb/>
     vote; that we should not build more schools for 
     <lb/>
     our children and our teachers are not entitled to 
     <lb/>
     any additional remuneration. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     may not have that programme actually in mind. 
     <lb/>
     He might have this one: in Canada, in practically 
     <lb/>
     every province, a school tax is imposed on the 
     <lb/>
     people. Mr. Smallwood may have in mind the 
     <lb/>
     raising of that additional $750,000 annually for 
     <lb/>
     education through additional taxation. The 
     <lb/>
     people must be taxed additionally, if we are to 
     <lb/>
     keep up the present annual educational grant. 
     <lb/>
     This would mean that in the various towns and 
     <lb/>
     villages all over Newfoundland, unless the 
     <lb/>
     people are agreeable to further taxation, they 
     <lb/>
     cannot have their present educational facilities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<cb/>
   
            <p>
     Now let us look at the Department of Public 
     <lb/>
     Health and Welfare. The estimates of expendi<lb break="no"/>ture for the present year under our present form 
     <lb/>
     of government amount to approximately $6.25 
     <lb/>
     million. In addition large amounts are being spent 
     <lb/>
     in the construction of hospitals which will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to increase our expenses for upkeep. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood lops a cool $1 million off this amount 
     <lb/>
     and makes his estimate something over $5.1 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. This Public Health and Welfare Department 
     <lb/>
     was one on which considerable controversy took 
     <lb/>
     place. I have a personal interest not alone in the 
     <lb/>
     country, but particularly in Ferryland; and in 
     <lb/>
     recent weeks, I am informed, a very serious acci<lb break="no"/>dent took place in that settlement and there was 
     <lb/>
     no nurse and no doctor there. If we go back to 40 
     <lb/>
     or 50 years ago, Trepassey had a doctor, Fer<lb break="no"/>ryland had a doctor, Bay Bulls had a doctor. Now 
     <lb/>
     we have no nurse, nothing. I say now, as a former 
     <lb/>
     representative of that district, that it has been 
     <lb/>
     done deliberately by the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we turn again to the Economic Report, we 
     <lb/>
     will find that in our proposed programme, which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood ridiculed, we forecast an annual 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $6.25 million; whilst, in addition, 
     <lb/>
     we set aside from our anticipated surplus an 
     <lb/>
     additional $1 million to be devoted to the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of old age pensions, unemployment insurance 
     <lb/>
     and additional social service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we turn to the Black Books again, we find 
     <lb/>
     that the reductions in expenditure made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood eliminate over $800,000 in the form 
     <lb/>
     of assistance to indigents, allowances to widows 
     <lb/>
     and orphans and maintenance of hospitals. Just 
     <lb/>
     imagine, Mr. Chairman, our poor unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     widows and orphans will be deprived of the mite 
     <lb/>
     which they have been receiving under our own 
     <lb/>
     government; the maintenance of hospitals will be 
     <lb/>
     reduced, whilst we know it is increasing in cost. 
     <lb/>
     Again, Mr. Smallwood may have in the back of 
     <lb/>
     his head the idea of further taxation in the form 
     <lb/>
     of hospital tax as well as municipal tax for the 
     <lb/>
     poor. He certainly knows that in many provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada the people are taxed specifically for 
     <lb/>
     the maintenance of hospitals. In the city of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, a 5% tax is collected on all meals 
     <lb/>
     served in hotels and restaurants for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of maintaining hospitals. Also the citizens are 
     <lb/>
     specifically taxed to take care of the poor. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood may not have the idea of decreasing 
    

            <pb n="1079" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-08_Page_1079.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1079</fw>
           

     the expenditure on such things as our hospitals 
     <lb/>
     and legitimate poor, but he may have in mind the 
     <lb/>
     imposition of such taxes as hospital taxes to make 
     <lb/>
     up the deficiency and thus continue the present 
     <lb/>
     social services our people are getting through our 
     <lb/>
     present form of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am making a ruling — I want 
     <lb/>
     to repeat again now, that when a member is 
     <lb/>
     occupying the floor, no other member may rise 
     <lb/>
     in any circumstances unless he is rising to a point 
     <lb/>
     of privilege or point of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> If you go into a restaurant in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal and buy a meal which costs over 35 
     <lb/>
     cents, you pay 5% hospital tax on it. Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood might have something like that in mind. If 
     <lb/>
     so, he should have injected it in his own budget 
     <lb/>
     and tell us where he is going to get that money. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to the Department of Natural 
     <lb/>
     Resources, which we find has an annual ordinary 
     <lb/>
     expenditure for the present fiscal year of 
     <lb/>
     $3,646,700. To begin with, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     wipes out any relief to be given to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, shown in these estimates as amounting 
     <lb/>
     to $10,000 annually. I wonder what the Rev. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Burry thinks of this, particularly in View of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that even though only $10,000 is voted in the 
     <lb/>
     estimates this year for such relief, we find that 
     <lb/>
     because of the stupid policy of the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government and the Dominions Office, it will 
     <lb/>
     cost the treasury in the vicinity of $50,000. The 
     <lb/>
     extra relief was brought about because the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government refused to permit the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Development Company to transfer 
     <lb/>
     from England some $200,000 for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     continuing its woods operations on the southern 
     <lb/>
     end of Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are out of order. What has 
     <lb/>
     that got to do with the terms? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In the estimates there was $10,000 
     <lb/>
     outlined for relief. That has been lopped off. I let 
     <lb/>
     no man kick me around. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We find that Mr. Smallwood eliminates nearly 
     <lb/>
     $40,000 in connection with the development of 
     <lb/>
     handicrafts; that he cuts out over $300,000 in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the development of our fisheries; 
     <lb/>
     and that other important surveys, as well as finan<lb break="no"/>cial help for rural development have been 
     <lb/>
     eliminated. He ends up by estimating that the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Natural Resources should be ad<lb break="no"/>ministered at a cost of roughly $1.75 million 
 

            <cb/>
          

     annually, whilst in our Economic Report we es<lb break="no"/>timated an expenditure of $2.5 million annually 
     <lb/>
     on ordinary account, as well as an additional $1 
     <lb/>
     million from our anticipated surplus for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of encouragement and development of 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, particularly the fresh fish industry. In 
     <lb/>
     all, under the Economic Report plan the sum of 
     <lb/>
     $3.5 million was outlined as against $1.75 mil<lb break="no"/>lion under Mr. Smallwood's proposal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is this the budget? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I wrote two budgets. I was helped 
     <lb/>
     to write the first one, and what little I know Sir 
     <lb/>
     Patrick T. McGrath taught me. If you call this a 
     <lb/>
     budget, then I say this committee should rise, 
     <lb/>
     because it is not a budget. A budget outlines 
     <lb/>
     expenditures and revenues and explains them. 
     <lb/>
     This explains nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But we must take into consideration at this 
     <lb/>
     time that if we unite with Canada, we must agree 
     <lb/>
     not to use any of our funds for the development 
     <lb/>
     of any of our products that may in any way 
     <lb/>
     compete with similar Canadian products. There<lb break="no"/>fore we see that it is proposed to save substantial 
     <lb/>
     sums of money in the administration of the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Natural Resources, but on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand we must realise that if we adopt such 
     <lb/>
     a course, our products of the sea and forests must 
     <lb/>
     be made to suffer for the sake of similar products 
     <lb/>
     in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us review the Department of Public 
     <lb/>
     Works. Under the estimates of expenditure for 
     <lb/>
     the fiscal year 1947-48, the total expenditures are 
     <lb/>
     estimated to cost, together with $900,000 
     <lb/>
     recoverable advances, approximately $8.7 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Mr. Smallwood, after apportioning 
     <lb/>
     $2,358,000 of this amount to be taken care of by 
     <lb/>
     the federal government, proceeds to lop off 
     <lb/>
     another $4 million which was voted during the 
     <lb/>
     present fiscal year under the heading of Recon<lb break="no"/>struction. He tells us that there will be no new 
     <lb/>
     roads built, although in another breath he said that 
     <lb/>
     he strongly favours the development of the tourist 
     <lb/>
     traffic, which we all must admit is dependent 
     <lb/>
     upon the expansion of our road system. Then he 
     <lb/>
     also cuts out $15 million for the expansion of 
     <lb/>
     hospitals and other buildings, many of which are 
     <lb/>
     now under construction and which must be 
     <lb/>
     finished. Whilst he leaves the staff of the 
     <lb/>
     Geological Division intact, he cuts out $45,000 
     <lb/>
     which was used for field work during the present 
     <lb/>
     year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <pb n="1080" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-08_Page_1080.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1080</fw> <fw>NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
            


<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I have shown that unless our 
     <lb/>
     accumulated surplus, consisting of some $16 mil<lb break="no"/>lion at present held in sterling funds, is convened 
     <lb/>
     to dollars, we would only have around $4 million 
     <lb/>
     left to finish these hospitals, extend our road 
     <lb/>
     system and perform other necessary capital 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. The completion of these buildings, 
     <lb/>
     like the sanatorium at Corner Brook as well as the 
     <lb/>
     finishing of the St. John's General Hospital and 
     <lb/>
     other institutions will take at least another $3 
     <lb/>
     million. Therefore we would only have $1 mil<lb break="no"/>lion available for road expansion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under the programme outlined in the Eco<lb break="no"/>nomic Report, we forecast an annual expenditure 
     <lb/>
     which includes $1.5 million for roads and general 
     <lb/>
     public works — a total of $5.5 million. That 
     <lb/>
     represented a cut in this particular department of 
     <lb/>
     around $3 million. These cuts were made up of 
     <lb/>
     the elimination of any deficit on the Gander 
     <lb/>
     operations, together with capital expenditures 
     <lb/>
     there, amounting to $1.15 million. Another $1.75 
     <lb/>
     million was taken from the vote covering the 
     <lb/>
     construction of new buildings and hospitals, as it 
     <lb/>
     was our idea to complete these institutions from 
     <lb/>
     our present accumulated surplus, or if we had 
     <lb/>
     acquired more surplus than our anticipated $5 
     <lb/>
     million, we could have continued the construc<lb break="no"/>tion and allowed the accumulated surplus to 
     <lb/>
     remain intact, to be used, as we pointed out, only 
     <lb/>
     in case of great national emergency. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, therefore, has eliminated any re<lb break="no"/>quirements for new road construction or the fur<lb break="no"/>ther expansion of buildings, which, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, should require between the two, not less 
     <lb/>
     than $2 million yearly. Therefore, I suggest that 
     <lb/>
     the vote under the heading of the Department of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works should not be less than $4 million 
     <lb/>
     under a provincial form of government. We must 
   

            <cb/>
        

     take into consideration that many roads have 
     <lb/>
     been begun and the continuation of their con<lb break="no"/>struction is essential to the general welfare of the 
     <lb/>
     country, particularly from a tourist policy 
     <lb/>
     angle.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now take the three departments of main ex<lb break="no"/>penditures under review, namely Public Health 
     <lb/>
     and Welfare, Public Works and Natural Resour<lb break="no"/>ces, which at present employ some 2,500 New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who are paid in annual salaries 
     <lb/>
     approximately $2.5 million annually. We find 
     <lb/>
     that under Mr. Smallwood's proposed provincial 
     <lb/>
     plan several hundred would be stricken from the 
     <lb/>
     payroll, whilst in addition, the hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     workers on the construction of new roads would 
     <lb/>
     be deprived of another $1 million yearly in 
     <lb/>
     wages. Also, if we take into consideration the 
     <lb/>
     curtailment of our educational system, we would 
     <lb/>
     find that salaries of our teachers, long overdue for 
     <lb/>
     adjustment, would remain unchanged. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I have made a brief survey of 
     <lb/>
     the four main departments of government which 
     <lb/>
     would be affected under union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     With your permission, the permission of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and the Ottawa delegation, I now 
     <lb/>
     propose to give what in my opinion would be the 
     <lb/>
     necessary monies to administer the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland under a provincial government. I 
     <lb/>
     give these expenditures under the various head<lb break="no"/>ings as follows:<ref target="#fn_01">*</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It will be seen from these estimates under the 
     <lb/>
     various departmental headings, that in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion the cost of administering the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as a province of Canada would be 
     <lb/>
     at least $19.25 million, possibly $20 million an<lb break="no"/>nually. This is absolutely the lowest possible on

     social services considerably, as well as our 
     <lb/>
     educational facilities. However, I feel that in 
     <lb/>
     view of the present necessity for these various 
     <lb/>
     services, that our people are not prepared to ac<lb break="no"/>cept anything lower and again I express the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the amount of $15.5 million forecast 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Smallwood is ridiculous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us see how this money can or will be 
     <lb/>
     raised in order to pay these expenditures. Let us 
     <lb/>
     review Mr. Smallwood's estimates of how this 
     <lb/>
     revenue is to be raised and see what deficit will 
     <lb/>
     accrue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To begin with, let us set aside the $3.5 million 
     <lb/>
     annual transitional grant, as it is not a continuous 
     <lb/>
     source of revenue; but in summing up the eight 
     <lb/>
     year period covered by Mr. Smallwood, we will 
     <lb/>
     take this transitional grant into account. The 
     <lb/>
     federal government of Canada agrees to pay to 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government an irreducible mini<lb break="no"/>mum of, say, $6.2 million. In addition, we would 
     <lb/>
     collect approximately $500,000 annually from 
     <lb/>
     various government departments such as Fin<lb break="no"/>ance, Natural Resources, Post and Telegraphs, 
     <lb/>
     Public Works and Public Health. Also the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Liquor Control should show a 
     <lb/>
     profit of $1 million, whilst the gasoline tax would 
     <lb/>
     give us an annual collection of $1 million. There<lb break="no"/>fore our total revenue would be under the various 
     <lb/>
    headings as follows:

            <p>
     In addition to this amount of revenue ag<lb break="no"/>gregating $9,672,000, we are to receive what is 
     <lb/>
     called a transitional grant of $3.5 million yearly 
     <lb/>
     for the first three years of union; thereafter reduc<lb break="no"/>ing itself by $350,000 annually until the grant 
     <lb/>
     disappears at the end of the 12th year of union. 
     <lb/>
     The Grey Book tells us that this particular grant 
     <lb/>
     is given in order to help us along the road until 
     <lb/>
     adjustment of our sources of provincial revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     However, it will be seen that, for the first three 
     <lb/>
     years, when we add this $3.5 million annual 
     <lb/>
     transitional grant to our revenue as outlined 
     <lb/>
     above, we will have a deficit of over $6 million 
     <lb/>
     each year; that consequently after the third year, 
     <lb/>
     this deficit will increase by $350,000 annually. 
     <lb/>
     These deficits for the first three years will be met 
     <lb/>
     in part, no doubt, by the application of the one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     third of surplus which is to be set aside in trust as 
     <lb/>
     outlined in the Grey Book, section 9, sub-section 
     <lb/>
     (1)<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> — unless extra taxation is imposed on the 
     <lb/>
     people. Let us see what this will mean in the 
     <lb/>
     period of eight years which Mr. Smallwood has 
     <lb/>
     estimated his forecast to cover. It works out as 
     <lb/>
     follows: eight years' revenues, as already 
     <lb/>
     referred to, will amount to $77,376,000. in addi<lb break="no"/>tion, we will receive an amount of $22,750,000 
     <lb/>
     in transitional grants from the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment, making a total, in all, of $100,126,000. 
     <lb/>
     Now, if we take eight years of expenditures in 
     <lb/>
     administration of the affairs of the province and 
     <lb/>
     at the rate of not less than $19.5 million, it will 
     <lb/>
     amount to $156 million or a deficit of nearly $56 
     <lb/>
     million. This deficit will be met from the $10 
     <lb/>
     million trust fund set up at the beginning of union, 
     <lb/>
     whilst additional taxation of $46 million will 
     <lb/>
     have to be imposed on our people in the form of 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation in order to pay our accounts. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p>However, Mr. Smallwood in introducing his 
     <lb/>so-called budget tried to avoid, and did avoid any 
     <lb/>reference to the introduction of any new taxation. 
     <lb/>He pointed out that the repayment of our loans to 
     <lb/>Britain would go against these deficits, but I want 
     <lb/>to point out that the repayment of these loans and 
     <lb/>the application of any other outstanding loans is 
     <lb/>not revenue, and it has not been devoted towards 
     <lb/>the repayment of loans which they borrowed, but 
     <lb/>it has been stuck in as revenue to bolster up the 
     <lb/>budget. When Mr. Hickman took Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>to task for including the repayment of the Hous<lb break="no"/>ing Corporation advances and other advances 
     <lb/>outstanding since they were not regular revenue, 
     <lb/>and should not be shown as such, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>replied by pointing out in so many words to Mr. 
     <lb/>Hickman, that whilst he was a good businessman, 
     <lb/>he did not understand public finance, and that the 
     <lb/>repayment of such loans would and should be 
     <lb/>considered as revenue. I want to tell Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood that he does not know what he is 
     <lb/>talking about — that he himself has had no ex<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_02">[1] Volume II:512. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>

     perience whatever in either public or private 
     <lb/>
     finance, and I now quote from Websterhis defini<lb break="no"/>tion of the word "Revenue". It is as follows: "The 
     <lb/>
     annual or periodical yield of taxes, excise, cus<lb break="no"/>tom duties, rents, etc., which a nation, state or 
     <lb/>
     municipality collects for public use. It also means 
     <lb/>
     income from investments". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Investments? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Investments, right — income from 
     <lb/>
     investments. They are paying 3.5% on the Hous<lb break="no"/>ing Corporation loan, and you credited that to 
     <lb/>
     your account certainly, but you don't take the $4 
     <lb/>
     million and put it in as revenue that the Housing 
     <lb/>
     Corporation owes you. If you do you are only 
     <lb/>
     cooking the budget. Now that is Webster, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman I think he should know a little more 
     <lb/>
     about it than either Mr. Smallwood, myself or Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman, with all due respect to the latter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now sir, I have shown that for a period of eight 
     <lb/>
     years, under union with Canada, and administer<lb break="no"/>ing this country as a province, that we would have 
     <lb/>
     to find in extra money $46 million after using up 
     <lb/>
     the $10 million trust account. That means that an 
     <lb/>
     annual average amount of almost $6 million will 
     <lb/>
     have to be found. How? What form of taxation 
     <lb/>
     has Mr. Smallwood in mind through which he 
     <lb/>
     could collect this extra money? However, let us 
     <lb/>
     suppose that Mr. Smallwood was in a position to 
     <lb/>
     cash in the money now held in sterling funds, 
     <lb/>
     amounting to some $16 million, and let him also 
     <lb/>
     take the $4 million cash surplus held in dollars, 
     <lb/>
     he would find that he would have to find at least 
     <lb/>
     $26 million. That would leave nothing in the 
     <lb/>
     treasury. It would leave no new hospital com<lb break="no"/>pleted at Corner Brook; there would be no new 
     <lb/>
     roads to encourage the tourist traffic. What would 
     <lb/>
     be our position? The Province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would be bankrupt. Then what happens? What 
     <lb/>
     happens to any bankrupt concern? The creditors 
     <lb/>
     step in and wind up the business. And so we find 
     <lb/>
     on referring again to the Grey Book, section 14 
     <lb/>
     under the heading of Reassessment of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's Financial Position. I will now 
     <lb/>
     read this particular section for the information of 
     <lb/>
     all concerned: 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>

     <lb/>

            <p>
     What does this section really mean? It means 
     <lb/>
     that when the Canadian government experts 
     <lb/>
     compiled these proposals and forwarded them to 
     <lb/>
     us, they knew that as a province, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would be unable to balance its provincial budget 
     <lb/>
     without the imposition of extra taxation on our 
     <lb/>
     people, and that it would be necessary for them 
     <lb/>
     to make further arrangements as to our continued 
     <lb/>
     existence as a province. The Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment knows that if and when we enter union with 
     <lb/>
     them, we can never recover our former status. 
     <lb/>
     The British government knows this also. 
     <lb/>
     Everyone knows the result of investigations by 
     <lb/>
     royal commissions in this country, and for that 
     <lb/>
     matter in Canada. New arrangements would have 
     <lb/>
     to be made so that Newfoundland would be able 
     <lb/>
     to carry on. Either the people would have to find 
     <lb/>
     additional revenue in the form of direct taxation, 
     <lb/>
     or a deal would have to be made, possibly forced 
     <lb/>
     upon us, whereby the 110,000 square miles of our 
     <lb/>
     Labrador possession would be mortgaged or 
     <lb/>
     taken over on a rental basis by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     federal government or by the French Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We all know that the future supply of high 
     <lb/>
     grade iron ore necessary for the manufacture of 
     <lb/>
     high grade steel both in Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States is to be found in Quebec and New<lb break="no"/>foundland-Labrador. We know that Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, because of her ownership of the great Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls waterpower, capable of developing not less 
     <lb/>
     than 1.25 million horsepower controls the future 
     <lb/>
     development of both the Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec mineral areas. We know that legislation 
     <lb/>
     has recently been enacted here in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     giving the Labrador Mining Company the right 
     <lb/>
     to build about 150 miles of railway through New<lb break="no"/>foundland territory on Labrador. We know that 
     <lb/>
     efforts are now being made by the promoters of 
     <lb/>
     this mining company to rush the development of 


<note xml:id="fn_03">[1] Volume II:513. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>


            <pb n="1083" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-08_Page_1083.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1083</fw>
      

     these iron areas in Labrador. We know that 
     <lb/>
     during the present session of Congress in the 
     <lb/>
     United States legislation is being brought before 
     <lb/>
     the House of Representatives to facilitate the 
     <lb/>
     passing of the St. Lawrence waterway project, 
     <lb/>
     designed for the purpose of deepening the canals 
     <lb/>
     leading from the St. Lawrence River into the 
     <lb/>
     Great Lakes, so that ships which carry 10,000- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     12,000 tons of cargo and draw 30 feet of water 
     <lb/>
     can navigate safely. We know that Canada is 
     <lb/>
     under control from the United States, that her 
     <lb/>
     finances are controlled from there, that her 
     <lb/>
     military policy is controlled from there, and that 
     <lb/>
     right at the present time the Canadian military 
     <lb/>
     authorities are making preparations for military 
     <lb/>
     emergencies. This high grade steel necessary for 
     <lb/>
     military purposes, as well as the high grade ore is 
     <lb/>
     obtainable in Labrador. If Canada could control 
     <lb/>
     the iron ore industry of North America she would 
     <lb/>
     be in a position to dictate terms to the USA, as 
     <lb/>
     America uses 100 million tons of iron ore annu<lb break="no"/>ally. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In all this planning the hand of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom is seen. We see the concessions given 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador Mining Company being changed to 
     <lb/>
     suit the purpose, and we see the financial terms 
     <lb/>
     of this Labrador agreement giving New<lb break="no"/>foundland absolutely nothing. For instance, we 
     <lb/>
     find that this great water-power in Labrador is 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the Labrador Mining Company 
     <lb/>
     for nothing — its development ultimately would 
     <lb/>
     bring Newfoundland only 15.75 cents per 
     <lb/>
     developed horsepower, whilst similar projects in 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Quebec pay to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     government not less than $1 per horsepower, and 
     <lb/>
     in this instance the Quebec Labrador pays in 
     <lb/>
     rental to the Quebec government $100,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     gratis. Let me point out that the hydro-electric 
     <lb/>
     development at Deer Lake in the Humber area 
     <lb/>
     does not pay anything in the way of royalties to 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland treasury. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     the Buchans mining company is paying the 
     <lb/>
     Bowater company at the rate of $4 per horse<lb break="no"/>power for the necessary electric energy to operate 
     <lb/>
     their industry, and that the Buchans mining com<lb break="no"/>pany pay all told to the Corner Brook company 
     <lb/>
     almost $50,000 yearly for electric power. In view 
     <lb/>
     of this experience, are we, as a people, justified 
     <lb/>
     in standing idly by and permitting the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government to sabotage our assets in this 
     <lb/>
     respect, whilst they are at the same time hand in 
  

            <cb/>
 

     glove with outsiders to take away the control of 
     <lb/>
     our country and hand it over to Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I have repeatedly stated that 
     <lb/>
     the only interest from an economic standpoint 
     <lb/>
     that Canada has in Newfoundland is to obtain by 
     <lb/>
     either fair means or foul our Labrador possession. 
     <lb/>
     Proof of this statement has been frequently given 
     <lb/>
     by both Premier Duplessis of Quebec, and former 
     <lb/>
     Premier Godbout of the same province. When I 
     <lb/>
     brought this matter up sometime ago, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood got up and abused Premier Duplessis. 
     <lb/>
     He termed him a Nazi and a Fascist, and I don't 
     <lb/>
     know what else. Well I have just come from 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and I venture the opinion that the provin<lb break="no"/>cial election in Quebec will return Duplessis by 
     <lb/>
     a larger majority than ever, and that there is a 
     <lb/>
     great probability of the reform of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party in Ottawa. Prime Minister King is about to 
     <lb/>
     retire, and his successor is very difficult to find. 
     <lb/>
     I predict that you will find in 18 months or two 
     <lb/>
     years another leader of the federal opposition in

     Ottawa, and I think Colonel George Drew will 
     <lb/>
     head the Conservative party, and together with 
     <lb/>
     Duplessis will lead the party at the next general 
     <lb/>
     election. Mr. Smallwood laughs and thinks he 
     <lb/>
     knows all about it! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the past year the Quebec government 
     <lb/>
     has issued an official map of that province show<lb break="no"/>ing the entire Labrador, including the 110,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles of Newfoundland territory, as part 
     <lb/>
     of the Province of Quebec. Quebec has been 
     <lb/>
     disappointed ever since the judgement of the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council in 1927 gave Newfoundland this 
     <lb/>
     particular territory. They are disgruntled because 
     <lb/>
     they did not avail of the opportunity given them 
     <lb/>
     in 1925 by our Monroe government. I think Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood said that no efforts were made, but I 
     <lb/>
     know that Prime Minister Monroe, Sir John Ben<lb break="no"/>nett, Mr. Justice Higgins, and Mr. Patrick Mc<lb break="no"/>Grath went to Quebec as representatives of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, to try to settle it out of court as it 
     <lb/>
     were; and if my memory serves me right — if I 
     <lb/>
     see Mr. Monroe tomorrow I will ask him — they 
     <lb/>
     offered to settle with the Quebec government that 
     <lb/>
     they could take the Labrador, and we would only 
     <lb/>
     retain our fishing rights on it, and Quebec would 
     <lb/>
     pay the Newfoundland government $15 million.

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, that's worse. Quebec thought 
     <lb/>
     they had the case sewed up. They have been sore

     country was that this original discovery of iron 
     <lb/>
     ore was made by a Newfoundlander in 1933, he 
     <lb/>
     was unable to finance it, and in 1935 a company 
     <lb/>
     called Weaver Minerals Ltd. got this concession. 
     <lb/>
     They had to spend $50,000, were given the right 
     <lb/>
     to explore 20,000 square miles, and when the 
     <lb/>
     time arrived and the mine went into production 
     <lb/>
     they would pay to the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment 10 cents a ton royalty. The gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     practically financed the entire part of that promo<lb break="no"/>tion nearly broke himself. When the Timmins 
     <lb/>
     interest in 1940 took it over they associated them<lb break="no"/>selves with the Hannah interest of Cleveland. 
     <lb/>
     They control many of the steel mills, and with 
     <lb/>
     Canadian and American backing they have spent 
     <lb/>
     many millions down there on this project. But the 
     <lb/>
     original discovery was made by a New<lb break="no"/>foundlander.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Monroe and his colleagues visited 
     <lb/>
     Quebec to try and effect a compromise in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Labrador boundary dispute, and 
     <lb/>
     offered to settle the matter with former Premier 
     <lb/>
     Taschereau for a payment to Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     somewhere in the vicinity of $15 million, and 
     <lb/>
     then the action would be called off. New<lb break="no"/>foundland was merely to retain the fishing rights. 
     <lb/>
     Taschereau and his government turned down this 
     <lb/>
     proposition, with the result that the case was 
     <lb/>
     heard before the Privy Council in 1926 and 
     <lb/>
     judgement was given in favour of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in the early part of 1927. Now that case started 
     <lb/>
     around the early part of this country, when 
     <lb/>
     Dickie, who owned a mining claim and a water<lb break="no"/>power claim on the Muskrat Falls started an 
     <lb/>
     operation, and the Canadian government stepped 
     <lb/>
     in and claimed it; Dickie went broke, and it was 
     <lb/>
     not until 1909 that efforts were made to settle this 
     <lb/>
     case.... We won 100,000 square miles, and now 
     <lb/>
     they are trying to take it from us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Did not former Premier Godbout, prior to the 
     <lb/>
     advent of the Duplessis government, write Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister King at Ottawa urging him to use his 
     <lb/>
     efforts to secure Newfoundland-Labrador for the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Quebec? Has not Duplessis on more 
     <lb/>
     than one occasion since his assumption of office, 
     <lb/>
     stated publicly that Canada and Quebec should 
     <lb/>
     be handed Labrador in return for the services 
     <lb/>
     rendered by Canada in the defence of New<lb break="no"/>foundland? Duplessis conveniently omitted to 
     <lb/>
     tell the world that Newfoundland servicemen 
     <lb/>
     were sent overseas to fight for freedom and for 
     

            <cb/>
          

     the continued existence of the British Empire, 
     <lb/>
     whilst in many cases Canadian conscripts were 
     <lb/>
     sent to Newfoundland to guard our shores! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yes, Mr. Chairman, I still hold that the only 
     <lb/>
     inducement there is in Newfoundland to make 
     <lb/>
     Canada anxious for us to join them is because of 
     <lb/>
     the wealth of Labrador. Let me quote for you an 
     <lb/>
     extract from a despatch by the British United 
     <lb/>
     Press at Ottawa on December 29, 1947, with your 
     <lb/>
     permission Mr. Chairman, because I don't think 
     <lb/>
     this is out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, all the documents emanat<lb break="no"/>ing outside the House are out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, I will have to summarise it, 
     <lb/>
     and it will probably be longer than the other way, 
     <lb/>
     and I hate to give you tedious repetition, but the 
     <lb/>
     country should know.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. J. A. Retty was employed by the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Mining Company at the outset, and took a party 
     <lb/>
     into Labrador in 1935-36, after this concession 
     <lb/>
     was granted. He did all the preliminary exploring 
     <lb/>
     of that area. He is still employed by the Hollinger 
     <lb/>
     interests, and ... at a convention of North 
     <lb/>
     American geologists.... Dr. Retty stated and the 
     <lb/>
     geologists agreed with him, that the future of the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining Company, the future of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador was to keep the steel industries, to keep 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United States going. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     some of you have read it. He went so far as to say, 
     <lb/>
     and I don't agree with him, that efforts were being 
     <lb/>
     made to bring that place into production in ten 
     <lb/>
     months. I think that should have been ten years, 
     <lb/>
     but I do know they are going to have it in produc<lb break="no"/>tion in five or six years, and I further do know ... 
     <lb/>
     that the only interest Canada has in New<lb break="no"/>foundland is the Labrador iron ore. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Furthermore we have acquired 50 million 
     <lb/>
     cords of wood in Labrador, roughly. Do you 
     <lb/>
     realise, Mr. Chairman, that in the huge Province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, which is the largest manufacturing 
     <lb/>
     province of newsprint, the timber is becoming 
     <lb/>
     depleted; that in that province and a couple of 
     <lb/>
     places in Ontario, nearly 12 million cords of 
     <lb/>
     wood are cut and manufactured annually, and 
     <lb/>
     that they have considerable forestry programmes 
     <lb/>
     on hand, no doubt to rehabilitate the forests? But 
     <lb/>
     I do know that even at the present time they are 
     <lb/>
     looking at Labrador. We have 50 million cords 
     <lb/>
     of wood down there. That should keep two mills 
     <lb/>
     of 500 tons capacity going indefinitely, and it is 
     <lb/>
     not far up the St. Lawrence River to Québec, and 


            <pb n="1085" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-08_Page_1085.jpg"/>

     when the St. Lawrence waterway goes through 
     <lb/>
     these larger ships can go right up to Fort William 
     <lb/>
     and Port Arthur, to Cleveland, which has the 
     <lb/>
     largest steel manufacturing plant, and Iowa and 
     <lb/>
     Pennsylvania. She is after the Labrador because 
     <lb/>
     she wants American dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I admit that I have strongly stressed on more 
     <lb/>
     than one occasion in this Convention, and before 
     <lb/>
     this Convention ever met, the importance and 
     <lb/>
     value to Newfoundland of the potential wealth of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador.... During my recent two weeks in 
     <lb/>
     Canada I made enquiries about this whole busi<lb break="no"/>ness, and was invariably told by mining men and 
     <lb/>
     other business interests that all Canada wants 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland for is for the iron ore of Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     as well as the 50 or 60 million cords of timber 
     <lb/>
     which is available there for the manufacture of 
     <lb/>
     pulp and paper. Canada today, even though she 
     <lb/>
     is in serious financial straits, has great national 
     <lb/>
     ambitions for the future. Canada is struggling to 
     <lb/>
     be one of the future powers of the world. Canada 
     <lb/>
     is sparsely populated. Her per capita population 
     <lb/>
     per square mile is less than that of our country. 
     <lb/>
     Canada carries a huge national debt, far too great 
     <lb/>
     for its present population of something over 12 
     <lb/>
     million people. There is only one redemption for 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion to the west of us, and that is 
     <lb/>
     increased population. In order that Canada may 
     <lb/>
     continue to expand, and equitably place the cost, 
     <lb/>
     she must increase her population to not less than 
     <lb/>
     20 million. That is necessary if Canada hopes to 
     <lb/>
     survive and develop as a nation. By the inclusion 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland in the Canadian federation, 
     <lb/>
     Canada would be in the position of controlling 
     <lb/>
     the steel production of the entire North American 
     <lb/>
     continent. This would be her salvation from an 
     <lb/>
     economic standpoint. I say that our Labrador 
     <lb/>
     possession must be guarded for the future genera<lb break="no"/>tions of Newfoundland. I realise that strong in<lb break="no"/>fluences are at work, both governmental and 
     <lb/>
     financial, to rob from Newfoundland her God- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     given rights. We, as a people, owe it to the future 
     <lb/>
     generations yet unborn, to guard those interests 
     <lb/>
     handed to us by a kindly Providence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This whole Labrador business looks to me 
     <lb/>
     something like the deal made between Russia and 
     <lb/>
     the United States when Russia sold Alaska for 
     <lb/>
     about $7 million. Like Labrador, Alaska was 
     <lb/>
     considered a barren wasteland. and the Russians 
     <lb/>
     thought they were making a good deal; but hardly 
     <lb/>
     was the ink dry on the contract when Russia had 
 

            <cb/>
         

     the bitter experience of seeing their former ter<lb break="no"/>ritory becoming a land worth billions. Will we, 
     <lb/>
     by accepting these proposals made to us by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, be guilty of a similar 
     <lb/>
     folly? Will we grasp at a few dollars and live to 
     <lb/>
     see French Canada take to herself the millions 
     <lb/>
     which should be coming to us — and which 
     <lb/>
     would have made us one of the richest little 
     <lb/>
     countries in the world? What a bitter pill that 
     <lb/>
     would be for our children to swallow — what a 
     <lb/>
     remorse to carry to our graves — to sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions for a baby bonus! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before concluding my remarks on this budget 
     <lb/>
     presented by Mr. Smallwood, let us see what 
     <lb/>
     would be our total revenues and total expendi<lb break="no"/>tures for the period of 12 years, by which time the 
     <lb/>
     transitional grant will have been eliminated and 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Newfoundland would be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to administer its own affairs and balance 
     <lb/>
     its accounts through the avenue of further taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the rate of $19.5 million annual expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, we would have spent at the end of 12 years 
     <lb/>
     the enormous sum of $234 million. During the 
     <lb/>
     same period, our revenues derived from subsidies 
     <lb/>
     and other sources based on Mr. Smallwood's own 
     <lb/>
     figures would amount to slightly over $116 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, exclusive of transitional grant. Now if we 
     <lb/>
     add the transitional grant for 12 years on the basis 
     <lb/>
     outlined in the Grey Book, we find that Canada 
     <lb/>
     would pay the province an additional $26.25 
     <lb/>
     million. These two amounts would total $142.5 
     <lb/>
     million, which would leave a deficit on ordinary 
     <lb/>
     account of over $90 million. This means that if 
     <lb/>
     we were to be in a position to balance our pro<lb break="no"/>vincial budget, we would have to impose taxes of 
     <lb/>
     an additional $7-8 million per year. However, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has compiled this budget of his 
     <lb/>
     to include all our surplus as revenue. In this case, 
     <lb/>
     we would be in the position of having to raise, in 
     <lb/>
     extra taxation, over $60 million for the 12 year 
     <lb/>
     period, or an annual increase in taxes of $5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion annually. On the other hand, if we adopted 
     <lb/>
     this sort of policy, we would not be able to extend 
     <lb/>
     our roads to foster the tourist business, we would 
     <lb/>
     have to leave our hospitals and other buildings as 
     <lb/>
     they are today, and the construction of same 
     <lb/>
     incomplete.

     the USA, it might be interesting information for 
     <lb/>
     all of us to know that even at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     Canada herself is seeking closer economic union 
     <lb/>
     with Uncle Sam. Canada finds herself, despite the 
     <lb/>
     fact that she shows a balanced budget, in the 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate position that for a period of nine 
     <lb/>
     months her adverse balance of trade with 
     <lb/>
     America comes to the huge sum of $800 million. 
     <lb/>
     She has paid some of this indebtedness by the 
     <lb/>
     borrowing of $300 million in America, the 
     <lb/>
     balance must be taken from her reserves of gold 
     <lb/>
     in the Bank of Canada, as well as the strictest 
     <lb/>
     carrying out of the present austerity programme 
     <lb/>
     — the increase of taxation on imports from the 
     <lb/>
     USA, all for the purpose of restricting the spend<lb break="no"/>ing of money in America — in which programme 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is included through the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     banks doing business in our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, after reviewing these 
     <lb/>
     Black Books and this Grey Book, and after read<lb break="no"/>ing Prime Minister King's letter to the Governor, 
     <lb/>
     that these are the best financial terms that the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada can offer to New<lb break="no"/>foundland; I want to say to Prime Minister King 
     <lb/>
     and to the Ottawa delegation that these proposals 
     <lb/>
     are fraudulent; that, in short, they do not con<lb break="no"/>stitute a fair and equitable basis for union of our 
     <lb/>
     two countries. In order to make a fair and equi<lb break="no"/>table basis for union it would be necessary that 
     <lb/>
     the debt question be properly adjusted; that 
     <lb/>
     Canada would pay to Newfoundland the dif<lb break="no"/>ference between the per capita debt of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the per capita debt of Newfoundland. In this 
     <lb/>
     instance it is approximately $1,200 per head for 
     <lb/>
     every man, woman and child in our country. This 
     <lb/>
     would mean that Canada should pay to New<lb break="no"/>foundland not less than $300 million in cash 
     <lb/>
     before we could go into national partnership on 
     <lb/>
     a fair and equitable basis. We have been told by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood that this debt matter was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed at Ottawa, but there does not appear in 
     <lb/>
     either the Black Books or the Grey Book any 
     <lb/>
     reference to the matter. As a matter of fact, the 
     <lb/>
     national debt of Canada has been deliberately 
     <lb/>
     omitted from both, which to me, at any rate, is an 
     <lb/>
     indication that the purpose of these proposals is 
     <lb/>
     to deceive our people, and through the avenue of 
     <lb/>
     the proposed baby bonus, to lure our people into 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada, the representatives of which 
     <lb/>
     have not properly given us their own present 
     <lb/>
     financial position. It should have been unneces<lb break="no"/>
            

 <cb/>
           

     sary for the delegates to this Convention to have 
     <lb/>
     to direct questions on the financial position of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to our own government for replies from 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. Answers to all these questions should 
     <lb/>
     have been available to us from the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion. But no, it has been proven beyond the 
     <lb/>
     shadow of doubt that the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     failed in its duty to this country, failed miserably. 
     <lb/>
     Instead of going to Ottawa as representatives of 
     <lb/>
     a proud and prosperous people, they went in a 
     <lb/>
     subservient manner, so to speak with their hats in 
     <lb/>
     their hands, begging from a country which at 
     <lb/>
     present has found it necessary to increase its 
     <lb/>
     taxation substantially and inaugurate an austerity 
     <lb/>
     programme, and which has been forced to appeal 
     <lb/>
     for financial assistance to the United States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us see where we would finally land 
     <lb/>
     ourselves from a financial and taxation 
     <lb/>
     standpoint, if we were to accept these so-called 
     <lb/>
     terms and become the tenth province of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada. Mr. Smallwood has told us 
     <lb/>
     that our per capita tax would not exceed $75 per 
     <lb/>
     head. Let us work this out properly. To begin 
     <lb/>
     with, the Canadian government would expect us, 
     <lb/>
     they would compel us to pull our weight in the 
     <lb/>
     entire Dominion boat. This means that the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland would be compelled to pay 
     <lb/>
     their proportionate share of the cost of ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the federal government. I repeat 
     <lb/>
     again now, that the cost for every man, woman 
     <lb/>
     and child in Newfoundland, to pay their share in 
     <lb/>
     administering the affairs of Canada, would mean 
     <lb/>
     that each individual would be taxed directly and 
     <lb/>
     indirectly to the tune of over $200 per head 
     <lb/>
     annually. It would mean that instead of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland having to find, as at present 
     <lb/>
     under our own Commission or responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, some $40 million in annual taxation 
     <lb/>
     to pay the cost of administering our country, or 
     <lb/>
     at the rate of $120 per head, that we would have 
     <lb/>
     to find as a people an additional $35 million in 
     <lb/>
     annual taxes or a total of $75 million each year 
     <lb/>
     in taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In addition to this taxation, we would have to 
     <lb/>
     find for the next ten years on average another $8 
     <lb/>
     million to pay for the administration of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed province. This money, we are told by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, will have to be collected by 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation. He has not explained what kind 
     <lb/>
     of direct taxation. As a matter of fact, he has not 
     <lb/>
     told us how these taxes are to be collected or from 
  

            <pb n="1087" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-08_Page_1087.jpg"/>

     what source of direct taxation. In some large 
     <lb/>
     cities the police department is not a provincial 
     <lb/>
     responsibility; it is municipal. In Montreal they 
     <lb/>
     have the provincial mounted police and the 
     <lb/>
     municipal police. I imagine we will have Moun<lb break="no"/>ties costing $500,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Short recess]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Before I proceed, I want to say that 
     <lb/>
     I understand His Excellency the Governor is 
     <lb/>
     leaving for England tomorrow on official busi<lb break="no"/>ness. I want to take this opportunity through the 
     <lb/>
     avenue of this Convention to say to His Excellen<lb break="no"/>cy with all respect, in view of the statements I 
     <lb/>
     made yesterday, that before he returns to resume 
     <lb/>
     office as representative of His Majesty, he might 
     <lb/>
     ask the United Kingdom government to let us 
     <lb/>
     know why Great Britain failed to carry out its 
     <lb/>
     obligation or contract with the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and fulfil its agreement between the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government and the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom in 1933.... There are others besides 
     <lb/>
     myself who think that this Convention which has 
     <lb/>
     been going on for some time — two and a half 
     <lb/>
     years ago I said this Convention was a farce and 
     <lb/>
     there are others now who have come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that I was right. This Convention has been 
     <lb/>
     a failure and some have appealed to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to have it called off. I would suggest there<lb break="no"/>fore, with all due respect, that His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     ascertain from the United Kingdom government 
     <lb/>
     during his visit why they have not carried out this 
     <lb/>
     agreement. In view of the fact that this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion has been termed a failure, the 1933 act should 
     <lb/>
     be carried out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Speaking again on taxation in Canada at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, I notice Mr. Smallwood pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that practically all the taxes are paid by Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Half. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Where do the raw materials come 
     <lb/>
     from? Ontario makes the profits on the raw 
     <lb/>
     materials from Saskatchewan and the lumber 
     <lb/>
     business of British Columbia. All that is control<lb break="no"/>led in Toronto and Montreal. These people have 
     <lb/>
     a right to pay these taxes direct and indirect 
     <lb/>
     because these people are located there. In some 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces — take the Dominion Steel 
     <lb/>
     Company, their profits are distributed in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, Toronto and New York. Even at the 
     <lb/>
     present time the DOSCO people have adopted a 
     <lb/>
     plan whereby some new American capital is to 
     <lb/>
     be brought in, and DOSCO steel will be control<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
 
led from the United States. True, Ontario pays 
     <lb/>
     and Québec pays, but the raw materials come 
     <lb/>
     from British Columbia, Alberta and Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan — oil from Alberta, wheat from 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and Saskatchewan; Ontario reaps the 
     <lb/>
     reward. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I said, with regard to direct taxation, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has not told us how these taxes are to 
     <lb/>
     be collected or from what source. No one has told 
     <lb/>
     us how they expect to collect these monies. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has not told us. Why? Because there 
     <lb/>
     shall be extra taxation to go on. Every man, 
     <lb/>
     woman and child will be taxed; an extra $8-10 
     <lb/>
     million will have to be inflicted and do not let 
     <lb/>
     anyone fool you to that effect. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     stated on occasions that the wealthy will have to 
     <lb/>
     pay this taxation. I think I heard him one time say 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Job and Mr. Crosbie and some others, 
     <lb/>
     because they are merchants, they will have to pay 
     <lb/>
     it... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I know; but I did not say it. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You are banking on the baby bonus. 
     <lb/>Next thing, you will have a baby farm. I say to 
     <lb/>you, that the rich will pay their share, but the 
     <lb/>ordinary man and woman of this country will, in 
     <lb/>the final analysis, pay all these taxes. Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood in his abortive budget has not indi<lb break="no"/>cated in what way these taxes will be collected. 
     <lb/>He has refused to do this, because he has been 
     <lb/>trying to convey to the country that there will be 
     <lb/>no such thing as additional taxation, when he 
     <lb/>knows quite well that there will be. Plenty of it. 
     <lb/>There are many kinds of direct taxation; property 
     <lb/>tax, which could be imposed on people owning 
     <lb/>property and homes. There is education tax, 
     <lb/>whereby people in the various outports would 
     <lb/>have to pay the increased cost of education for 
     <lb/>their children. There is also sales tax in force in 
     <lb/>some provinces, which means that every time one 
     <lb/>makes a purchase of goods in any store, one 
     <lb/>would have to pay a provincial sales tax. In 
     <lb/>Quebec it is 4%. If you want to buy a present, you 
     <lb/>have to pay 25% luxury tax. If you want to buy 
     <lb/>an alarm clock, you have to pay 25%. There is 
     <lb/>such a thing as a hospital tax effective in Canada, 
     <lb/>a 5% hospital tax in Quebec. There are many 
     <lb/>forms of direct taxation, many of which will have 
     <lb/>to be imposed on our people in order to collect 
     <lb/>$8-10 million a year in provincial taxes in order 
     <lb/>to balance the provincial budget. I move that the 
     <lb/>committee rise.

<!-- GL, 2017-08-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->
           <!-- <p>
     January 9, 1948 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to say that it is my 
     <lb/>
     intention to reply to the speech of Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     and, in all probability to other speeches which 
     <lb/>
     may be made on these terms. But, sir, just when 
     <lb/>
     I should do it is a matter that has given me a 
     <lb/>
     considerable amount of concern in the last day or 
     <lb/>
     two because I happen to be very anxious, very 
     <lb/>
     eager, that the Convention should finish its work 
     <lb/>
     by the end of January, so that the referendum can 
     <lb/>
     be held this spring. For that reason, if I were to 
     <lb/>
     reply to the lengthy speech of Major Cashin and 
     <lb/>
     to speeches made by other members of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, each one as it is made, it would take a 
     <lb/>
     considerable amount of time and might prolong 
     <lb/>
     the Convention beyond the end of January. I do 
     <lb/>
     not want to take that risk.... What I would like to 
     <lb/>
     feel a little confident about is this: after Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin has completed his speech, and if some 
     <lb/>
     other members speak attacking or criticising or 
     <lb/>
     analysing these terms of confederation, I would 
     <lb/>
     like to feel confident that I will have the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of replying to them. What I am trying to 
     <lb/>
     avoid is this: one man after the other attacks the 
     <lb/>
     confederation terms, criticises them, analyses 
     <lb/>
     them unfavourably; and then, before I have had 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity of replying, a closure motion 
     <lb/>
     could be put and adopted which would strangle 
     <lb/>
     any opportunity I would have of replying to these 
     <lb/>
     criticisms. I want very anxiously to avoid delay. 
     <lb/>
     I want to get out of this Convention by the end of 
     <lb/>
     January. I would like to see the referendum held 
     <lb/>
     this Spring. But I do not want to be deprived of 
     <lb/>
     the chance to reply. I can be deprived by the 
     <lb/>
     simple means of a closure motion.... I think that 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who are critical of these con<lb break="no"/>federation terms and who express their criticisms 
     <lb/>
     will be gentlemen enough not to bring in that 
     <lb/>
     closure motion and choke me off.... I put my trust 
     <lb/>
     in them. I put myself at the mercy of their sense 
     <lb/>
     of justice and fair play. After they have rapped 
     <lb/>
     the confederation terms. I will be given full, free 
     <lb/>
     and ample opportunity to reply with the freedom 
     <lb/>
     of debate in committee of the whole. With that 
     <lb/>
     understanding, I do not propose to reply to Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin when he completes his speech, but rather 
     <lb/>
     to wait until he and others have completed their 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     speeches, and then reply to the lot of them in one 
     <lb/>
     speech. With these few remarks I move the mo<lb break="no"/>tion on the order paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before I put that motion ... I 
     <lb/>
     want to say that I can give no guarantee that you 
     <lb/>
     will be permitted to speak at any given time; nor 
     <lb/>
     can I give any guarantee to any member that he 
     <lb/>
     will be able to speak to any motion at any time.... 
     <lb/>
     I have no authority to decide the number of times 
     <lb/>
     any member will speak in committee or the 
     <lb/>
     length of time he will speak on any subject before 
     <lb/>
     the Chair, as long as he confines himself strictly 
     <lb/>
     and in a proper manner to the business before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. Therefore, if a closure motion is put to me, 
     <lb/>
     I will have to accept a closure motion at any time; 
     <lb/>
     with this qualification, that I will not accept a 
     <lb/>
     closure motion without notice.... And what the 
     <lb/>
     Chair has to keep in mind, in a closure motion, is 
     <lb/>
     to make sure that the rights of the minority or the 
     <lb/>
     rights of members who have not had the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to express themselves fully, or at all, upon 
     <lb/>
     the business before the Chair shall not be 
     <lb/>
     abridged or taken away by the prompt putting and 
     <lb/>
     carrying of a closure motion. To put it simply, I 
     <lb/>
     am not prepared to guarantee to you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, or to any other member here, that he 
     <lb/>
     will be permitted to address the Chair, if you will, 
     <lb/>
     at 3 pm next Wednesday on a certain subject. 
     <lb/>
     How can I?....

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In view of the statement made by

     Mr. Smallwood, which I suppose is official in
