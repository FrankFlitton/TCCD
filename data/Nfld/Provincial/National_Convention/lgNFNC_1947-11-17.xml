     we might have in this work. That is a criticism 
     <lb/>
     that the public is entitled to make. It is a criticism 
     <lb/>
     we must take cognisance of. I feel that the feeling 
     <lb/>
     is so strong, the work ought to be speeded up and 
     <lb/>
     I think this motion should be disposed of one way 
     <lb/>
     or another at this time.

            <p>
     Mr. Job I have no objection to the sessions 
     <lb/>
     ceasing at 11 o'clock, I am convinced that the 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting will be done, but not the same day.

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I have made my point. I am 
     <lb/>
     quite sure the broadcasting people will have 
     <lb/>
     heard the point and they appreciate the profound 
     <lb/>
     interest of the people. I feel they will do every<lb break="no"/>thing in their power to see that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland hear every word said.

     Mr. Chairman Order please. Since resuming 
     <lb/>
     the Chair this afternoon, I received the following 
     <lb/>
     letter: 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>J. B. McEvoy, Esq, K.C., LL.B., 
     <lb/>Chairman, National Convention, 
     <lb/>St. John's, Nfld. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have to refer to your letter of November 
     <lb/>
     13, setting forth the resolution of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention requesting that the Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Commission arrange for the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the Convention Act, to enable 
     <lb/>
     members of the Convention, absent from ses<lb break="no"/>sions because of illness, to vote by proxy 
     <lb/>
     upon certain matters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commission of Government have 
     <lb/>
     given consideration to this request. Section 3 
     <lb/>
     of the act sets forth the duty and function of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, and empowers the making 
     <lb/>
     of recommendations to His Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government in the United Kingdom as to 
     <lb/>
     possible forms of future government to be put 
     <lb/>
     before the people at a national referendum. 
     <lb/>
     There is no provision that the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions of any particular proportion of the 
     <lb/>
     representatives should form the recommen<lb break="no"/>dations of the Convention, and the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion is not empowered to make any decisions 
     <lb/>
     as to the forms of government to be put 
     <lb/>
     before the people. It is the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     government that, as in the case of committees 
     <lb/>
     and commissions having power to inves<lb break="no"/>tigate and make recommendations, but not 
     <lb/>
     having power to make decisions, members of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention who hold a minority view on 
     <lb/>
     any question are entitled themselves, or with 
     <lb/>
     other members of the Convention, to have 
     <lb/>
     their recommendations go forward from the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. It is therefore difficult to see 
     <lb/>
     what purposes could be served by making the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     amendment requested. Members absent by 
     <lb/>
     illness can no doubt communicate with the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman or Secretary of the Convention and 
     <lb/>
     have their views on forms of government 
     <lb/>
     noted in any and all recommendations.

            <p>
     In view of the foregoing the Commission 
     <lb/>
     are unable to agree to the request of the

     Mr. Higgins I wonder Mr. Chairman if we could 
     <lb/>
     have copies of that mimeographed and dis<lb break="no"/>tributed to members? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman By all means, Mr. Higgins I 
     <lb/>should also like to inform the Convention that, 
     <lb/>arising out of your decision to continue evening 
     <lb/>sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday 
     <lb/>evenings, the Broadcasting Corporation has been 
     <lb/>contacted by Mr. Ryan. In fact he has been inter<lb break="no"/>mittently engaged in negotiations with that body 
     <lb/>since Saturday morning. The result is that all 
     <lb/>evening sessions will be recorded and the Cor<lb break="no"/>poration undertakes to rebroadcast the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings as nearly as possible, in view of point of 
     <lb/>time, after the sessions have taken place, as ex<lb break="no"/>igencies may reasonably permit and require. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should also like to inform members that all 
     <lb/>
     questions, and in one particular instance, notices 
     <lb/>
     given, have been attended to. We decided, or the 
     <lb/>
     Information Committee decided, that since the 
     <lb/>
     notice of question was given at the last session, 
     <lb/>
     and would in the ordinary course be put today, 
     <lb/>
     and since it has a bearing upon the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report which is now before the house, that the 
     <lb/>
     usual technical formalities ought to be raised, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore all questions and notices of questions 
     <lb/>
     up to this time have been submitted and attended 
     <lb/>
     to so far as we are concerned. 
     <lb/>

     Report of the Finance Committee: Economic Report<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </head>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Bradley This discussion is a debate upon 
     <lb/>
     the economic position of Newfoundland, and in 
     <lb/>
     view of its irregular and somewhat wandering 
     <lb/>
     development, it may be well to remind ourselves 
     <lb/>
     of what it is not, as well as of its true and only 
     <lb/>
     useful purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It would seem clear it is in no way concerned 
     <lb/>
     with forms of government, or with the merits or 
     <lb/>
     demerits of any such form, for these things lie in 
     <lb/>
     the future. At the referendum our people will 
     <lb/>
     have to select some form of government to apply 
     <lb/>
     to our economy. They will need all the informa<lb break="no"/>tion obtainable about that economy to reach a 
     <lb/>
     sound decision. Surely then, our first and only 
     <lb/>
     duty in this discussion is to ascertain what that 
     <lb/>
     economy is, how it has developed, whether it is 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory or not, and what degree of stability it 
     <lb/>
     possesses. Equally certain it is that efforts to 
     <lb/>
     advance the cause of any form of future govern<lb break="no"/>ment to which we may be partial, or to abuse a 
     <lb/>
     form which we dislike, are not only highly im<lb break="no"/>proper, but tend to confuse the real issue, and 
     <lb/>
     render the whole issue completely worthless. 
     <lb/>
     Anger, and a display of party spirit, exclude calm 
     <lb/>
     analysis and destroy sound judgement. Smart 
     <lb/>
     jibes and sly innuendoes shot into the debate in 
     <lb/>
     an effort to secure a hit against some form of 
     <lb/>
     government which we dislike, and made in the 
     <lb/>
     face of the Chairman's ruling, cause the whole 
     <lb/>
     discussion to degenerate into a partisan conten<lb break="no"/>tion. When such a situation arises, and we cannot 
     <lb/>
     deny it has done so on more than one occasion, 
     <lb/>
     the Convention departs entirely from the only 
     <lb/>
     purpose for which it exists, and for which the 
     <lb/>
     people sent us here. The thing becomes a gather<lb break="no"/>ing of warring political partisans, each bent upon 
     <lb/>
     advancing the cause dearest to his own heart, and 
     <lb/>
     completely incapable of forming any sound 
     <lb/>
     judgement on questions which may arise. In a 
     <lb/>
     battle between the mind and the heart, sir, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly when opposition intensifies enthusiasm, 
     <lb/>
     often to the point of antagonism, the mind never 
     <lb/>
     wins. To that impasse I fear this Convention has, 
     <lb/>
     on more than one occasion, deteriorated. We 
     <lb/>
     have lost sight of our duty to discover and inform 
     <lb/>
     the people of cold facts, and have developed into 
     <lb/>
     standard-bearers of one or other particular form 
     <lb/>
     of future government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     On every such occasion we have prostituted 
     <lb/>
     our true and only purpose and duty and, with that 
     <lb/>
     involuntary dishonesty which so often accom<lb break="no"/>panies elevated enthusiasm and political par<lb break="no"/>tisanship, we cease to be analysts of things that 
     <lb/>
     are, and become crusaders of things to be. We 
     <lb/>
     have ceased to be one body in search of truth, and 
     <lb/>
     have broken up into factions, each following a 
     <lb/>
     faith. I have no desire to go into details of such 
     <lb/>
     derelictions of clear duty just now; perhaps they 
     <lb/>
     are already too well known. That much of our 
     <lb/>
     activity, both in and out of this chamber, has not 
     <lb/>
     tended to foster public confidence, must surely 
     <lb/>
     be abundantly clear to every one of us by this 
     <lb/>
     time. On the contrary, it has brought upon us 
     <lb/>
     much justified criticism from John Citizen who 
     <lb/>
     is in search of truth, and confidence in us has 
     <lb/>
     failed. As a body there remain to us but a few 
     <lb/>
     short weeks of existence. Only in one way can we 
     <lb/>
     hope to recover that confidence, to be of any real 
     <lb/>
     value to the people who sent us here. Only by 
     <lb/>
     leaving our faiths and our factions, our shib<lb break="no"/>boleths and predilections, our prejudices and pas<lb break="no"/>sions on the outside every time we enter this 
     <lb/>
     chamber to discuss matters such as lie before us 
     <lb/>
     today, can we hope to reinstate ourselves in 
     <lb/>
     public esteem and leave a creditable record on the 
     <lb/>
     pages of history. We are not here to espouse any 
     <lb/>
     cause or to fight for any faith. We are neither St. 
     <lb/>
     Georges nor Sir Galahads; we are investigators 
     <lb/>
     of facts and seekers of truth. And it is in this spirit 
     <lb/>
     only that we should come to a consideration of 
     <lb/>
     this report which purports to portray the 
     <lb/>
     economic position of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is a remarkable document in many ways - <lb/> remarkable for its too casual analysis of figures; 
     <lb/>
     its too ready acceptance of comforting conclu<lb break="no"/>sions drawn from such figures; the avidity with 
     <lb/>
     which it translates possibilities for the future into 
     <lb/>
     probabilities and even into certainties; and the 
     <lb/>
     superlative assurance with which it predicts 
     <lb/>
     progress and plenty for Newfoundland and New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders in the days to come. In a word, sir, 
     <lb/>
     it is remarkable for the rosy hues in which it 
     <lb/>
     paints the utopia of our past, and the blithe op<lb break="no"/>timism with which it envisions a New Jerusalem 
     <lb/>
     for our future. it is full of fair figures and happy 
     <lb/>
     hopes.

<p>
     I have no intention of entering into any 
     <lb/>
     detailed discussion of intricate figures of the past, 
     <lb/>
     or of any nebulous or speculative calculations 
     <lb/>
     propounded for the near or distant future. Figures 
     <lb/>
     are useful things, but unless they are used with 
     <lb/>
     the utmost caution are likely to lead us to 
     <lb/>
     dangerous conclusions. This is particularly true 
     <lb/>
     where the figures of the past are used as a basis 
     <lb/>
     upon which to build castles for the future. It is 
     <lb/>
     equally true where such figures are but arbitrary 
     <lb/>
     estimates of a future and presently non-existent 
     <lb/>
     economy. In the latter case they are the child of 
     <lb/>
     a fervent and often fatuous hope, a stark un<lb break="no"/>reality, a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To the ordinary man masses of figures are 
     <lb/>
     always confusing and seldom illuminating. He 
     <lb/>
     gets lost in the multiplicity of detail. His vision is 
     <lb/>
     befogged, his perspective is distorted and the 
     <lb/>
     proportions of that which he seeks to evaluate are 
     <lb/>
     lost. He bogs down in frustration and disgust. If 
     <lb/>
     he is to obtain a reasonably true picture of our 
     <lb/>
     past he must sweep away most of these confusing 
     <lb/>
     details, whose tendency is to mislead, and view 
     <lb/>
     the situation not through the tangled web of 
     <lb/>
     meticulous detail, but from the vantage point of 
     <lb/>
     distance, which will enable him to see the whole 
     <lb/>
     picture in broad outline, with its highlights and 
     <lb/>
     its shadows, its peaks and its valleys. To put the 
     <lb/>
     matter in another way, he must determine if our 
     <lb/>
     past as a people was an experience we would care 
     <lb/>
     to repeat, and whether it holds probabilities, not 
     <lb/>
     mere possibilities, for the future of an adequate, 
     <lb/>
     countrywide standard of living, having regard to 
     <lb/>
     the age in which we live. Was that past, on the 
     <lb/>
     whole, a period of prosperity or adversity, of 
     <lb/>
     comfort or poverty, of happiness or grim and drab 
     <lb/>
     monotony for the people? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To put it shortly, he must determine the way 
     <lb/>
     of life which the country's economy has thus far 
     <lb/>
     provided for the people who have kept that 
     <lb/>
     economy going, and what its prospects are for the 
     <lb/>
     future, having regard to the present and in the 
     <lb/>
     light of human experience. Some days ago my 
     <lb/>
     good friend Mr. Keough gave the clearest exposi<lb break="no"/>tion of the meaning of a sound economy that I 
     <lb/>
     have heard since this Convention opened over a 
     <lb/>
     year ago. He showed beyond all question that 
     <lb/>
     balanced public accounts — even surpluses — <lb/> are neither the cause nor the proof of a sound 
     <lb/>
     economy. They are not necessarily even the 
     <lb/>
     result of such an economy, for the public ac<lb break="no"/><cb/>counts may show a surplus while the people 
     <lb/>
     starve. In fact, such balanced accounts or 
     <lb/>
     surpluses are nothing but proof that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has taken enough of the people's earnings 
     <lb/>
     to pay the bills which it has incurred, while in 
     <lb/>
     truth its operations may have had a disastrous 
     <lb/>
     effect upon the very national economy upon 
     <lb/>
     which it lives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I mention any of the figures which this 
     <lb/>
     report contains, perhaps in the interests of peace 
     <lb/>
     it may be well for me to reassure any who may 
     <lb/>
     incorrectly interpret my criticism as charges of 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty. Let me say at once that I have no 
     <lb/>
     intention whatever of charging anyone of falsify<lb break="no"/>ing figures or of a deliberate attempt to deceive. 
     <lb/>
     For my purposes it is completely unnecessary, 
     <lb/>
     and I am quite willing to accept the position that 
     <lb/>
     in their calculations and their predictions they 
     <lb/>
     believed the former were correct, and the latter 
     <lb/>
     were rational deductions. Moreover, if I am to 
     <lb/>
     assume that every calculation and every predic<lb break="no"/>tion which this report makes has been placed 
     <lb/>
     there with dishonest intent, it surely follows that 
     <lb/>
     I credit its framers with infallibility; for if all their 
     <lb/>
     inaccuracies are dishonest and known to them 
     <lb/>
     when they make them, it necessarily follows that 
     <lb/>
     they themselves are never in error. That is a 
     <lb/>
     supernatural faculty with which I must decline to 
     <lb/>
     credit them, or even this whole Convention when 
     <lb/>
     speaking as a whole, if we can ever reach that 
     <lb/>
     apparently far-distant goal where this body will 
     <lb/>
     speak as a unit. I prefer to assume that in their 
     <lb/>
     figures and mathematical calculations they may 
     <lb/>
     be in honest error, like ordinary mortals, and that 
     <lb/>
     in their predictions they have allowed their op<lb break="no"/>timism and enthusiasm to outstrip their philo<lb break="no"/>sophy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us then have no further charges of imput<lb break="no"/>ing dishonesty, and in the name of commonsense 
     <lb/>
     let us have no more of this childish, this petulant 
     <lb/>
     flaring up every time our figures are questioned; 
     <lb/>
     no more of this display of peevishness and bad 
     <lb/>
     temper when our conclusions are disagreed with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have said that it is not my intention to enter 
     <lb/>
     into any detailed discussion of intricate figures of 
     <lb/>
     the past. But there is at least one portion of this 
     <lb/>
     report's calculations to which I must make some 
     <lb/>
     reference. It seems to assume that a solvent public 
     <lb/>
     treasury is unmistakable proof of a solvent people 
     <lb/>
     — a people solvent in the sense that they are able 
     <lb/>
     to pay all the bills which they must incur to give 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="741"

     them a reasonably adequate living. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, it is proof of a sound economy. And so the 
     <lb/>
     report proceeds to lay its proof of governmental 
     <lb/>
     solvency before us. The relation of that solvency 
     <lb/>
     (assuming that it exists) I shall examine later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The whole point of this so-called Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report — if it has a point — is set forth in 
     <lb/>
     unmistakable terms on page 43. It was to make 
     <lb/>
     this one point that the report was compiled, I will 
     <lb/>
     quote the words of the report: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Now, making every allowance for the 
     <lb/>
     momentum of war expenditures carrying on 
     <lb/>
     after the close of hostilities, and allowing for 
     <lb/>
     the gradual recession of this boom period, it 
     <lb/>
     is yet an obvious fact that our present revenues 
     <lb/>
     cannot be something dependent on war 
     <lb/>
     boom. There must be some other cause, and 
     <lb/>
     on examining the matter further we found 
     <lb/>
     that a great portion of our present revenue is 
     <lb/>
     coming to us because of the growth of our 
     <lb/>
     main industries. Now, these industries are 
     <lb/>
     wholly peace industries and are not depend<lb break="no"/>ent for their prosperity on war conditions. It 
     <lb/>
     is clear therefore that we can properly regard 
     <lb/>
     our present revenues as being anything but a 
     <lb/>
     result of war boom. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Their whole point is admirably stated in that 
     <lb/>
     final sentence: "It is clear therefore that we can 
     <lb/>
     properly regard our present revenues as being 
     <lb/>
     anything but a result of war boom." That is what 
     <lb/>
     they ask this Convention and the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country to believe. There is nothing exceptional, 
     <lb/>
     nothing abnormal about these swollen revenues, 
     <lb/>
     they tell us. They are normal and ordinary, war 
     <lb/>
     or no war. And that being the case, as they are 
     <lb/>
     based upon a solid foundation of the normal 
     <lb/>
     growth of our basic industries, they may confi<lb break="no"/>dently be expected to continue. The future is 
     <lb/>
     assured. Such is the burden of this report's song, 
     <lb/>
     and we are told that it is unpatriotic to question 
     <lb/>
     their conclusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now it is worth spending a few minutes of our 
     <lb/>
     time in an examination of this contention, and the 
     <lb/>
     first fact worth noting is set forth on the first and 
     <lb/>
     second pages. Then the writer of the report gives 
     <lb/>
     us what we are expected to regard as a sort of 
     <lb/>
     average balance sheet of this country's financial 
     <lb/>
     position. This so-called balance sheet is based 
     <lb/>
     upon a set of figures for a span of 50 years of our 
     <lb/>
     country's history which began in 1897 and ended 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     just a month ago in 1947. We are told that in those 
     <lb/>
     50 years our government spent a total of $500 
     <lb/>
     million and had a total revenue of $496 million. 
     <lb/>
     This left them short $4 million. But paltry as that 
     <lb/>
     deficit amounts to, it is even less than that; for a 
     <lb/>
     sum of $20 million must be taken off that total 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $500 million. This is $20 million 
     <lb/>
     of capital expenditure made by the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government since 1934, and deducting this from 
     <lb/>
     the half-billion dollar expenditure, it reduces the 
     <lb/>
     amount to $480 million for the 50 years. And that 
     <lb/>
     means, for the 50 years, a total surplus of $15 
     <lb/>
     million, instead of a deficit of $4 million. And 
     <lb/>
     $15 million works out at an average surplus of 
     <lb/>
     $300,000 a year for the 50 year period. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such is the encouraging picture painted by the 
     <lb/>
     report. This favourable and solvent position, we 
     <lb/>
     are told, is really a normal growth — that the 
     <lb/>
     swollen revenues of the government are not at all 
     <lb/>
     due to the war, that they are the result of anything 
     <lb/>
     but the war. The war, they tell us, has little or 
     <lb/>
     nothing to do with it, and we can therefore leave 
     <lb/>
     the war out of it altogether. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, that is exactly what I propose to do - <lb/> to leave the war out of the picture. I'm going to 
     <lb/>
     accept the figures and follow the ideas and 
     <lb/>
     methods used in the report itself, and draw up a 
     <lb/>
     balance sheet for 50 years of our government's 
     <lb/>
     life, exactly as the report does it. But so that I can 
     <lb/>
     leave the war out of it altogether, I'm going to 
     <lb/>
     take the report's 50 years and push them back 
     <lb/>
     exactly eight years. That is to say, I'm going to 
     <lb/>
     take eight years off the latter end of the report's 
     <lb/>
     50 years, and put on eight years at the beginning 
     <lb/>
     of the period. In short, I'm going to look at the 50 
     <lb/>
     years which began not in 1897, but in 1890; and 
     <lb/>
     ending, not in 1947, but in 1939. Thus we avoid 
     <lb/>
     the war altogether; and thus we can get a clear 
     <lb/>
     picture of our govemment's balance sheet as it 
     <lb/>
     existed without being influenced by the war at all. 
     <lb/>
     Thus we shall see whether our present condition 
     <lb/>
     has been affected by the war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, in those 50 years which ended in 1939, just 
     <lb/>
     before this war began, the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland spent a total of $306,800,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Miller Point of order, Mr. Chairman. Is it 
     <lb/>
     not a part of our duty to determine the extent to 
     <lb/>
     which the war had an effect on our economy? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman That is exactly as I understand 
     <lb/>it. What is your point of order? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

 <p>
     Mr. Miller We are getting away from the matter 
     <lb/>
     in hand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I think he is coming indirectly 
     <lb/>
     to that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bradley I am going to make a comparison 
     <lb/>
     of the economy of the country without a war 
     <lb/>
     period and with a war period. I repeat that for the 
     <lb/>
     50 years which ended in 1939 the government 
     <lb/>
     spent a total of $306,800,000. There are a few odd 
     <lb/>
     thousand dollars which I have not included, be<lb break="no"/>cause I did not see much necessity of it, and in 
     <lb/>
     that respect I have followed the methods of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee itself. That then was their revenue — 
     <lb/>
     $306,800,000. But capital expenditures made by 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government in the years from 
     <lb/>
     1934 to 1947 is added, and so then in the years of 
     <lb/>
     Commission which come within my period, 
     <lb/>
     namely the capital expenditures from 1934 to 
     <lb/>
     1939.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I admit quite frankly that I have not been 
     <lb/>
     able to estimate the amount of such capital ex<lb break="no"/>penditure accurately from the report. I would 
     <lb/>
     judge it to be around $4-5 million, but I will be 
     <lb/>
     generous in the matter. In my period, Commis<lb break="no"/>sion was in office about five years only. In the 
     <lb/>
     period taken by the report, they were in office 13 
     <lb/>
     years. It is obviously fair to say that their capital 
     <lb/>
     expenditures were much greater in the last eight 
     <lb/>
     years of their term when they had vastly greater 
     <lb/>
     revenues and heavy surpluses. Therefore, if the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure on capital account in the whole 13 
     <lb/>
     years of Commission was $20 million, the first 
     <lb/>
     five years, which was all that my period of 50 
     <lb/>
     years include, would not account for more than 
     <lb/>
     $7 million. Deduct this $7 million from the total 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $306 million and we get a net 
     <lb/>
     expenditure during that period and up to the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of the war of $299.8, say $300 million 
     <lb/>
     in round figures. In that same period they had a 
     <lb/>
     total revenue of roundly $280 million. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     in the 50 years ending in 1939 they fell $20 
     <lb/>
     million short of meeting expenses on ordinary 
     <lb/>
     account. That is to say, they ended the half cen<lb break="no"/>tury with not a surplus but a deficit of $20 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then came the war, six years of it, and two 
     <lb/>
     years not of peace, but of armistice and armed 
     <lb/>
     watchfulness. Prices soared to unprecedented 
     <lb/>
     heights and wages followed painfully in their 
     <lb/>
     wake. And we find that a miracle has happened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     By 1947 that deficit of $20 million on ordinary 
     <lb/>
     account in 1939, has become a surplus of $15 
     <lb/>
     million in 1947. Our position from a governmen<lb break="no"/>tal standpoint was improved in eight short years 
     <lb/>
     by roughly $35 million. What was the cause of 
     <lb/>
     this providential change in our government's 
     <lb/>
     position? The war? Not at all, says the committee. 
     <lb/>
     Making every allowance, they say, 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>for the momentum (whatever that may mean) 
     <lb/>of war expenditures carrying on after the

     <lb/>yet an obvious fact, that our present revenues 
     <lb/>cannot be something dependent on war 
     <lb/>boom. There must be some other cause, and 
     <lb/>on examining the matter further we found 
     <lb/>that a great portion of our present revenue is

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     It would be relevant, sir, to have set out some 
     <lb/>
     of the details of that growth. But we haven't got 
     <lb/>
     it. And is the present price of some $14 per 
     <lb/>
     quintal for shore fish to have none of the credit 
     <lb/>
     when we recollect that in the immediate pre-war 
     <lb/>
     years it fetched about $5 only? And so this 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report asks us to believe, and what is 
     <lb/>
     more important asks this country to believe, that 
     <lb/>
     present revenues are due to anything but war. 
     <lb/>
     Such, sir, is the optimistic assumption of the 
     <lb/>
     committee. That assumption will be received by 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland, I fear, with amused 
     <lb/>
     incredulity. They know the difference between 
     <lb/>
     $14 and $5. They are watching, watching with 
     <lb/>
     anxious hearts, for the first indication of a break 
     <lb/>
     in price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have heard a great deal in this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     sir, about the desirability and the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     getting the Government of the United States to 
     <lb/>
     grant to Newfoundland some kind of special 
     <lb/>
     trade concession. The idea has been repeatedly 
     <lb/>
     expressed that this concession might take the 
     <lb/>
     form of special low customs tariff rates on our 
     <lb/>
     fish or fish products entering that country. Such 
     <lb/>
     special concessions would, of course, prove to be 
     <lb/>
     a very great value to our fishing industry, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore to the whole country. But what are the 
     <lb/>
     practical possibilities of our getting such a special 
     <lb/>
     concession from the United States? I used the 
     <lb/>
     word "special" advisedly. To be of any real value 
     <lb/>
          
<note xml:id="fn_02">1 The following section is taken from the recording of the proceedings.</note>

            <pb n="743"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0743.jpg"/>

     to us, such a concession must be special. It would 
     <lb/>
     not be of very much value to Newfoundland if the 
     <lb/>
     United States lowered her customs tariff on fish 
     <lb/>
     or fish products going in there from Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Iceland and Norway and other countries. It would 
     <lb/>
     not serve our purpose very much if the United 
     <lb/>
     States abolished those duties altogether on 
     <lb/>
     fishery products and did the same thing for all our 
     <lb/>
     powerful competitors. No, any concession to us 
     <lb/>
     along these lines must be given especially to us, 
     <lb/>
     else we will realise very little in the way of 
     <lb/>
     advantage from it. The question is, just what 
     <lb/>
     practical chance is there of Newfoundland per<lb break="no"/>suading the United States to give her such special, 
     <lb/>
     such preferential treatment? The argument used 
     <lb/>
     by those who say they see such a possibility is 
     <lb/>
     what I might call the bases argument. Nobody has 
     <lb/>
     yet suggested that out of the goodness of their 
     <lb/>
     hearts the Americans are likely, at our request, to 
     <lb/>
     give us such specially favourable treatment. 
     <lb/>
     Those who tell us of these possibilities of getting 
     <lb/>
     preferential treatment for our fish always use this 
     <lb/>
     bases argument. This is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> argu<lb break="no"/>ment. The British government and the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government in 1941 signed 
     <lb/>
     agreements with the Americans giving them 99- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     year leases of certain small areas of our territories 
     <lb/>
     on which to construct defence bases. New<lb break="no"/>foundland got nothing in return — save, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, what all those who are engaged on our side 
     <lb/>
     of the late war got, the advantage of the defence 
     <lb/>
     construction that was actually placed here by the 
     <lb/>
     Americans. But that is the argument, sir, New<lb break="no"/>foundland got nothing in return and so now we 
     <lb/>
     should go to the Government of the United States 
     <lb/>
     and ask for something that we should have had in 
     <lb/>
     1941; and the Government of the United States is 
     <lb/>
     likely to agree to our request, so we are told. That 
     <lb/>
     is the argument. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, the first hard fact that faces us when we 
     <lb/>
     consider this matter is that we are proposing to 
     <lb/>
     lock the stable door after the horse is gone. The 
     <lb/>
     lease agreements were signed in 1941. This is 
     <lb/>
     1947, nearly 1948. The lawful government 
     <lb/>
     signed the leases, not under any compulsion from 
     <lb/>
     the United States of America, but gladly, and 
     <lb/>
     with the feeling that they were doing something 
     <lb/>
     to help in time of dire peril, and with the feeling 
     <lb/>
     also that they had the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with them in their action. The leases are signed, 
     <lb/>
     the deal is closed. The bases are here. There has 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
       
     not been the slightest scrap of evidence to hint 
     <lb/>
     that the Americans would even consider opening 
     <lb/>
     up that deal again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But suppose that in spite of these facts, the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the United States, who are not 
     <lb/>
     woolly-minded sentimentalists remember, but 
     <lb/>
     hard-headed men of affairs, suppose that they 
     <lb/>
     went so far as to agree that we had a good case in 
     <lb/>
     equity. Would they then give us that for which 
     <lb/>
     we ask? Certainly the high permanent officials of 
     <lb/>
     the State Department and of the Department of 
     <lb/>
     Commerce, and of the United States Treasury, as 
     <lb/>
     well as the members of the Cabinet, would give 
     <lb/>
     careful consideration to all aspects of the matter 
     <lb/>
     before granting our request. And just as certainly 
     <lb/>
     as they would take those special aspects into 
     <lb/>
     careful account, so it is wise and prudent that we 
     <lb/>
     should consider them in this Convention. One 
     <lb/>
     aspect which the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
     States would be bound to weigh is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     they have defence bases in other places besides 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Those bases were acquired by 
     <lb/>
     the United States at about the same time as those 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. If they give Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     special trade concessions because they have 
     <lb/>
     bases here, must they not in consistency and 
     <lb/>
     justice give similar concessions to those other 
     <lb/>
     countries? That is something for us to consider. 
     <lb/>
     Another aspect which the United States govern<lb break="no"/>ment would take into account is their policy of 
     <lb/>
     never mixing trade concessions with military, 
     <lb/>
     naval, and air concessions. That is a definite 
     <lb/>
     policy of the United States of America. To do so 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland would be quite a novelty and 
     <lb/>
     would be to create a precedent which, as they 
     <lb/>
     would be quick to note, might be fraught with all 
     <lb/>
     kinds of possibilities for the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Still another aspect which the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United States would undoubtedly consider 
     <lb/>
     carefully is the effect that special trade conces<lb break="no"/>sions to Newfoundland might have upon the 
     <lb/>
     greatest cash customer the United States has in 
     <lb/>
     the world. I refer to Canada, which buys many 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods 
     <lb/>
     from her each year. The United States and 
     <lb/>
     Canada are each other's greatest customer. The 
     <lb/>
     trade, financial, political, and defence relations 
     <lb/>
     between them are probably closer than any other 
     <lb/>
     two countries in the world. Each of these two 
     <lb/>
     great countries is represented by an ambassador 
     <lb/>
     in the capital of the other, and the relationship 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="744"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0744.jpg"/>

     between them is peculiarly intimate and friendly. 
     <lb/>
     Is the Government of the United States at all 
     <lb/>
     likely, in return for bases which they acquired 
     <lb/>
     seven years ago in the hour of great common 
     <lb/>
     peril, to give special trade concessions to New<lb break="no"/>foundland which she will not give to Canada on 
     <lb/>
     at least equally favourable terms? But the most 
     <lb/>
     important aspect of all that the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     United States would take into account, is the fact 
     <lb/>
     that if they did give Newfoundland special con<lb break="no"/>cessions over and above those given to other 
     <lb/>
     countries, the United States would thereby be 
     <lb/>
     deliberately turning her back on a trade policy 
     <lb/>
     which she strained every effort to establish, 
     <lb/>
     which she has striven very hard to get other 
     <lb/>
     countries to accept and which she has advertised 
     <lb/>
     widely throughout the world as her policy. I refer, 
     <lb/>
     of course, to America's well-known policy of 
     <lb/>
     multilateral trade and tariff agreements. A policy 
     <lb/>
     of giving no trade concessions to one country 
     <lb/>
     without offering them to all other countries on 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was, we must not forget, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United States that called the trade conference 
     <lb/>
     at Geneva last spring. It was that government that 
     <lb/>
     invited the other nations to take part. It was that 
     <lb/>
     government that took the lead in the conference 
     <lb/>
     which met for many months, and at which New<lb break="no"/>foundland was represented. We all know the 
     <lb/>
     story of the ups and downs of that conference, of 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties, of the narrow escapes it had from 
     <lb/>
     disaster, of the herculean tasks it had to perform. 
     <lb/>
     We know that on the 18th of this present month, 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow, the world is to learn how successful or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise the United States government has been 
     <lb/>
     in establishing its policy of multilateral trade 
     <lb/>
     agreements throughout the world. For on tomor<lb break="no"/>row 105 trade and tariff treaties are to be publish<lb break="no"/>ed in all the countries concerned. To give 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland special trade concessions in such 
     <lb/>
     circumstances as these would mean that the 
     <lb/>
     United States would have to retrace its steps over 
     <lb/>
     the trail it has blazed in its efforts to stabilise its 
     <lb/>
     own and the world's trade. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, there is yet another aspect to which, 
     <lb/>
     whether they liked it or not, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United States would have to give most careful 
     <lb/>
     consideration, and that is the powerful pressure 
     <lb/>
     which America's own vast fishing industry 
     <lb/>
     would exert against allowing our fish or any one 
     <lb/>
     country's fish into America at such low rates of 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     customs duties as to depress the price of 
     <lb/>
     American fish and the wages of American fisher<lb break="no"/>men. That pressure, coming from the masters of 
     <lb/>
     the American fishing industry, and from the 
     <lb/>
     powerful trade unions of American fishermen 
     <lb/>
     backed by the whole trade union movement of 
     <lb/>
     the United States would carry a political sig<lb break="no"/>nificance, a political threat which no American 
     <lb/>
     government has ever yet been able to ignore. We 
     <lb/>
     all remember how just a few years ago a great fish 
     <lb/>
     development scheme on the southwest coast of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was wrecked before it could even 
     <lb/>
     get going, by the pressure of those same 
     <lb/>
     American fishing interests who fought fiercly 
     <lb/>
     against any move to admit Newfoundland fish at 
     <lb/>
     special tariff rates even when it was to be brought 
     <lb/>
     into the United States by an American company 
     <lb/>
     operating in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All these are hard facts Mr. Chairman, and 
     <lb/>
     they are facts upon which we dare not turn our 
     <lb/>
     backs. We must not give our people false hopes. 
     <lb/>
     I wish it were possible, sir, to get special preferen<lb break="no"/>tial treatment for our fish in the United States 
     <lb/>
     markets, but I am not prepared to delude myself 
     <lb/>
     or the people of this country in this matter. It 
     <lb/>
     would be a shameful thing to lead the people on 
     <lb/>
     with false hopes. And though I regret to say it, I 
     <lb/>
     must, for the reasons I have given, state very 
     <lb/>
     frankly that I see no hope whatever of our getting 
     <lb/>
     trade concession from the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America that our much larger competitors will 
     <lb/>
     not get on exactly the same terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, there is another aspect of this debate 
     <lb/>
     upon which I wish to offer a word or two of 
     <lb/>
     comment. We have seen and heard a very thinly 
     <lb/>
     disguised attempt to impute a lack of patriotic 
     <lb/>
     feeling to those members who have declined to 
     <lb/>
     accept this so-called Economic Report and the 
     <lb/>
     rosy picture it paints of our present and future. An 
     <lb/>
     effort is being made to blow this report up into an 
     <lb/>
     infallible test of our patriotism and love of 
     <lb/>
     country. If you are a patriot you will agree with 
     <lb/>
     this report, if you are not a patriot, you will 
     <lb/>
     question it. Your attitude towards it is a sure and 
     <lb/>
     certain test of your patriotism, that is the attempt 
     <lb/>
     that is being made, sir, and nobody seems to have 
     <lb/>
     observed the complete absurdity of it. Have we 
     <lb/>
     sunk so low, Mr. Chairman, are we so lost to all 
     <lb/>
     sense of reality? Have we wandered so far from 
     <lb/>
     a sense of duty? When the report seems to us 
     <lb/>
     literally to glow with easy optimism for the fu<lb break="no"/><pb n="745"

            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">745</fw>ture, is it really a crime against Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     express an honest doubt? When we venture to 
     <lb/>
     disagree with the report's pathetic attempt to 
     <lb/>
     convince us that we have been better than self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting all those tragic years of destitution, 
     <lb/>
     dole, and disease, are we to be denounced as 
     <lb/>
     traitors to our country? Has this Convention sunk 
     <lb/>
     so low that it is a major crime to remind ourselves 
     <lb/>
     of the fact, the indisputable fact, that this country 
     <lb/>
     went through a hell of suffering for nearly 20 
     <lb/>
     years between the two wars? Is it not permitted 
     <lb/>
     to us to wonder where our country and our people 
     <lb/>
     would be today if this war had not broken out? 
     <lb/>
     And when we look ahead, is it the one unforgiv<lb break="no"/>able sin to doubt that all is well with New<lb break="no"/>foundland — to wonder whether there may not 
     <lb/>
     be dangerous shoals ahead? I think I know how 
     <lb/>
     our Newfoundland people will answer all these 
     <lb/>
     questions, with their hard-headed practical minds 
     <lb/>
     and their vivid and bitter memories of their priva<lb break="no"/>tions up to the outbreak of the war in 1939. They 
     <lb/>
     are not going to be swept into any easy-going 
     <lb/>
     agreement with the optimistic speculations of this 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report. They know exactly what value 
     <lb/>
     to place upon any report that tells them that their 
     <lb/>
     country was self-supporting and better than self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting all through those long years of hunger 
     <lb/>
     and despair. They know exactly what to call a 
     <lb/>
     report that tells them, with cheerful complacency, 
     <lb/>
     that our present prosperity, such as it is, is due to 
     <lb/>
     anything but the war. And any man who imagines 
     <lb/>
     for one moment that our people would be led by 
     <lb/>
     the report into its mood of easy optimism is 
     <lb/>
     making the mistake of his life. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I read through the pages of this report, sir, 
     <lb/>
     I can allow my imagination to carry me along in 
     <lb/>
     company with the report's high hopes and pleas<lb break="no"/>ing predictions. I can hear the tread of marching 
     <lb/>
     feet, I can see in imagery column after column of 
     <lb/>
     presently worthless Newfoundlanders joyously 
     <lb/>
     marching towards the paradise of the future, and 
     <lb/>
     singing as they go that grand old evangelical 
     <lb/>
     chorus, "We are marching to Zion, beautiful, 
     <lb/>
     beautiful Zion." Would that it were so, sir, but 
     <lb/>
     alas I am brought back to the matter-of-fact world 
     <lb/>
     by another mental picture. A picture which is 
     <lb/>
     founded on reality. It is a picture of Mr. Average 
     <lb/>
     Fisherman's home of 40 years ago. I lived among 
     <lb/>
     fishermen then as I do now. I know their homes, 
     <lb/>
     their work, their flakes and their stages, their 
     <lb/>
     boats and their nets, the hardships and the dangers 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     they have endured, what they ate and what they 
     <lb/>
     wore, their education, or lack of it, their many 
     <lb/>
     labours and their few and limited pleasures, their 
     <lb/>
     hopes and their fears, the roughness and 
     <lb/>
     monotony of their simple diet, their utter lack of 
     <lb/>
     luxury and most of the amenities of life. It was a 
     <lb/>
     dull, drab existence; an inadequate reward for 
     <lb/>
     their skill, their fearless courage, their iron en<lb break="no"/>durance of heavy labour, chill and drenching 
     <lb/>
     spray. In those days the average fisherman who 
     <lb/>
     earned a couple of hundred dollars was reasonab<lb break="no"/>ly fortunate. And yet, sir, he possessed a pride and 
     <lb/>
     independence surpassed by few in more 
     <lb/>
     favourable circumstances in life. Did the child of 
     <lb/>
     a distant relative or connection become or<lb break="no"/>phaned? He willingly assumed the added burden 
     <lb/>
     of that child's maintenance, if at all possible. It 
     <lb/>
     was something in the nature of a reflection upon 
     <lb/>
     him for a relative to be sent to an orphanage. He 
     <lb/>
     put all he had into life, and received but a pittance 
     <lb/>
     in return. All that was perhaps nobody's fault. 
     <lb/>
     The product of his toil was a cheap commodity, 
     <lb/>
     consumed for the most part in the least wealthy 
     <lb/>
     market. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That sir, is the picture of 40 years ago, a 
     <lb/>
     picture I know well from close personal observa<lb break="no"/>tion. It persisted with uneven variations until the 
     <lb/>
     first world war, in the latter days of which, and 
     <lb/>
     for a couple of years after its end, that fisherman 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed phenomenal prices for the fruit of his toil 
     <lb/>
     levelled substantially however, by an increased 
     <lb/>
     cost of production and of living. Then came the 
     <lb/>
     first postwar slump when he went on the dole in 
     <lb/>
     his thousands. Then a short partial recovery 
     <lb/>
     during which the bite of poverty was not quite so 
     <lb/>
     sharp. Then the crash of the early thirties, when 
     <lb/>
     for eight long years he knew the grinding bitter<lb break="no"/>ness of dire destitution, and the torture of seeing 
     <lb/>
     his children grow thin from malnutrition and 
     <lb/>
     crippled with rickets. Beri-beri and tuberculosis 
     <lb/>
     stalked through the land. The government, both 
     <lb/>
     responsible and Commission, battled with this 
     <lb/>
     economic plague as best it could with the limited 
     <lb/>
     means at its disposal. But there was little if any 
     <lb/>
     improvement in the general conditions. Even as 
     <lb/>
     late as 1939, the year of the outbreak of the war, 
     <lb/>
     more than 40,000 people were still on dole after 
     <lb/>
     some $20,000 of British money had been pumped 
     <lb/>
     in in grants-in-aid to help keep the country afloat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And then sir, then, at the end of that terrible 
     <lb/>
     period, we experienced one of the bitterest 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="746"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0746.jpg"/>

     paradoxes of history — the paradox which 
     <lb/>
     drenched this world in blood and at the same time 
     <lb/>
     was the means of giving our people enough to eat, 
     <lb/>
     and placing a few dollars in their empty pockets. 
     <lb/>
     Yet we are asked by this report to believe that our 
     <lb/>
     swollen revenues are due to anything but war. 
     <lb/>
     During those terrible years of conflict and their 
     <lb/>
     aftermath, Mr. Average Fisherman has enjoyed a 
     <lb/>
     turn of comparative prosperity and again I use 
     <lb/>
     that word "comparative" advisedly. Let no one 
     <lb/>
     imagine that he has been living the full life during 
     <lb/>
     that period. He had a long leeway to make up to 
     <lb/>
     regain what the latest period of privation had 
     <lb/>
     taken from him. His home was dilapidated and in 
     <lb/>
     serious disrepair. Household utensils and essen<lb break="no"/>tials of all kinds, the very clothing on his bed had 
     <lb/>
     worn thin or disappeared altogether. Even his 
     <lb/>
     boat, his traps, his net, his engine, those things 
     <lb/>
     which claim priority of attention, for by them 
     <lb/>
     alone he could hope to live at all, suffered sadly. 
     <lb/>
     Yes he had a long leeway to make up. And it is a 
     <lb/>
     source of satisfaction to know that to a large 
     <lb/>
     extent at any rate he has been successful in that 
     <lb/>
     endeavour. And for that, wartime scarcity of 
     <lb/>
     food, high wages on transient defence works and 
     <lb/>
     high prices for his staple products have been 
     <lb/>
     fundamentally responsible. That, sir, is the story 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland fisherman as I have known 
     <lb/>
     him intimately for over 40 years. And yet, we are 
     <lb/>
     asked to believe that our present levels of com<lb break="no"/>parative prosperity and our revenues are due to 
     <lb/>
     anything, anything but the war.<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That story is the acid test of the economy of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — the way of life of the fisherman 
     <lb/>
     and of those directly dependent upon the fishery, 
     <lb/>
     the bulk of our people. And the same story with 
     <lb/>
     obvious variations holds true in all essentials for 
     <lb/>
     the logger, the labourer and the miner. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Jackman Point of order. Does Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>mean to say that these conditions are peculiar to 
     <lb/>Newfoundland only? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman What is your point of order? 
     <lb/>What irrelevancy are you referring to? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Jackman The conditions that exist in New<lb break="no"/>foundland exist everywhere else... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Bradley That is not a point of order. If Mr. 
     <lb/>Jackman, or any other member disagrees with 
     <lb/>what I say he will have an opportunity to state his 
     <lb/>opinion later on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman Quite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Mr. Bradley Not balanced budgets, not satisfy<lb break="no"/>ing surpluses, not trust and sinking funds, not 
     <lb/>
     these things, but the way of life of the people: that 
     <lb/>
     is the supreme test of our economy. Truly has it 
     <lb/>
     been said by a great British statesman that New<lb break="no"/>foundland has been the sport of historic misfor<lb break="no"/>tune. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have had a great deal of chatter about 
     <lb/>
     optimism and pessimism and realism, and the 
     <lb/>
     more we talk the further away we seem to get 
     <lb/>
     from the simple realities of the situation. We 
     <lb/>
     bandy about figures of millions and hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     millions, and roll our tongues over our industries 
     <lb/>
     and commerce; we talk of Marshall Plans and of 
     <lb/>
     exchange problems — and the more we talk of 
     <lb/>
     these things the further away we get from the 
     <lb/>
     simple truth, a truth so simple that it is lost in the 
     <lb/>
     mountain of figures over which we pore so pain<lb break="no"/>fully. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This country is not made up of budgets and 
     <lb/>
     deficits and surpluses. There are 300,000 living 
     <lb/>
     souls in the land, and they are Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Not the soil, the rocks and the water that con<lb break="no"/>stitute the island; nor the great companies and 
     <lb/>
     corporations; nor even the government itself. Are 
     <lb/>
     these 300,000 living souls the slaves of that 
     <lb/>
     government? Do they exist for the primary pur<lb break="no"/>pose of paying taxes and balancing the 
     <lb/>
     government's budget? Or does the government 
     <lb/>
     exist to serve them, the people, who make that 
     <lb/>
     government possible? 300,000 living souls, 
     <lb/>
     fashioned in God's image, for whom all material 
     <lb/>
     things in this land exist. <hi rendition="simple:italic">They</hi> are the yardstick of 
     <lb/>
     value, and the only yardstick. Anything which 
     <lb/>
     benefits them, anything which serves them, 
     <lb/>
     stands justified. A company or corporation is 
     <lb/>
     good for Newfoundland if it operates to the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of Newfoundland's people. Natural 
     <lb/>
     resources are valuable only if they serve the 
     <lb/>
     people's needs. A government is good if it func<lb break="no"/>tions in the people's interest. Under God our 
     <lb/>
     people are supreme over all in this island, and any 
     <lb/>
     institution or interest that does not serve their 
     <lb/>
     welfare stands condemned in the sight of the 
     <lb/>
     Almighty and in the sight of all just men. The 
     <lb/>
     people's interest, and their condition, are the acid 
     <lb/>
     test of this country's economy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, that is how it should be: that is what divine 
     <lb/>
     law ordains it should be. But that is not always 
     <lb/>
     what it has been in our history. Our companies

     benefit of the people. Our natural resources have

     system of taxation as to make it fall with the 
     <lb/>
     utmost gentleness on the shoulders of toiling 
     <lb/>
     bread-winners, so that they may live in frugal 
     <lb/>
     comfort and Christian decency? Or have we so 
     <lb/>
     arranged it as to crush all hope and initiative out 
     <lb/>
     of the lives of many? Is there a great hue and cry 
     <lb/>
     when the very government itself wrings $18-20 
     <lb/>
     million a year in customs duties out of our 
     <lb/>
     production? Or when the commercial interests 
     <lb/>
     wring more millions out of it in profits on those 
     <lb/>
     duties? No, we don't talk about these things - <lb/> we prefer to talk of budgets and surpluses and 
     <lb/>
     foreign exchange, Marshall Plans, and anything 
     <lb/>
     and everything but those simple truths that stare 
     <lb/>
     us in the face. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have wondered during the course of this 
     <lb/>
     debate, what has been in the minds of our fisher<lb break="no"/>men and other working classes as they heard from 
     <lb/>
     speaker after speaker that their country is 
     <lb/>
     prosperous, has been prosperous, and will be 
     <lb/>
     prosperous. I have thought of the way of life of 
     <lb/>
     these men, of their unending struggle against the 
     <lb/>
     mounting prices of everything they buy, and the 
     <lb/>
     fear which they must entertain of a drop in the 
     <lb/>
     prices of what they sell. I have thought of the 
     <lb/>
     decades and even centuries of the grim battle they 
     <lb/>
     have had to wage with life. Is it supposed, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that these people are impressed by all 
     <lb/>
     this discussion in terms of millions, all this sup<lb break="no"/>posed prosperity of today? $40 million is roughly 
     <lb/>
     the amount being presently wrung out of our 
     <lb/>
     production annually — roughly half our whole 
     <lb/>
     export trade. But is there any indignant shout in 
     <lb/>
     this chamber over these terrible figures? Is there 
     <lb/>
     even an exclamation of disgust at this crushing 
     <lb/>
     burden placed upon the shoulders of our people? 
     <lb/>
     On the contrary, the govemment's revenue is 
     <lb/>
     hailed with delight and cited as evidence to show 
     <lb/>
     how prosperous and self-supporting the people 
     <lb/>
     are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the year 1945, the latest for which we have 
     <lb/>
     the figures, 318 companies admitted to the in<lb break="no"/>come tax assessor that they had made profits that 
     <lb/>
     year amounting to $17 million. $17 million of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     taxable profits made in this little country by 318 
     <lb/>
     companies in one short year! Is this likewise to 
     <lb/>
     be taken as further proof that Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     prosperous and self-supporting? Can it be this 
     <lb/>
     that is meant when we are told that there is not a 
     <lb/>
     shadow on the road ahead? Some of us must be 
     <lb/>
     excused, sir, if when we hear of all this 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, and when we see these figures of big 
     <lb/>
     trading profits, some of us must be excused if we 
     <lb/>
     ask who has all this prosperity? Who is enjoying 
     <lb/>
     it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     True, the government is prosperous, and it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be denied that Newfoundland as an offi<lb break="no"/>cial entity, a corporate body, is self-supporting 
     <lb/>
     today. It is equally two that a number of in<lb break="no"/>dividual citizens, and many companies and cor<lb break="no"/>porations are prosperous. But does that make 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland prosperous? Does that make the 
     <lb/>
     people prosperous? Or are the people poor be<lb break="no"/>cause of that very prosperity? And yet it is their 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, or the lack of it, which makes up our 
     <lb/>
     economy. They are the measure of that economy. 
     <lb/>
     They are that very economy itself. Their 
     <lb/>
     prospects are the prospects of that economy. The 
     <lb/>
     trend of what lies ahead of them is the trend of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's economy. And what are those 
     <lb/>
     prospects? Those trends of today? Little con<lb break="no"/>sideration has yet been given to the possibilities 
     <lb/>
     which have agitated the minds of many states<lb break="no"/>men, economists, manufacturers, financiers and 
     <lb/>
     merchants for the past two years, and which are 
     <lb/>
     regarded by many as an imminent probability, 
     <lb/>
     and by some as a practical certainty. I refer to the 
     <lb/>
     possibilities of post-war depression. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The chaotic conditions of world trade today 
     <lb/>
     are already plain to be seen. Nearly the whole of 
     <lb/>
     Europe lies prostrate in the aftermath of the most 
     <lb/>
     devastating war in human history. World states<lb break="no"/>men arc struggling with hope, but hardly with 
     <lb/>
     confidence, to solve problem after problem aris<lb break="no"/>ing from day to day. And in the offing — we hope 
     <lb/>
     the far-distant offing — the grim spectre hovers 
     <lb/>
     of a struggle between the rival forces of com<lb break="no"/>munism and democracy. We have to depend 
     <lb/>
     upon that world for any degree of prosperity, for 
     <lb/>
     we are first, last, and all the time an exporting and 
     <lb/>
     importing country, and have little or no control 
     <lb/>
     over the prices we receive for what we sell, and 
     <lb/>
     no control at all over the prices we pay for what 
     <lb/>
     we buy. Already we see indications that all is not 
     <lb/>
     well. Cracks and rents are beginning to make 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="748"

     their appearance in many aspects of our 
     <lb/>
     economy. The prices of what we buy seem to be 
     <lb/>
     continually rising, while on the other hand we 
     <lb/>
     begin to see indications of a recession in the 
     <lb/>
     prices of those things we sell. And some are 
     <lb/>
     presently unsaleable. There is said to be a much 
     <lb/>
     larger quantity of our staple product of this year 
     <lb/>
     still unsold and in the hands of the merchants than 
     <lb/>
     for many years past, and there appears to be 
     <lb/>
     hesitation about making further purchases from 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All these points and observations I have made, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, and others like them that I have 
     <lb/>
     not the time to make today, are the stark con<lb break="no"/>siderations which are in the minds of our people 
     <lb/>
     and should be in ours. These are the considera<lb break="no"/>tions upon which we must, if we are true to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, base all our thinking about our 
     <lb/>
     country's economy. It is a time when every factor 
     <lb/>
     must be taken honestly into consideration, and 
     <lb/>
     this time the people shall know the truth, and the 
     <lb/>
     truth shall set them free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Starkes A few days ago, when I spoke on 
     <lb/>
     this Economic Report, I had hardly taken my seat 
     <lb/>
     when Mr. Hollett stood up and reeled off a whole 
     <lb/>
     lot of figures to show how much more prosperous 
     <lb/>
     our industries are than they were last year. I want 
     <lb/>
     to fill in some of the gaps left in Mr. Hollett's 
     <lb/>
     account of our industries. I want to tell you that 
     <lb/>
     at this moment many hundreds and thousands of 
     <lb/>
     producers are experiencing some of the worst 
     <lb/>
     misery they have ever known. Take a look at our 
     <lb/>
     biggest industry of all, the fisheries. Only last 
     <lb/>
     week a man from St. Mary's tramped Water 
     <lb/>
     Street, from one end to the other, trying to sell 
     <lb/>
     1,000 quintals of good quality shore codfish, and 
     <lb/>
     had failed to sell any of it up to the time I was 
     <lb/>
     speaking to him. What about the truckloads of 
     <lb/>
     codfish brought in here last week by the fisher<lb break="no"/>men, and carried back home again because 
     <lb/>
     nobody would buy it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett I rise to a point of order. I have been 
     <lb/>
     thinking about this ever since Mr. Starkes 
     <lb/>
     brought it up. Any figures which I quoted the 
     <lb/>
     other day were based on this, and were actual 
     <lb/>
     figures taken from the report. Why he imputes 
     <lb/>
     this statement to me I would like to know, and 
     <lb/>
     more than that, he spoke of somebody coming in 
     <lb/>
     with a truckload of fish. I wonder, could we have 
     <lb/>
     an official report of that? I would like to know. 
     <lb/>
     These are things we want. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I think 1 must sustain you on the 
     <lb/>
     first point. By the process of elimination my very 
     <lb/>
     definite recollection, Mr. Hollett, is that any 
     <lb/>
     figures quoted by you were from the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Report or the Economic Report. Their accuracy, 
     <lb/>
     of course, would obviously be decided when 
     <lb/>
     these reports come before the House. On the 
     <lb/>
     second point, however, I have to sustain Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Starkes, because I feel that any member must be 
     <lb/>
     free to express an opinion. I must assume that the 
     <lb/>
     opinion is honestly expressed, and he shall not be 
     <lb/>
     required to defend it simply because his opinion 
     <lb/>
     is not shared universally by other members of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. Therefore 1 don't think he is out of 
     <lb/>
     order, because I don't think I can allow this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to be resolved into a court of judica<lb break="no"/>ture where every member would have to provide 
     <lb/>
     independent corroboration. That would be a very 
     <lb/>
     serious state of affairs, Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett On that point again, if I may. We 
     <lb/>
     must remember that we are speaking to the 
     <lb/>
     people when we speak here, and if Mr. Starkes is 
     <lb/>
     going to make a statement about somebody 
     <lb/>
     bringing in a truckload of fish and not selling it, 
     <lb/>
     it will cause alarm in this country. I think, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that any statement of that kind should be 
     <lb/>
     substantiated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I see the seriousness of what you 
     <lb/>
     say, Mr. Hollett, but as I see it I am powerless to 
     <lb/>
     prevent consequences which may follow from 
     <lb/>
     any member's making an ill—advised statement. I 
     <lb/>
     think the members would be well advised to 
     <lb/>
     seriously consider every statement that they 
     <lb/>
     make before it is made; but on the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     unless and until the remark is out of order, I can't 
     <lb/>
     deal with it, and I think, in the circumstances, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Starkes, I can't do anything. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Starkes I was not contradicting Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett's figures, I was just filling in the gaps that 
     <lb/>
     he left out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett These are not my figures, they are 
     <lb/>
     from the Financial Report and the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I must sustain you, Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hollett The gaps then that you are propos<lb break="no"/>ing to fill in are the gaps left by the Economic 
     <lb/>Report and the Finance Report, as the case may 
     <lb/>be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Starkes Why is it that our salt codfish ex<lb break="no"/>ports fall short over 100,000 quintals as com<lb break="no"/>pared with the same period last year? What about 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="749"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0749.jpg"/>

     the fish stores that are filled up today with fish 
     <lb/>
     that has not yet been sold, and if and when it is 
     <lb/>
     sold, who can tell us what price it will bring to 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen? And what about the hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     fishermen who can't sell their fish, and can't even 
     <lb/>
     batter it for food? From January 1 to the end of 
     <lb/>
     September last year we exported over $4 1/2 mil<lb break="no"/>lion worth of fresh and frozen codfish, but for the 
     <lb/>
     same period this year the value was only $1 1/2 
     <lb/>
     million, which is $3 million less. That is a big 
     <lb/>
     difference in my eyes, and it tells us a lot... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman There is altogether too much 
     <lb/>
     commotion in this chamber. Members and 
     <lb/>
     visitors will please refrain from commenting at 
     <lb/>
     all, because it is with the greatest difficulty that I 
     <lb/>
     am able to follow the speaker, and at any time I 
     <lb/>
     may be asked to rule upon a point of order which 
     <lb/>
     the speaker is trying to address to the Chair. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Starkes That's a big difference in my eyes, 
     <lb/>and it tells us a lot, for had we exported as much 
     <lb/>fresh frozen fish this year as we did last year we 
     <lb/>would have that much less salted fish to try to get 
     <lb/>rid of now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, take our herring. From January I to the 
     <lb/>
     end of October last year we exported over $4 1/2 
     <lb/>
     million worth of herring; but what do we find for 
     <lb/>
     the same period this year? Our herring exports are 
     <lb/>
     only $2 million, that is over $2 1/2 million less that 
     <lb/>
     last year. Take lobsters. Our expert of lobsters 
     <lb/>
     this year is $150,000 less than last year. Look at 
     <lb/>
     dried squid. Out of 10,000 barrels packed this 
     <lb/>
     year only 2,000 barrels have been sold, leaving 
     <lb/>
     8,000 barrels still in the country, mostly in the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen's hands and practically unsaleable. 
     <lb/>
     Look at the salmon. Last year salmon exported in 
     <lb/>
     the first ten months came to $800,000. In the 
     <lb/>
     same period this year it is only $550,000, that is 
     <lb/>
     $250,000 less. And if you look at the pulpwood 
     <lb/>
     industry, what do you find? Practically all the 
     <lb/>
     camps cutting pulpwood had their quota reduced 
     <lb/>
     this year, and speaking of the district I represent, 
     <lb/>
     a very large pulpwood operation at Springdale 
     <lb/>
     has its camps at present all closed, while at 
     <lb/>
     Roberts Arm, where there is another large opera<lb break="no"/>tion, they expect to close this week. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With all these facts staring them in the face, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I can tell you that thousands of our 
     <lb/>
     producers are today up against conditions worse 
     <lb/>
     than any they have seen for many years past. Not 
     <lb/>
     very many of them would give a plugged nickel 
     <lb/>
     for all the rosy pictures painted in this Economic 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     Report. I am compelled to base my figures on 
     <lb/>
     those produced by the Fisheries Board, and not 
     <lb/>
     on the figures in this Economic Report which is 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion absolutely wrong. As proof, in the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries this year we exported less than we did 
     <lb/>
     last year as follows:

     as their representative, and considering the facts

     as stated, I say that this rosy report is not worth

            <p>
     Mr. Penney larn going to take a chance, without 
     <lb/>
     any notes or preparation, to take issue with two 
     <lb/>
     matters that Mr. Bradley brought out in his ex<lb break="no"/>tended talk. One of them is that he used a lot of 
     <lb/>
     "ifs" in his arguments about getting into the 
     <lb/>
     United States market. "If", and the result of it was 
     <lb/>
     there was no possible chance for Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     to do anything there. Well, I want to say to him, 
     <lb/>
     although he is not in the House at this time, and 
     <lb/>
     to the delegates, that if we had the chance to send 
     <lb/>
     an official delegation to Washington, and spent 
     <lb/>
     one-third of the time there that the delegates did 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa, then we would see and then we would 
     <lb/>
     know what could be done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another matter that Mr. Bradley stressed was 
     <lb/>
     speculation. There was speculation in our Eco&lt; 
     <lb/>
     nomic Report, and speculation in this and that, 
     <lb/>
     and everything. I say to you that no man or 
     <lb/>
     woman who speculates in any walk of life, they 
     <lb/>
     never got anywhere, and Mr. Starkes should bear 
     <lb/>
     me out in that matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now then, in regard to the Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     itself, I was a humble member of that Committee, 
     <lb/>
     and I want to say, notwithstanding the slurs that 
     <lb/>
     were put across this House about the report and 
     <lb/>
     the personnel of the Committee, we served 
     <lb/>
     honestly, unmoved by exterior motives of any 
     <lb/>
     kind, and I claim that the report is a good one. 
     <lb/>
     Lots of the information contained in that report is 
     <lb/>
     taken from all the reports of this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     compiled by all members of the Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     moreover they were also taken from official sour<lb break="no"/>ces, and I believe they are right; and when one 
     <lb/>
     member says, "It was not an honest report", I 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="750"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0750.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">750</fw>
            <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
         

     differ with that. I don't claim to be any special 
     <lb/>
     angel, but I am not dishonest, and Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     can search the records of the court, or the statis<lb break="no"/>tics of debtors, or the Economic Report, and he 
     <lb/>
     won't find anything there showing dishonesty. I 
     <lb/>
     am convinced from what I have seen and what 
     <lb/>
     we did, that this country is self-supporting, no 
     <lb/>
     matter what people may argue or say to the con<lb break="no"/>trary. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman, it does not matter 
     <lb/>how we obtained the prosperity we have, but 
     <lb/>rather what are our chances of holding it. It 
     <lb/>matters not to a country whether an earthquake, 
     <lb/>war or even a revolution brings prosperity. What 
     <lb/>does matter in deciding on a plan for the future is 
     <lb/>whether the prosperity is real. Is it lasting? Have 
     <lb/>we a reasonable chance of continuing to be self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>supporting? Surely we do not expect a drop of 
     <lb/>25% in our revenue in the immediate future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Frankly, I fail to see what purpose it serves to 
     <lb/>be debating these reports in committee of the 
     <lb/>whole. Most of us could have used up much more 
     <lb/>valuable time talking, bickering and arguing over 
     <lb/>something we ourselves, and the whole country, 
     <lb/>know has been prepared in such a manner as to 
     <lb/>do full justice to all the circumstances surround<lb break="no"/>ing it. Each member should have spoken once 
     <lb/>only and then the vote taken. It has been very 
     <lb/>difficult for some of us to hold our seats when we 
     <lb/>see so much valuable time wasted. I am in full 
     <lb/>support of Mr. Job's suggestion to get on with the 
     <lb/>job, and I must reiterate that this whole business 
     <lb/>should not have lasted six months. In my opinion 
     <lb/>we are all justified in suggesting corrections or 
     <lb/>minor alterations, but when we appoint commit<lb break="no"/>tees to do a job, we should not question the 
     <lb/>honesty of the reports, but rather the purpose they 
     <lb/>serve, and vote according to the dictates of our 
     <lb/>own consciences. In my opinion, anyone who 
     <lb/>votes against this report is betraying the land that 
     <lb/>gave them birth; regardless of whether we recom<lb break="no"/>mend that we carry on on our own or join hands 
     <lb/>with some other country, it is and will still remain 
     <lb/>our bounden duty to keep the torch of New<lb break="no"/>foundland burning high, and never let us accept 
     <lb/>an inferiority complex at any time, but insist that 
     <lb/>we are, and will always be equal with our neigh<lb break="no"/>bours of the same race. We are all only too 
     <lb/>conscious of the fact that all is not well with the 
     <lb/>world, and we cannot expect to escape our full 
     <lb/>share of the aftermath of the war; but we are 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
            
     prepared to adjust ourselves to new world condi<lb break="no"/>tions, just as other countries must; and this will 
     <lb/>
     not be altered by any particular form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is my definite opinion that the USA would 
     <lb/>
    renew negotiations concerning the base leases, or 
     <lb/>grant reciprocal trade tariffs, owing to the fact 
     <lb/>that the USA did not get 99 year leases from other 
     <lb/>countries who are seeking free entry for their 
     <lb/>products, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Kennedy Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to 
     <lb/>waste the time of this Convention with my 
     <lb/>opinion of members who consider their own 
     <lb/>blocking has any bearing whatsoever on the 
     <lb/>economic, or indeed any other standing, of our 
     <lb/>country. The general public, and indeed you 
     <lb/>yourself, must by this time be heartily sick of 
     <lb/>would-be statesmen and their egotism, so enough 
     <lb/>of this nonsense. I make no pretense of being an 
     <lb/>economist, but at the same time I claim common 
     <lb/>sense, and I trust that my claim will be substan<lb break="no"/>tiated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The direct aim of any business involving the 
     <lb/>
     public is to bring to that public the things that it 
     <lb/>
     needs most. If stocks held are the stocks in 
     <lb/>
     demand, then that business, regardless of whether 
     <lb/>
     its neighbours sink or swim, is bound to thrive - <lb/> and if it doesn't, no one is going to blame the 
     <lb/>
     finance minister's estimates. Apply this principle 
     <lb/>
     to countries at large and what have you? This 
     <lb/>
     island is producing commodities for which the 
     <lb/>
     whole world is clamouring from resources 
     <lb/>
     which, far from being worked out, are not even 
     <lb/>
     as yet tapped. It is indeed unfortunate that the 
     <lb/>
     sterling crisis affects our would-be market in 
     <lb/>
     Europe, but why in the name of heaven sit back 
     <lb/>
     and wail like a man with one theory, whose 
     <lb/>
     theory has been blown sky high? Every pound of 
     <lb/>
     fish, every cord of timber, every ton of ore sent 
     <lb/>
     to Europe must be shipped — using foreign 
     <lb/>
     fleets, note you! — at least 2,000 miles. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The United States needs our food in the form 
     <lb/>
     of fish. Transport and other difficulties regarding 
     <lb/>
     this commodity have in recent years been over<lb break="no"/>come, and I think I'm safe in saying larger strides 
     <lb/>
     are under plan, and soon the term "direct from 
     <lb/>
     fisherman to consumer" will become fact. With 
     <lb/>
     the appropriate trade agreements, we can derive 
     <lb/>
     from this need of the United States all the essen<lb break="no"/>tials which our now precious dollars are purchas<lb break="no"/>ing from a country unable to buy anything which 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="751"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0751.jpg"/>

     we can produce. In other words, millions of dol<lb break="no"/>lars are yearly leaving this country without one 
     <lb/>
     dollar returning in remuneration. Mr. Job has 
     <lb/>
     already attempted to emphasise to you that the 
     <lb/>
     largest and most sought-after market in the world 
     <lb/>
     is ours for the asking. Is our economy such that 
     <lb/>
     someone else is needed to do the asking for us? 
     <lb/>
     Why fritter away our precious dollars, which 
     <lb/>
     belong as much to the humblest fisherman in 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Bay or any other bay as to the country 
     <lb/>
     at large, on a dead market? Summarising, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, the whole affair is a one-sided gain. 
     <lb/>
     That side does not happen to be ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as the agricultural aspect of our econ<lb break="no"/>omy is concerned, this report itself showed all too 
     <lb/>
     clearly that much in this country is to be decided 
     <lb/>
     in this respect. Encouragement of veterans into 
     <lb/>
     agriculture but a year ago, and today these same 
     <lb/>
     veterans have practically everything they have 
     <lb/>
     grown still on their hands, while foreign produce 
     <lb/>
     pours into this country — no economy of any 
     <lb/>
     country will stand this lack of planning and 
     <lb/>
     foresight. Granted, this island a mere 200 years 
     <lb/>
     ago was a barren waste; but these 200 years have 
     <lb/>
     witnessed considerable advance. With the in<lb break="no"/>stitution of a good marketing system and the 
     <lb/>
     promise of a sale for goods produced, farming 
     <lb/>
     will substitute another answer to the unnecessary 
     <lb/>
     outside expenditure on goods which are here on 
     <lb/>
     our doorstep. I would remind certain members 
     <lb/>
     that three meals a day are more easily acquired 
     <lb/>
     by even the poorest, when two or more of those 
     <lb/>
     meals are to be found in the back garden. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, a depression is forecast by our 
     <lb/>
     members; just when, even the most pessimistic 
     <lb/>
     souls are not able to state. I wish to ask the 
     <lb/>
     member for Bonavista Centre if he considers that 
     <lb/>
     from the whole world, this small island of ours is 
     <lb/>
     to be singled out for starvation? Any fool knows 
     <lb/>
     that the economy of any country fluctuates from 
     <lb/>
     time to time. In the event of international crisis, 
     <lb/>
     is manna to drop from heaven in every country 
     <lb/>
     but Newfoundland? If there are to be soup and 
     <lb/>
     bread lines as before, are other countries to be 
     <lb/>
     spared them? Mr. Butt put forward what I con<lb break="no"/>sider to be a concrete fact when he stated that in 
     <lb/>
     economic spheres, material possessions may 
     <lb/>
     have more bearing on a country's prosperity than 
     <lb/>
     existent dollars. The value of the materials New<lb break="no"/>foundland possesses has increased beyond doubt; 
     <lb/>
     not alone because of the war which ended two 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     years ago, but because this war inevitably ex<lb break="no"/>hausted supplies and in some cases even the 
     <lb/>
     sources of those supplies for all time. Now the 
     <lb/>
     occasion is opportune to release to a world 
     <lb/>
     hungry for raw materials such as we possess of 
     <lb/>
     the natural resources at our command. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Any member in this Convention who expres<lb break="no"/>ses no faith in his country infers only lack of faith 
     <lb/>
     in himself; and who with such a line of thought 
     <lb/>
     can ever hope to gain for Newfoundland interna<lb break="no"/>tional respect? May I remind the member from 
     <lb/>
     St. George's that the hope and charity theme 
     <lb/>
     accentuated in his eloquent delivery of yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     fails to make sense when one perceives that he 
     <lb/>
     ignores that equally important factor of "faith". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall make no attempt to wrangle with the 
     <lb/>
     figures so ably provided by Major Cashin and his 
     <lb/>
     Committee. I, for one, am certain that fooling is 
     <lb/>
     implied only in our discussions with outsiders. 
     <lb/>
     After much thought and with deep sincerity, I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that our beloved country is self-support<lb break="no"/>ing at the present time and will be for as far into 
     <lb/>
     the future as any human being is able to foresee. 
     <lb/>
     I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin and his Committee on their fine 
     <lb/>
     work. With faith in my country and its people - <lb/> may God bless them — I submit my 
     <lb/>
     wholehearted support to this report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Order, please. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge Mr. Chairman, before recess there 
     <lb/>
     was a point or two on which I felt that I should 
     <lb/>
     comment, and that is in connection with our fish. 
     <lb/>
     Our trouble with fish is caused by our customers 
     <lb/>
     in Europe who trade in sterling, and the inability 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain to convert the sterling into dol<lb break="no"/>lars. This of course applies also to the woods 
     <lb/>
     situation. As far as the woods are concerned, I 
     <lb/>
     regret that the cut for this year is very near com<lb break="no"/>pleted, but I think it is only fair that I should 
     <lb/>
     explain as best I can why it is that the cut is up so 
     <lb/>
     soon. It is because of the fact that due to a poor 
     <lb/>
     fishery we have had such a flow of men to the 
     <lb/>
     woods as we have not had for years and years, 
     <lb/>
     with the result that two weeks ago, in one week's 
     <lb/>
     cutting, Bowaters had 27,000 cords of wood cut 
     <lb/>
     and piled. The like was never known before in 
     <lb/>
     their history. It must be understood that the 
     <lb/>
     forests cannot stand that... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I remember in the days before the war that our 
     <lb/>
     earning power was not very good, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     the economic position of Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="752"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0752.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">752</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
        
     none too good, because of the fact that our people 
     <lb/>
     were not getting sufficient for their toil. Wood 
     <lb/>
     was cut at $1 a cord, and you worked a long weary 
     <lb/>
     hour for $1.60, but today I find that matters have 
     <lb/>
     improved and the economic position is much 
     <lb/>
     better, and therefore the economic position of the 
     <lb/>
     country has come up also. The fisherman and the 
     <lb/>
     woodsman are well aware of what is going on. 
     <lb/>
     They are aware that there's been a lot of people 
     <lb/>
     who have done fairly well off the fisherman and 
     <lb/>
     the labourer, and some of those have made state<lb break="no"/>ments in this House today. They are aware of that, 
     <lb/>
     and I say that those things don't help the position 
     <lb/>
     in any case. I fear that by the words that we use, 
     <lb/>
     and the gloom that we are prepared to cause, we 
     <lb/>
     may have some effect upon our people. I realise 
     <lb/>
     that there are businessmen who are willing to 
     <lb/>
     allow a person two or three months groceries 
     <lb/>
     ahead to carry them over the winter; but with the 
     <lb/>
     pictures that we are painting here, why the wolf 
     <lb/>
     is living at their doors, and they will wake up in 
     <lb/>
     the morning and say, "I am sorry we can't give 
     <lb/>
     you anything, because those fellows in the Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention know it all, and poverty is right 
     <lb/>
     at our door". We should be careful in the way we 
     <lb/>
     express ourselves. I feel confident that this thing 
     <lb/>
     will right itself and I have taken a course perhaps 
     <lb/>
     opposite to others, and I am prepared to see what 
     <lb/>
     I can do about the future in Newfoundland. Along 
     <lb/>
     with the rest of the labour organisation I think 
     <lb/>
     those of you who are in doubt can leave it in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of those who represent labour, especially 
     <lb/>
     this winter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry I would like to make a few com<lb break="no"/>ments on this report. First, I would like to give 
     <lb/>
     my congratulations to Mr. Bradley (he is not in 
     <lb/>
     the House at present), because I feel he has given 
     <lb/>
     a very able and masterly and well balanced ad<lb break="no"/>dress. The report, sir, as you pointed out at the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of the debate, is one that is of utmost 
     <lb/>
     importance, the most important document before 
     <lb/>
     us in connection with the main purpose of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. It was with a great deal of eagerness 
     <lb/>
     that we looked forward to it. I remember clearly 
     <lb/>
     the disappointment I received, before we ad<lb break="no"/>journed last spring, when the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     thought it would not give an economic report. But 
     <lb/>
     the report is before us, and in anticipation of it I 
     <lb/>
     tried to draw up in my own mind a picture of what 
     <lb/>
     the economy was like, and to project it into the 
     <lb/>
     future. I did it for my own satisfaction, and to my 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     own satisfaction. I came here two weeks ago and 
     <lb/>
     heard this report given by Major Cashin in his 
     <lb/>
     characteristic way, and I was very much inter<lb break="no"/>ested in it, but I must say that I was keenly 
     <lb/>
     disappointed, because it did not match up with 
     <lb/>
     the things I had in mind.... It has been said often 
     <lb/>
     that the Finance Committee has done an excellent 
     <lb/>
     job in marshalling the facts and presenting them 
     <lb/>
     to us in the Finance Report that they presented to 
     <lb/>
     us some time ago. I subscribe to that, and say that 
     <lb/>
     it is a very comprehensive and able report.... 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Now this report that is before us is an inter<lb break="no"/>pretation of these facts, and an interpretation of 
     <lb/>the facts coming out of the other reports and I am 
     <lb/>not enthusiastic about the work of the Committee 
     <lb/>in interpreting the facts that we have dis<lb break="no"/>covered.... I think the weakness of the report is 
     <lb/>that it does not give sufficient consideration to 
     <lb/>the smaller units of production in this country, 
     <lb/>and their relation to the economy. I refer to the 
     <lb/>individual farmer, fisherman, trapper and miner 
     <lb/>— the primary producer, or what Mr. Keough 
     <lb/>likes to call the "little man". Now it may be 
     <lb/>argued that his capacity to produce is reflected in 
     <lb/>the millions and millions of dollars that have been 
     <lb/>referred to in this Economic Report and in the 
     <lb/>Financial Report. It may be that the farmer's 
     <lb/>ability to produce is reflected in the $12.5 million 
     <lb/>that the industry is worth in the estimation of the 
     <lb/>Agricultural Committee; and that the ability of 
     <lb/>the individual fisherman to produce is reflected 
     <lb/>in the number of quintals of fish, etc. That may 
     <lb/>be true in a sense, but it does not tell the whole 
     <lb/>story of the ability of the individual man to 
     <lb/>produce, and how it reflects upon the actual 
     <lb/>economy. The farmer, for instance, how is he 
     <lb/>equipped to produce? What is the state of his 
     <lb/>equipment, and how modern is it, and how well 
     <lb/>is he provided to bring the best possible contribu<lb break="no"/>tion? The fisherman, much has been said about 
     <lb/>him and his ability to produce. We have heard it 
     <lb/>said, and it was brought out in the Fisheries 
     <lb/>Report, that the equipment he has today, in some 
     <lb/>parts of our country at least, is outmoded — it is 
     <lb/>old fashioned. I wonder if we realise just how 
     <lb/>outworn and dilapidated that equipment is and 
     <lb/>how much he is handicapped in his ability to 
     <lb/>produce because of that.... Someone has said that 
     <lb/>the equipment of the fishermen has reached a 
     <lb/>very high stage of efficiency. I have no doubt that 
     <lb/>he was sincere in making that statement, and that 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="753"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0753.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>  <fw type="num">753</fw>
          
     he was referring to some of the fishermen he 
     <lb/>
     knew, but I am just as sincere in saying that the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen I know, and the equipment I have seen 
     <lb/>
     them use in the past, certainly cannot be 
     <lb/>
     described in that way. I rather think that if an 
     <lb/>
     efficiency expert were to pass judgement on 
     <lb/>
     some of the equipment our fishermen have to use, 
     <lb/>
     and I am not thinking only of the Labradorians, 
     <lb/>
     but of the fishermen who go to the Labrador, that 
     <lb/>
     at least 50% of it would be thrown on the scrap<lb break="no"/>heap, and the other 50% would not reach a very 
     <lb/>
     high stage of efficiency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And not only is the equipment of the fisher<lb break="no"/>man a handicap to him, but I think it can be well 
     <lb/>
     said that a man cannot do his best unless he is 
     <lb/>
     well-fed and well-housed, and well cared for in 
     <lb/>
     that way. On the bread and tea economy that our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen have had to depend upon, they are not 
     <lb/>
     able to bring their best possible contributions to 
     <lb/>
     our productive life. It is true that that man's bread 
     <lb/>
     and tea economy has been varied, as far as he is 
     <lb/>
     able to have a meal of fish and brewis two or three 
     <lb/>
     times a week, and on Sunday he can have a meal 
     <lb/>
     of puffins and turrs, but that kind of diet does not 
     <lb/>
     enable him to bring his best possible contribution. 
     <lb/>
     We all know that when England had to reduce on 
     <lb/>
     her rations the authorities saw to it that the men 
     <lb/>
     who had to go down in the mines, and the men 
     <lb/>
     who had to work in the factory, and the fisher<lb break="no"/>men, were given an extra ration. It has a bearing 
     <lb/>
     upon his ability to produce. The same is true of 
     <lb/>
     our people. If they had better equipment, and 
     <lb/>
     were better fed, they could bring a better con<lb break="no"/>tribution to the economy of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the member from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     made that speech here two weeks ago on the 
     <lb/>
     opening of the debate, on the way out I offered 
     <lb/>
     him my congratulations. I thought he was render<lb break="no"/>ing a great piece of service to this country. It has 
     <lb/>
     been backed up several times by other members, 
     <lb/>
     and especially by Mr. Bradley this afternoon, I 
     <lb/>
     offer him my congratulations because I thought 
     <lb/>
     then that he was "on the beam", as some other 
     <lb/>
     individual put it. I hasten to explain that in giving 
     <lb/>
     my congratulations to Mr. Smallwood, I am not 
     <lb/>
     giving blanket approval to all he said that day. He 
     <lb/>
     has a way of saying things sometimes that per<lb break="no"/>haps I don't like, and perhaps others don't like, 
     <lb/>
     but nevertheless who am I to say what he should 
     <lb/>
     say, or how he should say it?.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There have been letters read here, I think the 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     member from Bonavista Centre has read letters, 
     <lb/>
     from individual members of their constituencies, 
     <lb/>
     and I suppose if the rest of us were to gather 
     <lb/>
     together our letters and read them it would take 
     <lb/>
     up a great deal of our time, and I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     do that, but what I want to say is this: that there 
     <lb/>
     is none of us in this Convention who is so short<lb break="no"/>sighted as to think that because there is an in<lb break="no"/>dividual family or two somewhere on the coast 
     <lb/>
     of Labrador, or somewhere in the bays of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, who are living in squalor, poverty, 
     <lb/>
     distress, and hunger, that because of that the 
     <lb/>
     whole background of this report should be 
     <lb/>
     darkened.... But when there is forced in upon me 
     <lb/>
     the fact that these are not isolated cases, that there 
     <lb/>
     is a great deal of hunger, and has been in the past, 
     <lb/>
     and a great deal of poverty, and a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     distress in our island, I think that that fact, which 
     <lb/>
     our Committee members must have known, 
     <lb/>
     should have made them shade in some dark lines 
     <lb/>
     in the background at least in the report, rather 
     <lb/>
     than presenting only the highlights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not a waste of our time to look at this 
     <lb/>
     country through the spectacles that so many, 
     <lb/>
     many people on the island and the coast of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador have to wear through all the year, and 
     <lb/>
     see the position we are in through the shady 
     <lb/>
     spectacles that they have to wear. I think it is not 
     <lb/>
     a waste of time, and I think we would have spent 
     <lb/>
     some portion of the 14 months we have spent here 
     <lb/>
     more valuably, if we had tried together to see the 
     <lb/>
     country as it really is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was with a great deal of concern and regret 
     <lb/>
     that I read this morning in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that another of our industries in Labrador has 
     <lb/>
     had to declare itself insolvent. That company 
     <lb/>
     touches in a very vital way a large part of the coast 
     <lb/>
     of Labrador. The people along that coast have had 
     <lb/>
     a very hard and very difficult existence all 
     <lb/>
     through their lives. A few years ago this industry 
     <lb/>
     started. It did not have a very good beginning. It 
     <lb/>
     dropped out of existence for a while and came 
     <lb/>
     back again, but when this company came into 
     <lb/>
     existence these people saw an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     whereby they might be able to make a few dollars 
     <lb/>
     other than through the fishery. In the long winter 
     <lb/>
     months they might work and make a bit of 
     <lb/>
     money, rather than have to rely upon the dole 
     <lb/>
     which they know so well. It was a very bright spot 
     <lb/>
     to them. Now to most of us it would not be a 
     <lb/>
     bright spot. It is not an easy thing to have to make 
     <lb/>
      
            <pb n="754"

     a living by working, week after week, month after 
     <lb/>
     month, year after year, cutting wood to get a mere 
     <lb/>
     living. That's not an easy thing, but to these 
     <lb/>
     people who have had such a dreary existence, this 
     <lb/>
     was a great light, and they rejoiced in the fact that 
     <lb/>
     an industry was started. It had a very checkered 
     <lb/>
     beginning, but it did do good. And now this 
     <lb/>
     morning I was shattered in my hopes for these 
     <lb/>
     people to hear that this company has gone into 
     <lb/>
     liquidation. It is something more than another 
     <lb/>
     company gone broke. The coast is left stranded 
     <lb/>
     at a late part of the season, when the fishery was 
     <lb/>
     very, very poor, so poor that there was nothing 
     <lb/>
     left on the coast as a result of the fishery, or 
     <lb/>
     practically nothing. All supplies for the winter 
     <lb/>
     depended upon the industries, upon Goose Bay 
     <lb/>
     and the Labrador Development Company,<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> and 
     <lb/>
     upon the government. There is very little upon 
     <lb/>
     the coast by way of groceries and supplies to 
     <lb/>
     carry them through the winter....   The people were 
     <lb/>
     depending, on this part of the coast, upon the 
     <lb/>
     work that would be given them by the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Development Company. In that area the popula<lb break="no"/>tion is 400 people, 165 children. In the immediate 
     <lb/>
     vicinity there are 500 people, another 160 
     <lb/>
     children — north and south there is a large 
     <lb/>
     population coming to the Labrador Development 
     <lb/>
     Company to look for work rather than depend 
     <lb/>
     upon the government to supply them with dole. 
     <lb/>
     Even before the fishery stopped as many as 200 
     <lb/>
     men poured into Port Hope Simpson in the hope 
     <lb/>
     of getting work. The usual quota of the company 
     <lb/>
     is 150 people; that is quite a strain upon the 
     <lb/>
     supplies — 250 men calling upon them. Conse<lb break="no"/>quently the food had been all used up even before 
     <lb/>
     the boats left the coast for the year. They are in 
     <lb/>
     pretty desperate need. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not in a position to make any pronounce<lb break="no"/>ment upon what has been done — upon the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom or justice of the company's going into 
     <lb/>
     liquidation. This is how it strikes me. Here is a 
     <lb/>
     company cutting wood in Labrador; there is plen<lb break="no"/>ty of wood, plenty of labour, the market is open, 
     <lb/>
     prices are generous, and this company is not 
     <lb/>
     absolutely broke. They have some credits on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the Atlantic in sterling. They have 
     <lb/>
     applied to the government for some help. As I 
     <lb/>
     understand it the government has not seen fit to 
     <lb/>
     grant their request — a mere $200,000 — to 
     <lb/>
     enable them to carry on, to send supplies in and 
     <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
           
     to engage all these people. The government has 
     <lb/>
     not seen fit to help them out to this extent. There 
     <lb/>
     is one thing certain: the government will have to 
     <lb/>
     do something. They will have to send a supply 
     <lb/>
     boat to feed these people. There are about 900 of 
     <lb/>
     them in that particular area — north and south of 
     <lb/>
     that many others depend upon the company and 
     <lb/>
     now they have nothing to depend on but relief. 
     <lb/>
     The people cannot be allowed to starve this 
     <lb/>
     winter. It will cost $150,000 to get supplies in. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if it would not be better for the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to find some way whereby they might help 
     <lb/>
     this company out by sending in supplies and 
     <lb/>
     engage those men, enable them earn as much as 
     <lb/>
     $300,000 — unless of course this company is not 
     <lb/>
     reliable. I understand this company is composed 
     <lb/>
     of genuine, reliable, honest men of this country 
     <lb/>
     — no question about that — this company is in 
     <lb/>
     good circumstances, or would be but for the 
     <lb/>
     inconvertibility of sterling. I do not see why the 
     <lb/>
     government is not able to tide them over, let the 
     <lb/>
     company send in supplies and let the men earn an 
     <lb/>
     honest living rather than be humiliated by going 
     <lb/>
     on the dole as they will have to. Some may say 
     <lb/>
     that is not a matter for the Convention. That is not 
     <lb/>
     the way I see it. It is the job of the Convention to 
     <lb/>
     consider that there is another one of our industries 
     <lb/>
     not going well at this particular time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not want to be unkind, but it seems rather 
     <lb/>
     strange that the Economic Committee could 
     <lb/>
     write such an optimistic report when, while they 
     <lb/>
     were writing it, our most northerly industry was 
     <lb/>
     going into liquidation and our most southerly 
     <lb/>
     industry — the mining operation at St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     — has been closed during the summer for want 
     <lb/>
     of hydro-electric power. That is a thing which 
     <lb/>
     shows there is a very vital weakness in the 
     <lb/>
     economy and its inability to work up industries, 
     <lb/>
     the shortage of hydro-electric power. It is 
     <lb/>
     portrayed now in the bigger industries. Our most 
     <lb/>
     northerly industry is going into liquidation, there 
     <lb/>
     is our labour leader telling us that the camps are 
     <lb/>
     just about finished cutting, and we have been 
     <lb/>
     reminded that so many of our men rely upon that 
     <lb/>
     cut to tide them over; in view of these facts, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot but help thinking that the Committee 
     <lb/>
     should have shaded in a few dark outlines and 
     <lb/>
     shown the people that everything is not rosy and 
     <lb/>
     there are some discouraging things about it. 
     <lb/>
     There are some encouraging things about it too.

            <p>
     I am not a pessimist. There are a certain amount 
     <lb/>
     of encouraging things and given a fair amount of 
     <lb/>
     stability, these encouraging things are going to 
     <lb/>
     come to the forefront and make things a little 
     <lb/>
     more easy for our people. We have to go a long 
     <lb/>
     way to set up a standard of living as comfortable 
     <lb/>
     as we would want to enjoy life with. There has 
     <lb/>
     been a great deal of vying with one another as we 
     <lb/>
     have shouted about our great race of people; the 
     <lb/>
     great stock they came from... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fudge Better than the best. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Do not interrupt the speaker un<lb break="no"/>less you have a point of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry Better than the best. We have talked 
     <lb/>
     about their courage and dogged determination. I 
     <lb/>
     have experience enough to know, and I cannot 
     <lb/>
     close my eyes to the fact that this great stock of 
     <lb/>
     people have had to undergo some of the cruellest, 
     <lb/>
     gruelling experiences, hardships and privations 
     <lb/>
     during this generation, and I have seen the blush 
     <lb/>
     fading from their cheeks; I have seen the sparkle 
     <lb/>
     go from their eyes and I have seen them reduced 
     <lb/>
     to discouragement and despair, and they cannot 
     <lb/>
     go much further; a certain percentage of our 
     <lb/>
     people have had just about as much as they can 
     <lb/>
     stand and still maintain their dogged determina<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have great faith in the future. I really believe 
     <lb/>
     we have seen the worst, given a fair amount of 
     <lb/>
     world stability. But it is no use for us to paint a 
     <lb/>
     bright, glowing picture and think we are doing 
     <lb/>
     justice to the people. Those of us who would like 
     <lb/>
     to see a few shady lines in this picture are not 
     <lb/>
     unpatriotic. We are not backing down on the 
     <lb/>
     people just because we are trying to see the thing 
     <lb/>
     in its real state — the realities as they exist today 
     <lb/>
     and the prospects we have for the future. I have 
     <lb/>
     figures which I could give you to tell you what 
     <lb/>
     happened even last year in my own district, of the 
     <lb/>
     amount of privation and need that existed: 641 
     <lb/>
     individuals receiving dole last winter, and that 
     <lb/>
     did not include the Indians, 300 of them, most of 
     <lb/>
     them were on dole rations last year. Somewhere 
     <lb/>
     around 900 people receiving dole out of a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 5,500, one out of every six. From some 
     <lb/>
     places men could get to Three Rapids Estate and 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador Development,<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> so we can imagine 
     <lb/>
     the very much more concentrated privation and 
     <lb/>
     hunger there were in other places, and from what 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            

     I can gather, things are even worse. You would 
     <lb/>
     have to go back into the worst dole days to find

            <p>Mr. Chairman I am sorry to interrupt you, Rev.

     <lb/>o'clock, when I shall be glad to hear you continue 
     <lb/>your address. Before doing so, I direct your atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the following letter:

            <p>
     Mr. Burry Mr. Chairman, when the session 
     <lb/>
     closed this afternoon I was about to observe that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention is very anxious to have its work 
     <lb/>
     completed and I am in sympathy with that. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to have it over as quickly as possible. 
     <lb/>
     But I am wondering if fate has not had some hand 
     <lb/>
     in delaying this Economic Report. Perhaps if we 
     <lb/>
     had had it last fall or spring we would not see the 
     <lb/>
     true position of the country as we see it at the 
     <lb/>
     present time.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was about to say also, that in treating this 
     <lb/>
     subject in a bright and cheerful way, we are not 
     <lb/>
     treating the people of this country fairly. We have 
     <lb/>
     to recognise the struggle that they have had in the 
     <lb/>
     past and the struggles that they are bound to have 
     <lb/>
     in the immediate future. I do not want to be too 
     <lb/>
     pessimistic. I do not want to dwell upon this too 
     <lb/>
     much; but the other side of it has been given such 
     <lb/>
     importance that I feel someone should show that 
     <lb/>
     not every side of our life and economy is as bright 
     <lb/>
     as some would have us think. It was pointed out 
     <lb/>
     here the other day, in all seriousness, that 90% of 
     <lb/>
     our people own their own homes. That fact was 
     <lb/>
     taken from the census and is an interesting fact. 
     <lb/>
     But that does not tell the whole story. We know 
     <lb/>
            
   
<note xml:id="fn_05">1 Three Rapids Estate and the Labrador Development Company were small timber companies operating in 
     <lb/>
    Labrador.</note>

     perfectly well that 90% of these homes are not 
     <lb/>
     equipped with the conveniences and comforts 
     <lb/>
     that people of this age and generation have come 
     <lb/>
     to expect. A great number of these homes are not 
     <lb/>
     equipped with furniture that might be described 
     <lb/>
     as the chesterfield suite, on which the breadwin<lb break="no"/>ner might be able to recline at the end of the day 
     <lb/>
     to rest his weary bones, or even on a Sunday 
     <lb/>
     afternoon. A lot of the furniture are hard-backed 
     <lb/>
     chairs, home-made couches; not only that, the 
     <lb/>
     kitchen range is still the Waterloo stove in a lot 
     <lb/>
     of them. I could take members of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     to homes where there are not even hard-backed 
     <lb/>
     chairs, but packing cases to sit on, and where 
     <lb/>
     stoves are still strung together with wire and 
     <lb/>
     sometimes local cement or mud. These are iso<lb break="no"/>lated cases perhaps, but yet they are cases we 
     <lb/>
     have to recognise. It was also said that even if our 
     <lb/>
     people do not make very much money, they do 
     <lb/>
     not need as much money as other people — they 
     <lb/>
     are able to get their own fuel by their own labour. 
     <lb/>
     That was true in my day, in our childhood days 
     <lb/>
     perhaps. But it is not true in larger sections of our 
     <lb/>
     country, unless the man is willing to take a haul<lb break="no"/>ing rope on his back when the early snow comes 
     <lb/>
     in the fall and use it throughout the long winter 
     <lb/>
     months; then he might be able to do it, by hauling 
     <lb/>
     wood from long distances. There are very few 
     <lb/>
     places where firewood can be obtained without 
     <lb/>
     putting in the whole winter, and I am sure we are 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to have our people do that and say 
     <lb/>
     it is the justified and right thing for them to 
     <lb/>
     expect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not want to take up any more time on this 
     <lb/>
     debate. There are several things in the report I 
     <lb/>
     would like to call attention to, but the time is 
     <lb/>
     rapidly going. I would like to know where they 
     <lb/>
     get their authority for some of the things that they 
     <lb/>
     have quoted here, especially the picture they have 
     <lb/>
     built up with respect to the Labrador Mining and 
     <lb/>
     Exploration Company's work in Labrador and its 
     <lb/>
     possibilities for the future. I have always had an 
     <lb/>
     optimistic view of that future, but they have 
     <lb/>
     outdone me in my optimism. I wonder where they 
     <lb/>
     get some of the figures when they give this in<lb break="no"/>flated picture. It seems to me it is a proposition 
     <lb/>
     of great magnitude and we certainly hope it will 
     <lb/>
     mean a lot to the economy of this country and to 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. I wonder what they mean when they 
     <lb/>
     say, "Upwards of 10,000 Newfoundlanders and 
     <lb/>
     Labradorians will be able to find employment in 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
            
     the production of iron ore".... It seems rather 
     <lb/>
     optimistic for them to say, "It further means, that 
     <lb/>
     the great Grand Falls water-power will finally be 
     <lb/>
     developed and from statistics shown by a survey 
     <lb/>
     conducted a few years ago by the Aluminum 
     <lb/>
     Company of Canada, it is estimated that this 
     <lb/>
     waterpower when developed will produce some<lb break="no"/>where in the vicinity of one and one-half million 
     <lb/>
     horsepower." They are very optimistic, it seems 
     <lb/>
     to me, in saying that this water-power will be 
     <lb/>
     developed. I have not found anything to en<lb break="no"/>courage me to think that this water-power is 
     <lb/>
     going to be developed by this company.... The 
     <lb/>
     impression I have received from people in 
     <lb/>
     authority is that it is very doubtful yet; no con<lb break="no"/>clusion has been arrived at to lead anyone to 
     <lb/>
     believe this water-power will be tapped at all. It 
     <lb/>
     is a gigantic undertaking and if power for this job 
     <lb/>
     can be obtained at less expense, it will not be 
     <lb/>
     tapped at all. The Committee says it will be 
     <lb/>
     tapped. They say it will be 1.5 million horse<lb break="no"/>power when it is tapped. As I recall it the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee gives the estimate of 1.16 million 
     <lb/>
     horsepower. Of course it is true that the Mining 
     <lb/>
     Committee did point out that if the waters of 
     <lb/>
     Michikamau Lake flowing into the Hamilton 
     <lb/>
     River were tapped, 20% would be added. Since 
     <lb/>
     it is doubtful that the falls will be tapped, it is 
     <lb/>
     optimistic to say 1.5 million horsepower will be 
     <lb/>
     developed — used in the production of iron ore 
     <lb/>
     and exportation of power to the Quebec area. 
     <lb/>
   
            </p>
            <p>There is just one other thing I would like to 
     <lb/>say. As far as this country's being self-supporting 
     <lb/>is concerned, I am not in a position to admit that 
     <lb/>because the Secretary of State for Common<lb break="no"/>wealth Affairs makes a bare statement that we 
     <lb/>are self-supporting; or because a former Com<lb break="no"/>missioner for Finance also makes the bare 
     <lb/>statement, without any qualification; and be<lb break="no"/>cause the majority of the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>makes the same statement.... I am not able to 
     <lb/>accept that and many other things; it seems to be 
     <lb/>an inflated opinion of the economy. I do not feel 
     <lb/>justified in supporting the passage of this report 
     <lb/>through the House at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Ashbourne The time has come at last to 
     <lb/>consider and discuss the economic position of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. I was sent here as an elected 
     <lb/>member, elected by one of the outports of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, with a duty to perform. I find in the 
     <lb/>terms of reference ... that our duty is three-fold or 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="757"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0757.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">757</fw>
          
     perhaps four-fold. Firstly, to consider and dis<lb break="no"/>cuss. Secondly, to examine the position of the 
     <lb/>
     country. Thirdly, to make recommendations. We 
     <lb/>
     have been considering the changes that have 
     <lb/>
     taken place in Newfoundland since 1934 and we 
     <lb/>
     have entered into considerable discussion. I 
     <lb/>
     think, in view of what has been said by members, 
     <lb/>
     that there is little need for me to say much more 
     <lb/>
     on the economic situation, but yet I consider that 
     <lb/>
     perhaps my time might be well spent in referring 
     <lb/>
     to the reports which have been presented and in 
     <lb/>
     giving my ideas on them. I shall try to do this in 
     <lb/>
     the shortest possible time, but I would like the 
     <lb/>
     indulgence of the members of this House because 
     <lb/>
     I have no definite prepared speech.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....In discussing the economic position, which 
     <lb/>
     is the backbone and lifeblood of our national life, 
     <lb/>
     I would like to refer to two reports — the report 
     <lb/>
     of Chadwick and Jones,<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> which was distributed 
     <lb/>
     to us before the Convention met, and the Report 
     <lb/>
     of the Finance Committee.<ref target="#fn_07">[2]</ref> The former report is 
     <lb/>
     a comprehensive survey and I think it would have 
     <lb/>
     been greatly to our advantage if instead of going 
     <lb/>
     out and making another Economic Report, we 
     <lb/>
     had accepted this Chadwick-Jones Report and 
     <lb/>
     had debated it. It contains 15 tables, and while it 
     <lb/>
     was prepared before the Convention met, we 
     <lb/>
     could have these tables brought up to date by the 
     <lb/>
     government. That is the least we could expect of 
     <lb/>
     them. Perhaps, seeing that we are in the closing 
     <lb/>
     hours of the Convention now, that might be over<lb break="no"/>looked. But anyone who has considered and 
     <lb/>
     studied this white paper has been struck with 
     <lb/>
     its comprehensiveness. It is a factual report and 
     <lb/>
     contains a considerable amount of information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Regarding the Economic Report of the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee and also the Finance Report, 
     <lb/>
     I consider these reports have good points in them, 
     <lb/>
     but as far as I am concerned the Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     is not broad enough in its scope. I consider it a 
     <lb/>
     little too budgetary.... It seems to me we should 
     <lb/>
     keep in mind the fact we are not a government, 
     <lb/>
     but elected representatives sent here to do the job 
     <lb/>
     according to well defined terms of reference. We 
     <lb/>
     have the past to guide us. We are told history 
     <lb/>
     repeats itself. We all know we are living in a 
     <lb/>
     changing world. We are getting newer ideas. The 
     <lb/>
     age we live in, with aeroplanes, radios, cars, 
     <lb/>
     trucks, travel, motorboats and all the other inven<lb break="no"/><cb/>tions of our age, have all played their part in 
     <lb/>
     adding to the changing order. As far as I can see, 
     <lb/>
     the term "foreseeable future" has about it a sort 
     <lb/>
     of unreality which is unconvincing.... I do not 
     <lb/>
     know whether we were sent here to see what the 
     <lb/>
     future of Newfoundland is going to be. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think we were. I think we were sent here to assess 
     <lb/>
     and examine — that is the present tense — the 
     <lb/>
     country as we find it today. Who knows the 
     <lb/>
     future? God alone knows it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are several matters I would like to speak 
     <lb/>
     about in this report. The need of a good standard 
     <lb/>
     of living for our people is an essential, a great 
     <lb/>
     essential. We want taxation lifted from the neces<lb break="no"/>sities of life, and I would not want to be a part in 
     <lb/>
     the future, or even in the present, of a government 
     <lb/>
     which would seek to extract $17 million in duties 
     <lb/>
     from 300,000 people. There should be a great 
     <lb/>
     revision of the tariffs. I think it was about a year 
     <lb/>
     ago that the government made some reductions 
     <lb/>
     in the tariff, and I hope it will not be very long 
     <lb/>
     before we have further reductions, so that it will 
     <lb/>
     in some way try and offset the rise in the cost of 
     <lb/>
     living which must be a source of deep concern to 
     <lb/>
     our people. We know it is. I speak as one from 
     <lb/>
     the outports, rubbing shoulder to shoulder with 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen, for in our section people depend 
     <lb/>
     practically wholly upon the fisheries. There are 
     <lb/>
     some people who augment their earnings with the 
     <lb/>
     amount they earn from the lumberwoods. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure these people are anxiously awaiting the day 
     <lb/>
     when this great amount, I think it was $20 million 
     <lb/>
     last year, will be considerably lifted from their 
     <lb/>
     shoulders. We have heard recently about the re<lb break="no"/>quest of the dairymen for an increase in milk. The 
     <lb/>
     fact that there is $4.75 a ton placed on imported 
     <lb/>
     hay is excessive. I see no reason whatsoever why 
     <lb/>
     the government could not reduce or remove al<lb break="no"/>together the duty on hay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We know that people are wondering when the 
     <lb/>
     economic recession is going to get an impetus 
     <lb/>
     such as the World War brought along. Those of 
     <lb/>
     us who went through the experience after World 
     <lb/>
     War I, and knew the collapse of firms as a result 
     <lb/>
     of the drop in price of fish, wonder today when 
     <lb/>
     this recession is going to strike us again. Per<lb break="no"/>sonally, I do not think there will be such a drop 
     <lb/>
     in price as was experienced at that time. I think 
     <lb/>
     the demand for proteins, just the same as the 
     <lb/>

     demand for oils and fats, will help considerably 
     <lb/>
     to stabilise prices. But we must not forget, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that we are absolutely impotent and 
     <lb/>
     powerless to say what we are going to get for the 
     <lb/>
     fish and other commodities which we export, 
     <lb/>
     particularly to countries which have been devas<lb break="no"/>tated by war and whose populations are living a 
     <lb/>
     little bit above the verge of starvation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We also know of the inflationary processes 
     <lb/>
     which are at work, which have been controlled to 
     <lb/>
     a certain extent by rationing and by rigid govern<lb break="no"/>ment control. These forces of inflation are forces 
     <lb/>
     over which we have very little control; and we 
     <lb/>
     find that there is a tendency for these things to 
     <lb/>
     encroach upon our economy. Not only are these 
     <lb/>
     controls being exercised over foodstuffs, but also 
     <lb/>
     over foreign exchange, and that has a tendency to 
     <lb/>
     stagnate trade. When the time comes when goods 
     <lb/>
     will flow freely, then we know trade will prosper. 
     <lb/>
     Progress is limited by how much debt load the 
     <lb/>
     people can carry. I am not unmindful of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that when Newfoundland lost its credit, it lost its 
     <lb/>
     government. Governments depend upon money 
     <lb/>
     to finance them and governments have to extract 
     <lb/>
     certain amounts from the people in order to 
     <lb/>
     finance not only their ordinary expenditures, but 
     <lb/>
     also to provide as best they can for capital expen<lb break="no"/>ditures. When we consider the revenues and ex<lb break="no"/>penditures of the governments of the past, when 
     <lb/>
     we see the total revenue on the one side, I would 
     <lb/>
     like to see the total expenditure on the other side. 
     <lb/>
     How can I draw a fair picture, if I see a total on 
     <lb/>
     one side and do not see a total on the other side? 
     <lb/>
     That is why it is rather difficult for a layman to 
     <lb/>
     understand the intricacies of government 
     <lb/>
     finance.... That is one thing I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin. Having given us the total revenue, 
     <lb/>
     could he give us the total expenditure? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin In recent years the budget speeches 
     <lb/>
     included capital expenditure as well as ordinary 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. It is difficult to segregate them. It 
     <lb/>
     would have taken considerable time if we had. In 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Report we did our best to separate the 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditure from the ordinary expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. In the Economic Report we have attempted 
     <lb/>
     to point out that we consider $25 million to be the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary expenditure, to pay the ordinary expen<lb break="no"/>ses of the country; anything over and above that 
     <lb/>
     would be capital expenditure. Is that what you 
     <lb/>
     want to know? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Ashbourne I thank the Major for that. I see 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     here in the Finance Report that the total revenues 
     <lb/>
     from 1897- 1947 were $496 million while expen<lb break="no"/>ditures for the same years were approximately 
     <lb/>
     $500 million. What are the total expenditures? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Cashin I cannot tell you offhand. I will 
     <lb/>check up.... Since Commission of Government 
     <lb/>came they have included in their total expendi<lb break="no"/>tures all capital expenditures as well as ordinary 
     <lb/>expenditures. For the period of the last 12 or 13 
     <lb/>years, particularly during the last five or six 
     <lb/>years, they spent a considerable amount in addi<lb break="no"/>tion to the ordinary administration of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They have spent, so far as we could tell 
     <lb/>from the accounts, approximately $20 million, 
     <lb/>probably more, on capital or construction or spe<lb break="no"/>cial expenditures. You will find it in the estimates 
     <lb/>for each year. You will find estimates for expen<lb break="no"/>ditures have always been exceeded, as well as 
     <lb/>estimates of revenue. In 1946-47 they budgeted 
     <lb/>for $30 million in revenues, and the revenues 
     <lb/>went up to $34-37 million. They also budgeted 
     <lb/>for expenditures of $34 million. When the ac<lb break="no"/>counts were wound up, we find the expenditures 
     <lb/>were $37 million. So while the revenues have 
     <lb/>increased, the expenditures have increased 
     <lb/>proportionately each year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman Is it fair that the chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee has to give an accurate 
     <lb/>
     forecast for years to come? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman That is up to the chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee. If you have a point of order, state it. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Jackman My point of order is, no man here 
     <lb/>has a crystal ball. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman That is an expression of opinion, 
     <lb/>
     not a point of order. I must ask you to resume your 
     <lb/>
     seat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Ashbourne I am speaking about the 50 
     <lb/>
     years past, not the future. I am glad we can look 
     <lb/>
     forward with a certain amount of assurance to our 
     <lb/>
     exports keeping up in value. We realise that as 
     <lb/>
     far as the fisheries are concerned, the marketing 
     <lb/>
     end is being looked after far differently from 
     <lb/>
     what happened after World War I, when cut<lb break="no"/>throat competition and poor marketing resulted 
     <lb/>
     in great loss to this country. When the exports of 
     <lb/>
     a country drop, we know very well that a govern<lb break="no"/>ment is hard put to it sometimes to augment the 
     <lb/>
     money which comes in, by having to find loans 
     <lb/>
     and make capital expenditures and that, to my 
     <lb/>
     mind, has been the cause of a big increase in our 
     <lb/>
     national debt.... I realise that since 1934 we have 
     <lb/>
      
            <pb n="759"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0759.jpg"/>

     been fortunate in having a reduction of our inter<lb break="no"/>est rates. This was brought about by our friends 
     <lb/>
     across the water taking over or guaranteeing our 
     <lb/>
     debt with a saving, I believe, of about $2 million. 
     <lb/>
     I sincerely hope the time is gone forever when the 
     <lb/>
     people have to pay interest on loans raised by the 
     <lb/>
     government to keep the country going. It is the 
     <lb/>
     bondholders who get the benefit, and the tax 
     <lb/>
     payers have to pay the piper. Should we be in the 
     <lb/>
     position to float a large government loan in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, then the interest would be coming in 
     <lb/>
     to our own people; not to people outside the 
     <lb/>
     country, but to Newfoundlanders themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I notice that the Economic Report does not 
     <lb/>
     mention the serious Labrador fishery. The failure 
     <lb/>
     of that fishery will bear hardly upon quite a few 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fishermen this year. This is an 
     <lb/>
     important industry, the Labrador fishery. It has 
     <lb/>
     been said ... that it is uneconomic. I do not hold 
     <lb/>
     that view. No matter what fishery you have, there 
     <lb/>
     will be years when there are plenty of fish and 
     <lb/>
     there will be hard, lean years as well. Unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately we have not been able to work out yet a 
     <lb/>
     plan whereby in years of plenty the surplus would 
     <lb/>
     be able to take care of the lean years. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that the time will have to come when either 
     <lb/>
     through social legislation or some scheme ... 
     <lb/>
     some plan will have to be evolved whereby the 
     <lb/>
     decline of the fishery with its consequent 
     <lb/>
     hardship upon those who are engaged at the time, 
     <lb/>
     would have to be worked out for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the people concerned and also for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the country. I do not know how the government 
     <lb/>
     would go about it — probably the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Board might have some ideas. I feel that some<lb break="no"/>thing special should be done this year for the 
     <lb/>
     people who have come back from the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     without their usual voyages.... Clearly, if our 
     <lb/>
     economy is going to be built on solid foundations, 
     <lb/>
     some such plan should be evolved to take care of 
     <lb/>
     years such as this year. These men do not want 
     <lb/>
     dole. They do not want relief. I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     report speaks very much about relief, but I am 
     <lb/>
     informed that in September month in the city of 
     <lb/>
     St. John's, 314 families got relief at a cost of 
     <lb/>
     $7,873; in the outports, 401 families at a cost of 
     <lb/>
     $1,102. That was in September. I feel sure that 
     <lb/>
     there are sections that probably very soon will 
     <lb/>
     need some relief. My idea would be to work out 
     <lb/>
     a plan different from giving relief — something 
     <lb/>
     so that these men would be able to provide them<lb break="no"/><cb/>selves not only with the necessities of life for the 
     <lb/>
     winter, but also perhaps be able to provide them<lb break="no"/>selves with twine and other essential necessities, 
     <lb/>
     so that their fishery could be carried on next year 
     <lb/>
     in the accustomed fashion. It is to the producers 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland that we as a country must look. 
     <lb/>
     These are the men who wrest from the sea and 
     <lb/>
     from the forest and from the land, the wealth of 
     <lb/>
     land and sea, and with the surplus that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has in hand today, I think they might well 
     <lb/>
     provide a fund to look after these people.... I am 
     <lb/>
     sure that any money spent in helping these people 
     <lb/>
     would be money well spent. With the surplus the 
     <lb/>
     government has on hand a considerable easing of 
     <lb/>
     taxation should be given and, as I said before, this 
     <lb/>
     would offset the rise in the cost of living. I speak 
     <lb/>
     as a representative of the outports, and our stand<lb break="no"/>ards of living in the outports are different from 
     <lb/>
     the standards in St. John's. I know we cannot 
     <lb/>
     expect all the amenities of city life, but there are 
     <lb/>
     so many things in the outports that people have 
     <lb/>
     to do without, that we see, or think we see, a great 
     <lb/>
     difference between the two — between the out<lb break="no"/>ports and the city. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people, who are today being taxed to 
     <lb/>
     provide the revenues, are asking when relief from 
     <lb/>
     taxation will be forthcoming.... What is the use 
     <lb/>
     of piling up huge surpluses, while the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has to give out relief? We want to know 
     <lb/>
     where the people of Newfoundland, who are the 
     <lb/>
     producers, where they are going to balance their 
     <lb/>
     budgets. It is all very well to say the government 
     <lb/>
     should balance its budget. If the government does 
     <lb/>
     not balance its budget it has to resort to loans, but 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary John Citizen has a budget to balance, 
     <lb/>
     and his budget is balanced by his expenditure 
     <lb/>
     meeting his income.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Though dependent on the fisheries, we are 
     <lb/>
     also dependent upon the forests and other 
     <lb/>
     natural assets and resources. The question arises 
     <lb/>
     as to where we are going to get the capital to 
     <lb/>
     develop our natural resources. If we do not have 
     <lb/>
     the capital here, we must try to get it outside, and 
     <lb/>
     in the past we have depended very much upon the 
     <lb/>
     scientific experience of outsiders, to come in and 
     <lb/>
     help develop our resources. By our dependence 
     <lb/>
     upon these people we have built up paper-making 
     <lb/>
     and other resources, and I am glad to see today 
     <lb/>
     our own men are being trained, so much so that 
     <lb/>
     our dependence on outside scientific experts will 
     <lb/>
     be greatly lessened, and that will be to our ad<lb break="no"/><pb n="760"

            <fw type="num">760</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>vantage. While we have to import labour and 
     <lb/>
     management to help run our big industries we are 
     <lb/>
     not giving our own people the money returns that 
     <lb/>
     these outside people are getting.

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Ashbourne I was speaking about the capi<lb break="no"/>tal necessary to help develop our industries, and 
     <lb/>
     about the scientific experience we needed for our 
     <lb/>
     men. I thought about mentioning the fact that we 
     <lb/>
     were going to have a technical college or institute 
     <lb/>
     as a result of the extension of the men's vocation<lb break="no"/>al training scheme which will be, I hope, avail<lb break="no"/>able in the future for any young men who wish to 
     <lb/>
     get some training and experience to equip them 
     <lb/>
     to take up these necessary occupations. We have 
     <lb/>
     natural resources to develop, but our lack of 
     <lb/>
     available capital, I am afraid, may interfere with 
     <lb/>
     their development, which will perhaps react upon 
     <lb/>
     our ability to take full advantage of our maritime 
     <lb/>
     position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As regards the matter of a mercantile marine 
     <lb/>
     mentioned in the report, l think we have in the 
     <lb/>
     past lost quite a bit of money, which might have 
     <lb/>
     gone into our economy, by not having such a 
     <lb/>
     fleet, but on the other hand we are a small 
     <lb/>
     country, and we cannot be reasonably expected 
     <lb/>
     to provide services as if we had a population 
     <lb/>
     twice or three times the size. I believe we are 
     <lb/>
     underpopulated and our present transportation 
     <lb/>
     system and highroads could serve a far greater 
     <lb/>
     number of people. We are a small country, but 
     <lb/>
     yet it seems that we cannot provide full employ<lb break="no"/>ment for all of our people even at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     Surely this problem should not defy solution. If 
     <lb/>
     we are to survive, this should command the 
     <lb/>
     earnest consideration of all of us. We want full 
     <lb/>
     employment in order to realise full production. 
     <lb/>
     Our main sources of wealth come from the land 
     <lb/>
     and the sea. We have to study the problem of 
     <lb/>
     production as well as the problem of distribution; 
     <lb/>
     and while we want to try and get the maximum 
     <lb/>
     production, we also want to try and provide full 
     <lb/>
     employment for our people, for these are com<lb break="no"/>plementary and both very important. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We hope that the world's complex distribution 
     <lb/>
     system will not break down. Our national 
     <lb/>
     economy needs to be kept at a maximum not only 
     <lb/>
     in times of war, but also in times of peace. We 
     <lb/>
     have been aided by scientific invention and re<lb break="no"/>search to harness many of the forces of nature and 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     thus have been able to procure greater wealth 
     <lb/>
     from the land and the sea. We are told that our 
     <lb/>
     power to produce wealth has increased thirty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fold in the past 50 years. But to bring production 
     <lb/>
     and distribution to an equilibrium is a compli<lb break="no"/>cated and extremely difficult problem. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What is our dollar worth today? It has been 
     <lb/>
     said here already that the current index, or 
     <lb/>
     yardstick, was a barrel of flour for a quintal of 
     <lb/>
     fish. Today a barrel of flour is $20. The fisher<lb break="no"/>man, who is the backbone of Newfoundland, has 
     <lb/>
     to get a barrel of flour a month, which means he 
     <lb/>
     needs $240 a year for one item of food — flour. 
     <lb/>
     The cost of living index continues to rise and the 
     <lb/>
     question, is when will it start to fall? People are 
     <lb/>
     looking with anxious hearts to the time when the 
     <lb/>
     cost of living will start to come down, for we 
     <lb/>
     cannot expect big prices for fish. The big prices 
     <lb/>
     we got during the war years will not continue. 
     <lb/>
     When Iceland, Norway and other fish-producing 
     <lb/>
     countries did not catch the fish, it was a matter 
     <lb/>
     practically of transportation for us — we could 
     <lb/>
     sell all the fish we could get providing we could 
     <lb/>
     get the transportation to carry it to the markets. 
     <lb/>
     When these countries get into full production, we 
     <lb/>
     shall not be able to get the prices for fish which 
     <lb/>
     we have been getting in the past. This whole 
     <lb/>
     problem of cost of living is a very, very important 
     <lb/>
     one and really enters into our economic picture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have spoken about the tariff. I do not want to 
     <lb/>
     belabour the question. I consider that in 1942 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland became technically self-support<lb break="no"/>ing and for five years now has been self-support<lb break="no"/>ing.... I believe we need a planned economy, not 
     <lb/>
     a hit-and-miss policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have heard just recently from the north of 
     <lb/>
     the storms which have ravaged our shores. We 
     <lb/>
     know that the fishermen have to meet the storms 
     <lb/>
     and stress of the sea and of life. We have been 
     <lb/>
     very sorry to hear of the destruction which has 
     <lb/>
     been caused by the high seas and by the loss to 
     <lb/>
     these men of their stages and gear and equipment 
     <lb/>
     which is vital and necessary. Our sympathy goes 
     <lb/>
     out to these men in their loss and I hope that 
     <lb/>
     something may be done to assist these men to 
     <lb/>
     recoup that loss, or to encourage them to build up 
     <lb/>
     their fishing gear and property. I hope and trust 
     <lb/>
     that the intense economic storms and depressions 
     <lb/>
     that have swept Newfoundland in the past will be 
     <lb/>
     a thing of the past.

<p>
     Mr. Banfield Mr. Chairman, I will not take up 
     <lb/>
     much of the Convention's time, but I feel that I 
     <lb/>
     should express my sentiments on this Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report. The report is so optimistic, and so many 
     <lb/>
     optimistic speeches have been made in praise of 
     <lb/>
     it, that a man may well hesitate before he dares 
     <lb/>
     to express a word of doubt about the rosy future 
     <lb/>
     that is held out before us. No man likes to be 
     <lb/>
     called a traitor to his native land, but at the same 
     <lb/>
     time I look upon it as my duty to speak of facts 
     <lb/>
     as I find them. It makes no difference whether 
     <lb/>
     these facts be bright or gloomy, they have to be 
     <lb/>
     expressed. The people do not expect us to hide 
     <lb/>
     unpleasant facts and concentrate on pleasant 
     <lb/>
     ones. They want to know the whole truth, and I 
     <lb/>
     do not feel that this report contains the whole 
     <lb/>
     truth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have recently read through all the budget 
     <lb/>
     speeches delivered in the House of Assembly 
     <lb/>
     between 1920 and 1932. Those were probably the 
     <lb/>
     worst years this country ever went through. We 
     <lb/>
     all know how our people suffered during those 
     <lb/>
     years. Yet in all those budget speeches not one 
     <lb/>
     word, not one single word, admitted that times 
     <lb/>
     were bad. They were all hopeful and optimistic. 
     <lb/>
     To read them you would never guess that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was in the depths of depression. 
     <lb/>
     Those speeches were only trying to fool the 
     <lb/>
     people. Now, I want to be fair. When I say that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has had more prosperity in the 
     <lb/>
     past half dozen years than ever before in our 
     <lb/>
     history, I am only saying what everybody knows. 
     <lb/>
     We <hi rendition="simple:italic">have</hi> experienced some prosperity these past 
     <lb/>
     few years, since the war broke out. So we did in 
     <lb/>
     the last war. But a year or two after the last war, 
     <lb/>
     hard times fell upon Newfoundland. Can 
     <lb/>
     anybody get up and tell me that the same thing 
     <lb/>
     cannot happen again? Is depression something 
     <lb/>
     that cannot happen to us in future? I think we 
     <lb/>
     would have a big job on our hands to persuade 
     <lb/>
     our fishermen that depression is out of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I cannot agree with this report when it tells 
     <lb/>
     us that our present degree of prosperity is due to 
     <lb/>
     anything but the war. I think it is very much due 
     <lb/>
     to the war, and our people know it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The report tells us that our fishery exports will 
     <lb/>
     be worth $25 million three years from now. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder how they know that? Suppose the figure 
     <lb/>
     is only $20 million, or even $15 million. After all, 
     <lb/>
     they were worth only $8 million just eight years 
     <lb/>
     ago. I don't suppose they'll fall that low again, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     but between $8 million and $25 million anything 
     <lb/>
     can happen. Fish has dropped before and it can 
     <lb/>
     drop again, in spite of the Finance Committee and 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report. Of course, we all hope that 
     <lb/>
     fish prices will stay up, but we are not justified in 
     <lb/>
     taking it for granted that they will stay up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to say a word to those who keep telling 
     <lb/>
     us how prosperous this country is today. I'm very 
     <lb/>
     much afraid that there are some amongst us who 
     <lb/>
     seem to know very little about some parts of this 
     <lb/>
     country. There are places in Newfoundland today 
     <lb/>
     where it is anything but prosperous. I will make 
     <lb/>
     you a prophecy right now, Mr. Chairman, and it 
     <lb/>
     is this, that this coming winter we will have more 
     <lb/>
     people on the dole than we have had at any time 
     <lb/>
     since the war broke out. Right in my native For<lb break="no"/>tune Bay the bright bloom has disappeared from 
     <lb/>
     our wartime prosperity. Many a family will be 
     <lb/>
     forced to take dole again in Fortune Bay this 
     <lb/>
     winter. And Fortune Bay is not the only part of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland where dole is lifting its ugly head 
     <lb/>
     again. With all the millions of money that poured 
     <lb/>
     into Newfoundland from the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Canada these past few years, some people had 
     <lb/>
     forgotten all about the dole — in fact some 
     <lb/>
     shortsighted people told us that we'd never see a 
     <lb/>
     poor day again. The way things are going in some 
     <lb/>
     parts of Newfoundland today, we're in for 
     <lb/>
     another period of dole unless something is done 
     <lb/>
     to stop it, something to make dole unnecessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The picture is not all black. The paper mills 
     <lb/>
     will prosper for the next two or three years. The 
     <lb/>
     mines also seem to be pretty safe for the next year 
     <lb/>
     or two or even longer. And some day down in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador we're going to have a big development 
     <lb/>
     in iron ore. It is satisfying to see these bright 
     <lb/>
     spots, but we must not make the great mistake of 
     <lb/>
     imagining that because these industries are 
     <lb/>
     prosperous now, and will probably be prosperous 
     <lb/>
     for the next few years, that everything else is 
     <lb/>
     prosperous and will be prosperous. And we must 
     <lb/>
     never forget that over half our population lives 
     <lb/>
     out of the fishery. There can be no true prosperity 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland without a prosperous fishery. 
     <lb/>
     That is something which we must never forget. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion, I want to say this: I am quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that our government is self-supporting 
     <lb/>
     today, but not so sure that our people are all 
     <lb/>
     self—supporting. I am satisfied that some of our 
     <lb/>
     main industries are prosperous and will stay 
     <lb/>
     prosperous for another while, but that our main 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="762"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0762.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">762</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
        
     industry, the fishery, already shows dangerous 
     <lb/>
     signs of slipping back. I am satisfied that most of 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity we now have is directly the result 
     <lb/>
     of the war, and that this prosperity is almost 
     <lb/>
     certain to die away when the full effects of this 
     <lb/>
     war die away. I am all in favour of facing the 
     <lb/>
     whole truth, and I'm quite sure that it's the whole 
     <lb/>
     truth our people want, and nothing less. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett If I am in order, sir, I would like to 
     <lb/>
     ask the last speaker if he expects or wants the 
     <lb/>
     people to accept a prophecy which he has just 
     <lb/>
     made about dole and about the dark days —  if he 
     <lb/>
     expects them to take that as the truth? He has said 
     <lb/>
     we are in for bad times — we may be. That is a 
     <lb/>
     prophecy, but is that the truth? Is that the truth he 
     <lb/>
     wants to spread around this country? I maintain 
     <lb/>
     it is only a prophecy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Except that there are two 
     <lb/>
     schools of thought. As I said before and I repeat, 
     <lb/>
     if it is the conviction of a member that — for 
     <lb/>
     instance, some people think Cabot should have 
     <lb/>
     been hanged instead of being paid ten pounds for 
     <lb/>
     discovering this island; that is merely a question 
     <lb/>
     of judgement upon which men might differ. I 
     <lb/>
     suppose he is entitled to enter into the realms of 
     <lb/>
     speculation or conjecture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett What I want to get at is this, that 
     <lb/>
     statement, does he expect people to regard that as 
     <lb/>
     truth or as his own personal opinion? I take it this 
     <lb/>
     report was based on facts; it is true they did make 
     <lb/>
     some prognostications as to the degree of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity for the next three years. We do not 
     <lb/>
     have to accept that. Mr. Banfield says the fishery 
     <lb/>
     is slipping down into the dole stage again, the 
     <lb/>
     woods industry is good only for another two or 
     <lb/>
     three years, in spite of the fact, in the considered 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the Economic Committee and in the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the people who are looking after the 
     <lb/>
     woods industry, it will be prosperous for the next 
     <lb/>
     ten years. Do we want the people to accept that 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report based on facts, or does Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Banfield want them to accept his opinion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman That is beyond my competency. 
     <lb/>
     It is his right to draw any inference or conclusion 
     <lb/>
     he desires. Whether or not he will be able to sell 
     <lb/>
     his ideas to the people next May or June, I am not 
     <lb/>
     going to make any pronouncement upon, for the 
     <lb/>
     obvious reason that I cannot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I have no intention of making 
     <lb/>
     any speech at this time on the debate now before 
     <lb/>
     the Chair. After leaving here at six o'clock today 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
           
     and picking up my mail, I found this letter which 
     <lb/>
     I think may help to throw some light on the 
     <lb/>
     present economic position of Newfoundland in at 
     <lb/>
     least one of its aspects. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman To what do you refer? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I was about to read a letter, the 
     <lb/>
     author of which is willing to have her name used. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Higgins I strongly object. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman If you do not mind, I have per<lb break="no"/>mitted a certain amount of latitude in this connec<lb break="no"/>tion. In fact I might very well and very properly 
     <lb/>
     be accused of permitting too much latitude. I 
     <lb/>
     want members to remember that the expression 
     <lb/>
     of outside opinion to them is one thing, and must 
     <lb/>
     not be confused with expressions of opinion by 
     <lb/>
     members on matters before the Chair, which is 
     <lb/>
     something entirely different. Therefore I have to 
     <lb/>
     state that I cannot concern myself with anything 
     <lb/>
     that happens outside the House and therefore I do 
     <lb/>
     not propose to allow expressions of opinion 
     <lb/>
     originating outside the House, in permanent form 
     <lb/>
     or otherwise, to have any bearing at all upon the 
     <lb/>
     deliberations of the House. The only thing with 
     <lb/>
     which I am concerned is to ensure that members 
     <lb/>
     shall observe the standing orders and regulations 
     <lb/>
     covering debates on matters which come before 
     <lb/>
     the Chair. Therefore, Mr. Smallwood, I am com<lb break="no"/>pelled to draw the line and make a general ruling: 
     <lb/>
     I will not be concerned with any expressions of 
     <lb/>
     opinion outside this House unless the document 
     <lb/>
     referred to is of an official nature, which is cal<lb break="no"/>culated to lay the foundation for the consideration 
     <lb/>
     of some matter which is before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I accept your ruling. This letter 
     <lb/>
     is not an expression of opinion. This is a letter 
     <lb/>
     which describes the condition of economic af<lb break="no"/>fairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins Point of order. That is not an offi<lb break="no"/>cial document as far as we are concerned. There<lb break="no"/>fore I object to anything being quoted from it. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood There was no such ruling ever 
     <lb/>made and I have not been out of this House ten 
     <lb/>minutes since the Convention started. Time and 
     <lb/>again members have quoted from documents 
     <lb/>which were not official. Mr. Hollett has just 
     <lb/>quoted from a book written by me... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins That is official. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Time and again documents 
     <lb/>
     have been quoted in this chamber which were not 
     <lb/>
     officially compiled. Here is a bit of first hand 
     <lb/>
     information from a part of this country describing 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="763"

     the economic condition of the people here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman My position is, I have only to 
     <lb/>
     concern myself with expressions of opinion by 
     <lb/>
     members on motions before the Chair. I am there<lb break="no"/>fore not concerned with expressions of opinion 
     <lb/>
     outside this chamber, from members of the public 
     <lb/>
     to members who comprise this National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. I am afraid, Mr. Smallwood, in consistency 
     <lb/>
     with the line of demarcation I have drawn, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot allow you to read the letter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I will not read the letter, but I 
     <lb/>
     shall proceed to give a description of the condi<lb break="no"/>tions as they exist on the island of St. Brendan's. 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Applause from the gallery]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman This is not a matter for applause. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
    Mr. Smallwood, would you please address your 
     <lb/>remarks to me and not play the gallery. If you 
     <lb/>want to express an opinion on St. Brendan's or 
     <lb/>on any part of the island, it is your right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins Providing it is based on facts. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman Not being inspired and therefore 
     <lb/>not knowing what is coming, I cannot make a 
     <lb/>pronouncement upon what is going to be said. It 
     <lb/>is Mr. Smallwood's right to express his opinion 
     <lb/>on any question pertaining to any section of the 
     <lb/>island covered by the Economic Report. With 
     <lb/>that in mind, you may proceed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood St. Brendan's Island is one of 
     <lb/>
     the largest islands on the coast of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     It is entirely a fishing settlement. The people do 
     <lb/>
     some inshore fishing, some Labrador fishing and 
     <lb/>
     some squid fishing. This year they were en<lb break="no"/>couraged at the outset to concentrate on the squid 
     <lb/>
     fishery. They were offered 35 cents a pound for 
     <lb/>
     dried squid, and many of them dropped every<lb break="no"/>thing else and went at the squid fishery. They did 
     <lb/>
     very well, but having caught and made the squid, 
     <lb/>
     they now find they cannot sell any of it whatever; 
     <lb/>
     that no buyer will take any of it; no shopkeeper 
     <lb/>
     will trade any food for it, and these people cannot 
     <lb/>
     get any food whatever for their squid. They are 
     <lb/>
     living, many of them, on the kindness of their 
     <lb/>
     neighbours. They have no food for the winter. 
     <lb/>
     There is now no flour in St Brendan's and the 
     <lb/>
     people are at their wits' end as to what they are 
     <lb/>
     going to do. They cannot get any labour; they 
     <lb/>
     cannot get work at Gander; they cannot get work 
     <lb/>
     in the lumberwoods; they cannot get it in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's; the fishery is over; the fish is useless to 
     <lb/>
     them; they have no food; they have no money, 
     <lb/>
     and yet these people are told it is a prosperous 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     country and that its future is assured. The people 
     <lb/>
     down there, as in many other places in the island 
     <lb/>
     today, are wondering what is going to happen; 
     <lb/>
     whether they will be driven back on the dole, the 
     <lb/>
     thought of which they hate, or whether work will 
     <lb/>
     be found for them; or whether some arrangement 
     <lb/>
     will be worked out whereby cash can be put up 
     <lb/>
     — if not cash, then food — for the productof their 
     <lb/>
     toil all through these summer and fall months. I 
     <lb/>
     have no intention of making a speech. I was not 
     <lb/>
     permitted to read a letter describing at first hand 
     <lb/>
     the economic conditions among these hardy and 
     <lb/>
     very fine people on the island of St. Brendan's. 
     <lb/>
     So I have given you a description of it and now 
     <lb/>
     the country knows it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Could I ask Mr. Smallwood the 
     <lb/>
     authority for that factual statement he has just 
     <lb/>
     made? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I will be happy to give the 
     <lb/>
     authority; it is Mrs. Ed White of the island of St. 
     <lb/>
     Brendan's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt ....I have listened attentively to the 
     <lb/>
     debate for the last four or five days, and whether 
     <lb/>
     this man is an optimist, whether this man is a 
     <lb/>
     pessimist, whether this man is a realist, and all the 
     <lb/>
     other words which can be so contentious; but I 
     <lb/>
     always ends up with the feeling, "So what"? 
     <lb/>
     Since we have been an island, our people have 
     <lb/>
     suffered. The millennium has not come for New<lb break="no"/>foundland any more than for any other country, 
     <lb/>
     and I beg leave to express my doubts on the future 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. I express my doubts on the 
     <lb/>
     future of UNO. I express my doubts on the wel<lb break="no"/>fare of the United Kingdom in the years to come. 
     <lb/>
     But what do I do? I sit down and think what I can 
     <lb/>
     do about it. I do not allow myself to get into the 
     <lb/>
     doldrums. I face up to the situation as I see it, 
     <lb/>
     hoping to God that I may be able to do something 
     <lb/>
     about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If I had written this Economic Report, the 
     <lb/>
     wording and the approach might have been some<lb break="no"/>what different; but in the end I should have 
     <lb/>
     wound up by agreeing with it substantially, and I 
     <lb/>
     would not think of myself as either an optimist or 
     <lb/>
     a pessimist in ending up that way. I would have 
     <lb/>
     looked at the terms of reference and found that 
     <lb/>
     what we are supposed to do is to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     changes that have taken place in the financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic situation of the island since 1934.... I 
     <lb/>
     would have asked myself, what was the position 
     <lb/>
     of the fishery in 1934 and what is its position 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="764"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0764.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">764</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
           

     today? And I would have looked at the problem 
     <lb/>
     in such a way as to estimate the chances for the 
     <lb/>
     future as far as the fishery is concerned I would 
     <lb/>
     have come to the conclusion that we are better 
     <lb/>
     organised today; prices are higher and are not 
     <lb/>
     likely to drop to where they were before, if the 
     <lb/>
     world keeps on a sound basis at all. I would have 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that there are a greater number 
     <lb/>
     employed directly in the fishery today than in 
     <lb/>
     1934 on a percentage basis. I would have pointed 
     <lb/>
     out that our fisheries are more diversified than 
     <lb/>
     they have ever been, and I would have ended up 
     <lb/>
     by realising that the people of the world, as well 
     <lb/>
     as in Newfoundland, are in need of food and I 
     <lb/>
     would have then said, "We have got to make that 
     <lb/>
     better; we have to organise it better still and we 
     <lb/>
     have to convey that food to the people who need 
     <lb/>
     it". I would have concluded, so far as we are 
     <lb/>
     concerned in 1947, that we are somewhat better 
     <lb/>
     off in the fisheries than we were in 1934. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would have looked at the forest resources - <lb/> as the Committee did — and I do not propose to 
     <lb/>
     spend much time on them. We know our resour<lb break="no"/>ces are very much more considerably developed 
     <lb/>
     that they were in 1934. The people concerned 
     <lb/>
     with that development are putting more of their 
     <lb/>
     capital in it because they have some faith in the 
     <lb/>
     future of that industry. We have therefore 
     <lb/>
     developed our timber resources to a greater ex<lb break="no"/>tent than ever before in the history of the country. 
     <lb/>
     I would say we have extraordinary market 
     <lb/>
     prospects. There may be a drop in prices when 
     <lb/>
     things get back to normal. You cannot take your 
     <lb/>
     resources and blast them out of the earth without 
     <lb/>
     paying in higher cost of foodstuffs and higher 
     <lb/>
     cost of living. If you take up any magazine from 
     <lb/>
     any country you will find that the high cost of 
     <lb/>
     living is worrying everyone, just as in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and will continue to worry us until we 
     <lb/>
     have worked out our stupidity as a world for 
     <lb/>
     causing such a war as in 1939. I would point out 
     <lb/>
     that as far as timber resources are concerned, that 
     <lb/>
     there are at least a number of people earning more 
     <lb/>
     wages than ever before in that industry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would take serious note, if I happened to be 
     <lb/>
     a government, of the position of the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, who have suffered. I would take note 
     <lb/>
     of the failure of the Labrador Development Com<lb break="no"/>pany to which Mr. Burry referred, and I would 
     <lb/>
     attempt to do something about it. I would not give 
     <lb/>
     the people the impression that because there are 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
      
     some cracks in our economy, our country is going 
     <lb/>
     to the dogs. That is the point about which I feel 
     <lb/>
     as keenly as any man, the suffering of our people, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not want to get into the condition of 
     <lb/>
     gloom where we will do nothing about it. As long 
     <lb/>
     as you have not got faith and hope, you have 
     <lb/>
     nothing. That is what I resent about the gloom all 
     <lb/>
     over the place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we take the mining industry, I would have 
     <lb/>
     said, as far as the ordinary workings are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, it is not much better off than in 1934. But 
     <lb/>
     I would have said, as the report says, the world 
     <lb/>
     needs our wealth. Therefore potentially we have 
     <lb/>
     market, if we have the vision and courage to go 
     <lb/>
     after it, and we will have extra earning power for 
     <lb/>
     our people in the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Agriculture — I would have shown the 
     <lb/>
     present position which is very little better than 
     <lb/>
     1934. But I would say, we have not given to 
     <lb/>
     agriculture the thought and sympathy that it 
     <lb/>
     should have had, consequently we suffered be<lb break="no"/>cause we have not had the production we 
     <lb/>
     should.... If we have the will and vision to go to 
     <lb/>
     work on the land, we can produce in the future 
     <lb/>
     ten millions, possibly more, even when prices 
     <lb/>
     have found their normal range. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think the Finance Committee was perfectly 
     <lb/>
     right in putting in the last part of its report this 
     <lb/>
     question of faith. You can call it faith or you can 
     <lb/>
     call it morale — and you would need to call it 
     <lb/>
     some other things in different circumstances — <lb/> the one thing you must have in the economy is 
     <lb/>
     faith, the will of the people. If you look at Alfred 
     <lb/>
     Marshall's first book, in it he gives a definition 
     <lb/>
     of economics — "the study of wealth on the one 
     <lb/>
     hand and the study of man on the other". In the 
     <lb/>
     study of political economy you must take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration the human element which is the 
     <lb/>
     will to push forward and do things. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I shall look at our financial and other 
     <lb/>
     resources. I shall refer and not too strongly, to the 
     <lb/>
     $70-80 million in the bank. It may be worth in 
     <lb/>
     real wealth only $25 million, according to what 
     <lb/>
     you can buy for it. It is a backlog. I would point 
     <lb/>
     out the increase in life insurance in this country. 
     <lb/>
     It is a backlog. It is worth something to us. In 
     <lb/>
     regard to the investments in securities, I raised 
     <lb/>
     that question with Major Cashin, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     he gave enough credence to that question. In my 
     <lb/>
     own work I find the amount in savings banks 
     <lb/>
     deposits and the amount in life insurance held is 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="765"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0765.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">765</fw>
           
     probably, from what I can judge, a very small part 
     <lb/>
     of our savings in comparison with the invest<lb break="no"/>ments in securities. I realise it is impossible to get 
     <lb/>
     it with any degree of accuracy; but because we 
     <lb/>
     cannot get it with any degree of accuracy, does 
     <lb/>
     not mean we cannot depend upon a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount there which can be used as collateral 
     <lb/>
     against loans raised to develop the country or 
     <lb/>
     used to bring in income, and it is doing it, year 
     <lb/>
     after year. I would have pointed out the better 
     <lb/>
     position of our capital assets throughout the 
     <lb/>
     country — our business premises, our barns, our 
     <lb/>
     homes and other equipment and I would have 
     <lb/>
     pointed out this — and this may be a strange thing 
     <lb/>
     to bring in an Economic Report — the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of the radio. Radio is not just a means of 
     <lb/>
     communication. If you can use your means of 
     <lb/>
     communication to further the enlightenment of 
     <lb/>
     the people, you have created an asset which is 
     <lb/>
     something you did not have before; just as you 
     <lb/>
     say our health and education are assets which 
     <lb/>
     ought to be brought into questions of political 
     <lb/>
     economy. I would point out something else which 
     <lb/>
     has helped our economy, that is the development 
     <lb/>
     of trade unions and the development of the co<lb break="no"/>operative movement. Not only on its financial 
     <lb/>
     and business side, but in the spirit which it is 
     <lb/>
     bringing about in our country and the education 
     <lb/>
     which it is doing. I would also add a word about 
     <lb/>
     the service industries to which nobody seemed to 
     <lb/>
     have paid much attention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In all, the conclusion reached from my point 
     <lb/>
     of view is that we are considerably better off than 
     <lb/>
     we were in normal times, and much better off 
     <lb/>
     than we were in 1934, the date given in our terms 
     <lb/>
     of reference. In saying that, I am well aware of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that if we look too far into the future, it 
     <lb/>
     may be that Newfoundland will strike hard times. 
     <lb/>
     The people of this country are not fools. They 
     <lb/>
     know that as well as I do. And when some people 
     <lb/>
     say they want the truth, they know it is the truth. 
     <lb/>
     They also want to know about our chances of the 
     <lb/>
     future. I think the Economic Report gives that 
     <lb/>
     very reasonably, although as Mr. Burry said, it 
     <lb/>
     might have had some shadows put in it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having done that, I would ask myself, "Is this 
     <lb/>
     economy of ours the result of the war?" I would 
     <lb/>
     say, "Yes, to a large extent". It is also the result 
     <lb/>
     of our having got back to our normal export 
     <lb/>
     position. I would add that when the war is over 
     <lb/>
     you go into a peace economy and it may be 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     entirely changed; because of what happened in 
     <lb/>
     the war, that peace economy may take a long time 
     <lb/>
     to settle back into the condition it was before the 
     <lb/>
     war started. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having done that I would enquire into the 
     <lb/>
     relationship of our economy with government 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. As I see it, and reducing it to its 
     <lb/>
     simplest terms, it is this: if a group of people have 
     <lb/>
     some way of producing wealth which is 
     <lb/>
     measured by money, they have two courses open 
     <lb/>
     to them. One (which is as old as the first fog) is 
     <lb/>
     for each individual man and family to do things 
     <lb/>
     for himself, like looking after his own sick, 
     <lb/>
     educating his own children, building his own 
     <lb/>
     roads and other things which have to be done in 
     <lb/>
     order to make existence possible. Or he might 
     <lb/>
     say, we have a lot of things in common — we 
     <lb/>
     have education, health, roads, protection of 
     <lb/>
     property and of persons, we have communica<lb break="no"/>tions. All these things we have in common. Now, 
     <lb/>
     out of this we can produce, either as individuals 
     <lb/>
     or as corporations, or co-operatives, we can 
     <lb/>
     produce a certain amount of wealth, which can be 
     <lb/>
     measured in money, out of which we take so 
     <lb/>
     much to give — not to some big ogre, as some 
     <lb/>
     people look upon the government, any govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but to ourselves — so that we can spend it 
     <lb/>
     on the things which we have in common, and 
     <lb/>
     relieve ourselves of the private and individual 
     <lb/>
     need of doing it. That is why I say it does not 
     <lb/>
     make much difference where you set the point of 
     <lb/>
     revenue and expenditure as long as you base it on 
     <lb/>
     your taxable capacity, or your own ability to 
     <lb/>
     produce that which allows people to live and pay 
     <lb/>
     for the things they have in common. In assessing 
     <lb/>
     our position in relation to 1934, I would state 
     <lb/>
     quite frankly one thing, I would say from 1920-33 
     <lb/>
     — what is commonly known as the "roaring 
     <lb/>
     twenties" — we in Newfoundland, in common 
     <lb/>
     with other countries in the world, went on a binge 
     <lb/>
     of extravagance; we built for ourselves overheads 
     <lb/>
     which we were not entitled to build up and for 
     <lb/>
     which we could not pay.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Looked at in one way, our public debt and its 
     <lb/>
     burden brought Newfoundland to her knees be<lb break="no"/>cause at the time we borrowed money we paid 
     <lb/>
     5% and 5½%, and I would point out today we 
     <lb/>
     have $80 million with interest payment halved, 
     <lb/>
     because we are now paying 3%, therefore we do 
     <lb/>
     not have to carry the burden of $2½ million 
     <lb/>
     which would have helped us considerably in the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="766"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-17_Page_0766.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">766</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
         
     years 1920-34. I would look at the cash surplus, 
     <lb/>
     say $30 million. Never before has our country 
     <lb/>
     been in a position where she has been able to have 
     <lb/>
     a nest egg. I would look at the accumulated 
     <lb/>
     surplus and the sinking fund which is set aside, 
     <lb/>
     and I would be forced to conclude, as the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee did, that as far as finance is concerned 
     <lb/>
     we have much better conditions than we had in 
     <lb/>
     1934. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would say also government plant in the form 
     <lb/>
     of school buildings, public buildings, bait depots, 
     <lb/>
     wharves, hospitals, the demonstration farm, post<lb break="no"/>al telegraphs and the railway are in much better 
     <lb/>
     shape than they were in 1934, and the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture on them will not have to be as great. But we 
     <lb/>
     have also increased our permanent government 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. What are our chances of maintain<lb break="no"/>ing and increasing our services? In view of the 
     <lb/>
     betterment, as I see it, of our economy, stimulated 
     <lb/>
     by war but projected into the future, it is my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that we have a reasonable chance of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining and increasing these services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to ask Major Cashin if, in the 
     <lb/>
     process of compiling the Economic Report, he 
     <lb/>
     had recourse to the memorandum from the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, and the first page on the 
     <lb/>
     Reconstruction and Development Scheme? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin I remember the document. In com<lb break="no"/>piling the report I did not even look at it. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think any member of the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     looked at it. It was received in here and it showed 
     <lb/>
     a programme of reconstruction for the next num<lb break="no"/>ber of years and there it ended. We did not even 
     <lb/>
     debate it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt I am glad you did not. This scheme in 
     <lb/>
     all amounts to $60 million over the next ten years 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     — the government put in $26 million to be car<lb break="no"/>ried out over a period of three years, and it made 
     <lb/>
     a tentative programme for the next seven years; 
     <lb/>
     each of the next seven years would average 
     <lb/>
     $4,700,000. I do not want anyone to say we 
     <lb/>
     would have revenue enough to meet current ex<lb break="no"/>penditure over these ten years, and this much 
     <lb/>
     money over afterwards; but I would say that 
     <lb/>
     we would be able to meet our expenditure — <lb/> balance our revenue and expenditure — and take 
     <lb/>
     care of something on behalf of reconstruction.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My point in bringing this up is to show that a 
     <lb/>
     party independent of the Finance Committee had 
     <lb/>
     the temerity to set down a plan for ten years. They 
     <lb/>
     have also done what I consider reasonable, and 
     <lb/>
     set a plan for three years. If you will refer to the 
     <lb/>
     estimates you will find in the first year they spent 
     <lb/>
     $10 million on reconstruction and they expect to 
     <lb/>
     spend next year $6.5 million, which is one of the 
     <lb/>
     years included in the Finance Committee's 
     <lb/>
     report. I do not want to be accused of having 
     <lb/>
     invoked the government programme to support 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee report in any way. But I 
     <lb/>
     do think it shows there is a reasonable expectancy 
     <lb/>
     in the years to come of meeting expenditures by 
     <lb/>
     the current revenues and providing something for 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to end up by saying that whatever 
     <lb/>
     your natural leanings, whether optimistic or pes<lb break="no"/>simistic, we have been down before; we are not 
     <lb/>
     very high now; we will probably be down again. 
     <lb/>
     When I was a boy my father used to say to me, 
     <lb/>
     "It is nothing against you to fall down flat, but to 
     <lb/>
     lie there, that is a disgrace".

     Report of the Finance Committee: Economic Report

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, I made a few remarks 
     <lb/>
     some days ago with regard to this Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, but feel that I should supplement them 
     <lb/>
     with a few additional remarks.... First of all, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to say that the gloomy and pessimistic 
     <lb/>
     viewpoints so courageously and sincerely ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by Messrs. Starkes, Vincent and Banfield 
     <lb/>
     have had the effect of slightly checking, but by 
     <lb/>
     no means obliterating my own optimistic view of 
     <lb/>
     the future. The gentlemen named have been in 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     closer touch with conditions which are not so 
     <lb/>
     readily available to us city delegates. I believe, 
     <lb/>
     and certainly hope, that their pessimism is not 
     <lb/>
     justified. I can understand that the closer contact 
     <lb/>
     they have had with those unfortunate people, who 
     <lb/>
     have had a bad experience this year in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the fishery, has led them to adopt their 
     <lb/>
     defeatist attitude, but the actual all-round facts do 
     <lb/>
     not warrant the conclusions they have adopted. 
     <lb/>
     Their reference to lack of work in the woods, 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
