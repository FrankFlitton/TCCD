<!--<p>
     are all sorts of fish. Personally, I am an optimist 
     <lb/>
     more than a pessimist. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> After listening to Mr. Smallwood I 
     <lb/>
     was wondering just how countries like Portugal, 
     <lb/>
     Spain and France can compete with us over here. 
     <lb/>
     I can see how it can be done. We have no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Crosbie says, a competitor in Norway as 
     <lb/>
     far as codfish is concerned. Iceland has never 
     <lb/>
     been a competitor. I cannot see how even Spain 
     <lb/>
     and Portugal are going to feed the people, let 
     <lb/>
     alone feed their own.... In 1909, 1907, 1908 and 
     <lb/>
     1911 we could buy more for a dollar than we do 
     <lb/>
     today. We should be concerned with what we will 
     <lb/>
     be able to buy with what we produce. Take the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman today, he is in one of the worst places 
     <lb/>
     he has ever been in in the history of the shore 
     <lb/>
     fishery. The men of my district, on the shore 
     <lb/>
     fishery, their average earnings are $325; out of 
     <lb/>
     that they had to come home and feed their 
     <lb/>
     families — flour $18 a barrel. How much better 
     <lb/>
     off they were if they caught 50 quintals in 1929, 
     <lb/>
     than the men who catch 50 quintals today. He was 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     five times better off then. If the price of producing 
     <lb/>
     fish comes down, then let the prices come down. 
     <lb/>
     If it was not for the woods and land, you would 
     <lb/>
     have more men on the dole than in 1930. That is 
     <lb/>
     our shore fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I feel the Committee has made a 
     <lb/>
     fairly conservative estimate of what things to 
     <lb/>
     come are going to amount to as far as fish is 
     <lb/>
     concemed.... I admire Mr. Crosbie's optimism I 
     <lb/>
     feel quite sure that it will not go back more than 
     <lb/>
     half.... I cannot agree with Mr. Smallwood that 
     <lb/>
     the Committee overestimated on any false basis 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever.... Looking at the figures, I am sure 
     <lb/>
     the Committee which brought in this excellent 
     <lb/>
     report has not falsely estimated. Nobody can 
     <lb/>
     make an exact estimate. It must be tantamount to 
     <lb/>
     a guess, although I am sure it is not a guess. I 
     <lb/>
     entirely agree with the conclusions the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee has come to.

     <lb/>government expenditure on fisheries research, it 
     <lb/>shows for 1945-46 there was $12,000 less a 
     <lb/>refund from the Canadian treasury of $4,100, but 
     <lb/>in 1946-47 there is no refund of a similar nature. 
     <lb/>I was wondering if the convenor could tell us

     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> The figures for 1946-47 run only

     Dear Sir:

            <p>
     On hearing your broadcast over VONF, 
     <lb/>
     which we admire very much and listen to at 
     <lb/>
     every opportunity, I was asked by the people 
     <lb/>
     of Lamaline to write to you and ask you to 
     <lb/>
     ask the question at the Convention if anyone 
     <lb/>
     knows how much merchantable codfish is 
     <lb/>
     exported from Newfoundland. We sell

     thousands of quintals of codfish here in 
     <lb/>
     Lamaline, and we never get one merchant<lb break="no"/>able fish. I don't know one man that ever got 
     <lb/>
     a merchantable codfish, so we would like to 
     <lb/>
     know if there is such a thing as a merchant<lb break="no"/>able codfish. We salt and dry and wash our 
     <lb/>
     fish, and we make our fish. We made better 
     <lb/>
     fish last summer than for years past, but we 
     <lb/>
     never got one merchantable fish. Now the 
     <lb/>
     people are very anxious to know if there is 
     <lb/>
     such a thing as a merchantable codfish, and 
     <lb/>
     we thought you would be the right man to 
     <lb/>
     find out and let us know, either over the air 
     <lb/>
     or by letter.

            <p>
     We hear over the radio that you speak too

     loud, but the louder you speak the better we 
     <lb/>
     like it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do hope we will get a better cull on our 
     <lb/>
     fish next year than Madeira or West Indies. 
     <lb/>
     Of course if there is no such thing as a mer<lb break="no"/>chantable fish we would like to know it, but 
     <lb/>
     please don't mention my name, but I would 
     <lb/>
     like to know if there is such a thing as mer<lb break="no"/>chantable codfish, because I think it is right 
     <lb/>
     for the people to know.

            <p>
     I would like Mr. Job, or someone else, to tell us 
     <lb/>
     are the words "merchantable fish"just words, or 
     <lb/>
     is there such a thing? Could someone throw some 
     <lb/>
     light on that perplexing question?.... 
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I should think the best way for Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood to find that out would be to interview 
     <lb/>the Fisheries Board. We must presume their fish 
     <lb/>is not good enough to classify that way. It is 
     <lb/>probably greatly exaggerated; I imagine there is 
     <lb/>a certain quantity of merchantable fish 
     <lb/>everywhere, but the quantity is small nowadays 
     <lb/>because the same care is not taken with the cure; 
     <lb/>the main bulk of the fish shipped is good Madeira 
     <lb/>fish.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I know there is no merchant<lb break="no"/>able fish in Lamaline, but what they want to know 
     <lb/>is, is there such a thing as a merchantable fish? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> We are not cullers here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I object very strongly to the use of 
     <lb/>this Convention for answering anonymous let<lb break="no"/>ters. I can bring in half a dozen tomorrow. I object 
     <lb/>to anonymous letters, the contents of which I 
     <lb/>doubt very much. I can't conceive of any fisher<lb break="no"/>man making fish and not getting any merchant<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>
         able fish at all. It is a good many years since I was 
     <lb/>
     associated with a fishing settlement, but I know 
     <lb/>
     they did make considerable merchantable fish. 
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> As to whether or not merchantable 
     <lb/>fish has been made at Lamaline, I say, "Yes, it 
     <lb/>has been made there"; but according to the infor<lb break="no"/>mation furnished by fishermen, they have not got 
     <lb/>that rating. One man took particular care in curing 
     <lb/>his fish, and he took his fish along and it was 
     <lb/>culled and as he said, it was "picture fish", but he 
     <lb/>got no better price than the other man who 
     <lb/>brought in an inferior quality. Therefore I can 
     <lb/>understand the man saying, "Is there any mer<lb break="no"/>chantable fish?" Whether it is the grading or not 
     <lb/>I cannot say; but according to the information 
     <lb/>furnished me by the fishermen of Lamaline, and 
     <lb/>they are all shore fishermen, they don't seem to 
     <lb/>be able to get no. I grade. Where the fault lies I 
     <lb/>cannot say, but these are the facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It seems rather a waste of time to spend 
     <lb/>
     time on that question when we have such a large 
     <lb/>
     report to get through. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't think the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would consider it one moment 
     <lb/>
     wasted, and I would ask Mr. Hillier if he believes 
     <lb/>
     this letter to be genuine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> That's a genuine letter from Lama<lb break="no"/>line, and I happen to know the man who wrote 
     <lb/>
     that letter. He is a fisherman of many years. He 
     <lb/>
     is not very active now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> The remedy seems to be some sort of 
     <lb/>
     an inspector to whom a man can appeal on a 
     <lb/>
     question of cullage. Anyone who knows anything 
     <lb/>
     about cullage can see that it's very difficult to say 
     <lb/>
     on the borderline whether a fish is first or second 
     <lb/>
     quality. I say that's a matter of representation to 
     <lb/>
     the Fishery Board. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> I think that matter should be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with in this Convention, because the people will 
     <lb/>
     know what we are doing on the fisheries. I dis<lb break="no"/>agree with Mr. Job and agree with the letter from 
     <lb/>
     Lamaline to Mr. Smallwood. The rule is that the 
     <lb/>
     fish should be culled Merchantable, Madeira, and 
     <lb/>
     Thirds. The last two are all the one price to the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, and therefore they are not encouraged. 
     <lb/>
     They can make fish that's classified as Thirds and 
     <lb/>
     get the same price as they would for Madeira. My 
     <lb/>
     experience is that it is almost impossible to get a 
     <lb/>
     no. 1 fish that will pass inspection.

     <lb/>
     fishermen are getting no grade for merchantable 
     <lb/>
     fish, and they are getting merchantable fish, there 
     <lb/>
     is something wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> It is very difficult for the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     to get merchantable fish now. I don't know why, 
     <lb/>
     but the bulk of it is Madeira. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Do I understand from Mr. Job that 
     <lb/>
     there are no records to show how much fish was

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> The exports don't show it. There is no

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Every fish has to be passed by a

     government inspector. It is shown in the Fishery

     Board return, the amount of merchantable fish, 
     <lb/>
     Madeira, etc., because you must have a record 
     <lb/>
     before it is shipped. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> But do they keep the statistics?

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Well, they should certainly.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> There are three copies made out,

     one for the packer, one for the shipper and one

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I think that information can be 
     <lb/>
     secured from the Fishery Board, and I believe I 
     <lb/>
     heard or read recently about the small percentage 
     <lb/>
     of merehantable fish that was exported from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. We export some merchantable 
     <lb/>
     fish from Twillingate, not a very large amount, 
     <lb/>
     but the fishermen do sell some merchantable fish 
     <lb/>
     to us. The exact percentage I could not tell, but I 
     <lb/>
     firmly believe that that information can be 
     <lb/>
     secured from the Fisheries Board.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Will Mr. Job undertake to get that

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think Mr. Ashboume is chairman of 
     <lb/>
     the subcommittee on fish and perhaps he would

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I will try to get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you, and will you try to find 
  

            <cb/>
         

     out how much merchantable fish was brought in 
     <lb/>
     from Lamaline and elsewhere? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I know a little about selling fish to 
     <lb/>
     St. John's, and we generally believe the cull to be 
     <lb/>
     rather strict in St. John's, but I have seen a 
     <lb/>
     fisheries receipt for a total of 26 quintals of fish, 
     <lb/>
     and there were 23 quintals of merchantable out 
     <lb/>
     of 26. These figures can be verified 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> It would be very interesting to 
     <lb/>
     find out if there is any merchantable fish ex<lb break="no"/>ported, because there are a lot of people inquiring 
     <lb/>
     about that. I have seen quite a lot of fish on the 
     <lb/>
     west coast, but I have yet to see a merehantable 
     <lb/>
     fish. There is a difference of $1 per quintal, I 
     <lb/>
     think. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Smallwood a few minutes 
     <lb/>
     ago said that Lamaline had never known a mer<lb break="no"/>chantable fish. I would like to know on what 
     <lb/>
     authority he said that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I believe you are putting words 
     <lb/>
     in my mouth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I suppose we will have to try to get that 
     <lb/>
     information. Will that end it for the time being? 
     <lb/>
     We have 15 pages of this to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> Does this whole thing not point to a 
     <lb/>
     weakness in our whole method of curing codfish? 
     <lb/>
     I am no authority on this, but wherever you go 
     <lb/>
     you hear the same kind of comments, and usually 
     <lb/>
     where there is a great deal of smoke there is a 
     <lb/>
     little fire somewhere. As far as I understand the 
     <lb/>
     system of culling and exporting fish, going back 
     <lb/>
     a step from where we were yesterday, I presume 
     <lb/>
     whoever is selling codfish employs the local 
     <lb/>
     culler, who in turn is under oath to act fairly in 
     <lb/>
     the best of his ability to all parties concerned. Of 
     <lb/>
     course no man can be expected to do more than 
     <lb/>
     the best of his ability. I am not sure if the man's 
     <lb/>
     ability is ascertained before he is given a license 
     <lb/>
     or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> it is very difficult to get expert cullers. 
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> Codfish is bought by the dealers, 
     <lb/>and culled by local cullers appointed by the local 
     <lb/>dealer. I would not say that the culler gave an 
     <lb/>advantage to the local dealer, but that clause that 
     <lb/>the man must cull to the best of his ability does, 
     <lb/>after all, admit of certain very grave weaknesses. 
     <lb/>On the other hand, when the same codfish is 
     <lb/>exported to the markets it is culled under the 
     <lb/>supervision of inspectors of the Fishery Board. 
     <lb/>When the exporting merchant is packing his fish 
     <lb/>for export he has the same cullers in his store, but 


            <pb n="405" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-27_Page_0405.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">405</fw>
      

     he also has a supervisor or inspector from the 
     <lb/>
     Fishery Board on the premises, who is seeing to 
     <lb/>
     it that the codfish is culled strictly according to 
     <lb/>
     Fishery Board standards. That does admit of a 
     <lb/>
     double standard, to use that phrase, in the market<lb break="no"/>ing of codfish.... I think that better supervision is 
     <lb/>
     required at the point of production. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> I don't think Mr. Newell is quite 
     <lb/>
     clear there. My experience is that before a culler 
     <lb/>
     can get a permit to cull fish, that application has 
     <lb/>
     to be signed by the fish inspector of the territory 
     <lb/>
     over which he is working. For instance, if I 
     <lb/>
     wanted a culler today I could not appoint any man 
     <lb/>
     on my premises. That man had to be approved by 
     <lb/>
     the fish inspector before his application was sent 
     <lb/>
     in to the Fishery Board, before he could get his 
     <lb/>
     license at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is just one point that I 
     <lb/>
     want to make, and that's about a plentiful supply 
     <lb/>
     of fresh water in the washing of fish. In looking 
     <lb/>
     at the tariff I find that the duty on pumps — well, 
     <lb/>
     there are two rates, one for pumps for mining 
     <lb/>
     purposes, and one "for all other purposes", in<lb break="no"/>cluding the fishery. It is 20% full duty, 20% 
     <lb/>
     intermediary duty and 10% preferential. Well, if 
     <lb/>
     a pump is imported from the British Isles then the 
     <lb/>
     duty is 10%, but if it comes from Canada it is 
     <lb/>
     20%. Does anyone happen to know where most 
     <lb/>
     of the pumps come from — Britain or this side of 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The USA. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, that means that the duty 
     <lb/>
     will be 20%, so that the fishermen using the 
     <lb/>
     pumps pay a price which I imagine would make 
     <lb/>
     the use of these pumps very strictly limited. We 
     <lb/>
     all know as far as the inshore fishery is concerned 
     <lb/>
     there are not too many pumps used. I know places 
     <lb/>
     where they are used, and I take it that the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee puts a lot of value on that. What is wrong 
     <lb/>
     with the government, or the Fisheries Board ac<lb break="no"/>ting for the government, or some official body of 
     <lb/>
     the government, importing 10-15,000 pumps 
     <lb/>
     from the manufacturer, getting them at a special 
     <lb/>
     price, bringing them in duty free and selling them 
     <lb/>
     at cost? If it is valuable for the fishermen to have 
     <lb/>
     a plentiful supply of clean water why not do the 
     <lb/>
     thing right, and why leave it to the individual 
     <lb/>
     fisherman when the government could bring in 
     <lb/>
     lots of pumps and sell them at perhaps half the 
     <lb/>
     price that they are paying for mem now? Has 
     <lb/>
     anybody considered that?

     <lb/>years much money has been made by many 
     <lb/>people and firms from the fishery, but a few years 
     <lb/>back I got the jitters from it, and not the gold that 
     <lb/>glitters. The same can be applied to many other 
     <lb/>fishermen and firms all over Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>Today, I am happy to see the fish plants com<lb break="no"/>ing to the fore, and I hope and pray that markets

     pleted, it would make a big difference to the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> How? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It would enable them to bring fish from 
     <lb/>
     other places to the plant. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> By truck. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What other places? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Placentia Bay and Trinity Bay. You 
     <lb/>
     would not fish from the south of Trinity Bay up 
     <lb/>
     to there. I do not know the distance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Therefore the government is going 
     <lb/>
     to spend $15 million for the fish plant. I can see 
     <lb/>
     no advantage to the saltfish trade. You talk of 
     <lb/>
     green, fresh fish — I would like for someone to 
     <lb/>
     point out some fishing places along that road. 
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> I agree with Mr. Job. There are 
     <lb/>several other places where roads are important — 
     <lb/>e.g. Green Bay. There it is four miles from the 
     <lb/>plant to the sea; if the road was made passable by 
     <lb/>truck, the men in Shoal Cove could send fish to 
     <lb/>the plant. I do not agree with one road only, Burin 
     <lb/>to Avalon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Ithink the road to Burin is absolute<lb break="no"/>ly essential to the fish plant at Burin. One reason 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Monroe gave us was that he cannot get in 
     <lb/>
     touch with the plant except by steamer; and it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary for him to get in contact daily; and the 
     <lb/>
     only means is by road. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You are going to put a road there so 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Monroe can get back and forth to his 
     <lb/>
     plant? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> For the benefit of the plant. The 
     <lb/>
     Burin Peninsula is the most isolated place in the 
     <lb/>
     island of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> I disagree with Mr. Hollett regard<lb break="no"/>ing there being no fish caught in the bottom of 
     <lb/>
     Fortune Bay. There is a certain amount caught. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> How much? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> I have not got the figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> There may be a reason for spending 
     <lb/>
     $1.5 million on a road there; I was born in Burin 
     <lb/>
     and if the road is necessary, I am perfectly in 
     <lb/>
     accord. I am taking the attitude that they should 
     <lb/>
     show me that it is essential. Just how much fish 
     <lb/>
     is caught down there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You do not know how much can be 
     <lb/>
     caught. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I have seen so much thrown away 
     <lb/>
     on roads, that I am getting fed up, especially 
     <lb/>
     when talking about a balanced budget. We have 
     <lb/>
     the distance from Burin to Argentia — 40 miles 


            <cb/>
            

     — if Mr. Monroe wants to go to Argentia, he can 
     <lb/>
     go across the bay. If you can show me that this 
     <lb/>
     road is essential and beneficial then I am all in 
     <lb/>
     accord. The terrain through which the road will 
     <lb/>
     go has very little agricultural prospects. If we 
     <lb/>
     forget the transportation of fish — and there is 
     <lb/>
     very little fish — I cannot see what advantage it 
     <lb/>
     is to the cold storage plant. That road will be open 
     <lb/>
     six months of the year. Wherein lies the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It will be aconnection between Fonune 
     <lb/>
     Bay, St. J ohn's and other settlements, apart from 
     <lb/>
     the fish plant. There should be a connection be<lb break="no"/>tween Fortune Bay and St. John's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Do you know they go from St.

     John's to Fortune Bay by road? A distance of 55 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> The road is there now.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Some sort of road.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How many fishing settlements 
     <lb/>
     will it link up with Burin? How many on the 
     <lb/>
     Burin Peninsula side and how many on the 
     <lb/>
     Placentia Bay side?

     <persName ref="pers:RYAN4">Mr. Ryan</persName> In the district of Placentia West. it 
     <lb/>
     will link up Boat Harbour and there are only half 
     <lb/>
     a dozen fishermen there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I cannot picture the way the 
     <lb/>
     road is going to run. This should not be in the 
     <lb/>
     report as a sample of road for fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> It is not altogether for fisheries; it is 
     <lb/>
     to prevent isolation in the Burin Peninsula. The 
     <lb/>
     greatest salt codfishery in Newfoundland is on 
     <lb/>
     the Burin Peninsula. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> If Mr. Reddy was minister of public 
     <lb/>
     works would he be prepared to authorise the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure in connection with the Burin and 
     <lb/>
     Avalon Peninsulas, knowing how little it would 
     <lb/>
     affect the economy of Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I certainly would. It would bring 
     <lb/>
     those people out of the isolation that they have 
     <lb/>
     been in for years and years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I lived in Burin, I could always get 
     <lb/>
     to Canada or anywhere else I wanted to go; I was 
     <lb/>
     never isolated on the Burin Peninsula, if I was not 
     <lb/>
     afraid of getting seasick. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RYAN4">Mr. Ryan</persName> I agree with Mr. Hollett. The only 
     <lb/>
     explanation they give for it is that Mr. Monroe

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I think I was responsible in some 
     <lb/>
     way for social security having been introduced 
     <lb/>
     into the Fisheries Report. For years I have felt that 
     <lb/>
     fishermen should have some protection. Our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen begin fishing at the age of 18 and fish 
     <lb/>
     until they can no longer get into a boat and in 
     <lb/>
     many cases it has been brought to my notice, 
     <lb/>
     when they can no longer get into a boat they are 
     <lb/>
     very much in the same position as when they 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
     

     began. When the first meeting was held I asked 
     <lb/>
     permission to mention that social security 
     <lb/>
     scheme. I had in mind something in the nature of 
     <lb/>
     retiring allowances; that is, a man on reaching the 
     <lb/>
     age of 60 would receive a retiring allowance so 
     <lb/>
     that for the remainder of his days he would be 
     <lb/>
     looked after, and in the case of sickness would 
     <lb/>
     not have to fall back on the government. There 
     <lb/>
     have been cases where men in the prime of health 
     <lb/>
     have been called across the bar. They have noth<lb break="no"/>ing to leave to their wives and families. The wife 
     <lb/>
     and family is completely dependent upon, I think, 
     <lb/>
     $10 a quarter — the widow's mite. I felt that 
     <lb/>
     should not be. There should be something to 
     <lb/>
     provide for his family. Therefore I introduced the 
     <lb/>
     idea that there should be some quarterly contribu<lb break="no"/>tion made by the fishermen so that their families 
     <lb/>
     could be looked after. The insurance scheme 
     <lb/>
     before us applies in the case of death; there is no 
     <lb/>
     provision in the case of sickness and both the man 
     <lb/>
     and his family must fall back absolutely upon the 
     <lb/>
     government and I do not think that is good 
     <lb/>
     enough. I have here a social security scheme 
     <lb/>
     drawn up by Mr. Bannikin which was presented 
     <lb/>
     to the Department of Natural Resources in 1943. 
     <lb/>
     I think it is a good one. My plan was to collect 
     <lb/>
     from the fishermen and that is not so easy. His is 
     <lb/>
     to collect so much yearly from the exporters of 
     <lb/>
     our products, place it in the hands of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and from that to pay yearly to fishermen on 
     <lb/>
     pensions. If it is in order. I would ask the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary to read that scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What is your scheme? If it is in 
     <lb/>
     the nature of general social security it would 
     <lb/>
     apply not only to fishermen but to others as well. 
     <lb/>
     If it is something for the protection of fishermen 
     <lb/>
     in the event of loss of life in the course of their 
     <lb/>
     advocacy, we could have it read. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> That is what it is meant to be.

            </p>

            <p>

     for the fishermen would be a great benefit.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The report Mr. Hillier has was 
     <lb/>
     prepared by Mr. Bannikin, and deals entirely with 
     <lb/>
     social security for fishermen only. I think that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job's suggestion is an excellent one and would 
     <lb/>
     meet the desire of Mr. Hillier to give the infor<lb break="no"/>mation to the other members.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> With regard to the discussion held 
     <lb/>
     a short time ago regarding the quality of fish. I 
     <lb/>
     have here the figures for 1943, 1944 and 1945, 
     <lb/>
     and the percentage of merchantable fish for these

     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Before we get on to the catch 
     <lb/>
     again I would like to protest against this niggard<lb break="no"/>ly sum the government is going to offer our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen. I would not like to say what I think 
     <lb/>
     about it, but I would like the opportunity of

     putting a vote of censure on the government.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Before you put the question I would 
     <lb/>
     like the committee to turn to the report where it 
     <lb/>
     says "less $90 ton bounty." I am wondering if the 
     <lb/>
     Committee is thinking of boats from 20 tons up. 
     <lb/>
     I think you will find that it is $70 per ton from 12 
     <lb/>
     to 25 tons, and there is not any bounty on the 
     <lb/>
     engines if they are gasoline; they must be full 
     <lb/>
     diesel. You get $15 bounty on full diesel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Reddy can reply to that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> That's only put in for comparison, 
     <lb/>
     probably the real bounty on that boat was $45. 
     <lb/>
     That's the fishery bounty today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> This is going over the air, and people 
     <lb/>
     will be writing in expecting to get $90 per ton for 
     <lb/>
     that boat. It's nice to clear it up. I may say that I 
     <lb/>
     have not looked at these figures before, although 
     <lb/>
     I made a guess the other day when I mentioned 
     <lb/>
     the assistance given ex-servicemen. I am happy 
     <lb/>
     that my guess was pretty well correct. I would 
  

            <cb/>
           

     also like to have a word on this social security 
     <lb/>
     scheme. I have a lot of sympathy with this scheme 
     <lb/>
     prepared by Mr. Bannikin. I think we all will 
     <lb/>
     agree that Mr. Bannikin, being a very good 
     <lb/>
     businessman (he has invested most of the money 
     <lb/>
     he has made in various fishery experiments and 
     <lb/>
     otherwise), has a good knowledge of conditions 
     <lb/>
     in the country. I am in full accord with all the 
     <lb/>
     Committee say there. I agree with the report, 
     <lb/>
     generally speaking, all the way through. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to see more of these central curing stations 
     <lb/>
     to take care of the surplus fish. It would be a good 
     <lb/>
     answer to a lot of the country's taxes being spent 
     <lb/>
     very unwisely in other directions, by selling to 
     <lb/>
     better advantage to promote and modernise the 
     <lb/>
     fishery. It is still the staple industry.... I would 
     <lb/>
     like to see the future government of this country 
     <lb/>
     exert every effort to have fresh freezing plants 
     <lb/>
     built all over the country. Until then the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry will have a struggle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That matter of $80 insurance. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     add my support to the previous speakers, because 
     <lb/>
     I think it is an insult to the widow ofa man who 
     <lb/>
     goes to the Banks in Newfoundland or Labrador 
     <lb/>
     or anywhere else. We know that our government 
     <lb/>
     could easily place an insurance on the head of 
     <lb/>
     every fisherman, for a small nominal cost, and I 
     <lb/>
     think arrangements could be made whereby, for 
     <lb/>
     a minimum premium. provision could be made 
     <lb/>
     for those who were less fortunate. The time is ripe 
     <lb/>
     for it....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> There is just one other point in 
     <lb/>
     connection with this. I may have something to 
     <lb/>
     say on the insurance later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That's the only thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I understood the government were 
     <lb/>
     planning a fishermen's insurance scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I never heard of it. The Board of Trade 
     <lb/>
     are working on it, and they have some proposals. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Did you inquire from the govern<lb break="no"/>ment whether they were doing anything? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> No.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Would it be too much to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Committee to find out before the debate is over? 
     <lb/>
     The point I want to make is on page 54: "Under 
     <lb/>
     the incomparable chairmanship of Mr. Raymond 
     <lb/>
     Gushue the Board has functioned to the very 
     <lb/>
     great advantage of the industry and the country." 
     <lb/>
     I believe the Board is doing an excellent job, and 
     <lb/>
     I understand the Committee intended to pay the 
     <lb/>
     Board and Mr. Gushue a compliment, but what

     kind of a compliment is it when you look over at 
     <lb/>
     the next page: "the fullest co-operation of the 
     <lb/>
     trade that made the notable achievements of the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board possible." Well now, is that cor<lb break="no"/>rect? What is going to happen when the trade 
     <lb/>
     takes away its genial support? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I don't think they will take it away. I 
     <lb/>
     dare say Mr. Hollett will remember that in 1920 
     <lb/>
     or 1921 when the late Sir William Coaker en<lb break="no"/>deavoured to tackle this question of the organisa<lb break="no"/>tion of the fisheries, the trade was divided very 
     <lb/>
     seriously, and it got into a political atmosphere 
     <lb/>
     and the thing was an absolute failure. I believe if 
     <lb/>
     the trade had supported it, then the whole thing 
     <lb/>
     would have been brought into being then, but 
     <lb/>
     there was so much political spleen brought in that 
     <lb/>
     it killed it. We have been fortunate in getting the 
     <lb/>
     trade to support it now. I believe that if they don't 
     <lb/>
     we will not be able to carry it on.

            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> This is all on the co-operative move<lb break="no"/>ment — a very important one in the future of the 
     <lb/>country, and personally I think it is a very impor<lb break="no"/>tant matter. This section was written — as most 
     <lb/>the rest of it was — by Mr. Keough, who is a keen 
     <lb/>co-operative man, and he did reserve the right to 
     <lb/>criticise the figures given at the end of the section, 
     <lb/>having regard to the challenging by certain 
     <lb/>people of the figures of the co-operatives. The 
     <lb/>contention of the one witness we had before us, 
     <lb/>who is interested in canning, was that it would 
     <lb/>pay the country better if the lobsters, instead of 
     <lb/>being shipped alive, had all been canned. It seems 
     <lb/>very doubtful whether that's correct, but anyhow 
     <lb/>Mr. Keough reserves the right to criticise that 
     <lb/>although he agreed to put it in the report in favour 
     <lb/>of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> What I have to say I have written 
     <lb/>
     out in the form of a statement, so that we will not 
     <lb/>
     get mixed up in the statistics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to that section of this report that 
     <lb/>
     deals with the co-operative movement at its 
     <lb/>
     points of contact with the fisheries — and in 
     <lb/>
     particular in respect of the co-operative shipping 
     <lb/>
     of live lobster — I think it only fair to the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee to say that it did accept in good faith 
     <lb/>
     information which I supplied. In addition a fur<lb break="no"/>ther statement was supplied to the Committee, the 
     <lb/>
     intent of which was to show wherein the co-<lb break="yes"/>
       
            <cb/>
           operatives could have obtained greater returns if 
     <lb/>
     instead of marketing their lobster live they had 
     <lb/>
     canned it and marketed the same direct. I was 
     <lb/>
     quite willing that such statement should be in<lb break="no"/>cluded in this report in order that both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     story might be told. But when I signed the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Report I did so with the distinct under<lb break="no"/>standing that I would take some issue with that 
     <lb/>
     statement of how the co-operatives might have 
     <lb/>
     done better when such statement would come 
     <lb/>
     before the Convention. I now do so.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Keough argued at length that it was uncer<lb break="no"/>tain whether co-operatives had in fact lost money<lb/>by shipping live lobster]</hi><lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> There seems to be a disagreement 
     <lb/>
     among the Fisheries Committee. I could not fol<lb break="no"/>low Mr. Keough's dissertation and I would like 
     <lb/>
     to have a copy of his speech. An attempt has been 
     <lb/>
     made to prove there is more benefit from canned 
     <lb/>
     than from live lobster. I think it is a matter be<lb break="no"/>tween the co-operatives and the trade. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not going into the point 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Keough touched on. He is an auditor among 
     <lb/>
     the credit societies where a great many lobsters 
     <lb/>
     have been handled in recent years, and if he is 
     <lb/>
     satisfied it is the most economical thing to ship 
     <lb/>
     them alive, I am going to accept his word for it. 
     <lb/>
     That is not what I wanted to say, but rather this: 
     <lb/>
     it is a wonderful thing that this Fisheries Commit<lb break="no"/>tee, consisting of several of the country's best- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     known fish merchants and exporters, brings in a 
     <lb/>
     report, a big section of which deals with the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement.... The fact that this 
     <lb/>
     movement, young as it is, has been able to 
     <lb/>
     produce for this Convention men of the type of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Keough, Mr. Newell and Mr. McCarthy, is 
     <lb/>
     the most important thing about this whole 
     <lb/>
     country today. I am not too optimistic about this 
     <lb/>
     country and I am completely honest in that. There 
     <lb/>
     are some encouraging things and some dis<lb break="no"/>couraging things about it. One of the encouraging 
     <lb/>
     things, basically and fundamentally, is the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of this great co-operative movement which 
     <lb/>
     does not extend far enough and which I hope will 
     <lb/>
     extend throughout the country; that will make a 
     <lb/>
     big difference in the lives of our people. I con<lb break="no"/>gratulate the co-operatives on being represented 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention. Ten years ago we would have 
     <lb/>
     been laughed at for talking co-operatives; today 
     <lb/>
     it is not laughing matter. Ten years from now,

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I might ask Mr, Newell to give us some 
     <lb/>
     information as to what government support the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement is getting. Some people 
     <lb/>
     think it is getting too much and some people think 
     <lb/>
     it is not getting enough. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I did not intend to have anything to 
     <lb/>
     say on this. As far as I know, the co-operative is 
     <lb/>
     a good thing. It has not only the strong endorse<lb break="no"/>ment but the flattering OK of the Fisheries Com<lb break="no"/>mittee. I was prepared to leave it at that. I am not 
     <lb/>
     entirely in a position to speak for the government 
     <lb/>
     or the Co-operative Division. I have never 
     <lb/>
     worked for the (Co-operative Division of the 
     <lb/>
     government. I think, though, I am doing the same 
     <lb/>
     kind of work as their field workers are. As far as 
     <lb/>
     I know, there is no co-operative society in this 
     <lb/>
     country today receiving financial assistance from 
     <lb/>
     the government. When the idea of co-operatives 
     <lb/>
     was first mooted by the government — it was 
     <lb/>
     mooted long before that by Sir Wilfred Grenfell, 
     <lb/>
     the first co-operative was organised by him 35 to 
     <lb/>
     40 years ago — but when the idea was first 
     <lb/>
     mooted by the government they brought over an 
     <lb/>
     expert from England. He was an expert on co<lb break="no"/>operatives but not an expert on Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     because he recommended, I understand, that the 
     <lb/>
     only way we could get a start here would be by 
     <lb/>
     government loans. I believe considerable sums 
     <lb/>
     were loaned to three co-operative societies. One 
     <lb/>
     of these was known to exist years afterwards and 
     <lb/>
     the people took it over and built a good strong 
     <lb/>
     society. Whether the other two or three ever paid 
     <lb/>
     off their loans, I am not in a position to say. That 
     <lb/>
     first experiment on the basis of loans was written 
     <lb/>
     off as a failure generally. The past did sow in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the people the idea of co-operatives. As 
     <lb/>
     far as I know, not one cent of government money 
     <lb/>
     was invested in this society which was taken over 
     <lb/>
     by the people.

     vacancies. Anyway, that $50,000 grant is spent 
     <lb/>
     on co-operative education, that is to say they send 
     <lb/>
     out adult teachers to organise study groups to 
     <lb/>
     assist people in the organisation of study groups. 
     <lb/>
     They are not permitted, as far as I know, to 
     <lb/>
     participate in the business management of such 
     <lb/>
     societies, so that any money that is expended is 
     <lb/>
     expended as an educational vote. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Are they taxed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> There is taxation on co-operatives. 
     <lb/>
     At the present time I am not too sure about the 
     <lb/>
     details. I cannot speak on them. I am not much 
     <lb/>
     concerned with the business end of it; it is merely 
     <lb/>
     from a layman's point of view. I understand they 
     <lb/>
     are taxed on any profits. Strictly speaking, if they 
     <lb/>
     were co-operatives they would not make profits, 
     <lb/>
     but some of them do make profits. By that I mean 
     <lb/>
     they sell goods to people who are not members 
     <lb/>
     of the societies and thereby make profits. They 
     <lb/>
     are taxed on the basis of these and also on any 
     <lb/>
     amount they pay as dividends on share capital 
     <lb/>
     invested by their share holders.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I must agree with Mr. Keough on 
     <lb/>
     the question of lobsters.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> In reply to Mr. Hollett I would like to 
     <lb/>
     say there is no disagreement in the Committee. 
     <lb/>
     We thought it fair to present both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     case. Mr. Keough thought so too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not say you had a fight — I 
     <lb/>
     merely said there was a disagreement. I am not a 
     <lb/>
     co-operative man as far as the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement is concerned, I am not connected with 
     <lb/>
     it. That table on page 56 is interesting. I find that 
     <lb/>
     in 1946 at least, the co-operatives have persuaded 
     <lb/>
     the trade to come up to their price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> 1 do not think you noticed the note at 
     <lb/>
     the top of page 57: "....cold storage operations 
     <lb/>
     were not conducted in the area in l942-1943- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     1944." Cold storage — that refers to salmon. 
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> In order to keep the record straight, 
     <lb/>there is another point you have to consider which 
     <lb/>does not appear in this report. During the years 
     <lb/>1942-43, 1944-45, these particular co-operatives 
     <lb/>were the only producing co-operatives. As far as 
     <lb/>salmon was concerned they shipped a high 
     <lb/>quality product and received the best prices. In 


            <pb n="411" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-27_Page_0411.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">411</fw>
           

     other words they did not lose one single pound 
     <lb/>
     for bad quality. The fishermen looked after it all 
     <lb/>
     the way through. We did not need fishery inspec<lb break="no"/>tors — we had 250 inspectors and these were the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen themselves. But last year, 1946, they 
     <lb/>
     ran into their first snag — 16% of the total 
     <lb/>
     product was affected by spoilage, which does 
     <lb/>
     make some difference in the figures. The first 
     <lb/>
     four years were maximum figures; last year was 
     <lb/>
     a doubtful year.

     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> In rising to comment on this section 
     <lb/>
     of the report, it does not mean I was not impressed 
     <lb/>
     by the rest of it. I note that the Committee has 
     <lb/>
     recognised that our basic problem is our people 
     <lb/>
     scattered around our great coastline. They have 
     <lb/>
     made a very good attempt to solve some of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties of this problem. It has been suggested 
     <lb/>
     by other members that there is a gap — and we 
    

            <cb/>
            

     all recognise it and are sensitive to it — between 
     <lb/>
     the primary producer and the exporter and the 
     <lb/>
     trade. The Committee has recognised this and 
     <lb/>
     have made some very good suggestions to solve 
     <lb/>
     the problem. That seems to be one of their aims. 
     <lb/>
     They made suggestions for the modernisation of 
     <lb/>
     our fisheries and I support this section of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee's report because this is also one of 
     <lb/>
     their suggestions — one way in which we can 
     <lb/>
     span the gap. I am pleased because it came from 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Committee with representatives on 
     <lb/>
     it of various sections of our country, and undoub<lb break="no"/>tedly the trade and exporters have played such a 
     <lb/>
     part in presenting this report, it is hopeful for the 
     <lb/>
     future....

     Report of the Fisheries Committee:¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The committee is now consider<lb break="no"/>ing that section headed "The Co-operative Move- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ment".² 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> Mr. Chairman, I suppose I was part<lb break="no"/>ly responsible for this section not passing yester<lb break="no"/>day afternoon. There are, a couple of 
     <lb/>
     observations I would like to make now, however, 
     <lb/>
     relative to the co-operative movement. When Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell was speaking yesterday he stated that 
     <lb/>
     there was no money put into the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement by the government. Mr. Keough how<lb break="no"/>ever did inform us that the government did have 
     <lb/>
     money in several of the co-operative movements, 
     <lb/>
     especially land settlements. Then aquestion from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett elicited an answer from Mr. Newell, 
     <lb/>
     that the government had advanced them $50,000 
     <lb/>
     annually for salaries and travelling expenses. I 
     <lb/>
     contend that any committee bringing in a report 
     <lb/>
     on any department or institution in which govern<lb break="no"/>ment monies are involved should show what that 
     <lb/>
     department is costing and is likely to cost in the 
     <lb/>
     future. I feel that in order to arrive at the cost of 
     <lb/>
     government these are the facts we must have. 
     <lb/>
     They are more important than the price of some 
     <lb/>
     fishery products ten years ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> Mr. Fowler seems to want to 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     know how much is involved so far as the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is concerned. I might say that the land 
     <lb/>
     settlements (at the present time there are two or 
     <lb/>
     three) were started with money supplied by the 
     <lb/>
     government, and when they were wound up there 
     <lb/>
     was a certain amount of stock, buildings, etc. left 
     <lb/>
     over, and an inventory was taken. and in the case 
     <lb/>
     of Lourdes it amounted to $8,000. Some people 
     <lb/>
     think that $8,000 was passed over as a gift but 
     <lb/>
     that is not correct. We have not yet paid off the 
     <lb/>
     full amount, but we have it down to about $2,000 
     <lb/>
     and will pay it off practically at any time. It is not 
     <lb/>
     a matter of the government losing any money. 
     <lb/>
     This same situation applies to Midland and Point 
     <lb/>
     au Mal. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What Mr. Fowler really wants to 
     <lb/>
     know is why the people should be taxed to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of $50,000 a year to maintain or sustain 
     <lb/>
     some particular ideology which some people 
     <lb/>
     wish to bring forward. l think that's your point is 
     <lb/>
     it not, Mr. Fowler?

     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> Yes, sir.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would like to know that too. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if Mr. Job can tell us?
