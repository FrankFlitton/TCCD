<!--<p>
     production he stepped up? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy It is more or less the old crude way. 
     <lb/>
     The clay is taken from the pits by wheelbarrow, 
     <lb/>
     and goes to elevators and into the crusher, and 
     <lb/>
     down into the moulds, and the bricks are cut off 
     <lb/>
     by a string of wires passing through the moulds. 
     <lb/>
     Afterwards they are taken out and pass to the kiln, 
     <lb/>
     then they are sun dried. It's the old crude 
     <lb/>
     methods, and I believe if they had more modern 
     <lb/>
     methods the production would be stepped up, but 
     <lb/>
     then again you are up against the imported article 
     <lb/>
     being superior, and in order to make the industry 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile you will have to condemn the clay 
     <lb/>
     pits and use the shale. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, the duty on 
     <lb/>
     machinery coming in for brick is free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Won't Mr. Vardy confirm the 
     <lb/>
     fact that one of the gentlemen making brick down 
     <lb/>
     his way went away recently to the States and 
     <lb/>
     visited a number of up-to-date brick factories, 
     <lb/>
     and has plans to improve his plant in Trinity Bay? 
     <lb/>
     Isn't that true? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy Yes, I understand it is true. They 
     <lb/>
     have plans in mind to get together on it over there 
     <lb/>
     and try to use the shale. There is an unlimited 
     <lb/>
     quantity of shale. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Starkes The machinery for making brick is 
     <lb/>
     duty free, and your Committee must have made 
     <lb/>
     a mistake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I have not consulted the tariff on this 
     <lb/>
     myself. That was always my knowledge, and I 
     <lb/>
     know Mr. Smith had trouble on that. Is that a 
     <lb/>
     recent tariff? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Hickman Well this tariff is issued by the 
     <lb/>
     Customs in June, 1946, and included quite a lot 
     <lb/>
     of machinery for various purposes, including 
     <lb/>
     machinery for making brick, and it's duty free the 
     <lb/>
     same as cordage machinery for making twine, 
     <lb/>
     that's duty free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins Its nice to know the Mining Com<lb break="no"/>mittee made one slip! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Harrington All those bricks that are made, 
     <lb/>
     are they used locally? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I don't know of any local made brick 
     <lb/>
     being exported. I know we are importing a lot of 
     <lb/>
     brick, but I don't know of any being exported. It 
     <lb/>
     has been stated that the main complaint against 
     <lb/>
     our local brick is that it is very coarse and absorbs 
     <lb/>
     too much moisture. It can't stand up over a period 
     <lb/>
     of years against the hard brick. Of course, there 
     <lb/>
     is the hard and soft, I may say they use the hard 
     <lb/>
     brick for chimneys, but I think that's the main 
     <lb/>
     complaint. The brick manufactured from clay has 
     <lb/>
     been very porous, but the brick manufactured 
     <lb/>
     from this shale can be hardened up so that, as the 
     <lb/>
     report says, "it will be like steel". The opinion is 
     <lb/>
     that an industry should be started immediately. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hickman I don't want to disagree with 
     <lb/>Mr. Vardy again, but there has been some brick 
     <lb/>exported. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vardy I said "to my knowledge"; I did not 
     <lb/>
     say there was not any exported. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>[The section was adopted. The committee began<lb/>discussion of the section on water-power, and<lb/>then rose and reported progress. The Convention<lb/>adjourned]<lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins When we adjourned this report we 
     <lb/>
     were dealing with water-power.³ The table has 
     <lb/>
     been read, and Mr. Banfield was to give us some 
     <lb/>
     figures of estimated horsepower. I would ask you 
     <lb/>
     to mark on the tables the figures which Mr. Ban- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     field will read out. I would like to say we cannot 
     <lb/>
     vouch for the accuracy of these figures. We are 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     giving them to you as we got them. We are 
     <lb/>
     informed they are only an estimate. They will 
     <lb/>
     give you some idea, though not very accurate, of 
     <lb/>
     the potential horsepower in the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
