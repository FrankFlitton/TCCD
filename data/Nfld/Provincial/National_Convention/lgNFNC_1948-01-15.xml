            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Higgins, I still have the 
     <lb/>
     closure motion moved by you under considera<lb break="no"/>tion and I can only repeat to a limited extent what 
     <lb/>
     I said yesterday. It isn't for me to decide the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom or otherwise of carrying the motion; but 
     <lb/>
     it is my duty to put the motion at such time as I 
     <lb/>
     consider to be fair and reasonable. The House 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow will have had a week's clear notice of 
     <lb/>
     this motion, and the sands of time are running out. 
     <lb/>
     So that if a number of members desire that this 
     <lb/>
     Convention should finish its deliberations and 
     <lb/>
     work by the end of the month is to be given effect 
     <lb/>
     to, it obviously follows that the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     business presently before the Chair must shortly 
     <lb/>
     come to an end. Unless and until I'm shown 
     <lb/>
     between now and tomorrow afternoon at 3 
     <lb/>
     o'clock some good and sufficient reason why I 
     <lb/>
     should not put this closure motion, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to inform the House now that it is my intention to 
     <lb/>
     put it immediately after the order of business 
     <lb/>
     begins tomorrow afternoon. Will members 
     <lb/>
     please govern themselves accordingly? I do not 
     <lb/>
     want any suggestions made outside the chamber, 
     <lb/>
     I know there'll be none made inside, that in 
     <lb/>
     putting this motion at that time I am leaning one 
     <lb/>
     way or the other. The fact is I have taken already 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility for deferring this motion for 24 
     <lb/>
     hours, and I am going to assume the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility for the next 24 hours of deferring this 
     <lb/>
     motion. But having regard to all the attendant 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, I think that at 3 o'clock tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     afternoon the final decision should rest with this 
     <lb/>
     House... Therefore, Mr. Higgins, as far as I 
     <lb/>
     know, I have every reason to believe that I'll put 
     <lb/>
     this motion to the House tomorrow afternoon. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think it's quite fair, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man. After all nobody will agree that we haven't 
     <lb/>given full debate to this matter in three weeks. I 
     <lb/>think even Mr. Smallwood will agree. I think 
     <lb/>every member who's wanted to, would have 
     <lb/>spoken by the time we conclude our session 
     <lb/>tonight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think the opinion of the House 
     <lb/>
     should certainly be ascertained. My only worry, 
     <lb/>
     you will appreciate Mr. Higgins, was to ensure 
     <lb/>
     that this motion wasn't jumped on the House at a 
     <lb/>
     time when they didn't have notice... Tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     will constitute one week's clear notice of this 
     <lb/>
     motion, and I will have withheld putting this 


            <cb/>
         

     motion for 48 hours. I do not propose to go 
     <lb/>
     beyond that, because it might very well be that I 
     <lb/>
     will be exceeding my discretionary power.... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree that very ample time 
     <lb/>will have been given by the end of the sitting 
     <lb/>tonight for the debate of these terms. I think it's 
     <lb/>very generous of the House, and very ample. If, 
     <lb/>sir, you put the motion of closure at 3 o'clock 
     <lb/>tomorrow, and the motion is adopted, I will not 
     <lb/>have any regrets or recriminations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Thank you very much. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I want, sir, to direct the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the House to the fact that I have learned 
     <lb/>
     within the past 20 minutes that the Hon. Mr. Job, 
     <lb/>
     who has been sick at home and unable to attend, 
     <lb/>
     seems to have got the impression somehow that 
     <lb/>
     this closure motion is to be put tomorrow, but that 
     <lb/>
     it would be put at a stage in the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     which would allow him to deliver a speech which 
     <lb/>
     he has spent some time preparing. I haven't been 
     <lb/>
     talking with Mr. Job, and if I were to consult only 
     <lb/>
     my own feelings in the matter, as Mr. Job is not 
     <lb/>
     likely to make a very strong speech in favour of 
     <lb/>
     confederation, if he hasn't got the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     speaking, I will not shed bitter tears. But I do ask 
     <lb/>
     the House to remember that Mr. Job does wish to 
     <lb/>
     speak, and if the House were willing to indulge 
     <lb/>
     him for say half an hour or an hour, and then put 
     <lb/>
     the closure motion, I think you would have been 
     <lb/>
     completely fair. He couldn't be here, sir, he's 
     <lb/>
     been sick at home. I'm putting it to the sense of 
     <lb/>
     justice of the House itself to hear Mr. Job attack 
     <lb/>
     confederation, though I would not like him to do 
     <lb/>
     it and I would rather he did the other thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Nobody has more respect for 
     <lb/>
     and more sympathy with the Hon. Mr. Job than I 
     <lb/>
     have, but I direct members' attention to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the motion is as follows: "To move that 
     <lb/>
     immediately before the order of the day is called 
     <lb/>
     on Wednesday, January 14, 1948, for resuming 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the motion that the Convention 
     <lb/>
     resolve itself into a committee of the whole to 
     <lb/>
     further consider and discuss the proposals 
     <lb/>
     received on November 6 from the Rt. Hon. the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of Canada, that the said debate 
     <lb/>
     shall not be further adjourned." Now this motion 
     <lb/>
     supersedes the motion to resolve the House into 
     <lb/>
     a committee. Therefore, it is not for me to alter 
     <lb/>
     the form of this motion, which is what I would be

     doing were I to attempt to put this motion at any 
     <lb/>
     other time.... I have deferred, or will have 
     <lb/>
     deferred by 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, from 
     <lb/>
     putting this motion. If because of the uncertain<lb break="no"/>ties of this world, because of illness or physical 
     <lb/>
     disability, the Hon. R.B. Job or any other member 
     <lb/>
     is prevented from attending, and I don't put this 
     <lb/>
     motion tomorrow in its present form I have no 
     <lb/>
     authority to put it off until next Monday. 
     <lb/>
     Anybody might be deferred because of the unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate circumstances which prevent Mr. Job from 
     <lb/>
     attending the House, and then there are members 
     <lb/>
     who haven't arrived back here yet, and may very 
     <lb/>
     well take the view — because I have created a 
     <lb/>
     very dangerous precedent ... if they requested me 
     <lb/>
     to defer the motion after Monday, and I didn't do 
     <lb/>
    it, I would leave myself wide open to the charge  
     <lb/>that I had deferred for Mr. Job but I wouldn't 
     <lb/>defer in order to give other members the same 
     <lb/>opportunity. Therefore, the position as I see it 
     <lb/>now is that I have to put this motion tomorrow 
     <lb/>afternoon, or I have to defer putting it until Mon<lb break="no"/>day afternoon. The form of the motion allows me 
     <lb/>no discretion at all in the matter.... While I have 


            <cb/>
      

     the greatest sympathy and the greatest admiration 
     <lb/>
     for Mr. Job, I am duty bound to put this motion 
     <lb/>
     at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, and I definitely 
     <lb/>
     propose to give the House the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     determining the fate of the motion... I will have 
     <lb/>
     taken the responsibility for 48 hours. After 3 
     <lb/>
     o'clock tomorrow afternoon it is going to become 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of the members of this House. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore with this in mind, we'll move on to the 
     <lb/>
     second order of the day. Mr. Smallwood...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I move that.

     remind the House that if the closure motion is

     people may judge for themselves the merits and

     <lb/>
     into the many questions involved, but to deal with 
     <lb/>
     only one which I consider of major importance. 
     <lb/>
     As you all know, a country's growth and expan<lb break="no"/>sion depend on the supply of raw materials and 
     <lb/>
     of these we have more than sufficient; however, 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     our fishery under the proposed terms of union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. For a few moments let us look at 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's estimate of expenditure if 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland were a province of Canada. What 


   
 

    
            <cb/>
      

     would we find in the Department of Natural 
     <lb/>
     Resources?....<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> The expenditure is given at ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $112,000, a mere pittance, or as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood would say, chicken-feed. He's quite 
     <lb/>
     right; $112,000 is chicken-feed. Of course his 
     <lb/>
     explanation is that the federal government takes 
     <lb/>
     over where the province leaves off...<ref target="#fn_03">[2]</ref>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName>, they want an explanation. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I'm here to inform you and the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, this is not so. And to prove my point, 
     <lb/>
     here are the actual facts that I know. I would ask 
     <lb/>
     you to look at note four of Mr. Smallwood's

     and 1948 would be present. Gentlemen, this is not 
     <lb/>
     so. Items 1, 2 and 3 refer to the maintenance of 
     <lb/>
     bait depots and the supply of bait and the opera<lb break="no"/>tion of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Malakoff</hi><ref target="#fn_05">[4]</ref> for freezing and transfering

     bait for fishing, which services we agree meet the 
     <lb/>
     real need in this country and which I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     are threatened. The actual position is that the 
     <lb/>
     federal government does not operate or maintain 
     <lb/>
     any bait depot in Canada, or supply bait. Wishing 
     <lb/>
     to be sure on this point, I sought and obtained this 
     <lb/>
     information from two of Canada's largest fishing 
     <lb/>
     provinces — namely British Columbia and Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. And I am sure Mr. Smallwood will agree, 
     <lb/>
     what the federal government does for one 
     <lb/>
     province, it must do for all. If the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment is not supplying bait for British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia, the federal government will not 
     <lb/>
     supply bait for the Province of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Both in Nova Scotia and British Columbia the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen have to buy their own bait from private 
     <lb/>
     operators, or catch and store it themselves. Those 
     <lb/>
     items mentioned in 1947-48, $238,000. Now let 
     <lb/>
     us turn to item 9 — erection of new bait depots. 
     <lb/>
     This is not paid for by the federal government in 
     <lb/>
     any province, and cost in 1947-48, $294,000. 
     <lb/>
     Item 11 — alteration and extension to existing 
     <lb/>
     bait depots, $30,000. This also is not a federal 
     <lb/>
     charge. In other words, we have roughly 
     <lb/>
     $562,000 excluded in this preposterous budget. 
     <lb/>
     Our fishermen are to do without free services. 
     <lb/>
     Can they afford to do without them? The answer 
     <lb/>
     is clear — no. The position therefore is this: we 
     <lb/>
     actually have expenses in these items alone totall<lb break="no"/>ing $562,000, for which nothing has been 
     <lb/>
     provided in Mr. Smallwood's budget. So either 
     <lb/>
     we have a deficit of $562,000 or we go without 
     <lb/>
     fish services. Such a thought to me is fantastic 
     <lb/>
     and unthinkable under any form of government 
     <lb/>
     this country might have. Mr. Chairman, if the 
     <lb/>
     record of figures, and the estimates of expendi<lb break="no"/>ture and revenue of the provincial budget, are as 
     <lb/>
     far astray as these are, then it follows the figures 
     <lb/>
     of other estimates of the same sort are just as 
     <lb/>
     unreliable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some months ago I made the statement that 
     <lb/>
     sooner or later our American friends would be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to come to this country for their fish 
     <lb/>
     supply. Many people, I know, did not believe 
     <lb/>
     this. But today, much sooner then suspected, my 
     <lb/>
     forecast has come true. Last Monday, two 
     <lb/>
     trawlers ... with a crew of 18 men each sailed 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's on their first fishing voyage from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — under the flag of the United 


            <cb/>
      

     Kingdom. Until a very short time ago, these 
     <lb/>
     splendid boats were sailing from the United 
     <lb/>
     States under the flag of Atlantic coast fishermen. 
     <lb/>
     But due to many circumstances with which I am 
     <lb/>
     not familiar, they are now here. And in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, they are the forerunners of many more 
     <lb/>
     — if, and I say if, this country is permitted to run 
     <lb/>
     her own affairs. Now you might say, what do I 
     <lb/>
     mean by this? Well, in a nutshell it is this. Let us 
     <lb/>
     turn again to the federal government. In Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and other provinces, a licence is required 
     <lb/>
     before trawlers can be used. To obtain these 
     <lb/>
     licences, application must be made to the federal 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Fisheries himself at Ottawa. Now the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Fisheries in Ottawa is a very busy 
     <lb/>
     man and has many pressing problems for his 
     <lb/>
     attention. He may not have time to consider im<lb break="no"/>mediately a request from Newfoundland for a 
     <lb/>
     licence to operate trawlers and draggers, and 
     <lb/>
     unintentionally the opportunity to progress is 
     <lb/>
     gone or delayed indefinitely. Again, we all know 
     <lb/>
     New England interests are already coming to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in preference to Canada. Now is 
     <lb/>
     it likely that the Minister of Fisheries at Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     is going to issue licences to Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     operate trawlers etc., if pressure is brought to bear 
     <lb/>
     by Nova Scotia to have the business placed there? 
     <lb/>
     Of course he won't, in my opinion. Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     is far more important politically then we are. So 
     <lb/>
     right away we run the risk of losing to one of our 
     <lb/>
     keenest competitors. Gentlemen, it is neither 
     <lb/>
     feasible or sensible for this country to have 
     <lb/>
     remote control. We have it now under Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government. Are we to trade one remote 
     <lb/>
     control system for another? It has taken Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia a lifetime, practically, to obtain a licence 
     <lb/>
     to operate six trawlers and eight draggers, which 
     <lb/>
     is all that operates from there today. Dr. Douglas 
     <lb/>
     I. Cooper, Director of Fisheries for the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Industry for Nova Scotia asked if they 
     <lb/>
     were going to expand to the limit of exploitation 
     <lb/>
     and were they going to modernise to the limit, or 
     <lb/>
     were they going to perish? Gentlemen, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia is now a case of progress or failure. There 
     <lb/>
     are three reasons for this situation. One, failure to 
     <lb/>
     recognise the fishery as a whole was changing 
     <lb/>
     from saltfish to fresh. Two, high taxation result<lb break="no"/>ing from the war. Three, the McLean Commis<lb break="no"/>sion decision condemning the use of modern

     trawlers except in restricted areas.<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     today is rectifying this decision, but it is admitted 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has far outstripped Nova Scotia in 
     <lb/>modernisation and expansion.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We have the Fisheries Board which ad<lb break="no"/>ministers inspection and control of exports to all 
     <lb/>
     our great markets in Europe and the West Indies. 
     <lb/>
     Under this set-up, inspection is compulsory and 
     <lb/>
     fish cannot be shipped without an inspection 
     <lb/>
     certificate. If we enter confederation, this will be 
     <lb/>
     a federal function. Canada has no compulsory 
     <lb/>
     inspection, with the result that the quality of her 
     <lb/>
     fish has gone down during the war years, while 
     <lb/>
     ours has improved and we have held our market 
     <lb/>
     against Canadian competition. Is it likely that the 
     <lb/>
     federal government will permit Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     a province to control these exports which will be 
     <lb/>Canadian under confederation? The answer is no.<lb/>
    Would a federal government allow New<lb break="no"/>foundland to refuse to export fish to another 
     <lb/>province, say Nova Scotia, if it were found neces<lb break="no"/>sary in order to maintain prices in our markets to<lb/>do so? Certainly they wouldn't. As you all know,<lb/>Halifax used to depend on Newfoundland to<lb/>supply fish for re-export. And they used this fish<lb/>to compete with our own, until under the present<lb/>system this was stopped to the great advantage of<lb/>Newfoundland. For some years Canada, and<lb/>Nova Scotia particularly, had a large share of the<lb/>European market and produced as much if not<lb/>more saltfish for these markets than we do, But<lb/>over a period of years she lost those markets<lb/>while we held them. She also lost the West Indies<lb/>markets to a great extent, which at one time were<lb/>exclusively Canadian and which today are ours.<lb/>I wonder why these markets were lost? And I<lb/>wonder if under confederation we'll find oursel<lb break="no"/>ves in the same position as Nova Scotia? During<lb/>the last quarter of a century we have been able,<lb/>with the help of England, to sell to Spain, Italy,<lb/>and Greece while Canada was unable to make the<lb/>same exchange agreement and consequently<lb/>could not ship. High officials of the federal<lb/>government have made statements that our<lb/>marketing system is far ahead of Canada's. In<lb/>fact, it is so far ahead that last year a Canadian<lb/>delegation came here to study our system and<lb/>Went away amazed at the strides we had made. Is

            <cb/>
      

     a federal government going to permit New<lb break="no"/>foundland as a province to exercise federal rights 
     <lb/>
     by permitting the Newfoundland Fisheries Board 
     <lb/>
     to control exports? Certainly it won't. At any rate 
     <lb/>
     I see nothing in all the terms presented to us, in 
     <lb/>
     either the Grey Book or the Black Book, indicat<lb break="no"/>ing that she will. I for one would like assurance 
     <lb/>
     on this matter before I could mark my vote for 
     <lb/>
     confederation. It must be remembered that 
     <lb/>
     Canadian provinces are our keenest competitors, 
     <lb/>
     and under confederation we will not sell one 
     <lb/>
     pound of fish more to Canada than we do today. 
     <lb/>
     It is quite evident that our salt codfish trade will 
     <lb/>
     suffer practically the same fate as that of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and the Gaspé coast. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our present system, and the Fisheries Board, 
     <lb/>
     will be demolished overnight. And if you think 
     <lb/>
     this is not so under confederation, all you have to 
     <lb/>
     do is turn to Mr. Smallwood's budget.<ref target="#fn_07">[2]</ref> "Of the 
     <lb/>
     total expenditures of $282,800 by the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Board, $158,358 would be federal. Reduction of 
     <lb/>
     function should produce a saving of $12,000 on 
     <lb/>
     Board expenditure." The cost of operating the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board is cut from approximately 
     <lb/>
     $282,000 to $158,000, or $125,000 roughly is 
     <lb/>
     deducted. And they visualise, mind you, a further 
     <lb/>
     saving of $12,000 because the Board's functions 
     <lb/>
     are going to be reduced — not increased, or any 
     <lb/>
     further assistance given, but reduced. What func<lb break="no"/>tions of the Board do you think they intend to 
     <lb/>
     reduce? Perhaps members of the Fishery Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on the delegation to Ottawa can tell us, 
     <lb/>although I understand that only one meeting was 
     <lb/>held, attended by only two members of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland delegation. Mr. Chairman, one of our 
     <lb/>chief industries took the time of one meeting and 
     <lb/>the attention of two of our delegates, and we're 
     <lb/>expected to vote on a referendum for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. That committee should have had with them 
     <lb/>Mr. Raymond Gushue, who in my opinion knows 
     <lb/>more about trade agreements and what's best for 
     <lb/>our fishery then any member of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>delegation. And if this is correct, that it was only 
     <lb/>attended by two members, all I can say is that they 
     <lb/>had very little interest in their country and the 
     <lb/>most important branch of its economy. Just in 
     <lb/>case they can't tell us what functions are to be 
     <lb/>reduced, to me it is quite obvious that these

     functions are those that encroach on federal 
     <lb/>
     rights, mainly the controlling of exports. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another alarming result of union with Canada 
     <lb/>
     is the statement contained in section 9, subsection 
     <lb/>
     3 of the Grey Book. I'll read it, it's a honey: "No 
     <lb/>
     part of the surplus shall be used to subsidise 
     <lb/>
     production or sale of Newfoundland's products 
     <lb/>
     in unfair competition with similar products of 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, it being understood that this 
     <lb/>
     proviso does not preclude assistance to industry 
     <lb/>
     by such means as developmental loans on 
     <lb/>
     reasonable conditions or by ordinary provincial 
     <lb/>
     administrative services." Now Mr. Chairman, the 
     <lb/>
     substance of this particular section conveys to me 
     <lb/>
     at least that the Canadian government will do 
     <lb/>
     everything it possibly can to prevent any serious 
     <lb/>
     competition from our fishing industry. This is not 
     <lb/>
     the first time that Canada has shown its feelings 
     <lb/>
     with regard to our fishery. The Bond-Blaine 
     <lb/>
     treaty has been dealt with many times in this 
     <lb/>
     chamber and outside, so it's not necessary for me 
     <lb/>
     to go into further details on it. I only wanted to 
     <lb/>
     point out that it has been one of our fondest hopes 
     <lb/>
     that our fishery should be developed along 
     <lb/>
     modern and scientific lines, and there are many 
     <lb/>
     cases where government assistance would be of 
     <lb/>
     the utmost value. But the Canadian government, 
     <lb/>
     in these proposals, tells us that we will not be 
     <lb/>
     permitted with our own money to further develop 
     <lb/>
     our industry. I would like to take your minds back 
     <lb/>
     to last September and October, when it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary for our government to use ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $7 million in order to obtain foreign 
     <lb/>
     exchange to pay for Newfoundland fish produc<lb break="no"/>tion of 1947. I wonder would this be called a 
     <lb/>
     subsidy? Or would it have another name? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It's not a subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> It's all according how you look at 
     <lb/>
     it, Mr. Smallwood, and I'm not in the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government. I know what I'd do if I was there. 
     <lb/>
     I'd call it a subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gentlemen, I'm not interested in baby bonuses. 
     <lb/>
     They may be good, they may be bad, but they are 
     <lb/>
     something for which our people must pay. I am 
     <lb/>
     only interested in the life-blood of this country, 
     <lb/>
     which permits individuals to make a living. Let's 
     <lb/>
     assume that a fisherman with four children under 
     <lb/>
     16 receives $288 baby bonus. What good is it to 
     <lb/>
     him if our marketing system is gone? The price 
     <lb/>
     of fish falls, and he receives only $5 a quintal 
     <lb/>
     where he might have received $10 on say 100 
 

            <cb/>
       

     quintals of fish. I am confident that at the moment 
     <lb/>
     we enter confederation our Fisheries Board, our 
     <lb/>
     whole system of marketing that has been built up 
     <lb/>
     at considerable cost by the government, will be 
     <lb/>
     demolished overnight, and that we will have the 
     <lb/>
     chaotic experience of the early twenties and the 
     <lb/>
     early thirties, when so many of our people are 
     <lb/>
     depending on this for a livelihood. Let's go back 
     <lb/>
     again to last September and October. The catch 
     <lb/>
     for 1947 was roughly 1.1 million quintals, and I 
     <lb/>
     am sure that if the $7 million had not been used 
     <lb/>
     to make exchange available, and if we hadn't had 
     <lb/>
     the system of marketing that we have today, the 
     <lb/>
     price of fish would have fallen at least $5 and 
     <lb/>
     might have been on sale. Let's assume it dropped 
     <lb/>
     $5 — $5.5 million, gentlemen, that was our baby 
     <lb/>
     bonus gone overboard right away. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All this being so, I cannot see what we can 
     <lb/>
     possibly gain from federal union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     We may even lose many of the advantages we 
     <lb/>
     now have. To summarise, gentlemen, it is my 
     <lb/>
     firm and considered opinion that under union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada we will bring about the following: 
     <lb/>
     the abolition of the Newfoundland Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Board; two, the abolition of compulsory inspec<lb break="no"/>tion and control of exports which have been so 
     <lb/>
     beneficial in the last few years; three, the bait 
     <lb/>
     system as a government facility, as the province 
     <lb/>
     could not afford to maintain the cost; four, we 
     <lb/>
     would be under the dictates of Ottawa with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the export of our fresh fish; five, we would be 
     <lb/>
     deprived of the power to negotiate our own trade 
     <lb/>
     agreements with any country, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     with the USA which could be so essential to our 
     <lb/>
     economy today; six, we would lose assistance 
     <lb/>
     from England in our current fish arrangements, 
     <lb/>
     thus running a great risk of losing our European 
     <lb/>
     markets; seven, the loss of the use of our surplus 
     <lb/>
     for anything by way of subsidy, particularly if we 
     <lb/>
     wish to use it for subsidising exchange as was 
     <lb/>
     done last fall. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, in 
     <lb/>
     view of this I say honestly, I feel this very 
     <lb/>
     definitely, I say to you all and to the country, 
     <lb/>
     think and think well before we vote to enter union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make 
     <lb/>
     a few remarks on the proposals now before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. Having had the honour of being a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Ottawa delegation I think that with the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge gained during our stay in Canada I 
     <lb/>
     can speak with a certain degree of assurance and 


            <pb n="1193"

     confidence on these proposals. I'd like to say that 
     <lb/>
     during my recent visit to Twillingate, and during 
     <lb/>
     1947 I was there about three weeks of the year, I 
     <lb/>
     found in the minds of some of the people a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount of confusion. I hope that I shall be able 
     <lb/>
     in some way to bring some order to the minds of 
     <lb/>
     those who were confused. Personally I consider 
     <lb/>
     these proposed arrangements good, and do not 
     <lb/>
     see how we can afford to turn them down. I am a 
     <lb/>
     pro-confederate. If we turn down these arrange<lb break="no"/>ments that the Canadian government has sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us, what have we to substitute for them? 
     <lb/>
     Canada is enjoying a marked degree of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, has a record of savings accounts, 
     <lb/>
     plentiful employment there and business is 
     <lb/>
     booming. It is, as has already been said, one of 
     <lb/>
     the most fortunate countries in the world. And if 
     <lb/>
     we cannot manage to do it with Canada at our 
     <lb/>
     back, however are we going to do it by ourselves? 
     <lb/>
     There are people today who question our ability 
     <lb/>
     to stand alone. They remember the time was 
     <lb/>
     when we had to look for somebody to assist us. 
     <lb/>
     At that time Great Britain came to our help — for 
     <lb/>
     which we should never be too thankful, and 
     <lb/>
     which we should never forget.... Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     unless we have Great Britain or Canada at our 
     <lb/>
     back, how long shall we be able to go alone? That 
     <lb/>
     is the question that is uppermost in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     some of the people today. They realise as I do that 
     <lb/>
     we are a small number of people, a small number 
     <lb/>
     of producers in a large area, and with a consider<lb break="no"/>able amount of our area cut off during the winter 
     <lb/>
     months with consequent loss of employment. I 
     <lb/>
     know on the other hand that our geographical 
     <lb/>
     position is a strategic one, and Canada realises 
     <lb/>
     that as well. There are people who live in the 
     <lb/>
     outports, and the life is quite different than here 
     <lb/>
     in the city. I represent an outport district, and I 
     <lb/>
     know the conditions under which our people out 
     <lb/>
     there had to live. I do not think that the British 
     <lb/>
     government made any mistake when they had a 
     <lb/>
     proviso in electing members to this Convention 
     <lb/>
     that they had to reside in the district for which 
     <lb/>
     they were elected. I hope that when we get back 
     <lb/>
     our government there will be some such proviso, 
     <lb/>
     so that the majority of outport districts will not be 
     <lb/>
     represented by people who live in St. John's and 
     <lb/>
     the Avalon Peninsula. How do you think the 
     <lb/>
     people in St. John's would like to be represented 
     <lb/>
     by a man living down in White Bay? It is 
     <lb/>
     preposterous to think of it.... 


            <cb/>
          

     Our economy is a limited economy. Our gross 
     <lb/>
     national earning power is far lower than the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian earning power. And I wonder how long 
     <lb/>
     our surplus is going to last us. I don't think any 
     <lb/>
     member of this Convention has prophesied how 
     <lb/>
     long our surplus is going to last, and what we're 
     <lb/>
     going to do when that surplus is gone. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, we just can't do for the great majority of 
     <lb/>
     our people what we would like to do, and give 
     <lb/>
     them the things that we would like to give them. 
     <lb/>
     We can't close our eyes to economic factors. My 
     <lb/>
     advice to the members of this Convention is to 
     <lb/>
     examine these terms dispassionately, cooly and 
     <lb/>
     in the light of economics. We are a small number 
     <lb/>
     of people, yet we are a proud and sturdy race. But 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, Mr. Chairman, I do not see why 
     <lb/>
     we should always want to remain independent 
     <lb/>
     and isolated, particularly when there is a neigh<lb break="no"/>bour that's been good to us, Canada, these last 
     <lb/>
     few years — what would we have done if we 
     <lb/>
     hadn't got them? Only last fall, as far as I under<lb break="no"/>stand we wanted 60,000 sacks of flour. We sent 
     <lb/>
     up to Canada; the request was granted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They charged us double what they 
     <lb/>
     should have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Well, they've given to England 
     <lb/>
     what England certainly deserved after what she's 
     <lb/>
     gone through.... Canada has certainly backed her 
     <lb/>
     up, and certainly has done her share in order to 
     <lb/>
     help out the old country, that has been 
     <lb/>
     demolished and bore the brunt, and marched to 
     <lb/>
     victory for civilisation. Now surely the 12 million 
     <lb/>
     people in Canada can't be wrong in the nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces when they joined up together. And as 
     <lb/>
     far as I'm concerned, the form of government 
     <lb/>
     which worked for 12 million people will work for 
     <lb/>
     12,327,000, if the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     decide to go in there. We would then have a 
     <lb/>
     country where our young men could go when the 
     <lb/>
     fishery was over in the fall of the year, particular<lb break="no"/>ly if the fishery was poor; they could go from 
     <lb/>
     Halifax to Vancouver and earn other monies 
     <lb/>
     rather than be unemployed. The whole range of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian cities would be open for them. And if 
     <lb/>
     some of them want to go there and settle down, 
     <lb/>
     and make homes like a lot of Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     have, who are we to say that they shouldn't? .... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we are dependent on Great Britain and 
     <lb/>
     Canada to help to defend our shores. We haven't 
     <lb/>
     got a submarine or a warship of our own. But we 
     <lb/>
     have the men, and the men in the past have played

     their part nobly for defence of empire. It has been 
     <lb/>
     said by some member here that we may have a 
     <lb/>
     war at any time. Perhaps we may. And we realise 
     <lb/>
     that these countries have recognised the strategic 
     <lb/>
     position of Newfoundland; and not only that, the 
     <lb/>
     great United States of America has bases here in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. These bases are part of a plan of 
     <lb/>
     defense for the western hemisphere. I don't think 
     <lb/>
     that Canada is going to make any move as regards 
     <lb/>
     these American bases, particularly as it works in 
     <lb/>
     with their scheme of defense.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I know that time is running short, and it 
     <lb/>
     is not my intention to go through all these terms 
     <lb/>
     which have been fully explained by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. Members have had as much ex<lb break="no"/>planation on these terms as probably they want. 
     <lb/>
     But there are a few points that I would like to 
     <lb/>
     touch on, such as the slight change in our form of 
     <lb/>
     taxation, and in the manner of raising taxes, 
     <lb/>
     which may have to be made if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. But we must not assume that 
     <lb/>
     because we have been accustomed to a certain 
     <lb/>
     way of taxation for 100 years of so, that that way 
     <lb/>
     is according to the law of the Medes and Persians 
     <lb/>
     and cannot be changed. If it is in the interest of 
     <lb/>
     the masses of the people for a change to be made, 
     <lb/>
     then certainly it should be made. Very few people 
     <lb/>
     know exactly how much taxes they're paying. I 
     <lb/>
     doubt it.... Personally I can't say what taxes I'm 
     <lb/>
     paying. All I know, according to the last budget 
     <lb/>
     speech that was delivered, is that 54% of our 
     <lb/>
     revenue was collected through the Customs, 
     <lb/>
     something over $20 million. Under these terms 
     <lb/>
     it's estimated that we shall be paying $2 million. 
     <lb/>
     According to that, there would be a saving of $18 
     <lb/>
     million. Well, suppose we do have to find ... new 
     <lb/>
     taxation of $5-6 million. Well, aren't we saving 
     <lb/>
     a considerable amount then? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Don't forget the profit on the 
     <lb/>
     duty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Yes that's right, there is a profit 
     <lb/>
     on the duty. Now the people who have to go to 
     <lb/>
     the bank and get the money to pay into the 
     <lb/>
     government chest, they're not going to get that 
     <lb/>
     money from the bank without interest. And if 
     <lb/>
     they have money of their own, well, their money 
     <lb/>
     is generally able to earn some interest. That's 
     <lb/>
     how the world is run. These people can't really 
     <lb/>
     be expected to take their money and pay the 
     <lb/>
     government without getting a certain profit on it. 
 <lb/>

            <cb/>
        

     But if they don't have to make that outlay on 
     <lb/>
     government duties, then they can't make a profit 
     <lb/>
     on it. And it's quite clear that the cost of living 
     <lb/>
     will come down, and people will have then more 
     <lb/>
     money to spend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now so far as I am aware, no province has 
     <lb/>
     seceded from the Canadian confederation. There 
     <lb/>
     are nine provinces and not one of them has 
     <lb/>
     seceded. If things were so bad in Canada why 
     <lb/>
     is it that one of the provinces has not left? During 
     <lb/>
     my stay in Canada I questioned a captain of one 
     <lb/>
     of the boats in which I was travelling, and I asked, 
     <lb/>
     "What about all this talk we hear down in New<lb break="no"/>foundland sometimes, that you people, not being 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with confederation, would like to get out 
     <lb/>
     of it?" "Sir," he said, "I never heard talk of it." .... 
     <lb/>
     Do you think that Canada would send an army 
     <lb/>
     down here to keep us in confederation if we 
     <lb/>
     wanted to get out of it? I think it would be the 
     <lb/>
     other way around.... In union is strength. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that some real and marked increases in the money 
     <lb/>
     that the people would have in their pockets would 
     <lb/>
     ensue as a result of confederation. And if New<lb break="no"/>foundland, after her surplus was used up ...<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     naturally, being a part of Canada, we would know 
     <lb/>
     where to look in order to get help. We have a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous overhead in Newfoundland. We 
     <lb/>
     have the trappings of an elephant and the back of 
     <lb/>
     a cat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Somebody has remarked that the terms might 
     <lb/>
     be improved. But I read here in Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     King's letter that the government could not readi<lb break="no"/>ly contemplate any change in these arrangements 
     <lb/>
     which would impose larger financial burdens on 
     <lb/>
     Canada. We know that the economy of a country 
     <lb/>
     can change very quickly. We have been very 
     <lb/>
     fortunate in Newfoundland these last few years, 
     <lb/>
     in that millions of dollars have come in here from 
     <lb/>
     Canada and from the United States of America. 
     <lb/>
     We have had good prices for our fish, and the 
     <lb/>
     result is that we have built up a surplus. But let 
     <lb/>
     us not forget that we are spending this year about 
     <lb/>
     $40 million. How long can we go on spending 
     <lb/>
     such a sum of money as that? It is only for the 
     <lb/>
     price of fish to drop and of certain other basic 
     <lb/>
     commodities, for the beginnings of a depression 
     <lb/>
     to start again. We are dependent upon world 
     <lb/>
     markets and dependent upon countries overseas 
     <lb/>
     to take our products, in Europe and the West 
     <lb/>
     Indies as regards the fishery, and America to take

     our paper — we are very fortunate in being able 
     <lb/>
     to sell America paper, because it gives us a lot of 
     <lb/>
     American dollars. We know that Canada has a 
     <lb/>
     shortage of American dollars, that does not 
     <lb/>
     reflect any weakness in Canada, nor would it 
     <lb/>
     reflect any particular strength in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     because she happened to have a surplus of 
     <lb/>
     American dollars. It's only a matter of having 
     <lb/>
     goods available which America wants and can 
     <lb/>
     take. How do we know that we can get these 
     <lb/>
     terms extended, if we turn them down now? If 
     <lb/>
     there's any doubt about being able to get better 
     <lb/>
     terms, then why not ask our government? There's 
     <lb/>
     been a lot of talk about governments negotiating 
     <lb/>
     instead of members of a delegation, so why not 
     <lb/>
     ask the Commission of Government to inquire 
     <lb/>
     and see whether or not Canada can improve upon 
     <lb/>
     the terms, and then we'd know for sure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We would be part of a bigger country should 
     <lb/>
     we join up with Canada, and it is thought by some 
     <lb/>
     that within five years there may be economic 
     <lb/>
     union between Canada and America I am not one 
     <lb/>
     who thinks that Newfoundland would stand 
     <lb/>
     much of a chance of getting economic terms from 
     <lb/>
     America separately from Canada. The Bond- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Blaine treaty proved that to us.... Is it reasonable 
     <lb/>
     to think that America would do for New<lb break="no"/>foundland and her people what she wouldn't be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to do with her largest customer — 
     <lb/>
     Canada? How far could Newfoundland get with 
     <lb/>
     the Bond-Blaine treaty when Canada stepped in 
     <lb/>
     and said, "What about our fishermen? What are 
     <lb/>
     you going to do for our fishermen?" And surely 
     <lb/>
     she had had as much right to look after the rights 
     <lb/>
     of her fishermen as the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment had to look after the rights of hers? If there 
     <lb/>
     is any economic union coming between Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the States, we, if we were part of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     would certainly come in under it at that time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, if we can now barely balance our 
     <lb/>
     budget, what are we to expect except deficits and 
     <lb/>
     borrowing when the sunny days are over and our 
     <lb/>
     surplus reduced, and economic storms and world 
     <lb/>
     depressions beset our path? If our people now, 
     <lb/>
     with high revenues and high prices for paper, fish 
     <lb/>
     and minerals, can only moderately get along, how 
     <lb/>
     are they going to get along unless we can reduce 
     <lb/>
     taxation by ourselves? We have in Labrador 
     <lb/>
     tremendous resources, but unfortunately we in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland haven't the capital to develop 
     <lb/>
     them. Look at the three big companies which 


            <cb/>
   

     operate in Newfoundland now — the AND Com<lb break="no"/>pany, Bowaters and the Buchans Mining Com<lb break="no"/>pany, how much of their capital came from 
     <lb/>
     outside? We have to look for outside capital to 
     <lb/>
     come in and help to develop these great natural 
     <lb/>
     resources. Some people consider that confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is inevitable in time, but I say why not now? 
     <lb/>
     It has been said by Mr. Smallwood that we're 
     <lb/>
     about the size of a small city, split up into 1,300 
     <lb/>
     communities. We have to find the communica<lb break="no"/>tions, transport and facilities to run New<lb break="no"/>foundland and give our people as good services 
     <lb/>
     as we possibly can. As I said before, if we can't 
     <lb/>
     do it with the millions that Canada is prepared to 
     <lb/>
     give us, however are we going to do it by oursel<lb break="no"/>ves? Some people are just waiting for the time to 
     <lb/>
     come to mark their ballots for confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, as regards provincial government 
     <lb/>
     taxes. We realise that if we become a province 
     <lb/>
     we shall have a smaller revenue then we have at 
     <lb/>
     the present time. But what will that mean? That 
     <lb/>
     will mean of necessity a closer watch on how 
     <lb/>
     these taxes are expended. We have had to cut the 
     <lb/>
     garment according to the cloth. And if taxes were 
     <lb/>
     raised clearly and squarely, no doubt they will be 
     <lb/>
     well spent because the people will take an interest 
     <lb/>
     in how they are being spent when they know 
     <lb/>
     exactly what taxes they are paying. I maintain the 
     <lb/>
     people do not know exactly how much taxes they 
     <lb/>
     are paying, except as a gross sum when we get 
     <lb/>
     the budget at the end of the fiscal year. I have 
     <lb/>
     reason to believe that a closer scrutiny will be 
     <lb/>
     exercised by our people and a closer watch on 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. If fairly applied and wisely spent, 
     <lb/>
     true value will be received by our people.... The 
     <lb/>
     government is put in the saddle by the people but 
     <lb/>
     the people are the final masters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been said here that it would be criminal 
     <lb/>
     to accept these proposals. I can't understand that 
     <lb/>
     reasoning. Do members think ... that Canada 
     <lb/>
     would submit anything to us that would be 
     <lb/>
     criminal to accept? Nonsense! Now, if we join up 
     <lb/>
     with Canada, we would be within the great 
     <lb/>
     British Empire. I believe that we would make a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous amount of progress with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The difference in the per capita debt of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundland has been spoken of: yes, there 
     <lb/>
     is quite a difference. But look at the resources of 
     <lb/>
     the two countries, see them as you come across 
     <lb/>
     them, the broad expanse of Canada from the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic to the Pacific. Look at her resources. The 


            <pb n="1196"

            <fw type="num">1196</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
       

     United States with a population of almost ten 
     <lb/>
     times that of Canada has a greater per capita debt; 
     <lb/>
     and England has a bigger per capita debt than 
     <lb/>
     either Canada or the United States. But does that 
     <lb/>
     say they'll ever default as we did? They can raise 
     <lb/>
     their loans and get along. We know that in 
     <lb/>
     England there had to be an austerity programme. 
     <lb/>
     but we know something of the great fight she 
     <lb/>
     put up and what she's gone through. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     if we join up with Canada that there will be more 
     <lb/>
     Canadian tourists coming down here. That is a 
     <lb/>
     thing we want — more tourists. We have a 
     <lb/>
     wonderful climate here. Those of us who were 
     <lb/>
     members of the Ottawa delegation know some<lb break="no"/>thing of the heat that is experienced up there, and 
     <lb/>
     what a relief it would be to get out and get down 
     <lb/>
     to a place like Newfoundland in the summer time; 
     <lb/>
     and these people have the money. We saw their 
     <lb/>
     cars up there, cars from the States coming down 
     <lb/>
     through Canada — tourists spending their 
     <lb/>
     American money. I believe that they'd come to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland too, enjoy our climate, our natural 
     <lb/>
     beauty and our fishing. But we want a road joined 
     <lb/>
     up with the Humber valley, and if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada, we can make a national park 
     <lb/>
     over there somewhere, and Canada keeps up the 
     <lb/>
     roads in national parks. I believe that with this 
     <lb/>
     ferry that the Canadian government will put on 
     <lb/>
     the Gulf to bring across the cars to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, that there will be a lot of Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     American money coming into Newfoundland....<ref target="#fn_09">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     Now the question is can we do that ourselves? 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> this afternoon has spoken about 
     <lb/>the fisheries. I would like to refer to the fisheries 
     <lb/>as well. It was a very sad thing that happened 
     <lb/>when we were in Ottawa this year, the death of 
     <lb/>the Hon. Frank Bridges, who was Minister of 
     <lb/>Fisheries for Canada.... It was certainly very 
     <lb/>pleasant to meet such a man.... I believe that we 
     <lb/>would have had quite a bit more information 
     <lb/>about the fisheries if it hadn't been for the death 
     <lb/>of Mr. Bridges. I would like to read from infor<lb break="no"/>mation that has been placed on the desks of 
     <lb/>members.... It says here that the "Deputy Minister 
     <lb/>of Fisheries pointed out that there was in Canada 
     <lb/>a growing movement in support of regulatory 
     <lb/>measures of the type enforced in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>The establishment of the Canadian Fisheries 
     <lb/>Price Support Board which would be set up short<lb break="no"/>ly (by the way, sir, that has now been set up) 
 

            <cb/>
        

     would have considerable influence and it might 
     <lb/>
     be expected that federal policy would evolve in 
     <lb/>
     the direction of the measures already adopted in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Mr. St. Laurent stated that it 
     <lb/>
     could be provided in the terms of union that 
     <lb/>
     fisheries legislation presently enforced in New<lb break="no"/>foundland would remain in force until amended 
     <lb/>
     or repealed by the appropriate legislative 
     <lb/>
     authority." I understand that all laws that are on 
     <lb/>
     the statute book in Newfoundland at the time of 
     <lb/>
     union remain operative and are still the laws of 
     <lb/>
     the province until they are repealed or amended, 
     <lb/>
     "The federal government," it goes on to say, 
     <lb/>
     "would not be disposed to interfere with the 
     <lb/>
     system presently in effect in Newfoundland, un<lb break="no"/>less it proposed to introduce legislation which 
     <lb/>
     would represent an improvement over present 
     <lb/>
     regulations, and therefore would not be likely to 
     <lb/>
     repeal Newfoundland legislation in order to 
     <lb/>
     remove a regulatory system which had proven 
     <lb/>
     beneficial. The Newfoundland fishing industry 
     <lb/>
     must reasonably be informed that it need an<lb break="no"/>ticipate nothing prejudicial in this respect as a

     tion here from some of the fish producing provin<lb break="no"/>ces, probably two of them, Nova Scotia I know 
     <lb/>
     was represented...

     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Four of them last fall, to confer 
     <lb/>
     with the Fisheries Board and certain others and I 
     <lb/>
     believe that they may possibly be taking our 
     <lb/>
     Board as a pattern. I believe the Fisheries Board 
     <lb/>
     has done a good job, and taking that as a pattern, 
     <lb/>
     there will be evolved everything necessary for the 
     <lb/>
     orderly marketing of the fish catches of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and the other provinces. This, as I would 
     <lb/>
     like to explain, is an act which was drawn up in 
     <lb/>
     order to stabilise prices if the need arose, and to 
     <lb/>
     give the primary producer reasonable and proper 
     <lb/>
     return for his fishery product. If on account of 
     <lb/>
     conditions in the markets the catch couldn't be 
     <lb/>
     disposed of, they would see that the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     did not suffer. The Board has the power to go in 
     <lb/>
     and buy the fish and then dispose of it and if 
     <lb/>
     necessary deficits can be paid out of the Con<lb break="no"/>solidated Revenue Fund. Someone asked me a 
     <lb/>
     question, Mr. Chairman. I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government marketed the apple crop 
     <lb/>
     from Canada and put certain prices on it at which 
     <lb/>
     they paid the man who got the apples. And then 
     <lb/>
     they went and they marketed them, and I believe 
     <lb/>
     gave some of them to England.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They gave them away.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> They gave some of them, and 
     <lb/>
     saw to it that the man who produced them didn't 
     <lb/>
     suffer. That is the idea behind this Fisheries Sup<lb break="no"/>port Act. That rather than the producers should 
     <lb/>
     suffer, they would buy the whole catch if neces<lb break="no"/>sary...

     properly they could go to work and dispose of it

            <p>Such, Mr. Chairman, is a gist of the act for the

            <p>
     I feel that there are a lot of Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     living in Canada who would like to see us join up 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. That was the sentiment that was 
     <lb/>
     expressed to me by quite a few that I met during 
     <lb/>
     the past summer. We realise that if we go into 
     <lb/>
     Canada we shall have those social benefits which 
     <lb/>
     Canada is giving her people — the family al<lb break="no"/>lowances, which to my mind are good and very 
     <lb/>
     beneficial. It puts the money right in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the people who need it most, and I certainly can't 
     <lb/>
     see anything wrong about that. It would give our 
     <lb/>
     aged people, to whom Newfoundland doesn't 
     <lb/>
     give the old age pension now until they get 75 ... 
     <lb/>
     the pension at the age of 70. We would be able to 
     <lb/>
     participate in these benefits.

            <p>
     Now, sir, it has been mentioned here about the 
     <lb/>
     sales tax. I believe that the income tax has been 
     <lb/>
     already reduced a couple of times 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     is currently thought that the sales tax will be the 
     <lb/>
     next tax to be cut. At present it is 8%. We realise 
     <lb/>
     that at the present time prices are inflated. A few 
     <lb/>
     years ago, when I had the honour to have a seat 
     <lb/>
     in the Assembly, we were trying to run the 
     <lb/>
     country on about $9 million and of course it 
     <lb/>
     couldn't be done. We just had to go out and 
     <lb/>
     borrow money, year after year. There were a 
     <lb/>
     good many deficits, and after a while, when our 
     <lb/>
     credit gave out and we couldn't borrow anymore, 
     <lb/>
     we lost our government. These family allowan<lb break="no"/>ces alone are estimated to bring in about $8 
     <lb/>
     million, over 50 years, $400 million. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> But are we assured that they're not 
     <lb/>
     going to cut that out?

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Suppose they cut it out in two years' 
     <lb/>time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> If they cut it out then the taxes 
     <lb/>
     will be less, and our people will benefit that way. 
     <lb/>
     But there's no evidence that family allowances 
     <lb/>
     will be cut out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Family allowances, cut them 
     <lb/>
     out? Why, the government that tried would cut its 
     <lb/>
     own throat from ear to ear. They're not going to 
     <lb/>
     do it with their eyes open. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, if we go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation we shall be transferring certain 
     <lb/>
     powers to Canada, but we shall be reserving 
     <lb/>
     others to ourselves. There can be no fear of our 
     <lb/>
     losing the Labrador. The responsible government 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland one time offered to sell the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, twice. I hope they don't try it again.... 
     <lb/>
     We want the tremendous wealth of Labrador, but 
     <lb/>
     we in Newfoundland haven't got the capital our<lb break="no"/>selves to develop it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Neither has Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Canada and the States can help 
     <lb/>
     to develop the Labrador. That's what I main<lb break="no"/>tain.... And I believe that were we to join up with 
     <lb/>
     Canada and become a province more Canadian 
     <lb/>
     money would be forthcoming to help develop 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. There can be no doubt at all of our 
     <lb/>
     ownership of Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to refer briefly to the benefits 
     <lb/>
     which war veterans would receive. I've already 
     <lb/>
     enumerated them. The great benefit is the war 
     <lb/>
     veterans' allowance, by which a qualified veteran 
     <lb/>
     when he attains the age of 60 may get an al<lb break="no"/>lowance for himself and for his wife, and for the 
     <lb/>
     widow of a war veteran at the age of 55. If he is 
     <lb/>
     incapacitated and unable to earn before he 
     <lb/>
     reaches the age of 60, he may be able to get 
     <lb/>
     something then. This is a great thing for the war 
     <lb/>
     veterans of Newfoundland.... We know that the 
     <lb/>
     benefits extended to veterans by Canada were 
     <lb/>
     extra good. Provision was given for fishermen on 
     <lb/>
     provincial lands, whereby they would get a grant, 
     <lb/>
     which they didn't have to repay, of $2,320. We 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland allowed them $700. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We're told that within eight years ... we'll 
     <lb/>
     have a royal commission to assess the whole 
     <lb/>
     picture of Newfoundland. It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     Canada might have made a mistake in the prema<lb break="no"/>ture withdrawal of price controls. We know that 
 

            <cb/>
           

     when controls and rationing are removed, there 
     <lb/>
     generally follows inflationary pressure. Rapid 
     <lb/>
     spending sometimes is the result when controls 
     <lb/>
     come off. The shortage of American dollars does 
     <lb/>
     not mean that Canada is financially or fundamen<lb break="no"/>tally weak. We recognise that the trend of the 
     <lb/>
     times is for greater union. Look at the British 
     <lb/>
     West Indies at the present time, see how they are 
     <lb/>
     beginning to confederate, how they are joining up 
     <lb/>
     and seeing how they can pool their resources and 
     <lb/>
     work together. We in Newfoundland have no 
     <lb/>
     control over export markets. Years ago, and in the 
     <lb/>
     depression, our exports dropped from about $39 
     <lb/>
     million to $23 million, and our fish exports 
     <lb/>
     dropped from $15 million to $6 million. Some 
     <lb/>
     people wonder when this economic recession 
     <lb/>
     may start again. The ebb and flow of trade is after 
     <lb/>
     all — trade is a two-way street so to speak. It's a 
     <lb/>
     one-way street going backwards with traffic 
     <lb/>
     going and coming on it. And we know that over 
     <lb/>
     in Europe they want our fish and they must 
     <lb/>
     naturally be able to give us something that we can 
     <lb/>
     use to convert into the means of buying what we 
     <lb/>
     require This was amply provided this fall when 
     <lb/>
     the difficulty of sterling exchange became most 
     <lb/>
     acute. Fortunately, we had the money on the other 
     <lb/>
     side and the Commission negotiated and the 
     <lb/>
     result has been a great thing for our fishermen. 
     <lb/>
     We have other years ahead to look forward to, 
     <lb/>
     and we have to realise that in this matter of trade 
     <lb/>
     we are, so to speak, one world. We are dependent 
     <lb/>
     one upon the other. This was amply exemplified 
     <lb/>
     this year when it was explained that our sale of 
     <lb/>
     fish in Spain depends upon the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     taking Spanish oranges. For awhile the sales were 
     <lb/>
     held up but finally, when Great Britain bought 
     <lb/>
     these oranges from Spain, it gave the Spanish 
     <lb/>
     some sterling in order to buy our fish. While we 
     <lb/>
     are dependent upon these markets in Europe and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere, we realise what a great economic 
     <lb/>
     question is before us. We realise how these 
     <lb/>
     economic forces work, and that they, when not 
     <lb/>
     properly controlled, are the means of starting 
     <lb/>
     depressions. We are benefitting from the result of 
     <lb/>
     war prices. The inflated prices of the war are still 
     <lb/>
     in effect, they've not yet subsided. Peoples of the 
     <lb/>
     world are trying to settle down in a changing 
     <lb/>
     world, and we know that after the last war a sharp 
     <lb/>
     collapse in prices resulted in many failures. Ex<lb break="no"/>port prices for fish were cut in half between 1920 
     <lb/>
     and 1923.... Relief was required in quite a few

     places. I maintain that when prices get back to 
     <lb/>
     normal, we can't reasonably expect 325,000 
     <lb/>
     people to keep on raising $40 million in taxes. 
     <lb/>
     The progress of a country is limited to the amount 
     <lb/>
     of money the people can earn. As a government 
     <lb/>
     we shall want to balance our budget, or as near 
     <lb/>
     as possible. We realise that the amount of money 
     <lb/>
     that Canada is prepared to give us over the first 
     <lb/>
     12 years of union will be a help in trying to get 
     <lb/>
     the provincial form of government operative, 
     <lb/>
     providing that the Newfoundland people decide 
     <lb/>
     to enter into confederation. Our surplus can be 
     <lb/>
     used if necessary for certain things which would 
     <lb/>
     help our province. There is a provision that a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of it has to be put on interest. This 
     <lb/>
     surplus will be a great help to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     because there are certain things which we need 
     <lb/>
     to have done. We want a further extension of our 
     <lb/>
     road programme. We shall have certain other 
     <lb/>
     needs which will be evident from time to time. I 
     <lb/>
     don't fear any great difficulty to arise from the 
     <lb/>
     change in taxation if we enter the Canadian con<lb break="no"/>federation. We're going in with a country which 
     <lb/>
     is a big and wealthy country. The fact that Canada 
     <lb/>
     has got a seat on the United Nations Security 
     <lb/>
     Council this year proves that it is not immature 
     <lb/>
     politically; but that it is attaining full maturity 
     <lb/>
     amongst nations. I had the honour myself of 
     <lb/>
     attending one of the sessions last fall when I 
     <lb/>
     happened to be in New York. I went to the United 
     <lb/>
     Nations meeting. It was quite an experience. I 
     <lb/>
     found that the afternoon when I was there the 
     <lb/>
     committee on Palestine was meeting for its first 
     <lb/>
     session, and all the seats which were ordinarily 
     <lb/>
     available for visitors had been occupied.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Will you state your point, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ashbourne? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I don't think the United Nations 
     <lb/>
     Council has anything to do with this discussion, 
     <lb/>
     and there are other speakers to comment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Which is a point well taken, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ashboume. Frankly, I can't see what possible 
     <lb/>
     connection there can be between the meeting on 
     <lb/>
     Palestine affairs to which you refer and the busi<lb break="no"/>ness before the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Sir, I was just going to say that 
     <lb/>
     I was at that meeting of the United Nations in 
     <lb/>
     order to counteract the remark that Canada was 
     <lb/>
     immature politically. Canada today is the third 
     <lb/>
     largest trading nation.... Her aid to Europe has 


            <cb/>
         

     been greater than even that of the great United 
     <lb/>
     States itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been mentioned here about the duty 
     <lb/>
     that's put on pork and beef coming into Canada 
     <lb/>
     from the States. Does any member think here that 
     <lb/>
     the cows that grow in the States are better then 
     <lb/>
     the cows that grow in Canada? Or the pigs that 
     <lb/>
     grow in the States are better then the pigs that 
     <lb/>
     grow in Canada? No. Years gone by, sir, I saw 
     <lb/>
     some of these animals slaughtered myself in the 
     <lb/>
     Canada Packers plant in Toronto, put out in huge 
     <lb/>
     quarters, some of them put out in cuts for the 
     <lb/>
     Royal York Hotel. Now it's only reasonable to 
     <lb/>
     think that there would be some protection granted 
     <lb/>
     to Canada on pork and beef coming in there, and 
     <lb/>
     I think ... that if we could get all the beef that we 
     <lb/>
     want in Canada, there won't be very much com<lb break="no"/>ing in from the States at a duty of $4 a barrel. 
     <lb/>
     Flour is being subsidised to a certain extent in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, with the result that the Canadian people 
     <lb/>
     are paying less for flour than we are. Flour at $20 
     <lb/>
     a barrel in Newfoundland, it's quite an item, quite 
     <lb/>
     an item. I believe also that they're paying a 
     <lb/>
     subsidy on soap. You can buy a cake of soap in 
     <lb/>
     Canada for 8 cents.... Somebody said the other 
     <lb/>
     day there was 126 taxes on a pair of shoes...<ref target="#fn_11">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Ashbourne, I'd like to ad<lb break="no"/>dress myself to members generally on two points. 
     <lb/>One is, I would like members to be as brief as 
     <lb/>they possibly can. The time is running out and 
     <lb/>I'm not going to permit a filibuster. I'll stop that, 
     <lb/>if I have to put the closure motion... I've with<lb break="no"/>held this motion for 48 hours in order to permit 
     <lb/>members who had not had the opportunity of 
     <lb/>addressing themselves on the matter to be af<lb break="no"/>forded the opportunity of so doing.... I have to ask 
     <lb/>members, will they please at this stage make their 
     <lb/>remarks as terse and as brief as possible, bearing 
     <lb/>in mind the fact that there are a number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers who have not had the opportunity of speak<lb break="no"/>ing, and again bearing in mind that my purpose 
     <lb/>in deferring this motion is going to be defeated if 
     <lb/>one member is going to occupy the floor to the 
     <lb/>exclusion of other members who are entitled to 
     <lb/>equal treatment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next point, is a request that I want to make, 
     <lb/>
     and it arises out of some remarks made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood before we went into committee this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, when he directed my attention to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the Hon. R.B. Job would like to speak in

     the matter.... My position is simply this, and I 
     <lb/>
     have to appeal to the generosity of members. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job has been very ill, and I know what I'm talking 
     <lb/>
     about because his doctor brought the question 
     <lb/>
     before me since Mr. Job insisted that he was 
     <lb/>
     going to come into this House contrary to his 
     <lb/>
     doctor's instructions, when he shouldn't attempt 
     <lb/>
     to walk across the sueet. I called on Mr. Job and 
     <lb/>
     pointed out to him what a great risk he was 
     <lb/>
     taking.... I felt it my duty to communicate with 
     <lb/>
     him as a result of the remarks that were made by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood this afternoon, and Mr. Job in<lb break="no"/>timated that his doctor may allow him to appear 
     <lb/>
     for a few minutes when the evening session 
     <lb/>
     begins. As far as I'm concerned, I'm prepared to 
     <lb/>
     sit here until 3 or 4 o'clock tomorrow morning on 
     <lb/>
     condition that Mr. Job should be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     speak. He isn't going to speak very long, and it's 
     <lb/>
     my intention to ask him to remain in his seat. I 
     <lb/>
     think having regard to all the attendant cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances the House will endorse my action. I 
     <lb/>
     have no power, of course, to take the floor away 
     <lb/>
     from the speaker. But I would appeal to your 
     <lb/>
     good nature, gentlemen, and ask you that should 
     <lb/>
     it develop that the Hon. Mr. Job is permitted by 
     <lb/>
     his doctor to attend the evening session for a few 
     <lb/>
     minutes, would the member who then has the 
     <lb/>
     floor be good enough to yield it for a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments, so that Mr. Job may be able to express 
     <lb/>
     himself briefly on the question.... It may very well 
     <lb/>
     be that we would be doing a great kindness in 
     <lb/>
     enabling Mr. Job to discharge a duty which has 
     <lb/>
     been troubling him now for some two weeks. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I ask the member who may be occupy<lb break="no"/>ing the floor at 8 o'clock, would he kindly con<lb break="no"/>sider yielding to Mr. Job when he comes.... I 
     <lb/>
     assure you the circumstances are very urgent.... 
     <lb/>
     Would you be good enough to go ahead, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ashboume.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, I want it dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly understood that I am not a party to any

     filibuster. I don't believe in any such tactics.... I 
     <lb/>
     think that you will admit, and members will 
     <lb/>
     admit, that I haven't taken up a very great amount 
     <lb/>
     of time in this Convention.

     <lb/>sent here by the Canadian government. I want to 
     <lb/>congratulate the member for Bonavista Centre, 
     <lb/>who in his own masterly manner has explained 
     <lb/>the meaning and the application of these terms. I 
     <lb/>must confess that to me Mr. Smallwood is a 
     <lb/>magician with words, and I have listened to him 
     <lb/>repeating and repeating the points that he wanted 
     <lb/>to stress and to be remembered by the radio 
     <lb/>audience. And he has shown the same ability to 
     <lb/>side-step and gloss over the shaded and dark spots 
     <lb/>that for his purpose might best remain hidden and 
     <lb/>ignored. Mr. Smallwood, by his ability to outtalk 
     <lb/>and outguess any member here, has usually had 
     <lb/>the last word time and again. He has drawn one 
     <lb/>or other of us away from our point that he did not 
     <lb/>wish to discuss, and then having his opponent in 
     <lb/>deep water, so to speak, he has proceeded to 
     <lb/>drown him by something irrelevant to the case in 
     <lb/>point. Mr. Smallwood has reminded me of a 
     <lb/>French chef who, with a few scraps of leftovers, 
     <lb/>can combine them and with a little flavour make 
     <lb/>it appear a dish for a king. But unfortunately, in 
     <lb/>this instance, it is not the appearance that matters, 
     <lb/>much less Mr. Smallwood's ability to debate it. 
     <lb/>We cannot live in a beautiful picture or a fantastic 
     <lb/>dream, because we do not live in a land of make- 
     <lb break="yes"/>believe. We live in a hard world, where facts and 
     <lb/>not debates are the most important things.

     A few days ago in the papers, there was an 


            <pb n="1202"

     account of a trial of a famous Dutch painter. This 
     <lb/>
     man was on trial for collaboration with the Ger<lb break="no"/>mans when they were in Holland. He was ac<lb break="no"/>cused of selling to them some of the world's 
     <lb/>
     famed Dutch paintings. His defense was that the 
     <lb/>
     paintings were not genuine, but were all fake. 
     <lb/>
     Experts were called in, not Canadian experts, to 
     <lb/>
     express their opinion, and experts agreed that the 
     <lb/>
     paintings in question were genuine, 200 to 300 
     <lb/>
     years old. The accused Dutchman was in a tough 
     <lb/>
     spot. In order to clear himself he dumbfounded 
     <lb/>
     the experts by showing how he did it; how he 
     <lb/>
     mixed the paint to make them seem 100 years old, 
     <lb/>
     and how he prepared the canvas to give it an aged 
     <lb/>
     appearance. And before the eyes of the experts 
     <lb/>
     he showed that the pictures, supposed to be 
     <lb/>
     genuine, were really fake pictures; and while he 
     <lb/>
     himself was a faker, that those who believed the 
     <lb/>
     pictures were genuine fools to have been taken 
     <lb/>
     in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not insinuating in any way that our good 
     <lb/>
     member for Bonavista Centre is a faker — far 
     <lb/>
     from it. But I do think that the picture is com<lb break="no"/>parable inasmuch as what seems to be a genuine 
     <lb/>
     thing to many people, when closely examined is 
     <lb/>
     not genuine at all. There have been times since 
     <lb/>
     this Canadian business has been debated and as I 
     <lb/>
     listened to Mr. Smallwood's description of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, I have wondered if it were not some 
     <lb/>
     never-never land that he was talking about, or the 
     <lb/>
     lost Atlantis that some of the poets have written 
     <lb/>
     about. Mr. Smallwood's description of that 
     <lb/>
     country leaves an overall picture of a present-day 
     <lb/>
     Utopia, where the sun shines every day and 
     <lb/>
     where everyone goes singing on his way. One is 
     <lb/>
     reminded of Mr. Macaulay's rhyme that we 
     <lb/>
     learned in our school books: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>But unfortunately we are not living in the great

     <lb/>be described in terms of dollars and cents rather 
     <lb/>then in poems. And the issue before us here in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland is whether we want to have 
     <lb/>another country take us over, or whether we want 
     <lb/>to go on being Newfoundlanders.

            <p>There are certain indisputable facts which I 


            <cb/>
        

     did not manufacture. They are published by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, and these facts we must 
     <lb/>
     bear in mind in connection with this confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, because they have a most serious impact on 
     <lb/>
     our position as part of Canada. In 1945, 
     <lb/>
     2,365,000 people paid income tax in Canada. On 
     <lb/>
     a per capita basis, an average of one person in 
     <lb/>
     every family in Canada, that amounts to $288 per 
     <lb/>
     person. A single person earning $750 a year up 
     <lb/>
     and pays income tax...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> In this country a single person has 
     <lb/>
     to earn $1,000 before he's subject to income tax. 
     <lb/>
     According to the Canadian index from which I 
     <lb/>
     give these figures, in 1945 the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment collected in taxes an average of $142 per 
     <lb/>
     capita. This you will please note does not include 
     <lb/>
     the various provincial and town taxes, which are 
     <lb/>
     numerous and add up to a large figure per person. 
     <lb/>
     In Newfoundland in 1945, the per capita tax 
     <lb/>
     collected by our government amounted to $115 
     <lb/>
     per person, or just about a quarter of the amount 
     <lb/>
     collected by the Candian federal government. 
     <lb/>
     And please bear in mind, that outside of St. 
     <lb/>
     John's and the other places where there are town 
     <lb/>
     councils, there are no additional taxes in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Now apart from the federal tax in 
     <lb/>
     Canada the provinces imposed additional taxes, 
     <lb/>
     and there are I believe eight of these taxes, the 
     <lb/>
     most important ones being gasoline tax, liquor 
     <lb/>
     tax, corporation tax, public domain tax and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada subsidies system. Referring 
     <lb/>
     to the liquor tax, I am very much afraid that under 
     <lb/>
     confederation our good old Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     screech would even be taxed. During the past 
     <lb/>
     year I have been meeting and talking to quite a 
     <lb/>
     few Canadian businessmen and others here in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's, and I have been inquiring about the tax 
     <lb/>
     situation in Canada. They relate a long litany of 
     <lb/>
     taxes, some of which I never have heard before, 


            <pb n="1203"

     such as school tax, road tax, stock tax, sales tax, 
     <lb/>
     so by the time they are finished they leave me 
     <lb/>
     wondering if they are talking about the same 
     <lb/>
     country that my good friend the member for 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre has been telling us about. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe these Canadians to whom I have been 
     <lb/>
     talking are all wrong, and maybe they only think 
     <lb/>
     they are being taxed, and maybe Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     is right, but I am satisfied that they can't both be 
     <lb/>
     right. That is something you have to decide for 
     <lb/>
     yourselves. The gentleman for Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     reminds me of a tourist who visits another town 
     <lb/>
     or country and then comes back and tells the local 
     <lb/>
     boys of the marvellous sights he has seen, and the 
     <lb/>
     beautiful things he has encountered, and how 
     <lb/>
     everything is so much better than in the old home 
     <lb/>
     town. It reminds me of an old saying, the grass is 
     <lb/>
     always greener in the other fellow's yard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The good member is like an individual who is 
     <lb/>
     called a barker, who stands in front of a tent at a 
     <lb/>
     circus and has a very convincing story to tell you. 
     <lb/>
     He tells you that for 25 cents, if you will just step 
     <lb/>
     inside, you will see some wonderful things. I 
     <lb/>
     don't mind admitting that I visited Coney Island 
     <lb/>
     once and I was hypnotised by this barker. I parted 
     <lb/>
     with 50 cents which I could illafford to spend, but 
     <lb/>
     which I thought was little for what I was going to 
     <lb/>
     see. But I don't mind telling you, and I use a 
     <lb/>
     common but explicit word, I was a sucker. And 
     <lb/>
     since then I am inclined to be very suspicious of 
     <lb/>
     any gentleman who says in effect, "Will you walk 
     <lb/>
     into my parlour, said the spider to the fly." For<lb break="no"/>tunately for me, I was able to get out of the 
     <lb/>
     circumstance. But in this instance the tent we are 
     <lb/>
     invited to enter has no exit, and over the door 
     <lb/>
     might well be written, "Abandon hope all ye who 
     <lb/>
     enter here." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to compliment the gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre for the resourcefulness that he 
     <lb/>
     has shown whenever this subject of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     taxes has been brought up. In effect he's brushed 
     <lb/>
     it of by saying, "Oh don't worry about this tax, 
     <lb/>
     don't worry about that tax, because the federal 
     <lb/>
     government will pay them for you. It does not 
     <lb/>
     come out of your pocket at all. It comes out of the 
     <lb/>
     pocket of the federal government." The good old 
     <lb/>
     fairy godmother the federal government, whose 
     <lb/>
     sole purpose of existing is apparently to throw out 
     <lb/>
     gratuitously, to all her offspring, including the 
     <lb/>
     Newfies, big hunks of confederate money every 
     <lb/>
     time they go crying to her door. Yes, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
man, that is the picture that the good member for 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre has endeavoured to create in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the people. And I believe that he has 
     <lb/>
     done a very good job. I will now digress a mo<lb break="no"/>ment to pay a tribute to Mr. Smallwood's ability 
     <lb/>
     in this respect. I believe if it were possible for that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to descend into the inferno that the 
     <lb/>
     poet Dante speaks about, and then come back 
     <lb/>
     again and write and distribute his prospectus, I 
     <lb/>
     am convinced that he would describe that inferno 
     <lb/>
     in such glowing terms that they would be 
     <lb/>
     swamped with applications for ringside seats. 
     <lb/>
     Seriously, Mr. Chairman, while I am on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, I recommend now that if we do not go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, that the member for Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre be appointed head of our tourist bureau, 
     <lb/>
     because I think that a man with his imagination 
     <lb/>
     can write such a glowing account of this country 
     <lb/>
     that he will bring sufficient tourists here from 
     <lb/>
     Canada to pay off our national debt, and convince 
     <lb/>
     even Mr. Smallwood himself that we are self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     From the Canadian people whom I have met 
     <lb/>
     and talked with, and there have been many during 
     <lb/>
     the past year, I know that it is not a dream world 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Smallwood would have us believe. It has 
     <lb/>
     a bright side and a dark side and I think I might 
     <lb/>
     glance at a few figures. Canada's population in 
     <lb/>
     the last census, 1941, was 11.5 million. Most 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders have a hazy idea that if we 
     <lb/>
     would join Canada we would be joining up with 
     <lb/>
     much the same kind of people as we have in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, that is English, Irish, and Scotch 
     <lb/>
     descendants. If you think that, you are wrong. 
     <lb/>
     Fifty percent of all Canada's population are of 
     <lb/>
     English, Irish and Scotch descents, and the other 
     <lb/>
     fifty are French, Polish, Russian, Italian, and so 
     <lb/>
     on. So that we would be really joining a foreign 
     <lb/>
     power, in more ways than one. And if in the years 
     <lb/>
     ahead the foreign population outgrows the people 
     <lb/>
     of the British Isles, which could happen, and 
     <lb/>
     these people take charge of Canada, a lot of 
     <lb/>
     trouble that we never dreamed about we could be 
     <lb/>
     letting ourselves and our descendants in for. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Have you looked up the landed 
     <lb/>immigrants in the USA?

     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> No, Mr. Smallwood, I haven't.

            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> The national debt of Canada is now 
     <lb/>about $14 billion. The national debt of New<lb break="no"/>foundland is about $65 million. This means that 


            <pb n="1204"

     every man, woman and child in Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     liable for $220, and that every man, woman and 
     <lb/>
     child in Canada is liable for $932. So that if we 
     <lb/>
     join Canada we cease to have this burden of $220 
     <lb/>
     around our necks, and we take on a new burden 
     <lb/>
     of $922 instead. I was surprised some time ago to 
     <lb/>
     hear the good member for Twillingate attempt to 
     <lb/>
     say that a change from $220 to $932 was really 
     <lb/>
     nothing to worry about. Since this Convention 
     <lb/>
     began I have noted that no man here has shown 
     <lb/>
     a more scrupulous regard for clearing expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, watching our surpluses and our resources. 
     <lb/>
     But suddenly the good gentleman blossoms forth 
     <lb/>
     and goes on a bus, so to speak... Oh, that is a mere 
     <lb/>
     bagatelle, a per capita tax of $932. Mr. Ash<lb break="no"/>bourne attempted to justify it by stating that to a 
     <lb/>
     big man, or a big business, a big debt is no more 
     <lb/>
     then a small debt to a small man. That may or may 
     <lb/>
     not be so. But it is not so if the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland become bigger men, if we enter into 
     <lb/>
     confederation We will have to fish on the French 
     <lb/>
     Shore, on the Labrador, or if Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>
     wants it nearer home, Twillingate Long Point. 
     <lb/>
     And the fact that these fishermen are into con<lb break="no"/>federation is not going to put any more fish in 
     <lb/>
     their traps. They are still the same fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     doing the same things as before, and I doubt if 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ashbourne or anybody else will pay them 
     <lb/>
     any more for a quintal fish in order to pay this 
     <lb/>
     additional burden. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And now with respect to the famous baby 
     <lb/>
     bonus that we've heard so much about. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian trade index says that it cost Canadians 
     <lb/>
     annually $25 million in taxes to meet this al<lb break="no"/>lowance. This means that there is on average a 
     <lb/>
     tax of $20 per person on each man, woman and 
     <lb/>
     child. If the tax were raised by taking from the 
     <lb/>
     rich, it might have a Robin Hood justification. 
     <lb/>
     But it is raised as part of the general revenue and 
     <lb/>
     is collected in part as import duties. The poor pay 
     <lb/>
     as well as the rich. This baby bonus has good 
     <lb/>
     features, but like a lot of these things, we would 
     <lb/>
     find out in time it has a hurtful effect as well, and 
     <lb/>
     all is not gold that glitters. I could go on much 
     <lb/>
     further with respect to what we would have to pay 
     <lb/>
     in the shape of taxes if we became part of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     As I said before, every Canadian I talked to reeled 
     <lb/>
     off taxes that they have to pay. Every Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government statistical book I take up is a story of 
     <lb/>
     taxes and more taxes. I have come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that as far as I can learn, compared with 


            <cb/>
       

     Canadians we don't know what taxation is. I am 
     <lb/>
     willing to admit that in Canada they have general<lb break="no"/>ly better schools, better trains, better hotels and 
     <lb/>
     better public services all around. But don't let 
     <lb/>
     anyone tell you that these come like manna that 
     <lb/>
     fall from heaven. In a recent issue of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Maclean's 
     <lb/>
     Magazine</hi>, there was quite an article giving the 
     <lb/>
     statistics of the number of immigrants from 
     <lb/>
     Europe entering Canada. They are many 
     <lb/>
     thousands annually. But the article also shows 
     <lb/>
     that there are more Canadian immigrants enter<lb break="no"/>ing the USA from Canada annually than there are 
     <lb/>
     people coming into Canada. If it is the promised 
     <lb/>
     land that has been described to us, why is it that 
     <lb/>
     they are leaving Canada in the thousands each 
     <lb/>
     year?

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They'll be back now. It's too

     They're coming back.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> You know, Mr. Chairman, most of 
     <lb/>
     us in Newfoundland have been born and brought 
     <lb/>
     up in small harbours, and a mile or so behind the 
     <lb/>
     harbour are the wide open spaces. All of us during 
     <lb/>
     our young days have gone into the woods and 
     <lb/>
     roamed the hills and valleys, picked berries, 
     <lb/>
     snared rabbits, and caught trout in the ponds. All 
     <lb/>
     of us that felt that this was our country, our own 
     <lb/>
     ponds, valleys and rivers. We did not have a fence 
     <lb/>
     around it, and it was ours to use when we wanted. 
     <lb/>
     It is a part of that freedom that we have been 
     <lb/>
     brought up to in Newfoundland. If confederation 
     <lb/>
     comes, my guess is that all that will change. We 
     <lb/>
     will have the surveyors from Ottawa who will 
     <lb/>
     have the boundary lines marked, and like you see 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, there will be "No Trespassing" signs 
     <lb/>
     all over the country. The laws governing what 
     <lb/>
     you can and what you can't do will be far dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from what they used to be, and what they 
     <lb/>
     are today. Then you will know that New<lb break="no"/>foundland is ours no longer. I know quite well 
     <lb/>
     that you cannot put a money value on this sort of 
     <lb/>
     a thing. Maybe it does not feed a hungry man, but 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless it is worth a lot. It is well worthwhile 
     <lb/>
     holding on to. The value of this freedom that we 
     <lb/>
     have known so long is something that has to be 
     <lb/>
     decided by the heart and conscience of each of 
     <lb/>
     us.

     As we have read in the papers recently, 
     <lb/>
     Canada has just had to borrow $300 million from 
     <lb/>
     the USA. The chief advocate of confederation 
     <lb/>
     said here some time ago that Canada was borrow<lb break="no"/>

     ing money because she is prosperous. This 
     <lb/>
     gentleman gave a very clever explanation as to 
     <lb/>
     why that is, but Mr. Chairman, you know and I 
     <lb/>
     know and even the simplest child knows, that one 
     <lb/>
     usually borrows money because one hasn't got it. 
     <lb/>
     In this connection I read an article in the financial 
     <lb/>
     section of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">New York Times</hi> a couple of weeks 
     <lb/>
     ago, which says that the financial position that 
     <lb/>
     Canada finds herself in today is not, as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood says, because the Canadians have 
     <lb/>
     been spending money lavishly, but the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government (the article says) has been on a 
     <lb/>
     spending spree, and careless of public interest, so 
     <lb/>
     that the government is now in the embarrassing 
     <lb/>
     position of trying to find some US dollars, and is 
     <lb/>
     forced to go to the USA and borrow them. That 
     <lb/>
     is the financial section of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">New York Times</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood to the contrary. In the Geneva 
     <lb/>
     conference recently there were certain reductions 
     <lb/>
     made on goods coming from the USA to Canada 
     <lb/>
     to lighten the financial burden of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     taxpayer. But the same day that these tax reduc<lb break="no"/>tions were announced, an embargo came into 
     <lb/>
     effect in Canada on various other facets of US 
     <lb/>
     merchandise. So that according to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     papers, the advantages of the reductions brought 
     <lb/>
     about by the Geneva conference were completely 
     <lb/>
     wiped out overnight... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Canadian terms of union have been 
     <lb/>
     presented to us with the implication that they are 
     <lb/>
     something that are permanent and unchangeable 
     <lb/>
     and everlasting. In my own lifetime I have seen 
     <lb/>
     terms and agreements among the biggest nations 
     <lb/>
     amended, watered down, and even torn up when 
     <lb/>
     it suited the strongest of the contracting parties. 
     <lb/>
     We all know that the famous Atlantic Charter, 
     <lb/>
     agreed to only six years ago by Mr. Churchill and 
     <lb/>
     the late President Roosevelt at Argentia, is now 
     <lb/>
     not only forgotten, but its terms are being 
     <lb/>
     honoured in their breach and not in their obser<lb break="no"/>vance. So that is were we in confederation; when 
     <lb/>
     it suited Canada, she could place a new inter<lb break="no"/>pretation on any clause of the agreement that she 
     <lb/>
     wanted to, and we could do nothing about it. 
     <lb/>
     There would be loopholes in the agreement big 
     <lb/>
     enough, as the lawyers say, to drive a horse and 
     <lb/>
     buggy through. There is an old saying that 
     <lb/>
     promises are made to be broken, and if we have 
     <lb/>
     learned anything. we know that agreements like 
     <lb/>
     promises are made to be broken. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     permanent in this world except death and taxes. 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
         

     For instance, the well-known Yalta agreement 
     <lb/>
     between Britain, the USA, and Russia. It was 
     <lb/>
     signed by all three, and all three were agreed. But 
     <lb/>
     hardly was the ink dry when they started arguing 
     <lb/>
     about the meaning of this clause and that clause, 
     <lb/>
     and it is generally understood now that they will 
     <lb/>
     never agree on what the words of this treaty 
     <lb/>
     meant. Britain and the USA say it meant one 
     <lb/>
     thing, and the Russians say it meant something 
     <lb/>
     entirely different. And the men who made this 
     <lb/>
     treaty were, all of them, experts. And yet we are 
     <lb/>
     asked to believe that seven inexperienced New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders went to Ottawa to confer with some 
     <lb/>
     of the cleverest, keenest, financial experts, and 
     <lb/>
     that our delegation was a match for the clever, 
     <lb/>
     able, and political men that they met in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Surely no one can be so simple as to believe this. 
     <lb/>
     And while I haven't a great deal of intelligence, 
     <lb/>
     the little experience I have tells me that an 
     <lb/>
     amateur is no match for a professional. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been, Mr. Chairman, some debate 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the Privy Council decision on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador boundary. I think I'll leave that till after 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, I really feel very embar<lb break="no"/>rassed and appreciative. I don't know what to say, 
     <lb/>
     because it was a very nice gesture indeed. I've 
     <lb/>
     been confined to the house, as you know, sir, 
     <lb/>
     threatened by my doctor, and I have got to obey 
     <lb/>
     him. I've been listening in to everything that's 
     <lb/>
     been going along, and naturally I've felt very 
     <lb/>
     much out of it. I certainly didn't expect to come 
     <lb/>
     back to such a sympathetic and kindly welcome, 
     <lb/>
     and I very much appreciate it from both from you, 
     <lb/>
     sir, and especially from Mr. Reddy who so grace<lb break="no"/>fully has given me the floor.

     happy and pleased to hear you sitting in your seat.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That's very kind and thoughtful, sir, 
     <lb/>and I think I'll probably avail myself of your 
     <lb/>suggestion, if I may. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Certainly, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I desire to make a few remarks with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Ottawa proposals. I wish first of all 
     <lb/>
     to make it absolutely clear that I'm not in prin<lb break="no"/>ciple against confederation, nor am I an anticon<lb break="no"/>federate, as suggested since by Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian press. I don't want to be unkind, 
     <lb/>
     but that's the fact. In order to avoid any 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding as to the position I take in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the confederation issue, let me 
     <lb/>
     say that it was my view that unless the advantages 
     <lb/>
     and disadvantages of confederation with Canada 
     <lb/>
     are very clearly set forth, the electorate will not 
     <lb/>
     be placed in a position to fairly weigh the issue. 
     <lb/>
     And the outcome of the decision is so far-reach<lb break="no"/>ing and irretrievable that a snap judgement might 
     <lb/>
     be fatal for the future of our country. I doubt very 
     <lb/>
     much whether the disjointed debate which has 
     <lb/>
     gone out over the air from the Convention has 
     <lb/>
     conveyed any idea of the true position on this 
     <lb/>
     issue. In spite of the voluminous, valuable but 
     <lb/>
     still very incomplete information contained in the 
     <lb/>
     so-called Black Books compiled as the result of 
     <lb/>
     three months' discussions in Ottawa, the situa<lb break="no"/>tion is far from clear. I'd like to say in that 
     <lb/>
     connection, that I'm not at all sure that those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who wired suggesting the return of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation from Ottawa should not have advised 
     <lb/>
     them to stop there for another six months; be<lb break="no"/>cause they could not in the time be expected to 
     <lb/>
     bring about a thorough, clear picture. The posi<lb break="no"/>tion is very far from being clear, and it is evident 
     <lb/>
     that it cannot possibly be made clear to the Con<lb break="no"/>vention delegates or to the electorate prior to the 
     <lb/>
     termination of the Convention's proceedings, as<lb break="no"/>suming that our deliberations are to end this 
     <lb/>
     month and that the referendum will be held in 
     <lb/>
     May. The question therefore arises as to whether 
     <lb/>
     or not this Convention is justified in recommend<lb break="no"/>ing that such incomplete information should be 
     <lb/>
     placed before the people of Newfoundland for an 
     <lb/>
     irrevocable decision at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The very ardent advocate and/or advocates of 
     <lb/>
     confederation may contend that this is merely an 
     <lb/>
     attempt to shelve forever the question of con<lb break="no"/>federation. But I cannot accept that idea, as it is 
     <lb/>
     perfectly clear that should a referendum covering 


            <cb/>
      

     responsible government or Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment result in favour of responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     a general election would then be held. And there 
     <lb/>
     would then be an opportunity for those who 
     <lb/>
     favour confederation to form a party and contest 
     <lb/>
     the issue. If the confederation party were elected, 
     <lb/>
     they would then be in a position to pursue 
     <lb/>
     negotiations for confederation. It must be kept in 
     <lb/>
     mind that up to the present time there have been 
     <lb/>
     no negotiations, but merely a statement of 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa's views as to a fair and equitable basis. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's views as to a fair and equitable 
     <lb/>
     basis has not yet been formulated. It may be 
     <lb/>
     argued that in the case of the choice being Com<lb break="no"/>mission instead of responsible government there 
     <lb/>
     would not be a chance of considering the con<lb break="no"/>federation issue. I do not think that is necessarily 
     <lb/>
     correct. Presumably the continuation of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government, if placed on the paper, will be 
     <lb/>
     with a limit of perhaps three or four years. And if 
     <lb/>
     that is the case, the government might be asked 
     <lb/>
     to set up a royal commission to endeavour to set 
     <lb/>
     forth more clearly the advantages and disad<lb break="no"/>vantages to Newfoundland of union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     As an alternative to a royal commission, the idea 
     <lb/>
     expressed by Mr. Pratt, chairman of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Industrial Board, might be adopted 
     <lb/>
     and the government might arrange for an expert 
     <lb/>
     economic survey of our position which would 
     <lb/>
     include details on the impact of confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada on our future prosperity. There 
     <lb/>
     should be no hurry to decide such an irretrievable 
     <lb/>
     step as the confederation issue. The electorate 
     <lb/>
     must be absolutely clear as to its effect before 
     <lb/>
     voting on it. We have not yet got all the facts by 
     <lb/>
     a very long way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, I wish to emphasise that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood must have been aware of the views I 
     <lb/>
     have just expressed before he sent that despatch 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian newspapers. I made them clear 
     <lb/>
     on 6 December last through the local press. I do 
     <lb/>
     not take it lightly that Mr. Smallwood would let 
     <lb/>
     anything of importance go in the newspaper. 
     <lb/>
     However, I will forgive this indiscretion and call 
     <lb/>
     it a politician's license to discourage an op<lb break="no"/>ponent. There is probably no one in this assembly 
     <lb/>
     who takes a more independent view than I do 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject which we have been sent here to 
     <lb/>
     discuss. I offered myself as candidate without 
     <lb/>
     any expectation of future political associations, 
     <lb/>
     which is easily imaginable in view of my age and 
    

            <pb n="1207"

     the fact that within less than four weeks I shall be 
     <lb/>
     in my seventy-sixth year. My sole reason for 
     <lb/>
     offering myself as a candidate was that after a 
     <lb/>
     family business connection of over 180 years 
     <lb/>
     with this charming and fascinating country, and 
     <lb/>
     after 50 years of personal residence here myself, 
     <lb/>
     I felt that in this great crisis I would like to do 
     <lb/>
     something to assist in improving the living con<lb break="no"/>ditions of our people, and especially of our fisher<lb break="no"/>men. This was, and is still my sole objective. I 
     <lb/>
     only give these facts in the hope that they will 
     <lb/>
     remove the impression created by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's propaganda, indicating that my 
     <lb/>
     views on confederation are prejudiced and un<lb break="no"/>worthy of consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to enter into a long argument 
     <lb/>
     for or against the Ottawa proposal. I think the 
     <lb/>
     pros and cons have been thoroughly dealt with by 
     <lb/>
     previous speakers during the recent debates. Al<lb break="no"/>though I have been absent during the past ten days 
     <lb/>
     due to temporary illness, I have listened in to the 
     <lb/>
     broadcasts with very much interest. I was par<lb break="no"/>ticularly struck by the fine argument of my co- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     member for St. John's East, Mr. Higgins, and 
     <lb/>
     especially with the strength laid by him upon the 
     <lb/>
     enormous value of the strategic position of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The point overlooked by many is that 
     <lb/>
     we have a very strong bargaining card in the 
     <lb/>
     undoubted fact that the use of Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     strategic position is vital for the welfare and 
     <lb/>
     protection of not only Canada, but also of the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America and of Great Britain. I 
     <lb/>
     entirely agree with Mr. Higgins that much better 
     <lb/>
     terms than those offered should be obtained by 
     <lb/>
     reason of our strategic position. I feel quite cer<lb break="no"/>tain that with skillful negotiation by properly 
     <lb/>
     authorised authorities, better terms would have 
     <lb/>
     been finally, and perhaps grudgingly given by 
     <lb/>
     Canada.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> and his supporters appear to 
     <lb/>
     think that it would be sound business to jump at 
     <lb/>
     this offer from Canada. Mr. Smallwood himself 
     <lb/>
     is very able and willing to utilise his ready tongue 
     <lb/>
     and quick and fertile brain to induce the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland to accept these terms without 
     <lb/>
     any attempt to better them. Don't let us be led into 
     <lb/>
     grabbing the elusive bait in the shape of a s-— 
     <lb/>
     called baby bonus without first considering the 
     <lb/>
     full impact of the confederation issue. It is to my 
     <lb/>
     mind so obviously unreasonable to urge the im<lb break="no"/>

   
     
            <cb/>
 
     mediate acceptance of these unnegotiated terms, 
     <lb/>
     that I earnestly appeal to those members who are 
     <lb/>
     inclined to support Mr. Smallwood to reconsider 
     <lb/>
     their viewpoint...<ref target="#fn_12">[1]</ref> Mr. Smallwood has to stop 
     <lb/>
     being a very strong supporter of confederation. 
     <lb/>
     He has already influenced thousands of voters in 
     <lb/>
     this small country to share his extreme views, 
     <lb/>
     even before any indication was received as to the 
     <lb/>
     basis upon which, in Canada's view, we should 
     <lb/>
     accept confederacy. I have small hope of in<lb break="no"/>fluencing Mr. Smallwood. I hope I may have 
     <lb/>
     some influence with a few others. From the start 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention and probably for many 
     <lb/>
     months before, he has been advocating con<lb break="no"/>federation without even knowing what terms 
     <lb/>
     were available. Above all things, this conception 
     <lb/>
     of confederation is a matter of terms. Are we 
     <lb/>
     going to barter away our valuable strategic posi<lb break="no"/>tion without endeavouring to obtain something 
     <lb/>
     really worthwhile? I ask you sir, when a fisher<lb break="no"/>man wants to sell his fish, what does he do? Does 
     <lb/>
     he sell it to the first bidder? Or if there's only one 
     <lb/>
     bidder, does he accept the first offer that comes? 
     <lb/>
     In my experience he is shrewd enough to try very 
     <lb/>
     hard to secure a better price, and he uses every 
     <lb/>
     argument he can think of to do so. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     and his supporters, however, appear to think it is 
     <lb/>
     sound business to jump at this unnegotiated and 
     <lb/>
     undiscussed offer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, there are several good reasons for 
     <lb/>
     deferring this question of confederation until we 
     <lb/>
     have our own elected government. One of these 
     <lb/>
     is that, in my opinion, there is a strong tendency 
     <lb/>
     in the country for a trusted relationship with the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America, and the possibility 
     <lb/>
     should be carefully and closely investigated 
     <lb/>
     before the country is projected into the irretriev<lb break="no"/>able step of confederation with Canada. Our fu<lb break="no"/>ture prosperity, and particularly the prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     our fishermen, is mainly dependent upon recipro<lb break="no"/>cal trade with the United States of America, and 
     <lb/>
     this would receive its death blow by our entering 
     <lb/>
     into confederation. Some people, including my 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. Bradley, who I'm sorry to see is ab<lb break="no"/>sent, apparently believe that the prospects of ob<lb break="no"/>taining anything by approaching to the United 
     <lb/>
     States of America are unfounded. But surely to 
     <lb/>
     goodness this cannot be ascertained until some 
     <lb/>
     approach is made. The recent arrangement dealt 
     <lb/>
     with the Geneva conference has made very little

     improvement so far as Newfoundland is con<lb break="no"/>cerned in our trading relation with the United 
     <lb/>
     States of America, because the arrangements 
     <lb/>
     have merely stabilised for the time being the 
     <lb/>
     current duties on our fresh fish, and the result 
     <lb/>
     from other concessions is negligible. It is true that 
     <lb/>
     the duty and processing tax against our seal oil 
     <lb/>
     and whale oil entering the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America has been reduced by 50%, but the exist<lb break="no"/>ing tax is still a prohibitive duty. As you know, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I have been a steady advocate of the idea that 
     <lb/>
     a so-called partly internationalised position, or 
     <lb/>
     what has been termed the position of a con<lb break="no"/>dominium, might be the better solution for the 
     <lb/>
     future of Newfoundland. My reason for this is 
     <lb/>
     that I believe we are dependent for our future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity not only upon our trade with the USA, 
     <lb/>
     and with Canada to a small extent, but also upon 
     <lb/>
     our relation with the mother country, without 
     <lb/>
     whose assistance in various ways our trade in salt 
     <lb/>
     codfish with European countries would be cut 
     <lb/>
     short, and our fishermen would then indeed have 
     <lb/>
     a hard time. Anyone who imagines for one mo<lb break="no"/>ment that the old country is permanently down 
     <lb/>
     and out, and will not be in a position to assist us, 
     <lb/>
     is making a grave mistake and they will find that 
     <lb/>
     her recovery will be very much quicker than they 
     <lb/>
     imagine. As heretofore, Newfoundland will be 
     <lb/>
     able to rely upon the mother country, whether 
     <lb/>
     under Commission government or not, not only 
     <lb/>
     for assistance in marketing our fish in the 
     <lb/>
     European countries and providing exchange for 
     <lb/>
     it, but also for a market for a great many of our 
     <lb/>
     products which found a market there prior to the 
     <lb/>
     recent war. This question of fostering a joint 
     <lb/>
     interest by Great Britain, the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America and Canada in our future development, 
     <lb/>
     in terms of giving them the right to use our 
     <lb/>
     strategically placed country for their own 
     <lb/>
     defence and the defence of democracy 
     <lb/>
     everywhere, should be carefully investigated 
     <lb/>
     before confederation is placed before the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland in any form. All opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     making Newfoundland a prosperous country 
     <lb/>
     reliant upon its own resources may be entirely 
     <lb/>
     lost if we act too quickly; and instead of enjoying 
     <lb/>
     a development of our own resources, we may be 
     <lb/>
     in the humiliating position of living upon a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government with a much reduced 
     <lb/>
     population. It is my considered opinion that if 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain is sensible, and I believe she will be 


            <cb/>
       

     if we make our viewpoint clear, she will help us 
     <lb/>
     to obtain our goals, and at the same time give us 
     <lb/>
     back, if we wanted, a useful form of government 
     <lb/>
     with proper representation by our people. If she 
     <lb/>
     does not help us to do this, I do not hesitate to say 
     <lb/>
     that in my opinion the strength of our people will 
     <lb/>
     be towards political as well as economical and 
     <lb/>
     fiscal relations with the great and wealthy 
     <lb/>
     republic to whom Great Britain has already given 
     <lb/>
     a footing in this island without the consent of our 
     <lb/>
     people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In closing this address I will ask Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and his supporters to reply to one 
     <lb/>
     single, simple question. That question is this, 
     <lb/>
     does Mr. Smallwood, and do those who apparent<lb break="no"/>ly think as he does, really and honestly believe 
     <lb/>
     that it is right and proper that the terms indicated, 
     <lb/>
     not offered by Canada, which have not resulted 
     <lb/>
     from any negotiations, and which many people 
     <lb/>
     confidently believe could be improved upon, 
     <lb/>
     should be placed before the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland now, for an irreversible or irretriev<lb break="no"/>able decision? Or is it not reasonable that such a 
     <lb/>
     question should be deferred for a specifically 
     <lb/>
     limited period until there have been proper 
     <lb/>
     negotiations by an authorised government after 
     <lb/>
     very thorough investigation? I would like this 
     <lb/>
     question clearly answered without any equivoca<lb break="no"/>tion. That is all I've got to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> First I must congratulate the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     R.B. Job for his intelligent address. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I left to go home to tea, sir, I was 
     <lb/>
     discussing the Labrador boundary situation. 
     <lb/>
     There has been some debate with respect to the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council decision on the Labrador bound<lb break="no"/>ary. Mr. Cashin said that this decision would be 
     <lb/>
     upset, and Mr. Smallwood said that such an idea 
     <lb/>
     was fantastic, and that the only way that Quebec 
     <lb/>
     could take over Labrador was by raising an army. 
     <lb/>
     I know that Mr. Smallwood is not quite as naive 
     <lb/>
     as that. Mr. Cashin said he knew of three different 
     <lb/>
     ways by which Quebec might get Newfound<lb break="no"/>land-Labrador, perhaps the biggest asset we pos<lb break="no"/>sess today. There will be produced there 10 
     <lb/>
     million tons of iron ore annually when they get 
     <lb/>
     going, four or five years from now. Mining ex<lb break="no"/>perts in Canada and the USA say that it is the 
     <lb/>
     biggest thing of its kind in the world, that its 
     <lb/>
     richness is beyond financial calculation. One of 
     <lb/>
     the officials of the American government public<lb break="no"/>ly recommended to the US Senate that the USA 


            <pb n="1209"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-15_Page_1209.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1209</fw>
        

     should get a slice of this iron ore body in return 
     <lb/>
     for American aid to Britain under the Marshall 
     <lb/>
     Plan. This iron ore body extends right close to the 
     <lb/>
     border between Newfoundland-Labrador and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec — it crosses the border in several places. 
     <lb/>
     As there is nothing else like it in the world, we 
     <lb/>
     have no doubt that Quebec wants it. As a matter 
     <lb/>
     of fact. the French Canadian people are living 
     <lb/>
     right up close to this border now. If the mine 
     <lb/>
     develops, as we are given to understand it will, I 
     <lb/>
     imagine that Mr. Duplessis or his successor will 
     <lb/>
     take care to see that 300,000-400,000 French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians are settled in Newfoundland- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador in the course of 20 or 25 years. And 
     <lb/>
     when this happens there is no need to upset the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council decision; no need for Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's army. A major portion of the people 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland and Newfoundland-Labrador 
     <lb/>
     may well be French Canadian, and by popular 
     <lb/>
     vote they can vote and change the boundary 
     <lb/>
     between the two provinces. Do you know that 
     <lb/>
     famous Grand Falls<ref target="#fn_13">[1]</ref> at Labrador, with all its 
     <lb/>
     tremendous water-power resources is not 20 
     <lb/>
     miles from the Quebec border? The population of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec now is something over four million, and 
     <lb/>
     is increasing at the highest rate. One does not 
     <lb/>
     have to be a prophet to see that in 20 years from 
     <lb/>
     now the number of French Canadians in New<lb break="no"/>foundland-Labrador, provided the mine 
     <lb/>
     develops, will exceed the population of all of us 
     <lb/>
     here on the island of Newfoundland. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood tried to convince us that French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians would not be allowed into the 
     <lb/>
     province of Newfoundland-Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, I didn't. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Or something to that effect. That 
     <lb/>
     may be quite true at the present time and under 
     <lb/>
     the present agreement with the Hollinger Cor<lb break="no"/>poration, but if we become a part of Canada, just 
     <lb/>
     as a Newfoundlander is entitled to go to live and 
     <lb/>
     work in the city of Montreal, so also those French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians now living close to the Quebec- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador border may, if they want, come and take 
     <lb/>
     up residence on the Newfoundland-Labrador 
     <lb/>
     side. Anyone who says anything to the contrary 
     <lb/>
     is either talking nonsense or trying to deceive. 
     <lb/>
     The late Sir Wilfred Laurier, a French Canadian, 
     <lb/>
     was Prime Minister of Canada for 16 years. It is 
     <lb/>
     now generally expected that Mr. St. Laurent, 
     <lb/>
     another French Canadian, is likely to succeed Mr. 
 

<note xml:id="fn_13">[1] Now Churchill Falls.</note> 


            <cb/>
         

     King next year. If Mr. St. Laurent holds the office 
     <lb/>
     of Prime Minister as long as Sir Wilfred Laurier 
     <lb/>
     did, I have no doubt but that several ways will be 
     <lb/>
     found to get around the decision of the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council. I feel sure that Mr. Smallwood is sincere 
     <lb/>
     and means well, but Mr. Smallwood is a idealist. 
     <lb/>
     He dreams dreams and he sees visions, and wants 
     <lb/>
     everybody else to do as he does. But we do not 
     <lb/>
     believe in a world of dreams. In a few years, both 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood and myself will be pushing up 
     <lb/>
     the daisies ... but the people of Quebec, like Old 
     <lb/>
     Man River, will keep on rolling over the border 
     <lb/>
     into Labrador, as they are doing now in every 
     <lb/>
     province in Canada. And when a sufficient num<lb break="no"/>ber of them have gone into Labrador, there will 
     <lb/>
     be another referendum and at that time Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood will not be here to protest. Our valu<lb break="no"/>able territory will be passed over to Quebec by 
     <lb/>
     the new method, which dentists call painless ex<lb break="no"/>traction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A lovely picture has been painted with respect 
     <lb/>
     to all the money that Canada is going to pour into 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to develop our resources once we 
     <lb/>
     become a province. I agree that what we want in 
     <lb/>
     this country is more employment and more in<lb break="no"/>dustry, rather then more baby bonuses. A country 
     <lb/>
     will never become prosperous by getting its in<lb break="no"/>come from this sort of a thing. In a sense it is like 
     <lb/>
     dole. It gives relief, but the kind of industry it 
     <lb/>
     encourages is not the kind best calculated to put 
     <lb/>
     us on the road to prosperity. It is a matter of record 
     <lb/>
     that all the premiums and earnings of our $100 
     <lb/>
     million in life insurance are in Canadian com<lb break="no"/>panies. Also there is an additional $40-50 million 
     <lb/>
     of our savings on deposit with the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     banks and trust companies in Newfoundland. The 
     <lb/>
     total of these monies, I suppose, is not less then 
     <lb/>
     $50-60 million. And so it has been for years, that 
     <lb/>
     the bulk of our people's accumulated savings is 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of Canadian banks, trust companies 
     <lb/>
     and insurance companies. What have these 
     <lb/>
     Canadian financial institutions done with these 
     <lb/>
     monies, and what industries have they started and 
     <lb/>
     developed in Newfoundland with these monies? 
     <lb/>
     The Corner Brook paper mill is all English capi<lb break="no"/>tal. The Buchans Mining Company is, I under<lb break="no"/>stand, 52% English and 48% American capital. 
     <lb/>
     The AND Company at Grand Falls is all English 
     <lb/>
     capital. The St. Lawrence Mining Company is all 
     <lb/>
     American capital. The salt codfishery is all New<lb break="no"/>

     foundland capital with the exception of some 
     <lb/>
     American capital that is invested by the 
     <lb/>
     Gloucester interest in our saltbulk fish industry. 
     <lb/>
     The frozen fillet fish industry is mostly New<lb break="no"/>foundland capital, with I believe some American 
     <lb/>
     capital in North Atlantic Fisheries Ltd., in which 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. R.B. Job, I understand, has a good deal 
     <lb/>
     of money invested. Fishery Products Ltd, which 
     <lb/>
     operates a large filleting industry on the south 
     <lb/>
     coast, particularly in Burin and Burgeo, owned 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Monroe, is Newfoundland capital — plus, 
     <lb/>
     and I am subject to correction on this, some 
     <lb/>
     American capital. As for the herring industry, we 
     <lb/>
     know that this is all Newfoundland capital with 
     <lb/>
     the exception of Mr. Crosbie's herring oil and 
     <lb/>
     meal plant at Bay of Islands, in which I under<lb break="no"/>stand there is some American capital. As for the 
     <lb/>
     lobster fishery, seal fishery, squid fishery, there 
     <lb/>
     is not as far as I know one single Canadian dollar 
     <lb/>
     invested in one of these enterprises. A few 
     <lb/>
     months ago a small Canadian fishing venture was 
     <lb/>
     under way in Bay of Islands, but that is only a 
     <lb/>
     year or so old, and it is too early to say how it is 
     <lb/>
     going to develop. The only Canadian dollar that 
     <lb/>
     I know that is invested in the way of industry that 
     <lb/>
     is giving work to Newfoundlanders, is in the iron 
     <lb/>
     ore mines of Bell Island. This mining company 
     <lb/>
     agreed, I believe, in the beginning, to pay an 
     <lb/>
     export tax on ore if they exported from New<lb break="no"/>foundland. We know that with the exception of a 
     <lb/>
     very few years this tax was never paid, and the 
     <lb/>
     story behind it is not very complimentary to that 
     <lb/>
     particular company. It is a matter of public record 
     <lb/>
     that the Hollis Walker inquiry unveiled some of 
     <lb/>
     the manoeuvres of this company, and that is one 
     <lb/>
     of the darkest pages in our history....<ref target="#fn_14">[1]</ref> It was a 
     <lb/>
     dirty, despicable deal, where reputations were 
     <lb/>
     ruined but where this company still continued 
     <lb/>
     merrily on its way. So we see, gentlemen, that all 
     <lb/>
     the money that we have invested in New<lb break="no"/>foundland today for starting new industries and 
     <lb/>
     developing old ones is either Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     English or American capital. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yet we have people saying, wait until Canada 
     <lb/>
     takes us over and develops our resources. Why? 
     <lb/>
     For the past 50 years every dollar that we have 
     <lb/>
     had has been in Canadian hands, and any 
     <lb/>
     development that has been done has either been 
     <lb/>
     the development of the Prairies or the factories in 


            <cb/>
   

     Ontario. None of it has been used to develop 
     <lb/>
     anything in Newfoundland. And yet there are 
     <lb/>
     people foolish enough to think that Canada will 
     <lb/>
     be different in the years to come than she has been 
     <lb/>
     in the years that are gone. I ask any one of you 
     <lb/>
     who has visited the paper towns of Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     and Grand Falls, or even the mining town of 
     <lb/>
     Buchans, and seen the lovely homes, gardens, 
     <lb/>
     and trees, to contrast and compare those homes 
     <lb/>
     with the houses built at Bell Island. You know 
     <lb/>
     there is no comparison. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....The man who is going to send a schooner 
     <lb/>
     fishing on the Grand Bank searches around and 
     <lb/>
     gets an experienced captain to take charge. Then 
     <lb/>
     he selects for his crew experienced men who have 
     <lb/>
     fished on the Grand Bank before, and he spends 
     <lb/>
     some considerable time and money in fitting out 
     <lb/>
     his schooner and checking to replace any equip<lb break="no"/>ment. He knows that unless he has good equip<lb break="no"/>ment and a good crew he is going to wind up in 
     <lb/>
     the hole, and his year is going to result in a loss. 
     <lb/>
     If you ask that man to select men who would 
     <lb/>
     determine his economic welfare not for one year, 
     <lb/>
     but for his lifetime, and for all time, don't you 
     <lb/>
     think he would take considerable time, and exer<lb break="no"/>cise extreme care in selecting the men that he 
     <lb/>
     would give this reponsibility to? Now, as for 
     <lb/>
     those who went as a delegation to Ottawa — 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Bradley, Higgins, Ashbourne, Crum<lb break="no"/>mey, Ballam, Smallwood and Rev. Burry — all 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen are friends of mine, very fine 
     <lb/>
     men and I have nothing against them... But they 
     <lb/>
     were no better qualified to go to Canada on that 
     <lb/>
     mission than I was, and I know I am not qualified. 
     <lb/>
     The selection of these gentlemen was done in a 
     <lb/>
     matter of minutes on an afternoon 12 months ago. 
     <lb/>
     Off they went to Canada with little or no equip<lb break="no"/>ment, and to expect these men to come back here 
     <lb/>
     with the best terms is expecting miracles. In 
     <lb/>
     short, the men we sent, through no fault of their 
     <lb/>
     own, were not qualified to do the job for which 
     <lb/>
     they were sent. Would you send them on the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Bank in your fishing schooner? No. They 
     <lb/>
     were as qualified to engage in the Grand Bank 
     <lb/>
     fishery as they were to engage with the financial 
     <lb/>
     and political experts in Canada. If we could send 
     <lb/>
     a delegation to Ottawa comprised of such men as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. John Power of Carbonear, Mr. Harry 
     <lb/>
     Fletcher of Grand Falls, Mr. Aaron Buffett of

     Grand Bank, Mr. Cal Pratt of St. John's, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gerald S. Doyle of St. John's, Mr. F. Moores of 
     <lb/>
     Carbonear, Mr. George Kennedy of Avondale 
     <lb/>
     and our worthy Chairman, J.B. McEvoy, to inter<lb break="no"/>pret the legal points and to keep our delegates out 
     <lb/>
     of Canadian goal, I think that a delegation such 
     <lb/>
     as this could come back with any juice that 
     <lb/>
     might be extracted from the Canadian apple. In 
     <lb/>
     other words, I think that the gentlemen I have 
     <lb/>
     mentioned could drive the hardest and best pos<lb break="no"/>sible bargain, and would extract everything in the 
     <lb/>
     way of advantages for Newfoundland before they 
     <lb/>
     said adieu to Mr. St. Laurent. I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     the men who went to Ottawa were capable of 
     <lb/>
     driving a hard bargain. As for Mr. Smallwood, I 
     <lb/>
     do not think mat there is a more sincere man in 
     <lb/>
     this House than he is. I have known Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood long enough to know that he is utterly 
     <lb/>
     sincere and honest in his convictions. He is a very 
     <lb/>
     kindly gentleman, and possesses all the virtues 
     <lb/>
     and none of the vices. As they say, to know him 
     <lb/>
     is to love him. But one quality Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     does not possess. With all his virtues he is not the 
     <lb/>
     kind of a man thatI would hire to drive a financial 
     <lb/>
     bargain; and unfortunately that was the kind of a 
     <lb/>
     bargain that was laid in Mr. Smallwood's lap. 
     <lb/>
     The men to do this kind of thing are keen, ex<lb break="no"/>perienced, hard-headed businessmen, merchants, 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Smallwood is not, and which he does 
     <lb/>
     not want to be. It is nothing against Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood to say this. In a sense it is to his credit. But 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with our Canadian cousins, the quality 
     <lb/>
     of the bargaining and horse trading is very neces<lb break="no"/>sary for a man to have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We all know how much the USA is interested 
     <lb/>
     in this country. I think if we were wise enough to 
     <lb/>
     take advantage of the rivalry between Canada amd 
     <lb/>
     the USA, we could get almost any concession 
     <lb/>
     from either of these two countries. If we had our 
     <lb/>
     own government, and sent a good delegation to 
     <lb/>
     the USA, I am inclined to think that we would get 
     <lb/>
     a trade treaty, and that country would take all the 
     <lb/>
     fishery products that we might produce in the 
     <lb/>
     years ahead. It is in the USA that our economic 
     <lb/>
     welfare lies. They want the things that we have. 
     <lb/>
     Canada does not want the things that we have. 
     <lb/>
     And we can only prosper by exporting what we 
     <lb/>
     produce. I have no wish for a political union with 
     <lb/>
     the USA. I think as Newfoundlanders we have 
     <lb/>
     more freedom, and a lot of other good things that 
     <lb/>
     we would lose by joining politically with either 


            <cb/>
    

     Canada or the USA. But our economic welfare 
     <lb/>
     lies in the direction of the USA, and with our own 
     <lb/>
     government we will have very little difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     finding the USA very much interested in giving 
     <lb/>
     us fair economic terms. We have reached the 
     <lb/>
     point where our mineral resources on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador are beginning to bear fruit, and are 
     <lb/>
     wanted by the USA; ourfresh fish industry is only 
     <lb/>
     in its infancy, and is finding a ready market in the 
     <lb/>
     USA. And since the USA recognises our im<lb break="no"/>mense strategic importance, we are, so to speak, 
     <lb/>
     on the threshhold of a brighter economic era. It 
     <lb/>
     would be a form of madness to throw all of this 
     <lb/>
     away by giving it to Canada, with nothing in 
     <lb/>
     return. I hope that when the time comes to vote 
     <lb/>
     our Newfoundlanders will not be hypnotised by 
     <lb/>
     the pied piper. Do not listen to his tune, because 
     <lb/>
     if you do, you will do as the pied piper of old did, 
     <lb/>
     and if you follow him you will drown in the Cabot 
     <lb/>
     Strait. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we have had our ups 
     <lb/>
     and downs, and our way has been hard and the 
     <lb/>
     struggle long. But we have enjoyed some things 
     <lb/>
     that we had, and there is more freedom in New<lb break="no"/>foundland than anywhere. We are all one big 
     <lb/>
     happy family, so to speak. And I think you will 
     <lb/>
     agree with me, that neither you not I want to be 
     <lb/>
     living in a time when we cannot sing as our 
     <lb/>
     forefathers did, that good old come all ye, "We'll 
     <lb/>
     rant and we'll roar like true Newfoundlanders." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Now, I do not object to any mem<lb break="no"/>ber making speeches in reason, or when he has 
     <lb/>
     something to say that is worth listening to. In such 
     <lb/>
     cases I can overlook even the most enthusiastic 
     <lb/>
     Windjammer. For the same reason I could ap<lb break="no"/>prove of Mr. Smallwood's efforts, if at the same 
     <lb/>
     time he had given us some real facts about this 
     <lb/>
     confederation business. I find myself in the dark 
     <lb/>
     on many matters on which he should have thrown 
     <lb/>
     light. I feel that other members of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     and the people of the country feel as I do in this 
     <lb/>
     respect. Of course, he said many things and made 
     <lb/>
     many statements. But in my opinion, for every 
     <lb/>
     thing he did tell us, there are at least two others 
     <lb/>
     that he did not tell us. He handed out to us in 
     <lb/>
     plentiful supply his homemade forecasts and 
     <lb/>
     prophecies. He gazed long into the crystal ball 
     <lb/>
     and told us of the bright new world that was to 
     <lb/>
     be. But while that might be of value to him as an 
     <lb/>
    _ advertising stunt in the event of his opening a 
     <lb/>fortune teller's parlour, I am afraid that it is not 
     <lb/>much use to me, because I gave up going to

     fortune tellers long ago. I was too often put on the 
     <lb/>
     wrong track. So, Mr. Chairman, I came to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that if I wanted to find out the facts of 
     <lb/>
     this confederation issue, I should have to forget 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood and have recourse to other sour<lb break="no"/>ces, and to facts which would enable me to come 
     <lb/>
     to some common sense conclusions on this whole 
     <lb/>
     matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I first came here it was in the fond hope 
     <lb/>
     that this gathering of Newfoundlanders could 
     <lb/>
     function as an impartial body of examiners of the 
     <lb/>
     condition and prospects of our country; that in 
     <lb/>
     friendliness and co-operation we would pursue 
     <lb/>
     our labours and within a matter of months we 
     <lb/>
     would be able to present a report of our delibera<lb break="no"/>tions to the country. But what happened? Before 
     <lb/>
     we could get settled down to our job at all, we 
     <lb/>
     had this issue of confederation shoved across the 
     <lb/>
     table. At that time it struck me that it seemed 
     <lb/>
     strange, strange indeed, for this matter to come 
     <lb/>
     before us, seeing that we had neither examined 
     <lb/>
     nor reported on the matter of our own country, or 
     <lb/>
     whether it would be necessary for us to consider 
     <lb/>
     going in with any other country. It was obvious 
     <lb/>
     to me then that the parties responsible for intro<lb break="no"/>ducing this confederation issue were not con<lb break="no"/>cerned with what this Convention thought was 
     <lb/>
     best for the country, or what its final decisions 
     <lb/>
     might be. They apparently did not care what a 
     <lb/>
     survey of our accounts would show. Whether we 
     <lb/>
     were prosperous or insolvent did not seem to 
     <lb/>
     matter anything to them, because they acted 
     <lb/>
     without waiting for these things to be decided. In 
     <lb/>
     effect their actions seem to say, no matter what 
     <lb/>
     the findings of the Convention might be, no mat<lb break="no"/>ter whether we wanted confederation or not, they 
     <lb/>
     were there for the express purpose of hanging it 
     <lb/>
     around our necks... Talk about your closed 
     <lb/>
     minds, Mr. Chairman. Here is a case where we 
     <lb/>
     seem to have the mind which has never been 
     <lb/>
     anything else. We all know the unhappy results 
     <lb/>
     of this misguided action on the part of the con<lb break="no"/>federates. It destroyed the efficiency of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention before it could get down to business. It 
     <lb/>
     did away with any possibility of harmony or 
     <lb/>
     co-operation. It set the seed of political mis<lb break="no"/>guidance. In a word it sabotaged this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     and at the same time any hope which we might 
     <lb/>
     have entertained of obtaining beneficial results 
     <lb/>
     for our people. It is quite plain now that these 
     <lb/>
     people have placed their political aspirations 
 

            <cb/>
     

     before the interest of the country. Can we wonder 
     <lb/>
     then, can we be surprised at the state of things 
     <lb/>
     which resulted? Some outsiders are inclined to 
     <lb/>
     blame all of us for the unsatisfactory manner in 
     <lb/>
     which this Convention has conducted its ses<lb break="no"/>sions. But I ask, how could it be otherwise? Did 
     <lb/>
     they expect the delegates to allow this confedera<lb break="no"/>tion issue to be shoved down their throats without 
     <lb/>
     making their judgement known? Refusing to ac<lb break="no"/>cept the high pressure sales talk which the agents 
     <lb/>
     of our bartering of our country rained on them? 
     <lb/>
     The main reason we are here at all as a group is 
     <lb/>
     the desire of Newfoundlanders to live in freedom, 
     <lb/>
     to resolve the future in their own way. Yet before 
     <lb/>
     they had hardly taken their seats, we find them 
     <lb/>
     subject to this four-speeding Canadian pact. For 
     <lb/>
     myself, I can only congratulate my fellow mem<lb break="no"/>bers on their tolerance and forbearance in the face 
     <lb/>
     of the threat of dictatorship. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, as one who was born in this 
     <lb/>
     country, who is proud of the name New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, whose lifetime has been spent in her 
     <lb/>
     forests and on her sea, and who loves every inch 
     <lb/>
     of her soil as such a one I find it difficult to 
     <lb/>
     understand the mentality and the outlook of those 
     <lb/>
     who call themselves Newfoundlanders, yet are 
     <lb/>
     working for the end that Newfoundland shall no 
     <lb/>
     longer be Newfoundland, who are prepared to see 
     <lb/>
     her and all that she stands for passed into the 
     <lb/>
     hands of strangers, who are ready to make those 
     <lb/>
     who share its blood and toil servants in the house 
     <lb/>
     of another, instead of being masters in their own. 
     <lb/>
     To me at least there seems to be something wrong 
     <lb/>
     about it. It seems to violate some law of happi<lb break="no"/>ness. It seems to be a sin against morality itself. 
     <lb/>
     Yet that is the spectacle which I am witnessing 
     <lb/>
     here day after day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let me say that in spite of anything which 
     <lb/>
     I may have said, I am capable of viewing things 
     <lb/>
     fairly, and in the present instance I have tried to 
     <lb/>
     apply my sense of fairness to the present matter 
     <lb/>
     of the transfer of our sovereignty. Perhaps, I ask 
     <lb/>
     myself, we Newfoundlanders are a country that 
     <lb/>
     cannot stand alone, perhaps we are too small to 
     <lb/>
     survive as a country. But when the Financial 
     <lb/>
     Report was presented, what did I find? I found 
     <lb/>
     that every page in that report gave the lie to the 
     <lb/>
     questions I had asked. There I found undeniable 
     <lb/>
     figures and inescapable conclusions which 
     <lb/>
     proved to me beyond the shadow of a doubt that 
     <lb/>
     my country is not only solvent, but is one of the

     best—off countries in the entire world for its size 
     <lb/>
     and population. Next I considered the possibility 
     <lb/>
     that even though we were well-off now, what 
     <lb/>
     about the future? Could we stand up to the future? 
     <lb/>
     Can we carry on? I got my answer to that when 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report was read. I saw that report 
     <lb/>
     viciously attacked with all the resources of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. I heard a Newfoundlander many 
     <lb/>
     times run down his country to the dirt. I saw every 
     <lb/>
     effort being made to create despair and blue ruin. 
     <lb/>
     But I also saw the report stand up to all its 
     <lb/>
     attackers, and when the smoke cleared away its 
     <lb/>
     findings were just as staunch and undeniable as 
     <lb/>
     when it first came before us. [found that not alone 
     <lb/>
     was our future bright with hope, but that hope was 
     <lb/>
     also accompanied with a definite assurance that, 
     <lb/>
     as far as human vision and foresight can 
     <lb/>
     reasonably expect to go, the future for New<lb break="no"/>foundland looms up as the brightest in its entire 
     <lb/>
     history. These were the facts presented to me. 
     <lb/>
     These were the facts which as a sane logical 
     <lb/>
     person I have to accept, and which for the same 
     <lb/>
     reason all our people have accepted unless we are 
     <lb/>
     afraid to face the truth. Having then accepted the 
     <lb/>
     facts of our present prosperity and our hopeful 
     <lb/>
     outlook, I began to ask myself, if these things are 
     <lb/>
     so, what is all this talk about out having to have 
     <lb/>
     someone else to take us in? Why should we think 
     <lb/>
     that someone would think of rescuing the perish<lb break="no"/>ing, caring for the dying Newfoundlanders? 
     <lb/>
     What is the reason for all this confederate 
     <lb/>
     propaganda which I see around me? I have asked 
     <lb/>
     that question to myself many times, and I have 
     <lb/>
     gotten no answer. I ask it again today, and I still 
     <lb/>
     get no answers. Day after day, week after week, 
     <lb/>
     month after month, you and I have listened to the 
     <lb/>
     endless speeches of the confederates, waiting to 
     <lb/>
     see if they would give us the explanation we 
     <lb/>
     wanted. Waiting, waiting to see if they would 
     <lb/>
     give us some sane reason why we, the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country, should sell our sovereignty, bury our 
     <lb/>
     national heritage forever in an obscure corner of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian backyard...<ref target="#fn_15">[1]</ref> But I repeat, we have 
     <lb/>
     never been given the answer and the reason is 
     <lb/>
     simply this — they have no good reason to give 
     <lb/>
     us.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, a point of order. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fudge can't look into people's hearts, he 
     <lb/>
     can't tell why they do what they do. He's attribut<lb break="no"/>ing motives and not very good motives. The 
    

            <cb/>
          

     debate is nearly over. It's all been friendly the last 
     <lb/>
     few days. I think if we don't get vicious about it 
     <lb/>
     now, everybody would be a lot better off. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Fudge is simply drawing a

     conclusion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> An improper conclusion.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, that is a matter open to 
     <lb/>
     question. The fact is that conclusions have been 
     <lb/>
     drawn by members of this House on every con<lb break="no"/>ceivable question... Who am I to decide whether 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion drawn by one person, and not 
     <lb/>
     shared by any other person or persons, is incor<lb break="no"/>rect?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....My point of order is that he 
     <lb/>
     has drawn the conclusion that the motives of the

     <lb/>
     conclusion and make that imputation? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't think...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's what he said, sir.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....If the language employed is 
     <lb/>
     calculated to impute a design or motive, then Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fudge had no right to use that language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> No such a thing, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
     Before interruption I said they had no good 
     <lb/>
     reasons to give us. I state now we either buy their 
     <lb/>
     pig in a poke, sight unseen, or we do no business. 
     <lb/>
     Now Mr. Vincent, yesterday I believe, made 
     <lb/>
     some reference to the difference in the price of 
     <lb/>
     hay in Canada and here in Newfoundland. I 
     <lb/>
     believe he stated that the price of hay in Canada 
     <lb/>
     was $30 a ton and that it was $60 a ton in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. New surely Mr. Vincent, who is 
     <lb/>
     a businessman, is not trying to impress upon the 
     <lb/>
     people that he has $30 profit on a ton of hay. I 
     <lb/>
     don't think he intended to do that. I did expect 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Vincent to explain the difference between the 
     <lb/>
     $20 and the $30. I understand that the cost of 
     <lb/>
     transportation on hay is around $20. The duty on 
     <lb/>
     the hay is approximately $5. And he knows, as I 
     <lb/>
     find the figures, there's about a profit of $2 on the 
     <lb/>
     sale of hay. I want to impress upon the delegates 
     <lb/>
     that no matter whether we went into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion or not, the cost of transportation will be the 
     <lb/>
     same, whether in or out, unless somebody in this 
     <lb/>
     country is prepared, or Mr. Smallwood might be 
     <lb/>
     able, to go up and bring it down for nothing. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood 20% off.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I'm talking about the freight rate.

     there now of ... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No matter what it is, it's still 
     <lb/>
     20% less under confederation, you know that. 
     <lb/>
     The hay that comes by rail is 20% off. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't want any arguments at 
     <lb/>
     all. Mr. Fudge has the floor, and unless and until 
     <lb/>
     any member arises to a point of order or a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of privilege, he is not to be interrupted... 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fudge We've been told that under con<lb break="no"/>federation the cost of living would be reduced. 
     <lb/>
     We have been told this repeatedly. I fail to see to 
     <lb/>
     what extent. We must not forget that we are living 
     <lb/>
     on an island. In Canada, where rail haul is short, 
     <lb/>
     and consequently tranSportation and delivery 
     <lb/>
     costs low, the position is quite different to what 
     <lb/>
     it would be in this country. No such benefits 
     <lb/>
     would accrue to our people. We would still have 
     <lb/>
     to pay the regular freight direct from western 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the eastern seaboard — Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     Halifax, Sydney or Prince Edward Island to New<lb break="no"/>foundland —— marine insurance, wharfage, and 
     <lb/>
     distribution costs. Many of the items coming into 
     <lb/>
     this country from Canada pay little or no customs 
     <lb/>
     duty at the present time. All importations from 
     <lb/>
     the United States and the United Kingdom will 
     <lb/>
     be subject to customs duty under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and these are no small amounts of our total 
     <lb/>
     volume of imports. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another matter I wish to refer to is a statement 
     <lb/>
     made by Premier Jones of Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     the other day, when he said, in substance, that 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland coming into confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada, his island province could expect to 
     <lb/>
     market an additional amount of its produce. This 
     <lb/>
     would mean, according to Premier Jones, that an 
     <lb/>
     air transport service would be inaugurated with 
     <lb/>
     the west coast of our island. Let my constituency 
     <lb/>
     businessmen of Corner Brook and the Codroy 
     <lb/>
     Valley, the latter represented by Mr. Keough, 
     <lb/>
     take note that Premier Jones says that potatoes, 
     <lb/>
     vegetables of all kinds, livestock, meat, eggs and 
     <lb/>
     grain, should find a substantial market in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Labrador — Labrador's mine 
     <lb/>
     development especially, Premier Jones said, 
     <lb/>
     when the Labrador railway is completed. When 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland joins Canada, Frontier Jones said, 
     <lb/>
     a weekly service would be developed by steamer, 
     <lb/>
     and if the Harmon airfield in the vicinity of 
     <lb/>
     Stephenville could be operated for commercial 
     <lb/>
     freight planes, commodities such as milk, etc., 
     <lb/>
     would be carried by air freight to the west coast. 
 <lb/>

            <cb/>
          

     Air traffic would also be developed with 
     <lb/>
     Labrador through Goose Bay, and all com<lb break="no"/>modities from PEI would be flown in there and 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland. Commodities such as milk, 
     <lb/>
     eggs, fruit, butter, pork, cheese, and other goods 
     <lb/>
     would gain a market now served partly by our 
     <lb/>
     farmers of the Codroy Valley. I wonder what 
     <lb/>
     does my friend Mr. Keough, who so ably repre<lb break="no"/>sents the district of St. George's and the Codroy 
     <lb/>
     Valley, think of this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> presented his budget some 
     <lb/>
     time ago showing that he would require some $15 
     <lb/>
     million or$16 million to run the province, should 
     <lb/>
     we become one. When asked how he proposed 
     <lb/>
     getting this revenue, he stated that as in other 
     <lb/>
     provinces in Canada, the industrial towns would 
     <lb/>
     be taxed to pay for the poor ones. He 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood Point of order. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I made no such statement. I'm not going to be 
     <lb/>
     misstated, and I said nothing even like that, noth<lb break="no"/>ing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have no recollection of his 
     <lb/>
     having said that.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Complete misrepresentation. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fudge I understood that Mr. Smallwood, in 
     <lb/>
     pointing out about raising taxes, referred to the 
     <lb/>
     industrial centres in Canada which were paying 
     <lb/>
     the high taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> His statement was that 89% of 
     <lb/>
     the total revenue derived by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment was obtained from the three provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, and the 
     <lb/>
     remaining six provinces paid the remaining 11%. 
     <lb/>
     That was the statement Mr. Smallwood made. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fudge If that is so, Mr. Chairman, the in<lb break="no"/>dustrial towns in Newfoundland such as Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook, Buchans, Grand Falls, Bell Island, St. 
     <lb/>
     John's and some of our largest outport towns will 
     <lb/>
     be trimmed to balance Mr. Smallwood's budget. 
     <lb/>
     When I look at this confederation in such alight, 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing seems so silly and extravagant 
     <lb/>
     and stupid, that I ask myself how this crazy issue 
     <lb/>
     ever got into this chamber. And how did he 
     <lb/>
     manage to get us to take it seriously? And he can 
     <lb/>
     tie up our work for over three months. But it 
     <lb/>
     seems we have to face reality. The absurd thing 
     <lb/>
     has been foisted on us. It has destroyed the work 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention. It has to all sensible New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders become an actual fact, and whether 
     <lb/>
     we like it or not we have to deal with it. The 
     <lb/>
     records of our proceedings indicate that we did

     not receive the report of the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     with any great amount of enthusiasm. Even more 
     <lb/>
     significantly, people outside this chamber have 
     <lb/>
     not allowed themselves to be carried away by its 
     <lb/>
     rosy contents. The answer to this is not hard to 
     <lb/>
     find. Newfoundlanders are as a whole a realistic 
     <lb/>
     and common sense people. They know by hard 
     <lb/>
     experience that pennies don't fall from heaven. 
     <lb/>
     They look with suspicion on anyone who tells 
     <lb/>
     them they are going to get something for nothing. 
     <lb/>
     In spite of all the high pressure sales talk, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of all the hour-long speeches our people are still 
     <lb/>
     suspicious. In the meantime this Canadian 
     <lb/>
     prospect is being stripped down to its frame and 
     <lb/>
     the stuffing has been taken out. In short the thing 
     <lb/>
   is being debunked and Santa Claus is having his 
     <lb/>
     whiskers pulled off. If I were to give credit to any 
     <lb/>
     one man for his valuable service in showing up 
     <lb/>
     this confederation issue, it would be Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. His over-eagerness to convince us 
     <lb/>
     showed us that we should not allow ourselves to 
     <lb/>
     be convinced, and above all, he is the one who 
     <lb/>
     impressed it indelibly on our minds, that we 
     <lb/>
     should not for a moment consider anything that 
     <lb/>
     would be of sound presumption. We remember 
     <lb/>
     how, when the Economic Report was brought in 
     <lb/>
     with its modest three year forecast, he denounced 
     <lb/>
     the committee for daring to make any forecast. 
     <lb/>
     Such things, he said, were not worth the paper 
     <lb/>
     they were written on. Mr. Smallwood told us it 
     <lb/>
     was neglect for us to work on the basis of 
     <lb/>
     presumption. And this same gentleman, this hater 
     <lb/>
     of presumption and forecast, came in here and 
     <lb/>
     coolly asked us to accept his budget based on no 
     <lb/>
     less than an eight year forecast. Well, we knew 
     <lb/>
     then just what we were up against. We knew just 
     <lb/>
     how much value we could place on all that he had 
     <lb/>
     said before. I at least am duly grateful to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood for his distinguished service in help<lb break="no"/>ing me to see the real meaning of this confedera<lb break="no"/>tion issue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I do not intend to waste the 
     <lb/>
     time of this Convention by dealing in detail with 
     <lb/>
     the report before the Chair. Other members have 
     <lb/>
     already dealt with the figures contained in it. 
     <lb/>
     They have dealt with them as they deserved, and 
     <lb/>
     it is not worthwhile kicking a dead horse We 
     <lb/>
     know that they are unreliable. I feel sure that all 
     <lb/>
     intelligent Newfoundlanders already know this, 
     <lb/>
     but there are doubtless many who have not the 
     <lb/>
     means of getting in touch with our deliberations, 


            <cb/>
          

     and they are still under a delusion. It should be 
     <lb/>
     the prime duty of all of us to get the truth to these 
     <lb/>
     people. I heard a lot of talk about taxes. But I note 
     <lb/>
     that when Mr. Smallwood is asked about certain 
     <lb/>
     taxes, he tells us that the Canadians won't put that 
     <lb/>
     tax on us, that will be the matter for the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government. Is he trying to give us the impression 
     <lb/>
     that since the federal government won't impose 
     <lb/>
     a particular tax, it won't be imposed at all? We 
     <lb/>
     know too well that every tax necessary to balance 
     <lb/>
     our budget will be placed on our people. What 
     <lb/>
     does it matter who takes our taxes, so long as we 
     <lb/>
     have to shell out our dollars? This is one point 
     <lb/>
     you will not hear Mr. Smallwood talking about. 
     <lb/>
     All he has told us are the good things. For in<lb break="no"/>stance, they say that every Newfoundland child 
     <lb/>
     under a certain age will be entitled to a baby 
     <lb/>
     bonus. But why not say that the same child after 
     <lb/>
     he comes of age will spend the rest of his life 
     <lb/>
     paying back the baby bonus in taxes? They tell 
     <lb/>
     us all of all the benefits which will come to our 
     <lb/>
     workers under confederation. But they do not tell 
     <lb/>
     us that under confederation every small industry 
     <lb/>
     and factory in the island will be put out of busi<lb break="no"/>ness and its workmen out of jobs. In St. John's 
     <lb/>
     alone, Mr. Chairman, and throughout the country 
     <lb/>
     in a few years those industries will be reduced 
     <lb/>
     and our people out of work and forced to go and 
     <lb/>
     make a living elsewhere. In time, all we will have 
     <lb/>
     in this country will be the very young and the very 
     <lb/>
     old. Why not tell about the Canadian tax collector 
     <lb/>
     who will go around selling our people's proper<lb break="no"/>ty? Why not tell our people that no government 
     <lb/>
     on earth gives its people something for nothing; 
     <lb/>
     that for every dollar the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     gives us, it will demand a dollar, perhaps more in 
     <lb/>
     return? We will be taxed here, there and 
     <lb/>
     everywhere. We will be taxed from the cradle to 
     <lb/>
     the grave. This report is only a reminder of the 
     <lb/>
     saying that figures sometime lie, that it is easy to 
     <lb/>
     put a bright coat of paint over an old rotten skiff 
     <lb/>
     and pass it off as something good. I suggest 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that in the matter of this Ottawa report 
     <lb/>
     we accept Mr. Smallwood's own advice and ac<lb break="no"/>cept nothing which is not based on facts, and that 
     <lb/>
     we throw his eight year budget, with all its 
     <lb/>
     presumptions, into the waste basket where they 
     <lb/>
     belong.

            <p>
     If we want to find out about living conditions 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, let us ask the man who lives there. 
     <lb/>
     Does he shout about Canada like this advocate of

     confederation? Not at all. He is quite sober about 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing. I have talked to many of them 
     <lb/>
     lately. I have been talking to a Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     who sold his home in Canada, gave up his job and 
     <lb/>
     returned here because he could not pay his in<lb break="no"/>come tax. I have heard from Canadians who say 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundlanders would be crazy to enter 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada. And by the way, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, I've heard of some of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     politicians who say how generous Canada is in 
     <lb/>
     taking over our national debt. Why don't some of 
     <lb/>
     our Ottawa delegation tell us how foolish we are 
     <lb/>
     to take over Canada's huge and ever increasing 
     <lb/>
     public debt? Only this morning I came across the 
     <lb/>
     following in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Financial Post</hi> dated January 3, 
     <lb/>
     1948. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There's some articles you can't 
     <lb/>
     quote from. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I'm not quoting, but Vancouver in 
     <lb/>
     November had 1,000 jobs opened and 12,000 
     <lb/>
     applications — 12,000 applicants. Since then 
     <lb/>
     things are believed to have gotten worse. The 
     <lb/>
     same thing is true in the Maritimes and to a lesser 
     <lb/>
     degree in other provinces. There is a flash mes<lb break="no"/>sage to you from Mr, Smallwood's Garden of 
     <lb/>
     Eden... The proof of the pudding they say is in 
     <lb/>
     the eating, and the best voice is the voice of 
     <lb/>
     experience. In this case the voice of the people 
     <lb/>
     who live in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Just one other point. It seems to be forgotten 
     <lb/>
     that Canada's present position financially and 
     <lb/>
     economically is the offshoot of a war boom. It is 
     <lb/>
     not a solid peace-time economy, and we must 
     <lb/>
     also bear in mind that the recent surplus an<lb break="no"/>nounced by the Canadian government is not 
     <lb/>
     earned revenue. As you have heard Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     say, Canada is at present a hard-up country. She 
     <lb/>
     is short of dollars and is even talking about hold<lb break="no"/>ing a sweepstake to obtain American dollars. Her 
     <lb/>
     people are entering on the road of austerity, 
     <lb/>
     which is only a more polite term for poverty. That 
     <lb/>
     is the position now. What might it be this time 
     <lb/>
     next year? By then Canadian taxes and Canadian 
     <lb/>
     prices may be gone sky high. The baby bonus 
     <lb/>
     may be a thing of the past. What consolation will 
     <lb/>
     it be for us to say then that that was not what they 
     <lb/>
     told us in the Grey Book or the Black Book? 
     <lb/>
     These are the things which we must consider, not 
     <lb/>
     financial statements and the like. It is time we put 
     <lb/>
     dreams of Santa Claus aside. Christmas is over. 
     <lb/>
     When it is all boiled down, we will find that this 
  

            <cb/>
         

     Black Book and the Grey Book are nothing more 
     <lb/>
     than an empty gesture which can disappear like 
     <lb/>
     a bubble overnight. Is that the sort of thing they 
     <lb/>
     want us to base the future of this country and its 
     <lb/>
     people on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I conclude my remarks in the 
     <lb/>
     full confidence that when the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country realise what this proposal of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion means to them in their everyday life, when 
     <lb/>
     they realise the rain of taxes which will descend 
     <lb/>
     on them from every direction, when they realise 
     <lb/>
     the overlying plan which has as its object the 
     <lb/>
     swallowing up of this country, then I have con<lb break="no"/>fidence they will know how to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     situation — just as I trust the members of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention will know how to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     costly and worthless Ottawa report when the time 
     <lb/>
     comes for voting on it. At the very opening of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention I said that this good old ship, a ship 
     <lb/>
     of state in my opinion, was not in a position to 
     <lb/>
     send out an SOS to a Canadian rescue tug. She is 
     <lb/>
     still in that position. She is awaiting her New<lb break="no"/>foundland crew to sail her into her home port. I 
     <lb/>
     say to you, and to my fellow countrymen, get on 
     <lb/>
     board, sail her over.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Before I begin to address this Con<lb break="no"/>vention I wish to pay a word of tribute to the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Job upon the action that he has taken this 
     <lb/>
     evening. All my own life I have been considered 
     <lb/>
     somewhat of an extremist, and in consequence I 
     <lb/>
     can appreciate the gesture of a man who is 
     <lb/>
     prepared practically to risk his life in order to 
     <lb/>
     have his say upon a matter so vital to his country, 
     <lb/>
     that is now before us. And whilst I'm afraid that 
     <lb/>
     I cannot quite concur with the Hon. Mr. Job in all 
     <lb/>
     that he has said, I nevertheless wish to avail 
     <lb/>
     myself of this opportunity to pay my tribute to a 
     <lb/>
     gallant gentleman, and one who I have always 
     <lb/>
     credited with being perfectly sincere according 
     <lb/>
     to his own lights, as I hope, when this Convention 
     <lb/>
     is all over and done with, I will be credited with 
     <lb/>
     being sincere according to mine.

     "'I know what you are thinking about,' said

     Tweedledum, 'but it isn't so, no how.' 'Contrary

     <lb/>
     might be, and if it were so, it would be. But as it 
     <lb/>
     isn't, it ain't. That's logic." I wonder if by any

     chance Lewis Carroll was vouchsafed a vision of 
     <lb/>
     this great debate that is now drawing to its close,

     lines. Certain I am that Tweedledee and Tweed<lb break="no"/>ledum would both have felt very much at home 
     <lb/>
     in this chamber during the past several weeks. Up 
     <lb/>
     until as late as only yesterday I had no intention 
     <lb/>
     of risking my reputation, such as that may be, by 
     <lb/>
     becoming involved in this great floundering 
     <lb/>
     around the Canadian mulberry bush that has been 
     <lb/>
     going on here for some time. When at this late 
     <lb/>
     moment I do so, it is against my better judgement, 
     <lb/>
     and because I have been unable to resist the 
     <lb/>
     temptation to have a final word upon a matter that 
     <lb/>
     I have been at pains to stress throughout this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. I have kept out of this debate so far 
     <lb/>
     for a great many reasons, and by no means the 
     <lb/>
     least of these has been that I had a very inadequate 
     <lb/>
     training for effective participation in the genesis 
     <lb/>
     and genius of such debate that has been going on 
     <lb/>
     in this chamber of immortals. You see, sometime 
     <lb/>
     when I was very young I had the very great 
     <lb/>
     misfortune of being taught that two and two make 
     <lb/>
     four, and I have believed that all my life. But 
     <lb/>
     whenever during this Convention I have tried to 
     <lb/>
     put two and two together, I have found that my 
     <lb/>
     argument has been misinterpreted as adding up 
     <lb/>
     to 3.999 or 4.111, or what is undoubtedly held in 
     <lb/>
     some quarters to be the final treachery of all, an 
     <lb/>
     argument for confederation. Or again, I have to 
     <lb/>
     be of the mind that what matters most to the 
     <lb/>
     average man, once he is free in the practice of his 
     <lb/>
     religion, is three square meals a day. And that 
     <lb/>
     granted that, he doesn't worry very much about 
     <lb/>
     who sits in the seat of government and gets the 
     <lb/>
     grant. But I have found that to say as much in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, has been to invite condemnation as 
     <lb/>
     a materialist. This I have found to be strange logic 
     <lb/>
     indeed, particularly when I remember that in 
     <lb/>
     1933 the only answer of some of our best minds 
     <lb/>
     to all who took a stand against the surrender of 
     <lb/>
     our constitution was, "And how do you propose 
     <lb/>
     to feed this people?" I have failed completely to 
     <lb/>
     understand how it could be patriotism to worry 
     <lb/>
     about three square meals a day for all in 1933, but 
     <lb/>
     merely materialism to worry about three square 
     <lb/>
     meals a day for all in 1948. In consequence Ihave 
     <lb/>
     preferred to stay out of this debate by distortion. 
     <lb/>
     That, in my opinion, is exactly What it has been, 
     <lb/>
     and I will content myself with the statement that 
     <lb/>
     during this debate statements have been made, 
     <lb/>
     and many of them, calculated merely so to distort 
     <lb/>
     the whole confederation issue as to leave the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people completely confused.

            <p>
     On the one hand I have heard everything <choice><sic>con<lb break="no"/>ceiveable</sic><corr>conceivable</corr></choice> thrown at the idea of union. All the old 
     <lb/>
     arguments, all the skeletons of ancient bogies that 
     <lb/>
     have been dangling in the closet since 1869, have 
     <lb/>
     been given a new coat of whitewash and brought 
     <lb/>
     out for further service — all, that is, with one 
     <lb/>
     exception. I have heard no mention as yet of that 
     <lb/>
     most effective propaganda piece of 1869, that 
     <lb/>
     Canadians shoot babies out of cannons. I suggest 
     <lb/>
     that that is something not to be overlooked. For 
     <lb/>
     after all, it would be just as logical to expect 
     <lb/>
     people to believe that as to expect them to believe 
     <lb/>
     some of the things that I have heard in this cham<lb break="no"/>ber during the past weeks. On the other hand, it 
     <lb/>
     is not impossible that some of our people may 
     <lb/>
     have been left with the impression that with con<lb break="no"/>federation, we should come into the inheritance 
     <lb/>
     of a new Jerusalem flowing with milk and with 
     <lb/>
     honey and with maple leafs. I have no objection 
     <lb/>
     to the coming of the millennium except, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     that I think that I should find it dreadfully boring. 
     <lb/>
     But I don't expect to see it come to pass in my 
     <lb/>
     time, and I very much doubt that my son will see 
     <lb/>
     it come to pass in his time. Being a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     man, I am quite prepared to think that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is not inclined to tell us that the 
     <lb/>
     millennium will come upon us in consequence of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not my intention at this late date to try to 
     <lb/>
     sift for you the proof from the propaganda. But 
     <lb/>
     for the satisfaction of my own conscience, I have 
     <lb/>
     tried to keep in View the point that this debate was 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be about in the first place, namely 
     <lb/>
     whether or not a fair and equitable basis may exist 
     <lb/>
     for federal union of Newfoundland and Canada. 
     <lb/>
     That is what the delegation was sent to Ottawa to 
     <lb/>
     investigate, and that is what each of us has to 
     <lb/>
     decide for himself upon the basis of the docu<lb break="no"/>ments submitted to us. The only alternative is to 
     <lb/>
     play it safe, and to avoid the issue and take refuge 
     <lb/>
     in a confession of inability to complete the work 
     <lb/>
     that in standing for election we undertook to do. 
     <lb/>
     I have no intention of going into the decision that 
     <lb/>
     I have come to in this matter. I shall get around 
     <lb/>
     to that in the great final debates that will follow 
     <lb/>
     immediately. For the moment, I want merely to 
     <lb/>
     relate my concept of what confederation would 
     <lb/>
     mean, as formulated from the documents before 
     <lb/>
     us, to that matter upon which I have been so 
     <lb/>
     insistent throughout this Convention — namely, 
     <lb/>
     that for the future the ordinary man of this island

     must have a greater portion than has been his 
     <lb/>
     historic portion. We have been witness in our 
     <lb/>
     time to a great movement of the minds of men 
     <lb/>
     that's already come to have some effect upon the 
     <lb/>
     economics we live by and that cannot but have 
     <lb/>
     further considerable effect upon the shape of 
     <lb/>
     things economic in this land. But before I go on 
     <lb/>
     to relate these proposed arrangements for the 
     <lb/>
     entry of Newfoundland into confederation to all 
     <lb/>
     that, let me say this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During all the days of this Convention, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell and myself have gone out of our way at 
     <lb/>
     times to emphasise and italicise and reiterate the 
     <lb/>
     economics. We have hammered away at the 
     <lb/>
     theme of three square meals a day, and a decent 
     <lb/>
     suit of clothes on the back, and a tight roof over 
     <lb/>
     the head, every time that we have had our mouths 
     <lb/>
     open. Maybe we've overdone it, But I doubt that 
     <lb/>
     in this land such a theme can be overdone. I know 
     <lb/>
     that more often than not we have not said the 
     <lb/>
     proper things. But then, the thoughts that one has 
     <lb/>
     had holed up for the night in a tilt on the trail to 
     <lb/>
     Flower's Cove, or wallowing around the bill of 
     <lb/>
     Cape St. George in a lobster smack, have not been 
     <lb/>
     particularly proper thoughts either. And the mere 
     <lb/>
     shift of scene to the National Convention has not 
     <lb/>
     been anything like enough to stifle that. We have 
     <lb/>
     had a long association, Mr. Newell and I, with the 
     <lb/>
     men of this island whose overalls reek with the 
     <lb/>
     salt of the fish flakes, the manure of the barnyard, 
     <lb/>
     and the resin of the pulpwoods, and it has not 
     <lb/>
     been particularly conducive to the mouthing of 
     <lb/>
     platitudes. If at times we have sounded somewhat 
     <lb/>
     bitter, I hope that we haven't, but if we have, then 
     <lb/>
     that has been because we have sometimes seen 
     <lb/>
     such sights as a whole family curled up for a 
     <lb/>
     winter's night in a circle around the fire, or on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of a tar-paper shack; or a mother cooking 
     <lb/>
     for her children a dinner of pancakes of sour<lb break="no"/>dough on top of a sawed-off oil drum that served 
     <lb/>
     as a stove, or because, to quote Mr. Newell, "I 
     <lb/>
     saw death and hunger on a barren coastline/The 
     <lb/>
     empty cupboard and the lean winter — /But 
     <lb/>
     deeper than all the beaten look of despair/W as the 
     <lb/>
     dumb and impotent fury/In a man's eyes as he 
     <lb/>
     tumed/To the thing that had to be done."<ref target="#fn_16">[1]</ref> So if 
     <lb/>
     we said things that have rankled, don't think that 
     <lb/>
     they were dreamed up in an easy chair before a 
     <lb/>
     comfortable fire, because they weren't; and don't 
  

            <cb/>
      

     think we're sorry if by any chance we've dis<lb break="no"/>turbed somebody's peace of mind, because we're 
     <lb/>
     not. We may have had some hard things to say, 
     <lb/>
     but if we have, then it's been because we've felt 
     <lb/>
     that at this moment of historic decision, a few 
     <lb/>
     hard sayings wouldn't go amiss. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the great movement of the minds of men 
     <lb/>
     to which I refer has been a movement ofthe 
     <lb/>
     minds of men to the left; and this movement has 
     <lb/>
     had repercussions in the economies of most 
     <lb/>
     countries, including our own. All the days of all 
     <lb/>
     our lives, this movement of the mass of men to 
     <lb/>
     the left has been going on. Sometimes it has been 
     <lb/>
     a dribble, sometimes a torrent. With some it has 
     <lb/>
     been a matter of honest, intellectual conviction 
     <lb/>
     that that is the way that they should go; with most, 
     <lb/>
     it has been merely a matter of hoping to be cut in 
     <lb/>
     for a larger slice of the cake to be divided among 
     <lb/>
     the numbers of the nation. Indeed, irrespective of 
     <lb/>
     what may have driven the pundits to the left, it 
     <lb/>
     has been the hope of more bread and more lavish 
     <lb/>
     circuses that has enticed the people. Inevitably 
     <lb/>
     there has been class conflict over the division of 
     <lb/>
     the cake. In some countries this has led to bitter 
     <lb/>
     class warfare resulting in the elimination of the 
     <lb/>
     older aristocracies and the setting up of a new 
     <lb/>
     aristocracy ruling in the name of the proletariat. 
     <lb/>
     Just how much of the cake the proletariat has 
     <lb/>
     come to be cut in for in consequence of all this, 
     <lb/>
     however, seems rather problematic. Every now 
     <lb/>
     and then there are disquieting rumours out of 
     <lb/>
     Russia, for instance. Other peoples have settled 
     <lb/>
     for less than the dictatorship of the proletariat and 
     <lb/>
     are content, for the moment at any rate, with 
     <lb/>
     social security legislation calculated to improve 
     <lb/>
     the economic condition of low income groups. 
     <lb/>
     Scarcely a country but has in our own time made 
     <lb/>
     provision for a wider distribution of the cake. 
     <lb/>
     That is why you have workmen's compensation, 
     <lb/>
     minimum wage legislation, unemployment in<lb break="no"/>surance, widows' pensions, family allowances 
     <lb/>
     and all the rest of it. These are things that 
     <lb/>
     everyone has come to take for granted in the 
     <lb/>
     countries where they have them, or to look for in 
     <lb/>
     the countries where they haven' t. So I say that the 
     <lb/>
     whole consciousness of mankind has moved a 
     <lb/>
     little left of centre. Even your arch- conservative 
     <lb/>
     today is more social-minded than was his 
     <lb/>
     grandfather. At any rate, if he be eligible for old

     <lb/>
     Most people don't give a second thought to social 
     <lb/>
     legislation which, a generation ago, would have 
     <lb/>
     been damned as rank socialism. Indeed, right, left 
     <lb/>
     and centre may hardly be said to be positions in 
     <lb/>
     politics and economics, forever fixed by im<lb break="no"/>mutable law, but are instead fluid positions deter<lb break="no"/>mined from time to time, and we're witness that 
     <lb/>
     what is held to be extreme by one generation is 
     <lb/>
     often held to be conservative by another. There<lb break="no"/>fore, it may be said that the centre itself has lately 
     <lb/>
     come to be a little left of centre. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In our own land one doesn't have to go very 
     <lb/>
     far out of one's way to observe what has come of 
     <lb/>
     the movement of men's minds to the left. There 
     <lb/>
     was first of all the organised attempt to secure a 
     <lb/>
     wider distribution of the cake to the various 
     <lb/>
     unions of fishermen, loggers, labourers, clerks 
     <lb/>
     and so forth....<ref target="#fn_17">[1]</ref> Now I grant you that the cake we 
     <lb/>
     have to cut in this island is no Christmas cake; 
     <lb/>
     rather it is mostly a fishcake'. But I am ready to 
     <lb/>
     agree with Mr. Newell, that cut into such slices 
     <lb/>
     as social justice would dictate, it could provide a 
     <lb/>
     frugal living for our people, and in that the labour 
     <lb/>
     and co-operative movements apparently concur. 
     <lb/>
     Otherwise they would merely be engaged in the 
     <lb/>
     rather futile endeavour of butting their heads 
     <lb/>
     against the stone wall. And there has come of the 
     <lb/>
     desire of men in this island to achieve a wider 
     <lb/>
     handing out of the cake some social legislation, 
     <lb/>
     but not nearly enough of it, and some admission 
     <lb/>
     by management of the common man into a 
     <lb/>
     greater return from the increment of production. 
     <lb/>
     In evidence of the same, witness old age pen<lb break="no"/>sions, workmen's compensation, minimum wage 
     <lb/>
     legislation, improved public health services and 
     <lb/>
     so on, and many union working agreements, 
     <lb/>
     higher wages and improved working conditions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But as Mr. Newell has already pointed out, 
     <lb/>
     social legislation is not enough. Social legislation 
     <lb/>
     is merely stop-gap legislation. Family allowan<lb break="no"/>ces are merely something that a man must have, 
     <lb/>
     because the character of the economy is not such 
     <lb/>
     as enables him to provide adequately for his 
     <lb/>
     family out of his own efforts. Old age pensions 
     <lb/>
     are something that the aged must have, because 
     <lb/>
     the character of the economy in which they lived 
     <lb/>
     was not such as to permit them in their youth to 
     <lb/>
     provide adequately for their old age. Unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment insurance is something all modern men 


            <cb/>
     

     need, because they can never be certain at what 
     <lb/>
     moment the economy will put them out of a job 
     <lb/>
     and out of a livelihood. Minimum wage legisla<lb break="no"/>tion becomes necessary when the economic or<lb break="no"/>ganisation of society tends to deprive the labourer 
     <lb/>
     of his just hire. Not that I'm against social legis<lb break="no"/>lation — at this juncture it is most necessary. But 
     <lb/>
     at its best, what it attempts is to make the best of 
     <lb/>
     a bad bargain. What men everywhere, and in this 
     <lb/>
     island, have been seeking in edging to the left, in 
     <lb/>
     demanding the wider distribution of the cake, has 
     <lb/>
     been simply this — the opportunity from an 
     <lb/>
     honest effort to make a decent living, the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to come by such return from their labour 
     <lb/>
     as will enable them to provide their families with 
     <lb/>
     adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medi<lb break="no"/>cal attention, recreation, and yet enable them to 
     <lb/>
     put aside something for their old age. Only within 
     <lb/>
     an economy that admits of as much can Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell's fisherman hope to come by sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     send his son to Memorial College to study Greek 
     <lb/>
     if he wants to, and can my last forgotten fisher<lb break="no"/>man on the bill of Cape St. George come to have, 
     <lb/>
     in addition to his three square meals a day, his 
     <lb/>
     mug-up going to bed. And if any delegate is still 
     <lb/>
     of the opinion that not all men can have that 
     <lb/>
     much, maybe he will undertake to answer the 
     <lb/>
     question thatI asked way back at the beginning 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention — what men are you going to 
     <lb/>
     require to be satisfied with just exactly how much 
     <lb/>
     less? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The common man of this island now has ideas 
     <lb/>
     about a larger slice of the cake. He will likely 
     <lb/>
     become insistent, beyond the point of merely 
     <lb/>
     pounding the table, as time goes on. I know of but 
     <lb/>
     two methods of approach to the resolution of that 
     <lb/>
     difficulty, without running the risk of strife and 
     <lb/>
     unrest, which we want to avoid at all costs. I have 
     <lb/>
     been at pains in my examination of the Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book and the Black Books... and in listening to 
     <lb/>
     this debate, to seek to determine if confederation 
     <lb/>
     would provide a third formula for a redistribution 
     <lb/>
     of the cake. I am convinced that to a not incon<lb break="no"/>siderable extent it will. It will go as far as family 
     <lb/>
     allowances go, which is no little way. It will go 
     <lb/>
     as far as unemployment insurance and aug<lb break="no"/>mented old age pensions go, which is no mean 
     <lb/>
     distance. It will go as far as taxation related to 
     <lb/>
     capacity to pay will go, which is a considerable 
     <lb/>
     distance. But I am not completely convinced that

     confederation <hi rendition="simple:italic">per se</hi> and in itself will set to rights 
     <lb/>
     the basic economic maladjustments from which 
     <lb/>
     arises the necessity for a wider distribution of the 
     <lb/>
     cake. Not that that is anything to confederation's 
     <lb/>
     detriment. To adjust those maladjustments you 
     <lb/>
     have to do more than change the form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, you have to change the economics that men 
     <lb/>
     live by. In other words, as far as I can honestly 
     <lb/>
     and in conscience go at this moment is to say this: 
     <lb/>
     that I think that confederation is part of the 
     <lb/>
     answer that I am looking for, for Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     but that it is still not the complete and final 
     <lb/>
     answer. No form of government can be that. The 
     <lb/>
     complete and final answer to a more spacious 
     <lb/>
     destiny can come only from among the people 
     <lb/>
     themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I look in the first instance to the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement to set to rights the basic economic 
     <lb/>
     maladjustments of this land. Someone, in a rather 
     <lb/>
     obvious attempt to smear the movement, called 
     <lb/>
     the co-operative movement communist. It hap<lb break="no"/>pens to be the very antithesis. The co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement is private enterprise carried to its logi<lb break="no"/>cal conclusion, for the aim of private enterprise 
     <lb/>
     is ownership, and what the co-operative move<lb break="no"/>ment seeks is the widest ownership for the 
     <lb/>
     greatest number. I am convinced that New<lb break="no"/>foundland cannot afford not to have a largely 
     <lb/>
     co-operative economy, but I know that such an 
     <lb/>
     economy is not going to emerge next year, or the 
     <lb/>
     year after, or the year after that. All we have to 
     <lb/>
     show for ten years of effort is a few hundred 
     <lb/>
     organisations from the first 10,000 disciples. 
     <lb/>
     That is a creditable showing. But I nevertheless 
     <lb/>
     doubt that the co-operative movement can take 
     <lb/>
     up the slack in our economic and social system 
     <lb/>
     fast enough. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That leaves only one other acceptable formula 
     <lb/>
     immediately available that could be employed to 
     <lb/>
     achieve a more equitable division of the cake; 
     <lb/>
     that is participation by labour, through owner<lb break="no"/>ship, in that margin of return from commerce and 
     <lb/>
     industry up till now earmarked for the recom<lb break="no"/>pense of capital and management. Various labour 
     <lb/>
     and protective unions have done much to have 
     <lb/>
     the cake and pass it around more generously, by 
     <lb/>
     securing a greater return to the labourer for his 
     <lb/>
     hire and to the producer for his produce. But there 
     <lb/>
     are real economic limits to just how far that can 
     <lb/>
     be carried, particularly in a country of primary 
     <lb/>
     production whose industries must endeavour to 
  

            <cb/>
    

     hold their own in the rough and tumble of world 
     <lb/>
     competition. There is just so far that collective 
     <lb/>
     bargaining and mutual assistance associations 
     <lb/>
     can go to achieve wage increases for the labourer, 
     <lb/>
     and price increases for the primary producer, and 
     <lb/>
     thereby increase the common man's share in the 
     <lb/>
     national income. Some unions and associations 
     <lb/>
     are well along toward that point of just-so-far 
     <lb/>
     already. But even if further increases could be 
     <lb/>
     achieved, they would not alter the basic in<lb break="no"/>security that attaches to the lives of the wage- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     earning class, would not guarantee them 
     <lb/>
     permanently a larger slice of the cake. That can 
     <lb/>
     come only in consequence of ownership. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It could very easily be that we shall shortly 
     <lb/>
     witness a great translation of most of our people 
     <lb/>
     into wage earners in consequence of an industrial 
     <lb/>
     revolution in our fishing industry. Predominant<lb break="no"/>ly, our people have always been and still are of 
     <lb/>
     considerable personal independence in industry. 
     <lb/>
     That independence has been founded upon their 
     <lb/>
     ownership of their own instruments of produc<lb break="no"/>tion, upon their ownership of their own fishing 
     <lb/>
     boats, their own fishing gear and their own fish<lb break="no"/>ing rooms. But we have now come to the point 
     <lb/>
     where a considerable mechanisation and 
     <lb/>
     centralisation of our fishing industry is in<lb break="no"/>evitable; either we shall have that, or we shall 
     <lb/>
     have no fishing industry. It is easy to foresee how 
     <lb/>
     such mechanisation and centralisation could lead 
     <lb/>
     to the creation of a large fishing proletariat 
     <lb/>
     employed as wage earners on draggers, at 
     <lb/>
     processing plants, at central curing stations and 
     <lb/>
     canneries, but not participating in the ownership 
     <lb/>
     and earnings of those new fish enterprises. The 
     <lb/>
     creation of such a fishing proletariat is something 
     <lb/>
     to guard against at all costs It could lead only to 
     <lb/>
     great dissatisfaction, great unrest, maybe even 
     <lb/>
     strife. I am convinced that it can be avoided only 
     <lb/>
     if some formula be worked out to provide par<lb break="no"/>ticipation for fishermen in the ownership and 
     <lb/>
     earnings of such new fishing structures as may 
     <lb/>
     emerge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not for me here to indicate in what fashion 
     <lb/>
     all that may be brought about. But for the peace 
     <lb/>
     and the happiness of this land, the effort had 
     <lb/>
     better be made to bring it about, and not only in 
     <lb/>
     the fishing industry.... We have to have for the 
     <lb/>
     future a more even distribution of the national 
     <lb/>
     income than we have had in the past. We can 
     <lb/>
     achieve such results if we are willing to make the

     effort, without disorder, without upheaval, 
     <lb/>
     without injury to the essential character of our 
     <lb/>
     national institutions. But if we won't try it, don't 
     <lb/>
     be surprised if some arise in our midst who want 
     <lb/>
     to try it another way. I hope I haven't been 
     <lb/>
     sounding like Jeremiah helping Cassandra with 
     <lb/>
     her homework. It has not been my intention to try 
     <lb/>
     to put the fear of God into somebody by 
     <lb/>
     scaremongering. It's been my intention merely to 
     <lb/>
     indicate a significant phenomenon of our times, 
     <lb/>
     in consequence of which our economy will come 
     <lb/>
     to be changed. In that regard there is this that I 
     <lb/>
     can say in favour of these proposed arrangements 
     <lb/>
     for union. They meet the inevitable half-way. I 
     <lb/>
     hope that the change that must come will be 
     <lb/>
     accomplished without class conflict and social 
     <lb/>
     unrest. It can be, given the will. Economic 
     <lb/>
     security and political liberty are not incom<lb break="no"/>patible. I think that a satisfactory synthesis of the 
     <lb/>
     two can be achieved, to which the Christian con<lb break="no"/>science can subscribe. In our instance, the cause 
     <lb/>
     of peace and happiness, and the dignity of life in 
     <lb/>
     this land, will best be served if we go forward into 
     <lb/>
     the future prepared and ready to put in the way of 
     <lb/>
     the common man a larger slice of the cake that is 
     <lb/>
     ours to share. Indeed, only if the like be done all 
     <lb/>
     over the world, can mankind hope to see restored 
     <lb/>
     and kept inviolate the temple of human freedom 
     <lb/>
     and dignity.

            <p>
     Now, gentlemen of the National Convention, 
     <lb/>
     we go on to the last theme of all, to the recom<lb break="no"/>mendation of forms of government to appear 
     <lb/>
     upon the ballot, and a page of history is waiting 
     <lb/>
     to be written. A page of history is waiting to be 
     <lb/>
     written by the people of Newfoundland too. As 
     <lb/>
     they turn to face the greatest challenge that has 
     <lb/>
     ever been theirs to face, as they come to the 
     <lb/>
     making of the greatest decision that has ever been 
     <lb/>
     theirs to make, I should like to repeat for their 
     <lb/>
     guidance and their consolation the words with 
     <lb/>
     which His Majesty the King concluded his first 
     <lb/>
     wartime Christmas broadcast: "And I said to the 
     <lb/>
     man who stood at the gate of the year, 'Give me 
     <lb/>
     a light, that going forth into the darkness I may 
     <lb/>
     know whither it is I go. And he said to me, 'Go 
     <lb/>
     out into the unknown and put your hand into the 
     <lb/>
     hand of God, and that shall be to you better than 
     <lb/>
     a light, and safer than the known way.'" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have said nothing 
     <lb/>
     so far in this debate because I did not see the need 
     <lb/>
     of saying anything. The piloting of the debate has 
 

            <cb/>
      

     been in good hands, and my feeling has been that 
     <lb/>
     too many cooks might spoil the broth... This 
     <lb/>
     debate is now drawing to a close, and I want to 
     <lb/>
     say a few words just so that my silence might not 
     <lb/>
     be misunderstood. I want to go on record as being 
     <lb/>
     deeply impressed, as one of the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion, by the warm and sincere reception we got in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. From the time we stepped ashore in 
     <lb/>
     North Sydney, all we met was kindness and sin<lb break="no"/>cerity. It was very plain to see that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada was very glad to have us visit 
     <lb/>
     them, as I know they will be glad to have New<lb break="no"/>foundland. It is very plain that they would wel<lb break="no"/>come Newfoundland into their family of 
     <lb/>
     provinces. This feeling was not confined to mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government, all the public men of all 
     <lb/>
     political parties were very glad to see us and to 
     <lb/>
     make us welcome. I'm sure that my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins will remember the delightful evenings 
     <lb/>
     we spent at the home of the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, Mr. Bracken... In every way possible the 
     <lb/>
     people and the Government of Canada made us 
     <lb/>
     welcome. Before we left Ottawa, we had all come 
     <lb/>
     to feel that we were among friends. There was no 
     <lb/>
     gulf between us, except for the Cabot Strait of 
     <lb/>
     course, just friendly and sincere understanding 
     <lb/>
     all the time. Whatever the people may do in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum this spring, the members of the Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa delegation, that clever and austere body of 
     <lb/>
     men, will always remember the kind friendships 
     <lb/>
     that we met in Ottawa. 1 think I can also say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that we were surprised almost every 
     <lb/>
     day by the knowledge that these Canadians 
     <lb/>
     showed of Newfoundland. I can assure you that 
     <lb/>
     we didn't have to go up to Ottawa to tell them 
     <lb/>
     anything about Newfoundland, because they 
     <lb/>
     knew all about it before we went. This book on 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland by Dr. MacKay is a master<lb break="no"/>piece... They had studied our country, our trade 
     <lb/>
     and industries, and they certainly had an excel<lb break="no"/>lent knowledge of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This Ottawa delegation, this famous delega<lb break="no"/>tion that will go down in history, was sent to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa by this Convention for a special purpose. 
     <lb/>
     We knew what we were going for. We were going 
     <lb/>
     there to ascertain what fair and equitable basis 
     <lb/>
     there might be for federal union. That was our job 
     <lb/>
     — what we sometimes call the terms of federal 
     <lb/>
     union or confederation. We never lost sight of 
     <lb/>
     that for one moment. Mr. Higgins might have, but 
     <lb/>
     the rest of us didn't. It is quite true that we did not 


            <pb n="1222"

     bring those terms back with us, but they were sent 
     <lb/>
     down through the Governor. Nobody can deny 
     <lb/>
     that it was our visit to Ottawa and our work in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa that secured these terms. It was not until 
     <lb/>
     they were read out in this chamber that we really 
     <lb/>
     knew for sure just what the terms would be. But 
     <lb/>
     it was impossible for us to be there all that time, 
     <lb/>
     and to be meeting almost every day with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian ministers or officials, without getting a 
     <lb/>
     pretty shrewd idea of what the terms were going 
     <lb/>
     to be like. But we held our peace... We wouldn't 
     <lb/>
     say a word until they came here in writing... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think these terms are pretty fair. We were 
     <lb/>
     told by these gentlemen in Ottawa that no other 
     <lb/>
     body, even an elected government, or the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, could not get better 
     <lb/>
     terms: that these were the best terms available at 
     <lb/>
     this particular time. There's no reason that they 
     <lb/>
     can't be sort of added to at some future time.... If 
     <lb/>
     you look at the thing fairly and squarely, I think 
     <lb/>
     that even the Major ... knows in his heart and soul 
     <lb/>
     that they're very good, and that it would be the 
     <lb/>
     best thing for the people in this country. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that everything would be perfect if we 
     <lb/>
     became a province, it could not be, but there 
     <lb/>
     would be a great many improvements. The bulk 
     <lb/>
     of our people would be better off, and that is the 
     <lb/>
     most important thing. I think most family men 
     <lb/>
     would find it easier to bring up their families, and 
     <lb/>
     our younger generation would have a better 
     <lb/>
     chance in life. I think the working man would 
     <lb/>
     have a better chance, although our working men 
     <lb/>
     are doing very well, I must say.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was not my first visit to Canada, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, but while we were there last summer we 
     <lb/>
     were given every opportunity to see a very large 
     <lb/>
     section of it. We certainly saw enough ... to see 
     <lb/>
     what a great country Canada really is. I'm sure 
     <lb/>
     that there's nobody can deny that Canada is a 
     <lb/>
     really great country... By joining with Canada 
     <lb/>
     we're still going to be Newfoundlanders. You 
     <lb/>
     can't take that out of us. I think we were patriotic, 
     <lb/>
     although we were told that we weren't patriotic, 
     <lb/>
     we were called Judas Iscariot and God knows 
     <lb/>
     else. I and my three brothers served overseas in 
     <lb/>
     the first war and I had two people serving in this 
     <lb/>
     war. That is a patriotism of one form, and there's 
     <lb/>
     another form of patriotism, and that's being truth<lb break="no"/>ful and sincere and honest with your fellow man. 
     <lb/>
     If I really think in my heart, and I do, that con<lb break="no"/>
           
     
            <cb/>
          
     federation is the better thing for most people in 
     <lb/>
     this country, then I think I'm being patriotic, and 
     <lb/>
     I'm being sincere and honest with the people of 
     <lb/>
     the country.... We never went back on our 
     <lb/>
     country, I can guarantee you that.... But at the 
     <lb/>
     same time, we were all very deeply impressed by 
     <lb/>
     Canada's greatness, by her progressive methods, 
     <lb/>
     by her wide-awake system of doing things. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p>There's one thing that strikes my mind very 
     <lb/>much, Mr. Chairman, and that is the fact that if 
     <lb/>we decide to tie on with that great country, things 
     <lb/>will have to fall pretty low indeed for New<lb break="no"/>foundland to go under. If we become a province 
     <lb/>of Canada, all that big country will have to fail 
     <lb/>for us to fail. That's a very important thing, and 
     <lb/>it doesn't seem that Canada is going to fail very 
     <lb/>soon. Although Canada may not always be 
     <lb/>blessed by the wonderful prosperity they have 
     <lb/>right now, I find it impossible to believe that she 
     <lb/>will ever go under. I look to see her go onward 
     <lb/>and upward to ever greater things in the future. I 
     <lb/>regard Canada as one of the coming powers of 
     <lb/>the world, and I honestly believe that if we link 
     <lb/>our fortunes with hers, we'll go up with her. 
     <lb/>There's one thing about Canada more then any<lb break="no"/>thing else that impresses my mind, and that is the 
     <lb/>wonderful way in which she backed the old 
     <lb/>country in this last war, and since the war ended. 
     <lb/>There's no country in the world doing better.... 
     <lb/>There's one thing about confederation that satis<lb break="no"/>fies my mind, and that is the fact that Canada is 
     <lb/>a great British nation — don't forget. It's true that 
     <lb/>there is great friendship between Canada and the 
     <lb/>United States... But Canada is still British and 
     <lb/>proud of it. If we do decide to join up with 
     <lb/>Canada, it's a British nation we'd be joining. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>There are many things about confederation 
     <lb/>that we would be a while getting used to. Canada 
     <lb/>is something like the United States in her form of 
     <lb/>government, she is a federal union. She's really 
     <lb/>nine countries in one, and she'd be ten countries 
     <lb/>in one if we get in, only they don't call themselves 
     <lb/>countries, they call themselves provinces...<ref target="#fn_18">[1]</ref> It is 
     <lb/>very much like the Newfoundland Federation of 
     <lb/>Labour, which is a federation of unions, or a 
     <lb/>federal union in itself. This union runs its own 
     <lb/>show. There are certain matters that are too big 
     <lb/>for an individual union to run, and that's why they 
     <lb/>associate with the federal union. That's how it is 
     <lb/>with the Canadian federal union. Each province

     runs its own show in so many things, and the 
     <lb/>
     federal government runs the rest. I suppose it 
     <lb/>
     would take us all a little while to get used to it, 
     <lb/>
     but I don't doubt that we would get used to it. We 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders are famous for being able to 
     <lb/>
     adapt ourselves pretty quickly. We're a smart 
     <lb/>
     bunch of people. When it was proposed to change 
     <lb/>
     the rule of the road in Newfoundland last year, 
     <lb/>
     and make all the cars and trucks drive to the right, 
     <lb/>
     some people prophesised all kinds of accidents 
     <lb/>
     and deaths. But it turned out all right. And al<lb break="no"/>though we've only been a short year driving to 
     <lb/>
     the right, and we drove to the left for over half a 
     <lb/>
     century, we're so used to it now that we never 
     <lb/>
     even think of it. That's how it would be with 
     <lb/>
     confederation. It looks like a pretty big jump for 
     <lb/>
     us to take right now, but we'd get used to it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The way I look at this confederation idea, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, is simply you have to think of the 
     <lb/>
     majority. It's not what would suit a few but what 
     <lb/>
     would suit the many. I suppose some people 
     <lb/>
     might be hurt a little by confederation — I see my 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. Hickman smiling over there — espe<lb break="no"/>cially at the start. I would not be glad to see 
     <lb/>
     anybody hurt. But what comes first is the welfare 
     <lb/>
     of the many, and perhaps a very few would be 
     <lb/>
     hurt anyway... There's another thing I like about 
     <lb/>
     this confederation idea, and that's the fact that it 
     <lb/>
     will give us political democracy. We mustn't 
     <lb/>
     forget that. It would give us political democracy, 
     <lb/>
     just the same as responsible government would 
     <lb/>
     give it. I can see Major Cashin now up in the 
     <lb/>
     Houses of Parliament up in Ottawa, the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance of that great big Dominion of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     not a little place like this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suppose all of us would be inclined to give 
     <lb/>
     the Commission government system credit where 
     <lb/>
     they deserve it, and they do deserve some credit. 
     <lb/>
     We've said some very hard things here about the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, but we must admit 
     <lb/>
     that they have done some good and they're 
     <lb/>
     deserving of a little credit. I'm not swinging on 
     <lb/>
     the Commission government gate either.... But 
     <lb/>
     I'm ready to give praise where praise is due. But 
     <lb/>
     we've all got to be sensible about these things. In 
     <lb/>
     the spring we'll all be going in to vote for a form 
     <lb/>
     of government we want, for the form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment we want for our country in the future. And 
     <lb/>
     I think most thinking men know very well that we 
     <lb/>
     can't decide that we'll have the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government here forever. It was never meant to 
 

            <cb/>
           

     stay here. Commission government gives us no 
     <lb/>
     voice at all in our public affairs, while confedera<lb break="no"/>tion at least will give us better democratic 
     <lb/>
     government. We'll not only elect our seven mem<lb break="no"/>bers to the House of Commons in Ottawa, but 
     <lb/>
     we'll also elect our own House of Assembly. It is 
     <lb/>
     true that our House of Assembly wouldn't have 
     <lb/>
     the whole show to run, but still it will have plenty 
     <lb/>
     to do. We will be electing our own government 
     <lb/>
     and we'll also be helping to elect a government 
     <lb/>
     for the whole federal union. I won't go any fur<lb break="no"/>ther, Mr. Chairman, with this line of argument, 
     <lb/>
     because you'll probably have to rule me out of 
     <lb/>
     order. Anyway, one of the things I noticed about 
     <lb/>
     this confederation idea is that it will bring back 
     <lb/>
     to us a democratic form of government after a 
     <lb/>
     long and perhaps painful absence. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I have purposely kept away from discussing 
     <lb/>
     details of these confederation terms because they 
     <lb/>
     have been drawn over so often by everybody that 
     <lb/>
     I'm sure they've been worn out. And we don't 
     <lb/>
     want the people in the country to forget about it 
     <lb/>
     just yet. I can assure you that we all appreciate 
     <lb/>
     the fact that they were handled very ably by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood.... So there's nothing further that I 
     <lb/>
     would add just now. For about five weeks we've 
     <lb/>
     been debating these details and I guess the Con<lb break="no"/>vention and the country have a fair idea of them 
     <lb/>
     by this time. I regard the terms as fair and attrac<lb break="no"/>tive. I think that under confederation we would 
     <lb/>
     get a square deal. I think our country would go 
     <lb/>
     ahead. I think our people would be better off and 
     <lb/>
     I think most of our families would live better and 
     <lb/>
     that, like Mr. Keough said, is the most important 
     <lb/>
     thing of all. That is the thing which we're to 
     <lb/>
     decide. I think the people will know how to 
     <lb/>
     decide this fact. One last thing I want to em<lb break="no"/>phasise. We may decide to join up with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     If we do, we would become Canadian citizens, 
     <lb/>
     and Canada would be one great nation stretching 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's right out to Vancouver. We'd 
     <lb/>
     become Canadian citizens, but we'd never cease 
     <lb/>
     to be Newfoundlanders. That would be impos<lb break="no"/>sible. To us Newfoundland will always be home. 
     <lb/>
     To us Newfoundlanders it will always come first. 
     <lb/>
     And if in the referendum I cast my vote for 
     <lb/>
     confederation, it will not be for Canada's sake but 
     <lb/>
     for the sake of the generations yet unborn here in 
     <lb/>
     our own island home.

     their beliefs with varying degrees of ardour and 
     <lb/>
     ability. And with Mr. Hollett's closure motion 
     <lb/>
     hovering over this debate, I assure you that I will 
     <lb/>
     not occupy much of your valuable time. I realise 
     <lb/>
     that there are matters of great importance yet 
     <lb/>
     demanding the consideration of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, at first I had not intended to say 
     <lb/>
     anything in this debate, because I considered too 
     <lb/>
     much had already been said. But as it has been 
     <lb/>
     my custom since this Convention opened to brief<lb break="no"/>ly comment on matters before the Chair and to 
     <lb/>
     make my position clear regarding them, I decided 
     <lb/>
     to make a few general observations on this issue. 
     <lb/>
     They are as follows. First, I contend that the 
     <lb/>
     matter of confederation should never have been 
     <lb/>
     the business of this Convention and that respon<lb break="no"/>sible government should have been restored in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the agreement of 1934. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You can't do anything about 
     <lb/>
     that. You have no jurisdiction over that matter at 
     <lb/>
     all. In the first place if the matter is to be debated 
     <lb/>
     at all it comes within the purview of the different 
     <lb/>
     forms of government, which is not yet before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. You must confine yourself to business 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair, the terms of union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> That's what I'm trying to do — just 
     <lb/>
     following out my arguments, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Higgins, there's no need for 
     <lb/>
     you to prompt the speaker, I've just ruled that this 
     <lb/>
     matter isn't debatable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> If confederation is to be a live issue, 
     <lb/>
     let the people interested form a party, go to the 
     <lb/>
     country, preach their doctrine and if given a 
     <lb/>
     mandate from the people, go as honourable men 
     <lb/>
     and negotiate the terms of union on equal footing 
     <lb/>
     with the Canadian government. Gentlemen, I 
     <lb/>
     contend that in contrast to this, we should look at 
     <lb/>
     what really happened. Mr. Smallwood asked this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to send somebody, anybody to 
     <lb/>
     Canada to discuss terms of union. First we said 
     <lb/>
     no. Then sometime later some of us got soft<lb break="no"/>hearted and by a scant majority agreed to send 
     <lb/>
     seven individuals to Ottawa. No qualifications 
     <lb/>
     were required, and as we all know that delegation 
     <lb/>
     consisted of every type of gentleman with the 
     <lb/>
     notable exception of an expert. And it must be 
     <lb/>
     borne in mind that the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     were not asked if they wanted a delegation to go 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa or not. Much less were they asked to 
     <lb/>
     select the members of this delegation. It is doubt<lb break="no"/>ful if any delegation would have been wined and 
  

            <cb/>
         

     dined in Ottawa for that 100 days had the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland been asked to decide. Second<lb break="no"/>ly, we have these one-sided terms or proposals 
     <lb/>
     here. They are one-sided. That must be evident 
     <lb/>
     to all, because scores of questions of prime im<lb break="no"/>portance to Newfoundland have been asked and 
     <lb/>
     the answers could not be found in these costly 
     <lb/>
     documents we have before us. Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     has attempted to explain them. But with all due 
     <lb/>
     respect to Mr. Smallwood, what right has he to 
     <lb/>
     speak for the Canadian government? What 
     <lb/>
     authority has he? How does he know what any 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada may or may not do in the 
     <lb/>
     future? Mr. Chairman, we know only what is 
     <lb/>
     contained in the Grey Book. And that document, 
     <lb/>
     sir, will be longer remembered for what it does 
     <lb/>
     not contain than it will for what it does contain. 
     <lb/>
   </p>

            <p>Gentlemen, one of the things our people want 
     <lb/>to learn is the truth about this burning question of 
     <lb/>taxation. All I can say is that it is like the truth 
     <lb/>about the next world: we hear a lot about it, but 
     <lb/>we will never know the real truth until we go 
     <lb/>there. We will never know the real truth about 
     <lb/>taxes under confederation until we become the 
     <lb/>tenth province of Canada. But always remember, 
     <lb/>that if things do not turn out as you expected, you 
     <lb/>will never be able to do anything about it. Third<lb break="no"/>ly, people should disabuse their minds of the idea 
     <lb/>of getting something for nothing, and realise that 
     <lb/>whatever form of government you have, you pay 
     <lb/>for what you get in one way or another. If you 
     <lb/>don't pay indirect taxes, you will pay direct taxes. 
     <lb/>If the federal government does not collect them, 
     <lb/>the provincial government will. If the provincial 
     <lb/>government does not collect them then the 
     <lb/>municipal government will. And remember, that 
     <lb/>under confederation we will be subject to all three 
     <lb/>forms of taxation — federal, provincial and 
     <lb/>municipal. The other nine provinces have them, 
     <lb/>how can we expect to escape them? Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood labours the point that we will not be 
     <lb/>compelled to have land taxes, property taxes and 
     <lb/>the like. He tells us that it will be entirely up to 
     <lb/>the province. But that is the point. Nobody com<lb break="no"/>pels me to eat, but I must eat in order to exist. And 
     <lb/>in order for Newfoundland to exist at all as the 
     <lb/>tenth province of Canada, it will be necessary for 
     <lb/>her to avail of every known means of taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot see why we should 
     <lb/>join Canada or any other country at this time. It 
     <lb/>is common knowledge that the eyes of the North

     of our strategic importance and because of the

            <p>With reference to your letter of 9th

     <lb/>that in a letter to the Department of Natural

            <p>
     The answer is, my interpretation of that letter 
     <lb/>
     is it was not an offer. You can't do business with 
     <lb/>
     a man who doesn't disclose himself. The letter is 
     <lb/>
     plain and clear... The suggestion was made that 
     <lb/>
     Labrador should be sold for $150 million. The 
     <lb/>
     letter did not indicate who was the prospective 
     <lb/>
     purchaser. And there were no further develop<lb break="no"/>ments.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> So there was no offer? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Not at all. It's incapable of that 
     <lb/>
     interpretation... Go ahead, Mr. Fowler, please. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I really brought it up because I knew 
     <lb/>there were some doubts about it, and I think it's 
     <lb/>very good to have it cleared up. Gentlemen, even 
     <lb/>though we have been dead politically for the past 
     <lb/>14 years, let us bestir ourselves, awake to the 
     <lb/>importance of our inheritance, and if any ad<lb break="no"/>vantages are to be had, let us as Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>reap the benefits, and if Canada or the United 
     <lb/>States are interested, we will be in a position to 
     <lb/>do business with them as friendly neighbours. For 
     <lb/>these reasons then, it is my opinion that respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, the goal of all civilised people, 
     <lb/>should be restored to Newfoundland so that the 
     <lb/>people should be free to do business with the 
     <lb/>United States as well as Canada, if they so desire. 
     <lb/>And in any event, they would be free to act 
     <lb/>according to the dictates of the country. Thank 
     <lb/>you.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> Mr. Chairman, it's a pity almost 
     <lb/>
     to spoil that happy relationship we had in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     so ably demonstrated by our friend Senator 
     <lb/>
     Prospective. I did not intend at this juncture to 
     <lb/>
     take any part, but seeing I'm the lone bird of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation, I thought that possibly it 
     <lb/>
     might be thought that I was in accord with the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the delegation that returned from 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. I want to say without any shadow of a 
     <lb/>
     doubt that I am anticonfederate on the terms that 
     <lb/>
     have been brought down here. Mr. Burry, I think, 
     <lb/>
     hinted yesterday that if we had had some New<lb break="no"/>foundland experts up there we would have been 
     <lb/>
     back in possibly three weeks. I'm half inclined to 
     <lb/>
     disagree with him on the grounds that if we had 
     <lb/>
     had all the experts in Newfoundland and else<lb break="no"/>where, it was not possible to get back before we 
     <lb/>
     did. I doubt very much, Major, that we would 
     <lb/>
     have been back by the time we did arrive, had not 
     <lb/>
     that famous message been sent up and a copy sent 
     <lb/>
     to the Prime Minister of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We went there and we discovered...that we 
     <lb/>
     came a little ahead of the time that they would 
     <lb/>
     have liked for us to come. True, they said come 
     <lb/>
     around June or the lst of July. But they dis<lb break="no"/>covered politically that we arrived a little too 
     <lb/>
     early. The suggestion was made that we go home 
     <lb/>
     and come back again in September. But 
     <lb/>
     we...thought that if we came back the possibilities 
     <lb/>
     were that we wouldn't get back again in Septem<lb break="no"/>

     ber. Now what delayed us? ....There's an election 
     <lb/>
     on in Halifax. The government had a seat there 
     <lb/>
     that they had to win. We couldn't make very 
     <lb/>
     much progress until that election was decided. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, what I'm doing now is trying to 
     <lb/>
     show you why I'm anticonfederate. Then the next 
     <lb/>
     thing turns up is the Dominion-provincial tax 
     <lb/>
     agreement down in Nova Scotia that has to be 
     <lb/>
     signed That comes up the 20th of August, I 
     <lb/>
     believe — couldn't release any terms up to that 
     <lb/>
     time. Nova Scotia had to sign those tax agree<lb break="no"/>ments. And then we were making progress, but 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately the Minister of Fisheries, the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bridges died. That created a by-election 
     <lb/>
     down in New Brunswick. We couldn't come 
     <lb/>
     home then, because if they'd released those 
     <lb/>
     generous terms, the opposition in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick would play on them. Finally, up 
     <lb/>
     comes this message. It came before the plenary 
     <lb/>
     session, and I'd say they were a little bit tor<lb break="no"/>mented. They thought the best thing they could 
     <lb/>
     do was get the Black Books ready — give us the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books, and after the election in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick they'd send us down what now has 
     <lb/>
     been termed the Grey Book. Now as a member 
     <lb/>
     of that delegation, I thought that there was too 
     <lb/>
     much politics in the whole game. I went there 
     <lb/>
     with an open mind. I went there to get hard facts, 
     <lb/>
     and I am of that nature that I've got to be con<lb break="no"/>vinced before I really agree. And I've been 
     <lb/>
     charged with being cantankerous. You can call it 
     <lb/>
     that if you will. But there's the position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now then, I notice in that Grey Book that there 
     <lb/>
     is no mention whatever of the matter of divorce. 
     <lb/>
     Why? Take up your Black Book and it says that 
     <lb/>
     the whole matter is a matter for the province. 
     <lb/>
     How many provinces in Canada have no divorce 
     <lb/>
     laws? ....In Quebec there are no divorce laws — 
     <lb/>
     look what happened. Parties have to go before the 
     <lb/>
     Senate. They have to have all the evidence 
     <lb/>
     without belabouring the question. The position 
     <lb/>
     now is there's a movement afoot that it will not 
     <lb/>
     be necessary to go to Ottawa, that the evidence 
     <lb/>
     will be taken in the courts of Quebec. If you have 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces except Quebec with divorce 
     <lb/>
     laws, if you go in as a tenth province, what chance 
     <lb/>
     have you got in Newfoundland for being driven 
     <lb/>
     into divorce? Look at it in the common sense 
     <lb/>
     way. I would like to say that overtures were made 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa so that it would be possible to have 
     <lb/>
     some clause in that Grey Book regarding divorce. 
 

            <cb/>
 

     I'm inclined to think too that there were some 
     <lb/>
     overtures made here in Newfoundland since we 
     <lb/>
     came back along the same lines, but nothing 
     <lb/>
     became of it and you have no reference whatever. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p>Same thing applies to education. Mr. Small- 
     <lb break="yes"/>wood said last night that I was an ex-school- 
     <lb break="yes"/>teacher. In the old days, when I was a 
     <lb/>schoolteacher, in the early days of high school 
     <lb/>teaching, I was public school minded. I've had 
     <lb/>some experience in Canada and in the United 
     <lb/>States regarding education. I followed the whole 
     <lb/>situation and I completely changed my mind, and 
     <lb/>decided that the best form of education for New<lb break="no"/>foundland, as the settlements are divided, is the 
     <lb/>system that you have. Again, they tell you in the 
     <lb/>Black Book that education is a matter for the 
     <lb/>provinces. How many provinces in Canada have 
     <lb/>denominational schools? Can't you see that if 
     <lb/>you go into confederation, there is always a pos<lb break="no"/>sibility that your educational system will be 
     <lb/>upset? It's one of the reasons why I'm not 
     <lb/>prepared to take the chance. I don't know, sir, 
     <lb/>whether the time limit is up or not....

            <p><persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> Mr. Crosbie mentioned it this 
     <lb/>afternoon, he talked about the Fishery Board in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. I know of a certainty that the 
     <lb/>Fishery Board under confederation has got to go 
     <lb/>out of existence, irrespective of the opinion of 
     <lb/>any other of the members of the delegation. They 
     <lb/>searched around everywhere in the statutes, laws 
     <lb/>of Canada and they couldn't find any place where 
     <lb/>they could allow Newfoundland to keep that 
     <lb/>Board in existence. You can look in the Black 
     <lb/>Book and you'll find very nice phraseology 
     <lb/>covering up the situation. The next one and I'll 
     <lb/>soon be finished. That is the deficit that's going 
     <lb/>to be created by going into confederation. 
     <lb/>There's definitely going to be a deficit on the 
     <lb/>terms in that Grey Book. It was pointed out to the 
     <lb/>Canadians and asked how we were going to get 
     <lb/>around that situation. Put on more taxation or 
     <lb/>take your surplus, and in the Grey Book they've 
     <lb/>made provision by taking one third of your 
     <lb/>surplus to cover up any deficits that you'll incur. 
     <lb/>I could go on a bit longer, but I don't feel like 
     <lb/>keeping people here any longer. What I'm trying 
     <lb/>to say is that I am opposed to confederation on 
     <lb/>the terms presented in that Grey Book. I am not 
     <lb/>against going into confederation if the terms suit 
     <lb/>me, being a Newfoundlander first.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And that is one point referred

     to by Mr. Crummey. I'm sorry he referred to it. 
     <lb/>
     When he says that overtures were made in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     and in St. John's on the question of divorce, I'm 
     <lb/>
     sorry he said it. That is true, overtures have been

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, a very serious statement

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The statement was made by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Crummey that overtures were made in Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa and in St. John's with regard to the question

     of divorce. I say that that is true. And I say this, 
     <lb/>
     that whatever Newfoundland wants, whatever it 
     <lb/>
     be, the proper authorities, whatever they want in 
     <lb/>
     a matter of divorce, they can have. I say so, and 
     <lb/>
     I know what I'm talking about. Whatever the 
     <lb/>
     proper authorities of Newfoundland want in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of divorce, they've only got to ask. I say 
     <lb/>
     that, and I'm sorry the matter has been mentioned

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now just a moment, Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins, before Iput your motion. Is there at this time 
     <lb/>
     any member who hasn't spoken on this question, 
     <lb/>
     and who feels that he would like to address him<lb break="no"/>self on the question, because I'm going to put the 
     <lb/>
     closure motion to the House tomorrow afternoon. 
     <lb/>
     I don't want it to be said that there was anything 
     <lb/>
     improper I did, that certain members were al<lb break="no"/>lowed to speak to their heart's content and other 
     <lb/>
     people weren't allowed to speak at all. I don't 
     <lb/>
     want that situation to arise. If there's any member 
     <lb/>

     take the right of Mr. MacDonald to speak when 
     <lb/>
     he hasn't had the opportunity to address himself 
     <lb/>
     on this question at all, and other people have been 
     <lb/>
     able to address themselves tonight. There's a case

     of discrimination that I could be probably 
     <lb/>
     charged with that I'm not going to be charged

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> I wouldn't have asked, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, only the invitation was put to any 
     <lb/>
     person who wished to rise. I could have very well 
     <lb/>
     left it alone for that matter. But it's not my 
     <lb/>
     intention to address the Convention at any length 
     <lb/>
     on the subject matter now before the Chair, as it 
     <lb/>
     is more than probable that most of it will be 
     <lb/>
     repeated again when the question of recommen<lb break="no"/>dations arises. We have heard various opinions 
     <lb/>
     and many contradictions on the subject of the 
     <lb/>
     proposals for union with Canada. What results as 
     <lb/>
     far as the members of this Convention and the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country are concerned is a matter 
     <lb/>
     of opinion. I take it, Mr. Chairman, that the idea 
     <lb/>
     of holding our sessions in public, and that of 
     <lb/>
     installing the microphones in this chamber, was 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of acquainting our people as to 
     <lb/>
     what was going on and informing them as to the 
     <lb/>
     economic and financial position of this country 
     <lb/>
     of ours and giving them the facts. I repeat, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, the facts... I submit that a good many 
     <lb/>
     of our thinking people are more bewildered than 
     <lb/>
     they were when we started 16 months ago. We 
     <lb/>
     have disagreed and wrangled about every point 
     <lb/>
     that has been brought forward in our various 
     <lb/>
     debates, often descending to tactics more worthy 
     <lb/>
     of a gathering in a pub or the oft-quoted beer 
     <lb/>
     parties than that of a body of men gathered 
     <lb/>
     together to consider the future of our country. We 
     <lb/>
     have individually criticised and abused almost 
     <lb/>
     everything from the British Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     down to the Commission of Government to the 
     <lb/>
     Convention itself and the members thereof, I 
     <lb/>
     might add. Now do not let us forget this part. That 
     <lb/>
     whatever our individual opinions may be of the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of this Convention, we must realise that 
     <lb/>
     the people who voted in the election of 1946 did 
     <lb/>
     so in all good faith, and sent their respective 
     <lb/>
     delegates to this Convention not only to make 
     <lb/>
     recommendations as to possible forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but also to get information for them so that 
     <lb/>
     when the time came for the referendum they 
     <lb/>
     would be a position to decide intelligently as to 
     <lb/>
     the type of government which in their opinion 
     <lb/>
     would be the best in the interests of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Have we succeeded in this? Or has 
     <lb/>
     our time been more occupied in using this Con<lb break="no"/>vention as a forum from which to preach our own 
     <lb/>
     particular form of political ideology? In this very 
     <lb/>
     important matter of the Ottawa proposals for 
     <lb/>
     confederation ... we are faced with something 
    

            <cb/>
          

     that may well mean the future welfare or other<lb break="no"/>wise of Newfoundland to generations yet unborn. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard these proposals very ably, if 
     <lb/>
     somewhat heatedly at various times, supported 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Smallwood. We have heard them also 
     <lb/>
     very ably and sometimes heatedly criticised by 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin and other speakers. We have heard 
     <lb/>
     a lot about sales taxes, excise taxes, etc., even 
     <lb/>
     hidden taxes such as shoe taxes and gasoline 
     <lb/>
     taxes and so on. But we have not stopped to 
     <lb/>
     explain that outside of local sales tax, we are 
     <lb/>
     possibly paying all these taxes every time we buy 
     <lb/>
     these goods from Canada at the present time... 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p>Mr. Chairman, we are nearing the end of our 
     <lb/>deliberations as a National Convention. In the 
     <lb/>course of our work we have accumulated a great 
     <lb/>quantity of information, both essential and non<lb break="no"/>essential, and in what way are we to present all 
     <lb/>the facts to the people is the question which 
     <lb/>concerns me considerably. I doubt that the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this Convention can even agree on facts. 
     <lb/>I do not know yet what choices of government 
     <lb/>will be placed on the ballot papers. But whatever 
     <lb/>they may be, the people are entitled to know the 
     <lb/>pros and cons of each form of government placed 
     <lb/>before them. If this is not done, then we have 
     <lb/>failed miserably in our efforts of the past 16 
     <lb/>months. The people want to know whether con<lb break="no"/>federation will lower their cost of living and thus 
     <lb/>raise their standard of living. And I don't think it 
     <lb/>can be contradicted, and I state this on very good 
     <lb/>authority, Mr. Chairman, that the cost of a 
     <lb/>month's groceries in New Brunswick is consid<lb break="no"/>erably less then one half of that in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>at the present time in spite of the austerity 
     <lb/>programme. And I state that on good authority. 
     <lb/>They will also want to know as to whether it is to 
     <lb/>their advantage to have the whole Dominion of 
     <lb/>Canada open to their sons and daughters when 
     <lb/>they are unable to get renumerative positions at 
     <lb/>home. That's another matter that's never been 
     <lb/>brought up. Of if they wish to advance themsel<lb break="no"/>ves more quickly in their chosen trades or profes<lb break="no"/>sions and not as at the present time be treated as 
     <lb/>foreigners and be admitted on a quota. These 
     <lb/>things and scores of others they will want to 
     <lb/>know. I agree with Mr. Higgins that the proposals 
     <lb/>are good as a fair and equitable basis on which to 
     <lb/>work, and undoubtedly the proper authorities 
     <lb/>who would finalise the deal, if the people so wish, 
     <lb/>would recognise this and possibly get further 
 

            <pb n="1229"

     concessions if that is possible. In conclusion, I 
     <lb/>
     think our delegation to Ottawa did a fairly good 
     <lb/>
     job under the circumstances, and that their report 
     <lb/>
     as contained in the Black Books shows they did 
     <lb/>
     the best they could and most decidedly as good 
     <lb/>
     as any delegation we might have sent. I thank 
     <lb/>
     you, Mr. Chairman, for your forbearance and 
     <lb/>
     wish to say that any further remarks I may make 
     <lb/>
     on this matter now before the Chair may be left 
     <lb/>
     until the question of recommendations comes up. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> May I ask you, if in case the motion 
     <lb/>is adopted, will the delegates be allowed to com<lb break="no"/>ment on confederation under the heading of 
     <lb/>forms of government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, Mr. Penney, I've given 
     <lb/>
     considerable thought to the question. Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     has a motion on the order paper, covering respon<lb break="no"/>sible government or Commission government. 
     <lb/>
     As far as Mr. Higgins' motion is concerned, it 
     <lb/>
     follows that discussion will have to be confined 
     <lb/>
     to the two forms of government. In addition to 
     <lb/>
     this, Mr. Smallwood has given notice of motion 
     <lb/>
     covering three forms of government including 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada... In other words, the 
     <lb/>
     position is that under Mr. Higgins' motion, re<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
         
sponsible government and Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government would be disposed off. Once Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins' motion is disposed off by the House, 
     <lb/>
     you will not be able to re-introduce discussion on 
     <lb/>
     either of the two forms of government covered by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins' motion because it's <hi rendition="simple:italic">res judicata</hi>. 
     <lb/>
     It's been disposed of by the House and that's the 
     <lb/>
     end of it. It will therefore mean that the con<lb break="no"/>federation matter will have to be dealt with by the 
     <lb/>
     Convention on Mr. Smallwood's motion. There<lb break="no"/>fore to answer your question in a roundabout 
     <lb/>
     way, yes, you will have an opportunity of ex<lb break="no"/>pressing your opinion on the confederation ques<lb break="no"/>tion after and when Mr. Higgins' motion has been 
     <lb/>
     disposed of by the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I in<lb break="no"/>tended to say something on about confederation 
     <lb/>
     and forms of government, and I wouldn't like to 
     <lb/>
     be deprived of that privilege... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would like to say that it is rather 
     <lb/>out of order. It is an amendment to a motion I have 
     <lb/>not made or might not even make. The proper 
     <lb/>time to move the amendment is when the motion 
     <lb/>is made. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think it is perfectly well prece- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>dented in parliamentary practice when motions 
     <lb/>appear on the order paper, for other members to 
     <lb/>give notice of amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would not accept an amend<lb break="no"/>ment without notice.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Should it not be after the motion is 
     <lb/>made? The motion may be withdrawn.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the motion is withdrawn, ob<lb break="no"/>viously there will not be an amendment to a 
     <lb/>motion not made.
