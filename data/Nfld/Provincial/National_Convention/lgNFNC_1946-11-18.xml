     Mr. Ballam Does that mean that we will go over 
     <lb/>
     the summary when we come back? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman If there is no dissenting voice 
     <lb/>
     against the withdrawing of Mr. Watton's motion. 
     <lb/>

            <p>Mr. Bailey There seems to be a bit of dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction with the matter before the Chair, and I 
     <lb/>think I voice the sentiments of my colleagues on 
     <lb/>the Committee, that if anything is not clear, we 
     <lb/>will do our best to get information. I honestly 
     <lb/>believe that we have tried to get the information, 
     <lb/>and there is a lot of credit due to Major Cashin in 
     <lb/>that he has tried, but he seems to get up against a 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     blank wall. It seems right from the very first, and 
     <lb/>
     I think we are going to find it right straight 
     <lb/>
     through, that the government of this country has 
     <lb/>
     no bookkeeping at all, and sometime of course 
     <lb/>
     you have to start bookkeeping, and until that day 
     <lb/>
     we have to do the best we can. I think it is a pity 
     <lb/>
     that we did not have a National Convention years 
     <lb/>
     ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The motion is that the committee 
     <lb/>
     rise and that I return to the Chair.

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Bradley Mr. Chairman, I move the follow<lb break="no"/>ing resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas Almighty God has removed 
     <lb/>
     from our midst the Honourable Mr. Justice 
     <lb/>
     Fox, K.C., our Chairman; and 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas in his passing Newfoundland has 
     <lb/>
     lost one of her great sons and this National 
     <lb/>
     Convention one who graced it, and by his 
     <lb/>
     unfailing devotion to its best interests raised 
     <lb/>
     it high in the esteem of the country: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And Whereas the members of the Nation- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     a1 Convention are deeply conscious of the 
     <lb/>
     light that has passed from them; therefore be 
     <lb/>
     it 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolved that the members of the Nation<lb break="no"/>al Convention desire to record their profound 
     <lb/>
     sorrow over the passing of their Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     and to convey to his family their hope that the 
     <lb/>
     Almighty Father will be present with them in 
     <lb/>
     their bereavement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, how true is it that "in the midst of life, we 
     <lb/>
     are in death." Not many days ago, Mr. Justice 
     <lb/>
     Fox, our Chairman, was amongst us; today, his 
     <lb/>
     Chair is vacant; his soul has winged its way to the 
     <lb/>
     God who gave it and we have laid his earthly 
     <lb/>
     tabernacle beneath the mouldering dust of earth. 
     <lb/>
     Some knew him but a few weeks, since the open<lb break="no"/>ing of this Convention, and yet knew him for his 
     <lb/>
     unfailing courtesy and kindliness, for his 
     <lb/>
     scrupulous fairness, his deep and abiding love for 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the land of his birth, and his loyalty to this cham<lb break="no"/>ber wherein days gone by he presided as Speaker 
     <lb/>
     with such dignity and ability. Others of us knew 
     <lb/>
     him many years. My own acquaintance with him 
     <lb/>
     dates back to the early days of the present cen<lb break="no"/>tury, when we were youths together in the study 
     <lb/>
     of the law. Even then he impressed me with his 
     <lb/>
     kindliness and consideration for others, with his 
     <lb/>
     broad charity and his aversion to speaking ill of 
     <lb/>
     anyone, with his earnest conception of the 
     <lb/>
     seriousness of life and with his complete freedom 
     <lb/>
     from all unworthy motives. That impression, sir, 
     <lb/>
     has outlived the years and it abides with me still. 
     <lb/>
     I need not here enlarge upon his career: that is a 
     <lb/>
     public document which all may read and one of 
     <lb/>
     which those who loved him best may justly be 
     <lb/>
     proud. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the practice of his profession, he was deeply 
     <lb/>
     sensible of his duty to those whose interests were 
     <lb/>
     entrusted to his care. He was profoundly con<lb break="no"/>cerned about our system of laws, which he 
     <lb/>
     regarded as the greatest bulwark of human 
     <lb/>
     freedom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Three times was he called to the counsels of 
     <lb/>
     his country, and in his native district never did he 
     <lb/>
     suffer a defeat at the hands of the electorate <lb break="no"/>eloquent testimony, indeed, of the place that he 
     <lb/>
     filled in the hearts of his countrymen. Later he 
     <lb/>
     was elevated to be one of His Majesty's judges 
     <lb/>
     of our Supreme Court, where he had scarcely 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     ¹The Secretary, Captain Warren, acted as Chairman. 
     <lb/>
