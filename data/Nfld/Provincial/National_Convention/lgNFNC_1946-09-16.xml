     Mr. Chairman There is one difficulty that ap<lb break="no"/>pears to me â€” difficulty of getting in touch with 
     <lb/>
     the members and it would be better to know now 
     <lb/>
     the date, then we would know exactly when we 
     <lb/>
     were to re-assemble. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. HollettI fail to see how it can adjourn in<lb break="no"/>definitely. It may take some time for the commit<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>tee to draft the rules but we should meet every<lb/>day; we were not sent here for indefinite adjourn<lb break="no"/>ments. Another thing, I do not think the public<lb/>should be admitted where rules and regulations<lb/>are being made relative to the business. I do agree<lb/>that the committee should be allowed time.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>[The Convention adjourned until September 16]<lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am instructed to inform you <lb/> that in so
                  far as the Commission of Government <lb/> is concerned, the members of the
                  Commission <lb/> and high officials, that they are most willing that <lb/> the
                  Convention should have all possible informa<lb break="no"/>tion that we should
                  require, and that they are most <lb/> willing that that information should be
                  placed <lb/> before the Convention. They are not willing to <lb/> come before the
                  Convention in public, but they <lb/> offer to come before you at any of the
                  committee <lb/> meetings in private. However, there may be oc<lb break="no"
                  />casions when it may be more practical, because <lb/> of the readiness with which
                  they can get informa<lb break="no"/>tion from their departments, to call upon
                  them. <lb/> But in all other respects they will be happy and <lb/>
                  <cb/> willing to give all possible information. It was <lb/> never intended by the
                  government here, or by the <lb/> Dominions Office or the Secretary of State that
                  <lb/> this Convention should have power to subpoena <lb/> the members of the
                  Commission of Government <lb/> or high officials. That I am also instructed to
                  <lb/> convey to you. You will understand that the <lb/> absence of any rule or
                  authority to subpoena <lb/>witnesses does not apply merely to the officials
                  <lb/>of the government, but to anybody. We have no <lb/>right at all, gentlemen,
                  to compel any person to <lb/>come forward. That was the right which the old
                  <lb/>House of Assembly had by statute in the statutory <lb/>rules, but it is a
                  right which we have not got. <lb/>

                  might be a <lb/>committee of the whole, so that instead of a <lb/>commissioner, or
                  anyone else who had been in<lb break="no"/>vited to come to be interrogated,
                  attending only <lb/>a small committee and at that committee giving <lb/>certain
                  information which would then sub<lb break="no"/>sequently be passed on to the

<!-- GL, 2017-02-09, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

            <!--<p>
     September 17, 1946 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The questions tabled at the last 
     <lb/>
     sitting were sent immediately to the various 
     <lb/>
     departments and answers have not yet been 
     <lb/>
     received. In connection with questions, it is 
     <lb/>
     natural to suppose that at the commencement of 
     <lb/>
     proceedings, all members may not be conversant 
     <lb/>
     with the rules of procedure as to the form and 
     <lb/>
     relevancy of the question Some of these ques<lb break="no"/>tions will have to be re~worded; and I feel I should 
     <lb/>
     advise with the members privately, rather than in 
     <lb/>
     public, because I feel sure that if a member wants 
     <lb/>
     to ask questions in the required scope, attention 
     <lb/>
     being paid to the rules, he will want to confine 
     <lb/>
     himself strictly to relevancy. Therefore, with 
     <lb/>
     your permission, we might have a private word 
     <lb/>
     at an appropriate occasion when I can outline the 
     <lb/>
     rules in regard to questions. Whatever informa<lb break="no"/>tion is required by the Convention will not alone 
     <lb/>
     be obtained, but questions in respect thereof will 
     <lb/>
     be in the prescribed form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [Requests for information on a variety of topics 
     <lb/>
     were tabled by Mr. Smallwood, Mr. Hollett, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman, Mr. Vincent and Mr. Newell] 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood lf I might be permitted, under 
     <lb/>
     the heading of "Questions", some newspapermen 
     <lb/>
     and radiomen asked me to make the point that in 
     <lb/>
     addition to the three copies of questions and 
     <lb/>
     motions tabled, it would be convenient if addi<lb break="no"/>tional copies were made available to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Perhaps it might be better to 
     <lb/>
     have these questions available to the press on the 
     <lb/>
     day when they are asked in the House. The pro<lb break="no"/>cedure requires that the member give notice of 
     <lb/>
     the question and on the following day asks it 
     <lb/>
     formally. One of the reasons for the 24-hour 
     <lb/>
     interval between notice and asking of questions 
     <lb/>
     is that in certain cases the question has to be 
     <lb/>
     reviewed by the Chairman, to take care that the 
     <lb/>
     question is in the correct form and is relevant. The 
     <lb/>
     day following, the chamber hears the question 
     <lb/>
     formally, that is, brought forward on the order 
     <lb/>
     paper. If copies were then available, as they ap<lb break="no"/>pear on the order paper, it might be the ap<lb break="no"/>propriate occasion, as being the subject of 
     <lb/>
     interrogation on the following day.
