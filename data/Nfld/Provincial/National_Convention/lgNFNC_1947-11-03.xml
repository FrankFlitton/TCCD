     Committee of the Whole

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman ....The Economic Report repre<lb break="no"/>sents the accumulated effect of your efforts since 
     <lb/>
     you have been constituted as a National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. It is designed to co-ordinate or correlate all 
     <lb/>
     the reports heretofore tabled respecting the 
     <lb/>
     economic potentialities of the several industries 
     <lb/>
     which the reports are designed to relate. In conse<lb break="no"/>quence, I feel duty bound at this stage to inform 
     <lb/>
     you that, with one exception, forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, any member talking on any point arising 
     <lb/>
     out of any report heretofore tabled, shall be ruled 
     <lb/>
     by me to be in order.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett When you say "any matter", do I 
     <lb/>
     take it to mean that you refer to any matter 
     <lb/>
     embodied in the reports already tabled? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Or any matter arising out of 
     <lb/>
     these reports.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I want to say at 
     <lb/>
     the outset everything that I can say complimen<lb break="no"/>tary about this report. I happen to be one who has 
     <lb/>
     a great respect for hard work. Major Cashin, who 
     <lb/>
     wrote this report, is a hard worker, and I take my 
     <lb/>
     hat off to a hard worker any time. Secondly the 
     <lb/>
     report shows this, if nothing else did, that he is a 
     <lb/>
     man of great optimism, and I take my hat off to 
     <lb/>
     him for his great optimism also.... I am afraid that 
     <lb/>
     what I have got to say from this point on is not 
     <lb/>
     very complimentary. But Major Cashin has been 
     <lb/>
     a Minister of Finance. He has introduced three 
     <lb/>
     budgets before, and it won't be a new experience 
     <lb/>
