     and got this information have got the right to keep 
     <lb/>
     it from the 44 of us. We're getting the same pay. 
     <lb/>
     We represent the same people. I believe firmly 
     <lb/>
     that we as a body of men should receive it in 
     <lb/>
     secret and put out what we believe the people 
     <lb/>
     should know as near as we can, on account of it 
     <lb/>
     was to be kept in. I know there are things as you 
     <lb/>
     said when your hair is let down, but I firmly 
     <lb/>
     believe that whatever's been said should be let 
     <lb/>
     known to the representatives of the people. Can't 
     <lb/>
     the 44 of us keep it as quiet as six of us? I, as a 
     <lb/>
     member of this Convention, demand that we now 
     <lb/>
     have the report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I happened to be a 
     <lb/>
     member of that delegation. I have a clear 
     <lb/>
     memory.... I attended the first meeting of that 
     <lb/>
     conference over there, and to my recollection I 
     <lb/>
     don't remember Lord Addison saying that we 
     <lb/>
     were to keep these things confidential. That is my 
     <lb/>
     recollection. I do remember him saying, the last 
     <lb/>
     day we were there, five or six minutes before we 
     <lb/>
     disbanded, that we've had very fine talks be<lb break="no"/>tween ourselves, and these are confidential talks. 
     <lb/>
     These were his exact words. That was five 
     <lb/>
     minutes before we disbanded. That is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion. There were matters in connection with 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     American bases and so forth which wouldn't 
     <lb/>
     probably be made public. But as far as before we 
     <lb/>
     started saying, "Well now gentlemen, all our 
     <lb/>
     talks here have got to be confidential", there was 
     <lb/>
     no such statement made. That's all there is to it. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a moment please, just a 
     <lb/>moment. I have made a statement here which I 
     <lb/>stand by. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> So have I. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That Lord Addison did definite<lb break="no"/>ly indicate to us that we had these two alternatives 
     <lb/>
     and he assumed that if we were to talk freely, then 
     <lb/>
     all these talks would be confidential He definite<lb break="no"/>ly made that statement in the House of Lords at 
     <lb/>
     our first meeting, and I assented. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is right, what you say. I 
     <lb/>
     remember Lord Addison making the statement. 
     <lb/>
     He said words to the effect, if I remember, that 
     <lb/>
     things would be said off the record that would not 
     <lb/>
     be said if he knew the record was going to be for 
     <lb/>
     publication. As it is three minutes to six, I propose 
     <lb/>
     the committee rise and beg leave to report 
     <lb/>
     progress and sit again tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>[The committee rose and reported progress, and<lb/>the Convention adjourned]<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Late in yesterday's session I asked 
     <lb/>
     whether or not any discussion took place in Lon<lb break="no"/>don as to possible future relations between the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America and Newfoundland. I 
     <lb/>
     did not receive a satisfactory answer; in fact, I 
     <lb/>
     received no answer. So now I ask again: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Was the matter discussed? 2. If so, why 
     <lb/>
     was it not included in the report of the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation? 3. Is the delegation, having not 
     <lb/>
     reported on the matter, at liberty to answer from 
     <lb/>
     this floor? 4. If there is a "hush-hush" policy on 
     <lb/>
     this question, who, in the opinion of the delega<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
          

     tion, are the parties behind it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have one further remark to make, I think it 
     <lb/>
     very unfair for Lord Addison to pledge our 
     <lb/>
     delegation to secrecy on matters that concern us. 
     <lb/>
     I think that British diplomacy was gone pretty 
     <lb/>
     low when that happened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As chairman of the delegation I 
     <lb/>
     have to say, as far as my recollection goes, there 
     <lb/>
     was no discussion as to possible future relations 
     <lb/>
     between United States and Newfoundland. It did 
     <lb/>
     come up in connection with the bases; beyond 
     <lb/>
     that I have no recollection as to discussions of

     trade, except as to the possibility of securing 
     <lb/>
     concessions in consideration of these bases. The 
     <lb/>
     matter was not discussed. That being so, there is 
     <lb/>
     no answer to your second question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What was the first question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Was the matter discussed? It 
     <lb/>
     was not included in the report, first, because it 
     <lb/>
     was not discussed, and secondly the report of the 
     <lb/>
     London delegation consists of the memorandum 
     <lb/>
     of the British government and of the delegation. 
     <lb/>
     I am unable to tell you why it was not included. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I think it follows that the answer to 
     <lb/>
     the first question answers the others. The matter 
     <lb/>
     was not discussed in London by the delegation. 
     <lb/>
     What I mean by future relations of United States 
     <lb/>
     of America with Newfoundland is political and 
     <lb/>
     fiscal and other relations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There was no discussion except 
     <lb/>
     on the question of the bases. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I do not think that is quite correct. 
     <lb/>
     I think in connection with the base deals Lord 
     <lb/>
     Addison said there was a conference going on at 
     <lb/>
     Geneva, and that the question of trade could be 
     <lb/>
     discussed. I understood we had representatives 
     <lb/>
     there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We have representatives to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss general world trade relations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I think he said it was a question for 
     <lb/>
     us to decide. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In connection with that matter, you 
     <lb/>
     will remember the base deal came up at the first 
     <lb/>
     meeting; we asked if any effort was made to get 
     <lb/>
     tariff concessions in return for the bases. They did 
     <lb/>
     not say "no" or "yes". With regard to their taking 
     <lb/>
     the matter up further, they told us plainly that if 
     <lb/>
     we had our own government we would be able to 
     <lb/>
     take up the whole matter. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I do not wish to delay the 
     <lb/>
     debate... From the report of the delegation and 
     <lb/>
     from references made by the delegates themsel<lb break="no"/>ves, it is quite clear where we stand now. My 
     <lb/>
     thoughts over the last few months, and what 
     <lb/>
     knowledge we have gained here, have been 
     <lb/>
     clarified by the report from London. It is obvious 
     <lb/>
     there is only one solution for us. We have to get 
     <lb/>
     out and fight for ourselves and stand on our own. 
     <lb/>
     We do not want anything from anyone; we do not 
     <lb/>
     want charity; we are sounder financially; our 
     <lb/>
     credit rating is higher than it has been for some 
     <lb/>
     considerable time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The delegation report refers to the question 


            <cb/>
       

     which Mr. Miller just raised, further discussions 
     <lb/>
     on the bases agreement. We have been told that 
     <lb/>
     that is a job for our own government. I think the 
     <lb/>
     sooner we can get on our own feet so that we can 
     <lb/>
     take up the question of the base deals with the 
     <lb/>
     Americans the better. Those interest-free loans 
     <lb/>
     should be applied to the reduction of our debt and 
     <lb/>
     so cut down on debt services. That is important, 
     <lb/>
     particularly in view of the lower rate of interest 
     <lb/>
     we will receive next January. presumably.... We 
     <lb/>
     have the ability and the brains and the people.... 
     <lb/>
     Our future lies in ourselves, and we should get 
     <lb/>
     out and fight for ouselves and talk later about 
     <lb/>
     what we want to do. 
    </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> ....We know what the result of the 
     <lb/>trip to London is. We know it in clear and unmis<lb break="no"/>takable terms. We have all said it is what we 
     <lb/>expected. Perhaps there was not much else we 
     <lb/>could have expected. Responsible government 
     <lb/>means we accept responsibilty for our own af<lb break="no"/>fairs. Commission of Government means that the 
     <lb/>British government accepts responsibility for our 
     <lb/>affairs. We knew that. But it was not a waste of 
     <lb/>time to send a delegation to London. A good 
     <lb/>many points were cleared up — points which 
     <lb/>would have been indefinite if any other method 
     <lb/>had been used to seek the information. I have just 
     <lb/>said Commission of Government means that the 
     <lb/>British government accepts responsbility for our 
     <lb/>finances. Having said that, there is a bit of a catch. 
     <lb/>Whereas the British government accepts respon<lb break="no"/>sibility for any deficits, it retains the power to see 
     <lb/>to it that we do not incur any deficits. In other 
     <lb/>words, the aid we receive from the British 
     <lb/>government may mean something or it may mean 
     <lb/>nothing. And if we are to rely on the impressions 
     <lb/>brought back by the delegation to London, we are 
     <lb/>inclined to believe it will mean nothing, or very 
     <lb/>little. It is good for us to be clear on that.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout our deliberations, we have al<lb break="no"/>lowed our own personal politics to obtrude too 
     <lb/>much into the discussion, and history will 
     <lb/>remember us perhaps just as much for what we 
     <lb/>said on these occasions, as for what we did. I 
     <lb/>regret it has been found necessary in discussing 
     <lb/>the report, to have anything to say about forms of 
     <lb/>government, and that questions of politics should 
     <lb/>be dragged in again, Were it not for the fact that 
     <lb/>there has been so much political colouring to our 
     <lb/>discussions, they might have been over before 
     <lb/>this.... Since, however, the question of forms of

     government was raised, I would like to make this 
     <lb/>
     one brief statement. When we have reviewed the 
     <lb/>
     report that has come back from London; when we 
     <lb/>
     see where we stand as far as the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Newfoundland are concerned; and 
     <lb/>
     when we receive the report of the delegation that 
     <lb/>
     is to proceed to Ottawa — when we get all these 
     <lb/>
     reports, together with the facts we have gleaned 
     <lb/>
     about our own country and its finances and 
     <lb/>
     prospects, and the people of this country should 
     <lb/>
     make the decision to stand alone, though that 
     <lb/>
     decision should involve a certain amount of 
     <lb/>
     poverty — in other words they are prepared to be 
     <lb/>
     poor but proud — I want to say that they will earn 
     <lb/>
     my undying respect, and that I will do whatever 
     <lb/>
     I can. But there are two observations I want to 
     <lb/>
     make. One is, I have never been prepared to 
     <lb/>
     compromise that such a decision must be made 
     <lb/>
     by the whole people of Newfoundland, including 
     <lb/>
     the people to whom the future may be hardest, 
     <lb/>
     because it has always been our fate that when the 
     <lb/>
     boot has been too small it has always pinched 
     <lb/>
     hardest on the smallest toes. I think the people 
     <lb/>
     most directly concerned in any sacrifice should 
     <lb/>
     be heard from before that sacrifice is imposed 
     <lb/>
     upon them. If they take it willingly, more power 
     <lb/>
     and more credit to them. Secondly, ... regardless 
     <lb/>
     how much you or I may come here and talk of 
     <lb/>
     what we will do in the future, there has never been 
     <lb/>
     in this country any equality of sacrifice on the part 
     <lb/>
     of all people. If there had been, perhaps we should 
     <lb/>
     never be in the position we are today. When we 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to stand together and take that 
     <lb/>
     equality of sacrifice, perhaps we shall have the 
     <lb/>
     right to tell other people they are not what they 
     <lb/>
     should be. Let us not scorn any man for looking 
     <lb/>
     to the security of his future, when our own future 
     <lb/>
     is as secure as we want it to be.

            <p><persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> Mr. Chairman, the London delega<lb break="no"/>tion, back from the heart of empire, brought to 
     <lb/>members of this assembly a memorandum, en<lb break="no"/>dorsed by only five of the seven delegates com<lb break="no"/>prising that delegation.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was much impressed to hear one of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates say, in effect, yesterday, "The Domin<lb break="no"/>ions Office told us, if you want to negotiate and 
     <lb/>
    discuss the matters listed in this memorandum, or 
     <lb/>this seven point program to which I referred a few 
     <lb/>minutes ago, go get yourselves a government." 
     <lb/>Strangely enough, however, the London visit 
     <lb/>seemed to give added support to the strange 


            <cb/>
          

     opinions that some of the members already held, 
     <lb/>
     for one of the members of the delegation yester<lb break="no"/>day implied in his talk that all was long ago 
     <lb/>
     decided, meaning, of course, Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     future form of government. Other implications 
     <lb/>
     were that we were being sold up the river, and 
     <lb/>
     that dark and sinister influences were at work, 
     <lb/>
     and some cold, grey, forbidding morning the 
     <lb/>
     300,000 of us little people would wake up in a 
     <lb/>
     sunless world to find that we had been pawned 
     <lb/>
     off to some other nation. Somebody talked in 
     <lb/>
     platitudes to say what we need is faith in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but I say what we really need is faith 
     <lb/>
     in ourselves, faith to believe that the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     down in Lumsden, the good housewife in 
     <lb/>
     Gambo, the enterprising farmer in Eastport, all 
     <lb/>
     have enough ordinary common sense, enough 
     <lb/>
     average intelligence, to prevent anybody, even 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, from selling us anywhere, and 
     <lb/>
     that they don't need the 44 men of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion to do their thinking for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not care if Mr. Fudge, proud, patriotic and 
     <lb/>
     loyal though he be, uses as his slogan "Thou too 
     <lb/>
     sail on, O ship of state, Sail on O country strong 
     <lb/>
     and great", or if Mr. Smallwood, fired and en<lb break="no"/>thused with his federal union idea, walls his ap<lb break="no"/>peal to Canada to throw out the lifeline — no, I 
     <lb/>
     am not in the least concerned. I have one vote, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not have a price, and like myself there 
     <lb/>
     are many thousands of my fellow countrymen 
     <lb/>
     who, in the hour of decision, will be guided not 
     <lb/>
     by catch cries or slogans, not by impassioned 
     <lb/>
     speeches, not exactly by what this Convention 
     <lb/>
     thinks collectively or individually, but by what 
     <lb/>
     they find to be in the best interest of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland we love. Why then should this Con<lb break="no"/>vention become obsessed with its own 
     <lb/>
     importance, worried by fears of its own imagin<lb break="no"/>ing, so much so as to darkly contemplate outside 
     <lb/>
     influences, and internal traitors banding together 
     <lb/>
     to work our economic, financial and political 
     <lb/>
     collapse? Gentlemen, the main conclusion I draw 
     <lb/>
     from this debate is that the mother country gives 
     <lb/>
     us a guarantee that is at best provisional upon her 
     <lb/>
     ability to stand behind the guarantee. Should we 
     <lb/>
     then, on this very uncertain assumption, retain in 
     <lb/>
     power a government whose policies we all claim 
     <lb/>
     are not in the best interest of this island? Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     the main objective of the London delegation was 
     <lb/>
     to find out under what terms, if any, the British 
     <lb/>
     government would be prepared to continue the 


            <pb n="558"

     present administration. No logical person, view 
     <lb/>
     ing the economic and financial position in which 
     <lb/>
     the mother country presently finds herself, ex<lb break="no"/>pected any handouts or favours. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     certain members of the delegation were highly 
     <lb/>
     dissatisfied.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It's time our people made an entirely new 
     <lb/>
     approach to their appraisal of Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government: a new approach in this way, that 
     <lb/>
     each and every voter ask himself or herself this 
     <lb/>
     question — what assurance have I from the state<lb break="no"/>ments of Lord Addison that the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment will guarantee our economic stability 
     <lb/>
     should we fall upon mean times five or ten years 
     <lb/>
     from now? Or to put it plainer, what guarantee is 
     <lb/>
     there contained in this report that England will be 
     <lb/>
     in a position to help us with anything at any time? 
     <lb/>
     Now quite plainly the answer isjust this: there is, 
     <lb/>
     there can be no such hard and fast guarantee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have no illusions as to what a large percent<lb break="no"/>age of our people think of Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but there are many whose apathy merely 
     <lb/>
     causes them to shrug their shoulders and say, 
     <lb/>
     "This is the best government we ever had. This 
     <lb/>
     government brought us prosperity, higher wages, 
     <lb/>
     and a better price for our fishery products". It's 
     <lb/>
     just as much a truth to say, "Adolf Hitler was the 
     <lb/>
     greatest man that ever lived. He was great be<lb break="no"/>cause he created a world crisis that brought us 
     <lb/>
     unheard of wealth and prosperity." The London 
     <lb/>
     delegation brings us just this, my friends: "Any 
     <lb/>
     guarantee of financial and economic aid is 
     <lb/>
     definitely out of the question, and we, the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office, can actually guarantee New<lb break="no"/>foundland nothing at all." I would emphasise this 
     <lb/>
     now, lest ten years hence Newfoundlanders, 
     <lb/>
     having made their decision, may once again have 
     <lb/>
     desperate reminders of their choice in the form of 
     <lb/>
     six cents per day guaranteed dole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In concluding, I cannot altogether agree with 
     <lb/>
     the sentiments expressed so dramatically by my 
     <lb/>
     good friend Major Cashin.... Now I am more 
     <lb/>
     concerned with the welfare of my fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen of 1947, than I am with the hopes 
     <lb/>
     and loves of my great ancestors who, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     more patriotic than practical, waved a flag when 
     <lb/>
     they might have been better employed. Whether 
     <lb/>
     we like it or not, from the dust of old beliefs, old 
     <lb/>
     customs, old loves; from the ashes of old tradi<lb break="no"/>tions, political and otherwise, a new order is 
     <lb/>
     arising. Tradition, heritage are fast disappearing, 


            <cb/>
          

     and with such disappearance is coupled a dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion and decay of old values. We in New<lb break="no"/>foundland are not unaffected by this historic 
     <lb/>
     dislocation. Only recently a motion was intro<lb break="no"/>duced suggesting an approach to a foreign power. 
     <lb/>
     A few shouted "upstart", "renegade", "seces<lb break="no"/>sionist", a few talked of kicking down any con<lb break="no"/>sideration ofsuch a motion, but this will not, this 
     <lb/>
     cannot do away with the conflicting and convul<lb break="no"/>sive sentiment that is slowly, in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     young Newfoundlanders, tearing down the dams 
     <lb/>
     of the past, and bringing a new thought and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps a new vision for our people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I am well content to let the 
     <lb/>
     matter of choice of government rest in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of my fellow countrymen. I care not if the 
     <lb/>
     majority view of things differs from mine, but 1 
     <lb/>
     am concerned that they be not misled in their 
     <lb/>
     interpretations of the reports of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     To this end I submit that l cannot find in the report 
     <lb/>
     of the London delegation sufficient guarantee for 
     <lb/>
     our future well-being as a people, should we ever 
     <lb/>
     need help, to justify my support of the retention 
     <lb/>
     of the present form of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, ... the delega<lb break="no"/>tion has not accomplished as much as similar 
     <lb/>
     missions in the past. Reference to one such oc<lb break="no"/>casion in me past was made here yesterday by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Butt, when be quoted the famous 
     <lb/>
     Labouchere despatch of 1857, which has been 
     <lb/>
     referred to as Newfoundland's Magna Carta, in<lb break="no"/>asmuch as it laid down the democratic principle 
     <lb/>
     "that the consent of the community of New<lb break="no"/>foundland is regarded by Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as the essential preliminary to any 
     <lb/>
     modification of their territorial or maritime 
     <lb/>
     rights". What a shame that our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners of the 19405 did not recall the 
     <lb/>
     Labouchere despatch before they collaborated in 
     <lb/>
     "modifying" — or "impairing" as this report says 
     <lb/>
     — the territorial rights of Newfoundlanders for 
     <lb/>
     99 years. Sir Hugh Hoyles and P.F. Little were 
     <lb/>
     the members of the delegation who were as<lb break="no"/>sociated with this famous despatch; that achieve<lb break="no"/>ment was one of many that illumine the pages of 
     <lb/>
     the history of responsible government from 1855 
     <lb/>
     down to almost its very end. Another instance 
     <lb/>
     occurred in 1886 when the House of Assembly 
     <lb/>
     passed the Bait Act which was to sound the 
     <lb/>
     death-knell of French influence in this country. 
     <lb/>
     When the British government refused to ratify it, 
  

            <pb n="559"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-21_Page_0559.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">559</fw>
          

     the House of Assembly passed the second Bait 
     <lb/>
     Act in 1887 and sent over Sir Robert Thorbum 
     <lb/>
     and Sir Ambrose Shea to London on the occasion 
     <lb/>
     of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The result of 
     <lb/>
     this delegation and its conference was the 
     <lb/>
     ratification of the Bait Act by the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the weakening of French influence, 
     <lb/>
     leading to their final withdrawal in 1904 after two 
     <lb/>
     and a half centuries. And as recently as 1927, a 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation to London, headed by 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister Walter Monroe, presented a case 
     <lb/>
     prepared in Newfoundland that won for New<lb break="no"/>foundland 110,000 square miles of Labrador, the 
     <lb/>
     greatest asset this country has, and which, come 
     <lb/>
     what may, we mean to hold. These are a few 
     <lb/>
     outstanding examples of what other New<lb break="no"/>foundland delegations to London accomplished. 
     <lb/>
     Their accomplishments are no reflection on the 
     <lb/>
     calibre of the members of the delegation from this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. But it is certainly pertinent to point 
     <lb/>
     out to the country the great difference between 
     <lb/>
     these delegations of earlier days and that delega<lb break="no"/>tion of recent date. From 1857 to 1927, every 
     <lb/>
     delegation that went from this house to London 
     <lb/>
     went with authority — the authority that is vested 
     <lb/>
     in members of a responsible government, elected 
     <lb/>
     by the people to represent, talk and act for them 
     <lb/>
     in matters of the gravest and most far-reaching 
     <lb/>
     concern. That is a fact we should not lose sight of 
     <lb/>
     — it is the most significant fact of the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation's visit. It sticks out like a sore thumb. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Won't we recognise it? Can't we get it into our 
     <lb/>
     heads as a people that the thing that makes all the 
     <lb/>
     difference is authority? I repeat it — the authority 
     <lb/>
     that goes with being a government of the people. 
     <lb/>
     True, the delegates to the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     were elected by the people. True, the delegates to 
     <lb/>
     London — not counting the Chairman — were 
     <lb/>
     elected by the Convention, but we have no 
     <lb/>
     authority, they have no authority, to deal, bargain 
     <lb/>
     or otherwise engage in the legitimate functions of 
     <lb/>
     a government. Not so long ago we were told 
     <lb/>
     indirectly by members of the Bar and the Bench 
     <lb/>
     that we were what Mr. Bailey referred to as a 
     <lb/>
     "glorified debating society" — and our delega<lb break="no"/>tion went to London to hear substantially the 
     <lb/>
     same statement fall in curt tones from the lips of 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not surprised that Lord Addison said what 
     <lb/>
     he did. We know we have no such authority. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, some of us here have been trying to impress 


            <cb/>
          

     that fact on others. Our principal objection to 
     <lb/>
     sending a delegation to Ottawa for terms on 
     <lb/>
     which the people of this country might be asked 
     <lb/>
     to vote themselves into confederation — into a 
     <lb/>
     set-up from which there would be no backing out 
     <lb/>
     — was that having no such authority to bargain 
     <lb/>
     or negotiate we would be false to our trust by 
     <lb/>
     helping to lead our countrymen down a blind 
     <lb/>
     alley. We knew that we had no authority. The 
     <lb/>
     delegation knew it. My blessing to them just the 
     <lb/>
     same, that as real Newfoundlanders they made 
     <lb/>
     the most of their opportunity, when face to face 
     <lb/>
     with the real government of Newfoundland, the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office, to go further than in strict 
     <lb/>
     legality they may have been entitled to go under 
     <lb/>
     our much-quoted and widely-misunderstood 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference. At least five of them believed 
     <lb/>
     they were doing the right thing for their country, 
     <lb/>
     and were not to be hidebound by rules and regula<lb break="no"/>tions. I would have done the same had I been 
     <lb/>
     there. I have read their memorandum to the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State; and I see nothing in it that 
     <lb/>
     could be objected to by any Newfoundlander. To 
     <lb/>
     my mind the split in the ranks of the delegation 
     <lb/>
     is the most disappointing feature of the visit to 
     <lb/>
     London. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And yet even without the authority of a 
     <lb/>
     government, and despite disagreement in their 
     <lb/>
     ranks, the delegation was successful in other mat<lb break="no"/>ters besides obtaining bald answers to bald ques<lb break="no"/>tions. It is obvious that they have been able to 
     <lb/>
     speed up certain acts of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, which it is alleged the Commission 
     <lb/>
     was already contemplating, and which, no doubt 
     <lb/>
     when accomplished, the said Commission will 
     <lb/>
     take the credit for, such as in all likelihood the 
     <lb/>
     reduction of the public debt by the application of 
     <lb/>
     the interest-free loans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The delegation was quite justified in arguing 
     <lb/>
     the case they did argue, even though they may not 
     <lb/>
     have had the authority. As Mr. Crosbie said, they 
     <lb/>
     asked for nothing that was not fair and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable. No one in this Convention was look<lb break="no"/>ing for gifts or handouts.... As far as I'm con<lb break="no"/>cerned, we've had enough of that kind of talk and 
     <lb/>
     attitude of mind in this country — too much. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So in actual fact the delegation has ac<lb break="no"/>complished more than I expected. This Conven<lb break="no"/>tion had a job to do to assess the financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic position of Newfoundland. The Con<lb break="no"/>vention found that it was necessary to consult 


            <pb n="560"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-05-21_Page_0560.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">560</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">May 1947</fw>
         

     with the real government of Newfoundland — 
     <lb/>
     the Dominions Office — to get answers to ques<lb break="no"/>tions which their agents in St. John's could not 
     <lb/>
     give. This has now been done. We have received 
     <lb/>
     answers couched in the very best language of 
     <lb/>
     British diplomacy. They are very diplomatic 
     <lb/>
     answers in that they say a lot and say very little, 
     <lb/>
     and endeavour at the same time to put us very 
     <lb/>
     firmly in our place. But in this diplomatic lan<lb break="no"/>guage certain sentences have been written down 
     <lb/>
     — intentionally or otherwise — that no amount 
     <lb/>
     of twisting or interpretation can alter. I refer you 
     <lb/>
     to page 5 of my Lord Addison's memorandum, 
     <lb/>
     second paragraph, on the base deals: "There is no 
     <lb/>
     reason to think that the United States Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would be prepared to agree to any substan<lb break="no"/>tial variation of the basis on which the Agreement 
     <lb/>
     was entered into, or to give any <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for 
     <lb/>
     rights which were given to them 'freely and 
     <lb/>
     without consideration'. If, however, New<lb break="no"/>foundland should return to Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment it would be open to her to raise the question 
     <lb/>
     of some modification of the Agreement and in 
     <lb/>
     that event negotations would no doubt be carried 
     <lb/>
     out with the assistance of the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     Government ...." There is the answer to the many 
     <lb/>
     people in this country who wish for a closer 
     <lb/>
     association with the United States. It bears out 
     <lb/>
     too what I said during the last debate on the 
     <lb/>
     motion to send a delegation to Ottawa, that no 
     <lb/>
     agreements or arrangements of any kind can be 
     <lb/>
     expected to be made with the United States by 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland until this country is once again a 
     <lb/>
     free agent, able to act through its own responsible 
     <lb/>
     government — that we will never be able to do 
     <lb/>
     so through either the Dorninions Office or the 
     <lb/>
     Department of External Affairs in Ottawa. Again 
     <lb/>
     I refer you to page 7, to the answer to the question 
     <lb/>
     on the "Financing and Control of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Airports". After stating that Newfoundland is to 
     <lb/>
     be responsible for one-third of the operating 
     <lb/>
     deficit of Gander, the Secretary of State says: "In 
     <lb/>
     the event of a return to Responsible Government, 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland authorities will decide their 
     <lb/>
     policy with respect to the operation of the airport 
     <lb/>
     and they might if deemed desirable submit a 
     <lb/>
     request to the international organization for 
     <lb/>
     financial assistance...." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are clear and plain statements. They 
     <lb/>
     should open our eyes — those of us who still need 
     <lb/>
     to have them opened — to the true realisation of 
    

            <cb/>
       

     what is at stake. The United States bases and the 
     <lb/>
     great airports in our country are our bargaining 
     <lb/>
     power with great nations — they are a tremen<lb break="no"/>dous advantage that this country has never had in 
     <lb/>
     the past, brought about by the march of progress 
     <lb/>
     and the sad accident of war. They can well be the 
     <lb/>
     key that will unlock the door to the future well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     being of all our people. If their control passes 
     <lb/>
     from our hands irrevocably, then we are finished. 
     <lb/>
     I say that word "finished" in all seriousness. If we 
     <lb/>
     take back our country and its assets into our own 
     <lb/>
     hands, our position will be one to be envied by 
     <lb/>
     every country. At the moment, this control is 
     <lb/>
     temporarily out of our hands — it is in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of trustees who are not going to move very far, if 
     <lb/>
     at all, in utilising that bargaining power to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's advantage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Secretary of State has raised the signpost, 
     <lb/>
     wittingly or unwittingly, for Newfoundlanders to 
     <lb/>
     read that they may follow the right road. He did 
     <lb/>
     not say that if Newfoundland retains the Com<lb break="no"/>mission form of government, she could do any<lb break="no"/>thing about these matters. He said that if 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland returns to responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment — meaning dominion status — she will be, 
     <lb/>
     and her people will be, in a position to use these 
     <lb/>
     bargaining powers to her own advantage and the 
     <lb/>
     advantage of her people, our people — us. It is as 
     <lb/>
     plain as Cabot Tower on a fine day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To me that is the most significant fact that has 
     <lb/>
     come out of the visit of the London delegation, 
     <lb/>
     the real find of this game of power politics, this 
     <lb/>
     game of blindman's buff in which we and our 
     <lb/>
     country are involved. They have told us to get on 
     <lb/>
     our own and do our own fighting, for they are in 
     <lb/>
     no position to fight for us. They are too dependent 
     <lb/>
     on the United States and Canada to bargain for us 
     <lb/>
     about matters in which these countries are so 
     <lb/>
     vitally interested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....In closing I want to tell a story, and it's no 
     <lb/>
     fable; it happened this very morning. There came 
     <lb/>
     in to see me an old fisherman, 80 years old, and 
     <lb/>
     as bright and keen as anybody here. He follows 
     <lb/>
     the Convention with greatest of interest. He told 
     <lb/>
     me that he knew nothing about the country, noth<lb break="no"/>ing about what has happened in the past 15 years 
     <lb/>
     until the Convention started, and he gave due 
     <lb/>
     credit to us all, irrespective of what form of 
     <lb/>
     government we espouse. But he said, "I've seen 
     <lb/>
     a lot of governments, and I firmly believe that our 
     <lb/>
     own govenment, responsible government, is the 
  

            <pb n="561"

     best thing for Newfoundland. All we want is the 
     <lb/>
     right men, and there are lots of them in the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, who are a credit to their race." That's 
     <lb/>
     what this old fisherman said, this old man who 
     <lb/>
     still wants to go on fishing. Let this be a lesson 
     <lb/>
     for us Let us take fate by the throat and go 
     <lb/>
     forward. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> When this Convention was 
     <lb/>
     convened I understood that its purpose was the 
     <lb/>
     collection and digestion of facts with a view to 
     <lb/>
     determining whether this country was self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting, and for how long a period it could 
     <lb/>
     reasonably hope to remain so. I felt satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     all delegates, as well as all Newfoundlanders, 
     <lb/>
     would want nothing less than responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, if after investigation and deliberation we 
     <lb/>
     came to the conclusion that we were self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting. Since that time many extraneous matters 
     <lb/>
     have been introduced which tended to befog our 
     <lb/>
     original purpose. I realised that we had men 
     <lb/>
     amongst us who were not only more familiar than 
     <lb/>
     I with Newfoundland affairs, but also more ex<lb break="no"/>perienced in public debate. I felt that our real job 
     <lb/>
     was the collection and analysis of facts, and not 
     <lb/>
     a political platform or an opportunity to display 
     <lb/>
     our oratorical qualifications. For this reason, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I observed the maxim that speech is 
     <lb/>
     silver but silence is golden, and I cannot but think 
     <lb/>
     that the radio audience often wished that some 
     <lb/>
     delegates did likewise. I remained silent, even 
     <lb/>
     when one of our most loquacious delegates prac<lb break="no"/>tically insulted all delegates like myself who 
     <lb/>
     were not in love with our own melodious voices 
     <lb/>
     when, commenting on some letters in the public 
     <lb/>
     press and seeking to justify his long-winded and 
     <lb/>
     repetitious speeches, he conveyed the impression 
     <lb/>
     that any delegate with brains must necessarily 
     <lb/>
     speak to the different reports, and associated him<lb break="no"/>self with half a dozen others as being the brains 
     <lb/>
     of the outfit. I don't know if the others felt flat<lb break="no"/>tered.... I do not make any apologies for these 
     <lb/>
     irrelevancies, as I have been obliged to listen to 
     <lb/>
     too many since last September. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In speaking to this report I had hoped for a lot 
     <lb/>
     more than it contains. We sent a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     England to obtain facts which only England 
     <lb/>
     could give us, and which were necessary to us if 
     <lb/>
     we were to be in a position to make recommen<lb break="no"/>dations on future forms of government. We 
     <lb/>
     realised that the Dominions Office was in effect 
     <lb/>
     the real government of Newfoundland. We 


            <cb/>
     

     realised also that the Dominions Office should 
     <lb/>
     have volunteered this information months ago if 
     <lb/>
     the English government meant this Convention 
     <lb/>
     to be more than a glorious stall.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told that we will have to take full 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for our sterling debt if we assume 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, regardless of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the loan when raised was guaranteed by 
     <lb/>
     Britain. We are told that the delegation had no 
     <lb/>
     authority to discuss trade and other matters, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of the fact that they agreed to receive 
     <lb/>
     the delegation, having been fully advised of the 
     <lb/>
     matters the delegation wished to discuss. We are 
     <lb/>
     told that because of dollar shortage they cannot 
     <lb/>
     guarantee to take any substantial quantity of our 
     <lb/>
     fish or iron ore, regardless of their awareness of 
     <lb/>
     what it would mean to our economy, and that we 
     <lb/>
     would accept goods in kind and even lend them 
     <lb/>
     dollars to buy our frozen fish fillets. We are told 
     <lb/>
     that the Commission govemment in its prudence 
     <lb/>
     doesn't deem it wise to apply the interest-free 
     <lb/>
     loans to the reduction of our debt, regardless of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that we have a substantial surplus and that 
     <lb/>
     the saving in interest would be considerable. We 
     <lb/>
     are told that we must pay any deficit on the 
     <lb/>
     Gander airport up to $225,000, regardless of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that we have no use for it ourselves and that 
     <lb/>
     international airlines need its facilities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told that there is no reason to think that 
     <lb/>
     the United States government would be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to make any variation or give any <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> 
     <lb/>
     on the base deals, regardless of article 28 of that 
     <lb/>
     agreement and of the fact that our sovereign 
     <lb/>
     rights were violated by the leasing of our territory 
     <lb/>
     for 99 years with utter disregard for our feelings. 
     <lb/>
     We are even reminded that we owe our wartime 
     <lb/>
     immunity to the presence of the US forces in the 
     <lb/>
     island, regardless of the fact that they came here 
     <lb/>
     for their own defence rather than for ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are warned that should we decide on 
     <lb/>
     responsible government we are on our own but 
     <lb/>
     that, should we retain Commission government, 
     <lb/>
     our financial stability would be guaranteed, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of the fact that when Britain was in a 
     <lb/>
     far better position to assist us, and when we really 
     <lb/>
     needed her assistance, the guarantee of financial 
     <lb/>
     stability amounted to the staggering sum of six 
     <lb/>
     cents a day dole. I say staggering advisedly, as it 
     <lb/>
     left us our present phenomenal expenditure on 
     <lb/>
     public health and welfare, with our hospitals and 
     <lb/>
     sanatoriums unable to accommodate a large per<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="562"

     centage of our population who need treatment. 
     <lb/>
     This degrading dole left some of us so lethargic 
     <lb/>
     and apathetic that we have lost the spirit of inde<lb break="no"/>pendence for which our forbears were noted, and 
     <lb/>
     are ready to run begging someone else to do for 
     <lb/>
     us that which we will not do for ourselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We did not go to England seeking charity, 
     <lb/>
     rather seeking information which we had a right 
     <lb/>
     to expect, and this report at least leaves us in no 
     <lb/>
     doubt as to England's attitude toward us. Our 
     <lb/>
     confederates are overjoyed at its contents and feel 
     <lb/>
     that it is a real boost for their cause, but I would 
     <lb/>
     remind them that even though civics was never 
     <lb/>
     taught in our schools, the ordinary New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, instinctively or otherwise, can be 
     <lb/>
     depended on to make a common sense decision, 
     <lb/>
     and is not to be swayed by the oratorical powers 
     <lb/>
     of any propagandists in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, there appears to be a dif<lb break="no"/>ference of opinion in the delegation as to its 
     <lb/>
     reception in England, but the tenor of the report 
     <lb/>
     leaves little room to doubt the feeling of the 
     <lb/>
     majority. Lord Addison and his colleagues would 
     <lb/>
     seem to have some resentment towards the 
     <lb/>
     delegation, and I am of the opinion that the full 
     <lb/>
     report of the conversations in England should be 
     <lb/>
     laid before the Convention, convened in private 
     <lb/>
     session.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think Mr. McCormack said 
     <lb/>
     that the British government has told us that if we 
     <lb/>
     go back to responsible government, then the 
     <lb/>
     British government will no longer be responsible 
     <lb/>
     for our sterling debt....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> That is right.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think it is utterly incorrect. I 
     <lb/>
     do not see in the memoranda from the British 
     <lb/>
     government any such statement. I have not heard 
     <lb/>
     any of the delegates who went to London make 
     <lb/>
     the statement. I am aware there are people in this 
     <lb/>
     town who seem to have got the impression that if 
     <lb/>
     we go under responsible government the British 
     <lb/>
     government will repudiate the guarantee of our 
     <lb/>
     sterling debt. It is wrong. It is utterly untrue...

            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> I thank Mr. Smallwood for

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Whilst I appreciate the excellence 
     <lb/>
     of the speech of Mr. McCormack, it was an error. 
     <lb/>
     I believe someone else made the same statement 
     <lb/>
     yesterday. Great Britain guaranteed in 1934 the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the debt, otherwise they could not 
     <lb/>
     have converted it and it could not have gone back 
  

            <cb/>
           

     to par. Whether Commission government, 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, confederation or any 
     <lb/>
     other status, it does not matter, because Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain has guaranteed the interest on that debt, 
     <lb/>
     whatever form of government.... I thank 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood for bringing up this point. 
     <lb/>
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> lthought I had a chance to have 
     <lb/>a knock at responsible government, but I gave 
     <lb/>responsible government a boost. Really, I think 
     <lb/>Mr. Hollett should thank me a little more heart<lb break="no"/>ily. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It would not be that Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood was more worried about Commission of

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am one who wants self-

     <lb/>opinion that the majority of people want Com<lb break="no"/>mission government—I say that as one who does 
     <lb/>not want Commission of Government, but as one 
     <lb/>who wants self-government. In my opinion Com<lb break="no"/>mission government is the most popular govern<lb break="no"/>ment in Newfoundland at this moment.

     received as much information as we have, for 
     <lb/>
     from the first day of the Convention, it has been 
     <lb/>
     clear to me that information was the last thing it 
     <lb/>
     was intended for us to get, and I am sure it is very 
     <lb/>
     patent to anyone who has been listening closely 
     <lb/>
     just as soon as we get into anything worthwhile, 
     <lb/>
     we are up against a stone wall. I could not help 
     <lb/>
     thinking yesterday, whilst listening to the senior 
     <lb/>
     member from Grand Falls, how close he was to 
     <lb/>
     the truth when he said the only reason the delega<lb break="no"/>tion was received was because the powers that be 
     <lb/>
     wanted a delegation to go to Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At an earlier date I said we were going into 
     <lb/>
     confederation with a pull from the front, meaning 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and a push from the back, meaning Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. We got more from the Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     than I expected, in fact, all that was intended for 
     <lb/>
     us to get since 1943. It makes my blood boil to 
     <lb/>
     think we have a body of men elected by the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country treated in the manner we 
     <lb/>
     have been treated. I cannot understand how men 
     <lb/>
     with blood in their veins can put up with it. Every 
     <lb/>
     way we turn we are up against those cursed terms 
     <lb/>
     of reference.... They encircle us like the scalloped 
     <lb/>
     shrouds the old folks used to put around a corpse 
     <lb/>
     in the outports. Who made those terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence so entangling? Those who wanted it that 
     <lb/>
     way. The Convention was only intended to show 
     <lb/>
     the world that what would happen to this country 
     <lb/>
     would have a show of democracy, while all the 
     <lb/>
     time an organised minority in the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     backed by the powers that be, led us, an unor<lb break="no"/>ganised majority, the way they wanted us to go, 
     <lb/>
     like a horse is led or driven with a curb bit. The 
     <lb/>
     time has come for us to assert ourselves. I think 
     <lb/>
     the limit has been reached. No greater insult 
     <lb/>
     could be heaped on an elected body, than that 
     <lb/>
     they are not men of honour and discretion, and I 
     <lb/>
     see no reason why the stenographic report cannot 
     <lb/>
     be given to the Convention in an informal ses<lb break="no"/>sion. If the whole delegation concurred in this I 
     <lb/>
     am sure the people would not take it lightly, but 
     <lb/>
     with only two of seven of that opinion, then it 
     <lb/>
     looks to me like a plot to keep the Convention aw 
     <lb/>
     misinformed as possible, to becloud and to befog 
     <lb/>
     the issue.... Going back a year ago, and listening 
     <lb/>
     to the cheers in both Houses of Parliament when 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's sacrifices in both world wars 
     <lb/>
     were mentioned, how hollow do they sound 
     <lb/>
     today to you who are in reach of my voice? Don't 
    

            <cb/>
          

     they sound like a travesty of democracy? Why the 
     <lb/>
     change from 1933, one has only to turn to RA, 
     <lb/>
     MacKay's book on Newfoundland, page 503.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the following paragraph in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     is making trouble for us today. This is where we 
     <lb/>
     get the pull and push. This makes Britain and 
     <lb/>
     Canada partners through the ages or until swords 
     <lb/>
     are beaten into ploughshares. This is why today 
     <lb/>
     only a small minority in the Convention is in the 
     <lb/>
     know, and the rest of us are treated like children. 
     <lb/>
     The iron curtain has nothing on it. This paragraph 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say. 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Newfoundland region is of vital strategic 
     <lb/>
     importance to Canada, both for its direct

     defence and, if it so decides, for despatching 
     <lb/>
     air to Great Britain in the event of war. It

     would be ignominious to Canadians to leave

     <lb/>
     would be the case were the United States

     alone able to operate in the Newfoundland

     region. And now that Canada has become a

     responsibility for protecting the North Atlan<lb break="no"/>tic trade routes if Canada were an active

     I see nothing wrong with this, being British

     is he who has his quarrel just, but four times blest 
     <lb/>
     is he who gets his blow in first." The only thing 
     <lb/>
     wrong with it is that we are treated like children. 
     <lb/>
     We are the oldest colony, yet with our record 
     <lb/>
     behind us, ashore and afloat, we are shuffled 
     <lb/>
     around like pawns on a chess board. Why could 
     <lb/>
     not that which has been taken from us have been 
     <lb/>
     given back? And with a government of our own, 
     <lb/>
     meet both the imperial and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     authorities and let us take our share of the burden. 
     <lb/>
     If we haven't the cash, we have the men, and I'll 
     <lb/>
     wager my life that we will keep up our end of the

     <lb/>
     manned the ships for Canada in World War I, and 
     <lb/>
     our record speaks for itself. Everything has been

     for itself. That is why I draw the attention of the

     <lb/>
     the Convention must be composed of men from

     <lb/>
     that was so in order that we would have men who

     <lb/>
     any financial help whatsoever should we ever

     need such help. We will be free to vote for

     The delegation brought back another piece of 
     <lb/>
     information: that if we decide to remain under the 
     <lb/>
     Commission system of government, the British 
     <lb/>
     government will continue to guarantee our finan<lb break="no"/>cial stability. That sounds like a lot more than it 
     <lb/>
     really is. I suppose the British government did not 
     <lb/>
     feel like saying that they would chop us off 
     <lb/>
     altogether if we decided to remain under the 
     <lb/>
     Commission system, but when we consider 
     <lb/>
     Britain's own very bad condition, we must 
     <lb/>
     suspect that if they had been free to express their 
     <lb/>
     real feelings, they would have said to us, "You 
     <lb/>
     can have any form of government you like, but it 
     <lb/>
     will have to be without any help from us, for we 
     <lb/>
     are simply not in a position to help you under 
     <lb/>
     Commission government or any other form of 
     <lb/>
     government."

     Like Mr. Smallwood, I honour the mother

     country for her generous and gallant offer, but I

     cannot help remembering what I have read and 
     <lb/>
     heard about her own terrible condition.... I doubt 
     <lb/>
     very much whether Britain will be in any position 
 

            <cb/>
        

     to help Newfoundland for many, many years to 
     <lb/>
     come. Britain needs help herself — it is nothing

     short of selfishness on our part if we look to her

     for help....

            <p>
     To sum it up, Mr. Chairman, it seems that 
     <lb/>
    under responsible government we'll get nothing 
     <lb/>at all from Great Britain; and that under Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government it'll be very little more, We 
     <lb/>might as well face it right now, that so far as the 
     <lb/>mother country is concerned, this country is on 
     <lb/>her own right now, and will be on her own in the

     <lb/>have agreed. Now the position of the disagree<lb break="no"/>ment, as I see it, repeats itself back to the first 
     <lb/>time they sent out their three goodwill commis<lb break="no"/>sioners to Newfoundland. Some of you saw them, 
     <lb/>and they went back with the verdict that we in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland did not know what we wanted. 
     <lb/>The second time they sent the Prime Minister of 
     <lb/>Great Britain with two others. I understand the 
     <lb/>same verdict was marked against us. Now they 
     <lb/>have a National Convention set up, wherein the 
     <lb/>people can discuss the suitable form or forms of 
     <lb/>government they desire.

     The manager of the hotel, and his wife, which 
     <lb/>
     housed the Newfoundland delegation, were kind 
     <lb/>
     to us. They did all they possibly could. They gave 
     <lb/>
     us all they had, but I am still convinced that had 
     <lb/>
     any other concern, other than Dominions Office 
     <lb/>
     or the Office of Home Affairs, looked after it, we 
     <lb/>
     would have had better accomodation than we 
     <lb/>
     had. As far as cars are concerned, I think we did 
     <lb/>
     get a couple ofcars once free, but I think I spent 
     <lb/>
     most of my surplus money on cars, getting back 
     <lb/>
     and forth to the Dominions Office.

     Now you know the good book reminds us of

     the ten virgins who went out, and says there were

     five wise and five foolish. I wonder whether or 
     <lb/>
     not this country will think there are two wise and 
     <lb/>
     five foolish. That is up to them to judge. The two

     gentlemen who could not see eye to eye with us

     in signing this document, they have a perfect

     treated as well as could be expected. I hope that 
     <lb/>
     out of the visit of the delegation to London some 
     <lb/>
     good will come. The referendum of course will 
     <lb/>
     be put to the people some time, I am not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to say when. In fact there is no guarantee that it 
     <lb/>
     will be, but let's assume that it will. I repeat the 
     <lb/>
     statement that I made over there, that the people 
     <lb/>
     themselves will be in a position to judge as to 
     <lb/>
     what form of government they want at the proper 
     <lb/>
     time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> ....I have been listening to the 
     <lb/>
     speeches of the delegates and I think that 50% of 
     <lb/>
     the information that they gave us, and they gave 
     <lb/>
     us a good deal, is not contained in the report. 
     <lb/>
     Where did it come from? Is it in these secret 
     <lb/>
     meetings that we are not supposed to hear about? 
     <lb/>
     I think that this Convention should be in posses<lb break="no"/>sion of the proceedings of these meetings. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to ask if you made a definite mling 
     <lb/>
     that we can't get them, Mr. Chairman? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes. This information cannot be 
     <lb/>
     divulged. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Thank you.... I don't see any<lb break="no"/>thing in this report, as far as I can see, relating to 
     <lb/>
     item 7: "Any other matters...." Did the delegation 
     <lb/>
     discuss any other matters or not, and if so, can 
     <lb/>
     this Convention have that information? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have no recollection of any 
     <lb/>
     other matters that were discussed. They may pos<lb break="no"/>sibly have been incidentally mentioned. One 
     <lb/>
     thing that was discussed, which was not specify 
     <lb/>
     cally mentioned, was the question of frozen fish. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There was one other point that 
     <lb/>was mentioned and replied to, the question was 
     <lb/>put to the British government, "Could there be 
     <lb/>only two forms of government on the ballot?" 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That's in the answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Therefore it was raised. Could 
     <lb/>
     there be only two forms, Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment and responsible government? Their answer 
     <lb/>
     is given — they said, "No, that is not so. The 
     <lb/>
     Convention can recommend other suitable forms 
     <lb/>
     as well to be put before the people." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> ....I wish to emphasise the urgen<lb break="no"/>cy for action in the present position into which 
     <lb/>
     we true Newfoundlanders find ourselves bullied. 
     <lb/>
     The idea of the l939-46 conflict having been 
     <lb/>
     waged to put an end to all tyranny has become 
     <lb/>
     daily more farcical. When men are condemned 
     <lb/>
     by a more powerful nation for merely questioning 
     <lb/>
     the rule of their own country, the situation calls 
 

            <cb/>
   

     for more than polite verbal replies. Daily — one 
     <lb/>
     might say hourly — what remains in our dwin<lb break="no"/>dling treasury is being disposed of in the same 
     <lb/>
     manner in which our soil was wrenched from us 
     <lb/>
     for 50 creaking destroyers, a considerable num<lb break="no"/>ber of which were too decrepit to even survive 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic crossing. I wager that the land 
     <lb/>
     wrenched from us for their payment has not 
     <lb/>
     deteriorated in its solidity or value. An investiga<lb break="no"/>tion 12 months after purchase into the worth of 
     <lb/>
     the scrap hulks for which part of us were sold, and 
     <lb/>
     into the actual number of these destoyers seawor<lb break="no"/>thy enough to be taken into active operation, 
     <lb/>
     would no doubt have had interesting results. 
     <lb/>
     During these transactions it was my questionable 
     <lb/>
     honour and privilege to be a guest of England, 
     <lb/>
     and the Dominions Office seemed in no haste for 
     <lb/>
     me to leave. I doubt that they enjoyed my com<lb break="no"/>pany or presence to any great extent, but I was 
     <lb/>
     then what my country is proving now, a vassal 
     <lb/>
     and useful pawn. As each newly-acquired 
     <lb/>
     destroyer broke into pieces or failed to float, my 
     <lb/>
     humility was incurred by reminders from English 
     <lb/>
     individuals on the apparent worth of our beloved 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must admit I expected no more than was 
     <lb/>
     received from the dictators that have bled this 
     <lb/>
     island in recent years. Major Cashin has already 
     <lb/>
     told us that Britain herself is in a precarious 
     <lb/>
     position internationally. She is struggling, and 
     <lb/>
     the man in fear of drowning has little thought and 
     <lb/>
     less ability to save a weaker comrade, even be 
     <lb/>
     that comrade in far shallower water. I am con<lb break="no"/>soled by the fact that the majority of the delega<lb break="no"/>tion possessed sufficient common sense, 
     <lb/>
     sufficient love of their country, sufficient faith in 
     <lb/>
     themselves, and sufficient pride and inde<lb break="no"/>pendence to have stood on their feet and not knelt 
     <lb/>
     on their knees to the big brother with a whip in 
     <lb/>
     his hand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During early sessions of the Convention the 
     <lb/>
     general public was politely, but at the same time 
     <lb/>
     unfairly informed that they were only to be given 
     <lb/>
     those facts that the Commission decreed they 
     <lb/>
     should know. These same people were to stand 
     <lb/>
     outside locked doors while the disposal of the 
     <lb/>
     assets provided by them, the little people, were 
     <lb/>
     explained away without excuse by their servants, 
     <lb/>
     imported from England. Surprisingly enough 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Newfoundlander took this lying down, as he 
     <lb/>
     has learned to take quite a number of impositions

     during late years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now two members of the recent delegation 
     <lb/>
     have decided that, as elected members, they have 
     <lb/>
     the power to keep back knowledge from the very 
     <lb/>
     men that voted to send them to England. I was 
     <lb/>
     elected into a position of trust by my district as 
     <lb/>
     were all other members, and in such a position I 
     <lb/>
     demand here and now to know why two members 
     <lb/>
     have the right to withhold any knowledge that we 
     <lb/>
     sent them out to get.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, following the 
     <lb/>
     remarks a few moments ago by Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     I wonder if you would enlighten the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     as well as myself, on that part of the memoran<lb break="no"/>dum in which the British authorities were asked 
     <lb/>
     as to forms of government, and the answer you 
     <lb/>
     brought back that forms of government other than 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and retention of Com<lb break="no"/>mission could be recommended. What I want to 
     <lb/>
     know is, were federal unions discussed, and did 
     <lb/>
     you get permission, or were you advised that 
     <lb/>
     federal union is a proper form of government that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention could recommend? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not certain whether the 
     <lb/>
     term "federal union" was mentioned at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, confederation, or anything 
     <lb/>
     of that nature? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I cannot remember whether 
     <lb/>
     anything meaning that was discussed.... Probably 
     <lb/>
     some other gentleman can tell you that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The point raised by Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     was definitely dealt with by the delegation in the 
     <lb/>
     conversations, and that is one of the points which 
     <lb/>
     I made yesterday, that you cannot get a true 
     <lb/>
     perspective on that report without knowing ex<lb break="no"/>actly what was said. It is all very well for Lord 
     <lb/>
     Addison to sit down and write an answer to a 
     <lb/>
     question. It is quite another thing when that per<lb break="no"/>son is asking questions thereon and getting 
     <lb/>
     replies. I still maintain that the Convention 
     <lb/>
     which sent us over there should have the right of 
     <lb/>
     access to the conversations which took place 
     <lb/>
     between the delegates and Lord Addison and 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office. I say that with due regard to 
     <lb/>
     the rule made by you yesterday, and I have a right 
     <lb/>
     to disagree with any rule. I trust we are still 
     <lb/>
     democratic in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The simplest way is to ask 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office if there is any objection to the 
     <lb/>
     disclosure of that information. The arrangement 
     <lb/>
     was made that these documents would not be 


            <cb/>
          

     disclosed, and we cannot do so without the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the other party. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I maintain that that was only so that 
     <lb/>
     we could not have newspaper reporters in here. 
     <lb/>
     That was the meaning. It was never meant that 
     <lb/>
     the delegation which was sent over by this Con<lb break="no"/>vention should keep things from the members of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The only way is to enquire from 
     <lb/>
     Lord Addison what he meant. My clear under<lb break="no"/>standing is that these things were to be kept 
     <lb/>
     secret. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Have you read these yourself? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have never seen them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Might I suggest that before you 
     <lb/>
     give a final decision you peruse these 
     <lb/>
     stenographic notes? I am prepared after that to 
     <lb/>
     accept your ruling, if there is anything which you 
     <lb/>
     feel should not be put before the Convention, but 
     <lb/>
     not otherwise. I am not prepared to accept a ruling 
     <lb/>
     by anybody on something he does not know 
     <lb/>
     anything about, which he has never read. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been an impression given by some 
     <lb/>
     members which is wrong. Great Britain is not by 
     <lb/>
     any means starving. Great Britain is not on her 
     <lb/>
     back.... True, she is somewhat crippled and 
     <lb/>
     scarred and bruised, but when a country like 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain can, within the last two years, give 
     <lb/>
     out freely, and without any hope of ever getting 
     <lb/>
     it back, $300,000 million to various European 
     <lb/>
     and Asiatic countries, that country is not broke. 
     <lb/>
     It is merely a matter of the upsetting of curren<lb break="no"/>cy.... I don't want this Convention to get the idea 
     <lb/>
     that Great Britain is so poverty-stricken as some 
     <lb/>
     people would have you believe. I have every faith 
     <lb/>
     in the British Empire. I have no doubts whatso<lb break="no"/>ever that the empire to which we belong, and for 
     <lb/>
     which Kennedy and others of you fought, will not 
     <lb/>
     go down.... I referred yesterday to the treatment 
     <lb/>
     we got in 1933 to 1940. That is not the treatment 
     <lb/>
     of the English or Irish or Scotch people. It was 
     <lb/>
     the treatment of the people in Dominions Office, 
     <lb/>
     who know no more about this country than they 
     <lb/>
     know about Burma, India and other countries that 
     <lb/>
     have been under British rule. One man in that 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office wanted to know where we sent 
     <lb/>
     our saltfish — was it to Belgium or Holland? 
     <lb/>
     There's nothing wrong with the English, Irish or 
     <lb/>
     Scotch people. They know nothing whatever 
     <lb/>
     about the political position in this country. We 
     <lb/>
     have never publicised it enough ourselves. We 
   

            <pb n="567"

     have not gone in the right way about it to tell these 
     <lb/>
     people, our own kith and kin, what ignominy we 
     <lb/>
     have been subjected to in the past years. Don't 
     <lb/>
     get the idea that Great Britain, whom we are all 
     <lb/>
     prepared to love and serve and die for, is down 
     <lb/>
     and out, because mark you she will rise from that 
     <lb/>
     crippled state in which she at present finds her<lb break="no"/>self. All we need is for our people to get together 
     <lb/>
     and forget these petty little differences, and start 
     <lb/>
     to fight our own battles in our own way, and put 
     <lb/>
     men at the head of the government who know 
     <lb/>
     exactly what they are doing, good hard-headed 
     <lb/>
     businessmen — not mealy-mouthed politicians 
     <lb/>
     who think politics are so filthy and dirty that they 
     <lb/>
     would not touch it. No, you want hard-headed 
     <lb/>
     businessmen like Crosbie. I am not saying he 
     <lb/>
     would be any good there, but men like him, who 
     <lb/>
     would be prepared to fight. If you do fall by the 
     <lb/>
     wayside, Great Britain will be ready and willing 
     <lb/>
     to help. Please, I want to make that correction, 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain is still <hi rendition="simple:italic">Great</hi> Britain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> As I was the one who brought up 
     <lb/>
     the matter, I would like to have your ruling. Is it 
     <lb/>
     right and proper to say that members who have 
     <lb/>
     copies of this transcript might refer to them for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of refreshing their memories, and 
     <lb/>
     then they could answer?

     not as good, or our honour is not as good? I am 
     <lb/>
     sure the Dominions Office did not specify that 
     <lb/>
     that information should be kept from us. If every<lb break="no"/>thing else is outside our terms of reference. I think

     this is inside. I move that this information be

     have any objection. It seems a very grave ques<lb break="no"/>tion; either there was or was not an undertaking

     given to keep this private. If there was an under<lb break="no"/>taking we would disgrace ourselves if we com<lb break="no"/>mitted a breach of confidence.

     proceedings now in the possession of the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation be sent to the Dominions Office when 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Secretary, will you have the 
     <lb/>
     necessary copy prepared so that I can take it to 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency at the earliest possible moment? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Mr. Chairman, the situation is get<lb break="no"/>ting clearer. Bit by bit we are beginning to see 
     <lb/>just where our country stands. Slowly we are 
     <lb/>commencing to see the light. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I expect to see another depression in this 
     <lb/>
     country. All the figures and all the talk in the 
     <lb/>
     world is not going to drive it out of my mind that 
     <lb/>
     a depression will come upon us before many 
     <lb/>
     years are over. I do not believe that our present 
     <lb/>
     earning power is going to continue. In the past 
     <lb/>
     few years, thanks to the war, our country and our 
     <lb/>
     people have enjoyed greater prosperity than they 
     <lb/>
     ever dreamed of. Some prospered more than 
     <lb/>
     others, but all shared in the prosperity to some 
     <lb/>
     extent. I can see the handwriting on the wall — 
     <lb/>
     that prosperity is going to pass away. We have 
     <lb/>
     heard a lot of talk about our terms of reference. 
     <lb/>
     The most important words in those terms of ref<lb break="no"/>erence to my mind are these: "and bearing in 
     <lb/>
     mind the extent to which our prosperity is the 
     <lb/>
     result of the war." That is what we have to bear 
     <lb/>
     in mind all the time — that our present prosperity, 
     <lb/>
     such as it is, is the result of the war. The war is 
     <lb/>
     now over, or almost over, and the cause is 
     <lb/>
     removed, so the result will pass away also. We 
     <lb/>
     would not be very patriotic if we blinked these 
     <lb/>
     facts out of sight.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The time has not yet come for us to discuss 
     <lb/>
     forms of government. We are still trying to get all 
     <lb/>
     the facts we can, so that we can base our opinion 


            <pb n="568"

     on solid facts. That is why we sent this delegation 
     <lb/>
     to London We wanted to know just where we 
     <lb/>
     stood with the old country. Did they really mean 
     <lb/>
     it when they told us that we could vote for any 
     <lb/>
     form of government we liked? They told the 
     <lb/>
     delegation that we could vote for any form of 
     <lb/>
     government we liked. We wanted to know where 
     <lb/>
     we would stand if we voted for responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. They told the delegation that if we 
     <lb/>
     voted for responsible government we would be 
     <lb/>
     on our own so far as Britain is concerned. We 
     <lb/>
     wanted to know where we would stand if we 
     <lb/>
     voted for Commission government. They told the 
     <lb/>
     delegation that if we voted for Commission 
     <lb/>
     government they would continue to stand behind 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, when a man promises to do something 
     <lb/>
     for you, it's only common sense to take a look at 
     <lb/>
     his ability to do what he promises. He may make 
     <lb/>
     the promise in good faith and sincerity, but he 
     <lb/>
     may not be able to keep his promise. And so it is 


            <cb/>
         

     with Great Britain. She promises to help New<lb break="no"/>foundland if we need help in the future — 
     <lb/>
     provided we stay under Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment. But then we take a look at Britain's condi<lb break="no"/>tion, and we are very doubtful whether Britain 
     <lb/>
     would be able to give us any help for many years 
     <lb/>
     to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have very great doubt about Britain's ability 
     <lb/>
    to help this country. I have no doubt at all about 
     <lb/>her sincerity.... If I had to sum it all up, I would 
     <lb/>say that so far as Great Britain is concerned, this 
     <lb/>country is on its own right now. We' ll get <hi rendition="simple:italic">no</hi> help 
     <lb/>from Britain whatever form of government we 
     <lb/>may choose. We needed to have the information 
     <lb/>that the London delegation brought back to us, 
     <lb/>and at last we are beginning to know where we 
     <lb/>stand.

     with the exception of the reading of the final

     report from the Labrador Mining and Exploration

     Company of their work in the past year. I believe 
     <lb/>
     it is important to read it; and then all we have left

     is the summary of the Committee's report, and a

     have no desire to stop it from being read. With

     <lb/>
     the Imperial Institute of Mines in London, and 
     <lb/>
     that they did not take exception to the act. I took 
     <lb/>
     occasion when in London to visit South Ken- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sington, and I saw this Imperial Institute of 
     <lb/>
     Mines. The setup is this: they are partly financed 
     <lb/>
     by the imperial government and mostly by mini<lb break="no"/>ng interests. We were informed that this Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Institute was made up of Lord Somebody and the 
     <lb/>
     deputy minister of mines for each dominion. 
     <lb/>
     There is one deputy minister of mines on the 
     <lb/>
     board, and that is the deputy minister for Canada. 
     <lb/>
     There are no other officials on the board. I in<lb break="no"/>quired about the I944 act and the 1938 act.³ They 
     <lb/>
     knew nothing whatsoever. Neither act had been
