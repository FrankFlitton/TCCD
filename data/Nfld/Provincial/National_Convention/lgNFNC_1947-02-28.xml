<!-- GL, 2017-06-13, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     England at one stage there was a fine balance 
     <lb/>
     between agriculture and industry. Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     found she could make more money by going into 
     <lb/>
     industry to the neglect of agriculture. At the 
     <lb/>
     present time she is going back and spending a lot 
     <lb/>
     of money to try and build up her agricultural 
     <lb/>
     possibilities. It seems to me that if we could build 
     <lb/>
     up a lot of industries which would return to us 
     <lb/>
     greater wealth than farming, then maybe we 
     <lb/>
     should not do much farming. My opinion is that 
     <lb/>
     we should always do so much, because if one of 
     <lb/>
     your vital industries sadly failed, you would have 
     <lb/>
     something to fall back on. Do you not agree? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Definitely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> It is a question of the whole economy 
     <lb/>
     and stability. I believe in 1870, France, because 
     <lb/>
     of the fine balance between industry and agricul<lb break="no"/>ture, was able to pay off her debt to Germany and 
     <lb/>
     she came back quicker than if she had depended 
     <lb/>
     on industry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That is likely what is happening in 
     <lb/>
     England today. I am sure your Committee gave 
     <lb/>
     thought to the matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Yes, we thought of the soil which is 
     <lb/>
     rocky and rough; but you read the history of 
     <lb/>
     agriculture in Norway, and it is almost word for 
     <lb/>
     word the description of the soil in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     If you read the history of the founding of the New 
     <lb/>
     England states, almost word for word would be 
     <lb/>
     the language used about the soils when they took 
     <lb/>
     over first. It seems to the Committee we are 
     <lb/>
     starting agriculture 300 years too late. We have 
     <lb/>
     the advantage now, of course, we will be able to 
     <lb/>
     use modern machinery, whereas before, it was 
     <lb/>
     done by back-breaking work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Do you think we might be able to 
     <lb/>
     catch up? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Some people think we might be able 
     <lb/>
     to do much more than at the present time. We will 
     <lb/>
     in time compete in various fundamental items of 
     <lb/>
     agriculture 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Livestock? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Not for a long time. It might be pos<lb break="no"/>sible to rear calves for milk production and after<lb break="no"/>wards sell the cows. To go in for production on a 
     <lb/>
     big scale might be questionable. The same thing 
     <lb/>
     is true for sheep. A man has eight or ten sheep on 
     <lb/>
     a normal size farm; that can be worked all right; 
     <lb/>
     but to have sheep as acommercial proposition is 
     <lb/>
     not feasible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I could add to that. I was talking 
     <lb/>
     to a farmer in the west end of St. John's; he grew 
     <lb/>
     2,000 barrels of potatoes. He did not grow them 
     <lb/>
     on his own land, he did not have enough, but he 
     <lb/>
     got the use of two or three farms and he grew 
     <lb/>
     2,000 barrels, ... sold them and made money on 
     <lb/>
     them. He himself said the trouble is that if you 
     <lb/>
     plant out five or ten acres in potatoes, you have 
     <lb/>
     not got enough land to do it on a large scale. Your 
     <lb/>
     unit of production is very low; and your cost per 
     <lb/>
     bushel or barrel naturally is going to be high. You 
     <lb/>
     have to get a high price to make it pay. The only 
     <lb/>
     way to get a good price is through the customs 
     <lb/>
     tariff which will make the price of competing 
     <lb/>
     potatoes artificially higher. If you get away from 
     <lb/>
     the small unit, and turn out at the rate of 2,000 
     <lb/>
     barrels, you can make money....

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I do not wish to go into the merits 
     <lb/>or demerits of the resolution. I made some 
     <lb/>remarks relative to this on Wednesday.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> It is 
     <lb/>absolutely essential to get information which we 
     <lb/>have not been able to get from the authorities in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. I see no way except by direct 
     <lb/>contact between this Convention and the Govern<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
          
ment of the United Kingdom. The only way is by 
     <lb/>
     means of a duly appointed delegation from the 
     <lb/>
     Convention.... The resolution contravenes no 
     <lb/>
     constitutional right we possess by reason of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that we are a part of the British Empire. 
     <lb/>
     definitely governed by the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government through the Dominions Office and 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government. More than that, 
     <lb/>
     we have confirmation from the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government that we would be quite in order in 
     <lb/>
     appointing a delegation to interview His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government in Great Britain. I have 
     <lb/>
     the right to reply to any criticism. If any member 
     <lb/>
     wishes to make an amendment he can do so. I 
     <lb/>
     have great pleasure in moving the resolution. 
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I second the motion of the member for 
     <lb/>Grand Falls.... When this Convention opened, I 
     <lb/>put forward a notice of question concerning our 
     <lb/>national debt and the possible way of financing a 
     <lb/>reconstruction programme. I was not thinking in 
     <lb/>terms of asking Great Britain what she was going 
     <lb/>to do for us. It came from a mind which remem<lb break="no"/>bered how the debt had been built up; which had, 
     <lb/>I hope, a sense of perspective after reading New<lb break="no"/>foundland history; and which remembered a 
     <lb/>statement of an Englishman, who had read 
     <lb/>English and Newfoundland history, and said, "I 
     <lb/>would not like to have to decide whether England 
     <lb/>has been of more benefit to Newfoundland, than 
     <lb/>Newfoundland has been to England." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I had a whole series of questions, but older and 
     <lb/>
     more experienced men in the Convention and out 
     <lb/>
     of it, seemed to think the questions were of such 
     <lb/>
     vital importance that they would have to be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with seriously before the Convention closed and 
     <lb/>
     that I should leave them until a later date. I 
     <lb/>
     accepted the position. I think these men were 
     <lb/>
     right. The time has now come when these ques<lb break="no"/>tions will be put forward. A little later we had a 
     <lb/>
     discussion on the Interim Report of the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Committee. I said the question of how we should 
     <lb/>
     go about exploring the possibility of having some 
     <lb/>
     benefit accrue to Newfoundland, other than came 
     <lb/>
     from the construction and maintenance of bases, 
     <lb/>
     should be examined. Later still, I voted against 
     <lb/>
     sending a delegation to Canada to discuss federal 
     <lb/>
     union for two main reasons. Every instinct in me 
     <lb/>
     rebelled against even the possibility of creating 
     <lb/>
     the impression that this was an indication we had 
     <lb/>
     once again reverted to the status of supplicants. 
     <lb/>

<p>
     Secondly, I believed that we should, as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of common sense, know all about our own posi<lb break="no"/>tion before we went off discussing our affairs 
     <lb/>
     with another country, however friendly and 
     <lb/>
     neighbourly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then we got down to fact finding, and the 
     <lb/>
     issues referred to above were left in abeyance 
     <lb/>
     until the rather sudden appearance of Mr. Job's 
     <lb/>
     motion<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> which raised all three at once. I voted 
     <lb/>
     against that motion. I am proud of it. I would do 
     <lb/>
     it again. That motion should have been the one 
     <lb/>
     that is now before the Convention. If he had given 
     <lb/>
     any serious thought to the fact that the effective, 
     <lb/>
     real government of Newfoundland is in the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom, he would have realised that we 
     <lb/>
     ran the risk, by going to the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, of getting an answer to our ques<lb break="no"/>tions from the Commission itself and therefore 
     <lb/>
     limited; or made by the United Kingdom govern<lb break="no"/>ment through a third party and therefore limiting 
     <lb/>
     our chances of putting up our case face to face; 
     <lb/>
     that we may have run the risk of obtaining an 
     <lb/>
     opinion from the creator of the real government 
     <lb/>
     which the real government would have found it 
     <lb/>
     very embarrassing to reverse. Whoever made the 
     <lb/>
     final decision, we have accepted certain limita<lb break="no"/>tions. Take the case of the reason given for our 
     <lb/>
     not approaching the United States on the grounds 
     <lb/>
     of the present international tariff conference. I do 
     <lb/>
     not accept that suggestion and it is irrelevant. 
     <lb/>
     There is a clear case to be made for a separate 
     <lb/>
     negotiation, apart from the multilateral tariff ar<lb break="no"/>rangements whereby we give something for 
     <lb/>
     something. We have already given something 
     <lb/>
     and we ought to see what we can do about getting 
     <lb/>
     something in return. There is, however, that little 
     <lb/>
     phrase Mr. Miller used — "it is doubtful if it 
     <lb/>
     comes within our terms of reference." I am glad 
     <lb/>
     that the case is not entirely closed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to the motion, and the question 
     <lb/>
     of how we are going to approach this issue. I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt it will pass. I have no doubt Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain will give us all the facts we need. I am 
     <lb/>
     more concerned with the way in which we ap<lb break="no"/>proach the problem and the importance which we 
     <lb/>
     as representatives of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, approach the problem of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. This motion can be the instrument 
     <lb/>
     through which we can assert a statesmanlike ap<lb break="no"/>proach to larger issues which in the end may be 


            <cb/>
            
     of more importance than all we have done so far. 
     <lb/>
     I am not a man given to outbursts of patriotic 
     <lb/>
     fervour, but on this occasion I can say, as quietly 
     <lb/>
     as a big issue will allow, let us go forward proud 
     <lb/>
     of our honourable and great traditions but more 
     <lb/>
     determined that in our approach we will lay the 
     <lb/>
     groundwork for a bigger and a better New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I rise to support the motion. 1 am 
     <lb/>
     going to vote for it; I am enthusiastic about it. 
     <lb/>
     There is another matter relating to it that has 
     <lb/>
     something to do with the matter on which Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Butt ended — the approach to the government. I 
     <lb/>
     think that the statements and the attitude taken by 
     <lb/>
     this Convention towards that government and its 
     <lb/>
     associates are analogous. Statements which have 
     <lb/>
     been made throughout the session range all the 
     <lb/>
     way from comparatively mild references — such 
     <lb/>
     as not being willing to co-operate with us — to 
     <lb/>
     the one bearing on the expenditure the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is making this year, referring to it as "a 
     <lb/>
     deliberately planned campaign to bleed the finan<lb break="no"/>ces of this country" before they go out of office.... 
     <lb/>
     They were not altogether called for. If members 
     <lb/>
     wish to express their feelings in that way, they 
     <lb/>
     have a perfect right to do so. I respect their 
     <lb/>
     sincerity; they are just as sincere in what they are 
     <lb/>
     saying as I am in what I say now. I do not rise to 
     <lb/>
     object to that in the least. I do rise to declare 
     <lb/>
     myself, not in the spirit of being holler than thou, 
     <lb/>
     not in the spirit of having a better plan for the 
     <lb/>
     future of this country, but in a humble spirit to say 
     <lb/>
     to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador that 
     <lb/>
     I am not a part of that. I feel that though the 
     <lb/>
     relationship we have had with Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     throughout our history, including the past 12 or 
     <lb/>
     13 years, may not be all it might have been, these 
     <lb/>
     statements are not called for, and this approach is 
     <lb/>
     just not the proper one. I am not building up a 
     <lb/>
     case for Commission of Government. The kind 
     <lb/>
     of government which is going to get my vote is 
     <lb/>
     that in which the Newfoundland people are going 
     <lb/>
     to get a fair chance. If Commission is not the kind 
     <lb/>
     of government which the people want, then I am 
     <lb/>
     going to vote the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     out. I recognise something of the great value they 
     <lb/>
     have been to this country; I realise also the errors 
     <lb/>
     they made; I hope I can see the good with the bad. 
     <lb/>
     Now, if they go out, our ushering or kicking them 
     <lb/>
     out should not be done in just this way. It is not

     going to hurt them.... But it is going to hurt 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. If this goes on we will do an 
     <lb/>
     injustice that will take a long time to live down. 
 </p>

            <p>This delegation to be sent to England should 
     <lb/>not be put in the embarrassing position of going 
     <lb/>over there with the record of this Convention and 
     <lb/>some of the ungrateful and unkind remarks be<lb break="no"/>hind them, about the British government in its 
     <lb/>dealings with this country. We are not out of the 
     <lb/>woods yet. We might have to go to the British 
     <lb/>government again.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I believe in London there is 
     <lb/>information that this Convention needs to have 
     <lb/>and the people of Newfoundland need to have. I 
     <lb/>am very much in favour of sending a delegation 
     <lb/>to London to get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I think this is a move which should 
     <lb/>have been taken, not in 1947, but every year since 
     <lb/>1934. I fail to see how any country can govern 
     <lb/>another country without some connection be<lb break="no"/>tween.... I have listened carefully to the remarks 
     <lb/>of our learned friend from Labrador and I ap<lb break="no"/>preciate what he said. I honestly believe that what 
     <lb/>we have said here should have been said long 
     <lb/>before because — as I told His Excellency and as 
     <lb/>I told members of the Commission — the greatest 
     <lb/>crime that any nation can do against another 
     <lb/>nation is to take away from it something that men 
     <lb/>had given their very lives for, the right of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>government. For the sake of $2 a head, we lost 
     <lb/>that. There may be members who do not feel the 
     <lb/>way I feel about it, but I will never forgive the 
     <lb/>British government, whether Conservative, Tory 
     <lb/>or Labour for the wrong they have done in taking 
     <lb/>our liberty from us.... I have read the Amulree 
     <lb/>Report through 27 times. I am sure if everyone in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland had read that report they would 
     <lb/>have realised that our government should have 
     <lb/>been restored in 1942; now we find that Amulree 
     <lb/>had no right or authority to make the people of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland believe the things contained in 
     <lb/>this report, and it is nothing to our credit. Nobody 
     <lb/>has made any representations at all, and in fact 
     <lb/>the members who are in the British House of 
     <lb/>Commons today don't know what to do. Had 
     <lb/>there been six or seven men each year going over 
     <lb/>to the British House of Commons, and letting the 
     <lb/>people of Britain know what we want, it would

     <lb/>we have dwelt too long upon the fact that we have 
     <lb/>been given a rotten deal. A lot of our ancestors 
     <lb/>served in the Royal Navy and their naval salute 
     <lb/>comes from pulling the forelock. We have not got 
     <lb/>past that yet, we have not set it right. We should 
     <lb/>have been sending delegations over there the last 
     <lb/>12 or 13 years. I don't know how to approach the 
     <lb/>British government, but I believe we should go 
     <lb/>in and put our cards on the table, say what is on 
     <lb/>our minds; don't go into hysterics, but tell them 
     <lb/>what is what. Let us help this country have a

     least it's not what I want." Some of our profes<lb break="no"/>sional politicians are in for a rude jolt when the 
     <lb/>
     people next go to the polls. Iam not trying to build 
     <lb/>
     up a case for confederation, but the charge made 
     <lb/>
     by some few that there is not a strong sentiment 
     <lb/>
     in favour of union with Canada is fantastically 
     <lb/>
     unmre. If I were asked to voice an opinion I 
     <lb/>
     would content myself with saying that there is a 
     <lb/>
     strong warning of caution against a reversion to 
     <lb/>
     the unrestricted politics of the past. I know noth<lb break="no"/>ing of what confederation might offer. I have 
     <lb/>
     bothered very little about it, yet in fairness to a 
     <lb/>
     large minority of my intelligent fellow 
     <lb/>
     countrymen I would like to see the approach 
     <lb/>
     made to Ottawa, and if terms are offered it would 
     <lb/>
     be unfair to dispose of them without a thorough 
     <lb/>
     and honest examination. If they offer political 
     <lb/>
     stability and promise of future security, better 
     <lb/>
     things for Newfoundland, then they should go on 
     <lb/>
     the referendum next autumn.

     I am content to leave the ultimate choice of 
     <lb/>
     government to the intelligence of my fellow 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders. I would not dare suggest that 
     <lb/>
     this country has no choice but to accept literally

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Reading over this resolution, on 
     <lb/>
     the bottom of page I it says: "To send a delega<lb break="no"/>tion consisting of the Chairman and six of its 
     <lb/>
     members to the United Kingdom at the earliest 
     <lb/>
     possible moment..." I was under the impression, 
     <lb/>
     although it may have been altered since the 
     <lb/>
     original notice was given, that the question of 
     <lb/>
     time was to be set there. I don't want to compli<lb break="no"/>cate matters, but I wonder if the Chairman would 
     <lb/>
     state whether or not the delegation would proceed 
     <lb/>
     until all the reports had been tabled, except per<lb break="no"/>haps the economic side of the Financial Report.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yesterday, in consultation with 
     <lb/>
     the Steering Committee, Mr. Hollett decided to 
     <lb/>
     alterthe wording of his resolution somewhat. The 
     <lb/>
     motion before you now is the result. It is possible 
     <lb/>
     to amend that resolution. If you have any sugges<lb break="no"/>
         
<cb/>

     tions Mr. Hollett might be satisfied to incorporate 
     <lb/>
     them without the necessity of an amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suggest the use of"the earliest possible mo<lb break="no"/>ment" is very elastic, and it will be impossible to 
     <lb/>
     set a date until we receive a reply from the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government anyway. We must not get 
     <lb/>
     it in our heads that if we send this off tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     we are going to get a reply the next day. It may 
     <lb/>
     be a week or two and in the meantime I think the 
     <lb/>
     bulk ofour reports will be concluded. The Steer<lb break="no"/>ing Committee has work to do before the delega» 
     <lb/>
     tion can go at all. However, the matter is for you 
     <lb/>
     to decide; Ijust suggest these considerations for 
     <lb/>
     thought, but the Convention must do as it pleases. 
    </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The phrase was purposely left more 
     <lb/>or less elastic. We could not say whether or not 
     <lb/>the Convention would be satisfied to allow a 
     <lb/>delegation to proceed to Great Britain before all 
     <lb/>the reports were in. It was felt by some that 
     <lb/>possibly if we had the meat out of these reports 
     <lb/>which have not yet been filed, and had the finan<lb break="no"/>cial side of the Financial Report and not the 
     <lb/>economic, that the Convention might allow the 
     <lb/>delegation to proceed as soon as word was 
     <lb/>received. The government of Great Britain is a 
     <lb/>pretty busy organisation and would want to fix 
     <lb/>the date when they would receive us. If we em<lb break="no"/>body a statement saying that the delegation 
     <lb/>should not proceed until all the reports were in it 
     <lb/>would be impossible for them to fix a set date. I 
     <lb/>felt that if we made it elastic then if we got 
     <lb/>permission to send a delegation with the reports 
     <lb/>already in and the meat out of the others, and the 
     <lb/>financial side of Major Cashin's report, then I 
     <lb/>think that we might be prepared to go. We will 
     <lb/>have to have sessions, without the microphones, 
     <lb/>to draw up the questions which will be asked. If 
     <lb/>Mr. Higgins and Mr. Job will suggest some 
     <lb/>amendment I will be perfectly happy to have it

     Resolved that the National Convention

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I believe that in Ottawa there is

     information that this Convention needs to have,

     <lb/>
     want to have. I believe that a delegation ought to

     go and get it if they will receive the delegation.

     However, the delegation to London should go

     first, and return to bring its report before the

     <lb/>before the Chair, I want to clean up this insidious 
     <lb/>propaganda that is going on inside and outside 
     <lb/>this House. I have been accused of being anti- 
     <lb break="yes"/>British, and I want to tell those individuals who 
     <lb/>make such vile accusations that they must be 
     <lb/>possessed of very diseased minds. I want to point 
     <lb/>out that some 32 or 33 years ago I offered my 
     <lb/>service to King and country in western Canada; 
     <lb/>1 was young at the time and my father telegraphed 
     <lb/>me and suggested that I return and join the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Regiment. which I did. I went over<lb break="no"/>seas, and my friend across the way here, Sergeant 
     <lb/>Northcott, went overseas at the same time.... Fol<lb break="no"/>lowing that I commanded a unit of an English 
     <lb/>regiment on the other side, and still it is in<lb break="no"/>sinuated that I am anti-British. Also, in the last 
     <lb/>war, although well over 50, I offered my services 
     <lb/>and took a contingent across from Canada, but on 
     <lb/>account of my age I had to get out. If I hear any 
     <lb/>more of this I am going to take further steps, not 
     <lb/>in this House, but outside of it.

            <p>
     Now with regard to the motion. I have from 
     <lb/>
     the beginning been an exponent of a return to 
     <lb/>
     responsible government based upon the choice of 
     <lb/>
     the people. But before we discuss this I want to 
     <lb/>
     place myself on record as still retaining that view, 
     <lb/>
     and consequently I feel that I will probably have 
     <lb/>
     to bore the House somewhat, and I trust they will 
     <lb/>
     excuse me. Go back to 1932. I have here the 
     <lb/>
     manifesto of the Prime Minister<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> of that year to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland. In this document on 
     <lb/>
     page 6, I will just read it: "The trouble indicates 
     <lb/>
     the only remedy. Confidence in this country and 
     <lb/>
     its administration must be restored. Government 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     must see an end to the extravagance and waste of 
     <lb/>
     recent years. I undertake that with the return of 
     <lb/>
     my party that result will follow. I am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that it will be possible to obtain the financial 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     second last paragraph of that historic document. 
     <lb/>
     "Before concluding, let me repeat the pledge 
     <lb/>
     recently made through the daily press, that one of 
     <lb/>
     my first acts will be the appointment of a com<lb break="no"/>mittee, the members of which will serve without

     remuneration, to enquire into the desirability and 
     <lb/>
     feasibility of placing the country under a form of 
     <lb/>
     commission government for a period of years. In 
     <lb/>
     case the proposal is favourably reported upon, it

     will then be submitted to the electorate for their

     first have the consent of the people."

            </p>

            <p>
     That is a definite pledge to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country. On that pledge that party was elected to 
     <lb/>
     office. They carried out the first part of the pro<lb break="no"/>gram. A royal commission was appointed, came 
     <lb/>
     here in February or March 1933, made certain 
     <lb/>
     enquiries into the affairs of the country, official<lb break="no"/>ly, economically, personal and everything else. 
     <lb/>
     On February 28, 1933, the same gentleman, now 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister, introduced a resolution 
     <lb/>
     which I am not going to bore you by reading: It 
     <lb/>
     is interesting to note extracts from his talk on that 
     <lb/>
     momentous occasion. He said, "We are a part of 
     <lb/>
     the British Commonwealth of Nations and it is a 
     <lb/>
     proud boast that no British Dominion ever went 
     <lb/>
     back on its pledged word. Are we to be the first? 
     <lb/>
     What will it profit us if we retain responsible 
     <lb/>
     government and lose our souls, our honour, in the 
     <lb/>
     end?" Mr. Alderdice said — and I want this to be 
     <lb/>
     listened to attentively — he had always felt that 
     <lb/>
     after all the vote was a theoretical thing and not 
     <lb/>
     all that it was cracked up to be. He said, "In the 
     <lb/>
     new form" — meaning the Commission — "not 
     <lb/>
     one man will know the difference and he could 
     <lb/>
     see as a result of it more prosperity in the 
     <lb/>
     country." He could see more capital invested 
     <lb/>
     because capitalists would see they are taking no 
     <lb/>
     chances. Commenting on the conversion of our 
     <lb/>
     debt to 3% he said, "The United Kingdom

     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom give us a large share of 
     <lb/>
     their orders for ore. This means a prosperous 
     <lb/>
     Conception Bay. She will see thatour codfish 
     <lb/>
     gets preference in British mandated territory." He 
     <lb/>
     wound up his remarks on this famous or infamous 
     <lb/>
     resolution: "And finally I speak on behalf of all 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders when I say that we thank His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     for the generous offer that they have made to us 
     <lb/>
     in our extremity. We are grateful for the promised 
     <lb/>
     development of our resources; we trust implicitly 
     <lb/>
     in their honourable intentions, feeling confident 
     <lb/>
     that a full measure of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     will be restored to the island when we have been 
     <lb/>
     placed upon a self-supporting basis and we fully, 
     <lb/>
     frankly and freely accept the Report and the 
     <lb/>
     conditions laid down in the White Paper and 
     <lb/>
     subscribe to the Address, the adoption of which 
     <lb/>
     I have now the honour to move." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These words speak for themselves. These 
     <lb/>
     resolutions were passed on November 29 or 30, 
     <lb/>
     1933. The people were given to understand that 
     <lb/>
     certain things were going to happen. I defy any 
     <lb/>
     man to get up here or anywhere else and say one 
     <lb/>
     of these pledges was carried out. What hap<lb break="no"/>pened? You, sir, as leader of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     asked that the resolution be deferred for a week. 
     <lb/>
     That was refused. You moved many amend<lb break="no"/>ments. All were turned down. After this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion had been passed, and the Address to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty forwarded, the British Parliament intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Newfoundland Act confirming these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, in which it was stated that as soon as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland became self-supporting and upon 
     <lb/>
     request of the people, responsible government 
     <lb/>
     would be restored. That legislation was passed in 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain during the early part of December, 
     <lb/>
     1933; and as pointed out by my friend Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett, the Commission government was in<lb break="no"/>augurated, with pomp and ceremony, on l4 
     <lb/>
     February, 1934. Every man who voted for that 
     <lb/>
     legislation, particularly those who were paid off 
     <lb/>
     with jobs, understood definitely that as soon as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland became self-supporting, respon<lb break="no"/>sible government would be restored. However I 
     <lb/>
     state authoritatively that Newfoundland suffered 
     <lb/>
     more hardship and privation than any time in its 
     <lb/>
     history. And, despite what my friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labrador has said, we have nothing to be grateful

     for to the United Kingdom during that period.... 
     <lb/>
     Why therefore should I apologise? I am pro- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Newfoundland. I am not anti-British. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the early stages of this Convention, when 
     <lb/>
     this confederation matter came up, we passed an 
     <lb/>
     amendment to a resolution brought in by the 
     <lb/>
     member forBonavista Centre that until all reports 
     <lb/>
     were prepared, there would be no discussion or 
     <lb/>
     conversation regarding sending a delegation out<lb break="no"/>side the country. These reports cannot be 
     <lb/>
     prepared until we get information from the 
     <lb/>
     government in the United Kingdom, because the 
     <lb/>
     Commission is not the government. We have 
     <lb/>
     asked the Commission government for definite 
     <lb/>
     information regarding the economic condition of 
     <lb/>
     this country — they have refused that informa<lb break="no"/>tion. We have to go to the only place we can get 
     <lb/>
     it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After Mr. Penney's amendment was passed, 
     <lb/>
     we went along fairly smoothly. Finally we come 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Job's motion<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> that we go to Government 
     <lb/>
     House to have a discussion with the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. I voted against it. I explained my 
     <lb/>
     position in a few remarks which were evidently 
     <lb/>
     construed that I was trying to hold up the work of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention. But Mr. Job brought in a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion of some kind regarding the same matter and 
     <lb/>
     it was kicked out. We get back from the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government the answer that we cannot deal 
     <lb/>
     with the United States — it is a matter for 
     <lb/>
     diplomatic negotiations. We agreed on that. We 
     <lb/>
     get the answer that they are prepared to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office or the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government whether they would receive a 
     <lb/>
     delegation from this Convention to discuss mat<lb break="no"/>ters, and also they would be prepared to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government whether they would be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to receive a delegation — not to get or 
     <lb/>
     discuss terms, because the answer distinctly 
     <lb/>
     states we have no authority to discuss fiscal, 
     <lb/>
     financial or economic matters, As I see it, the 
     <lb/>
     delegation going to Ottawa would mean going up 
     <lb/>
     as postage stamps. We meet the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     and say, "We are here to find out if you have any 
     <lb/>
     offer to make regarding confederation." The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of Canada says, "Here, you take 
     <lb/>
     that and bring it back. You cannot open it and say 
     <lb/>
     whether or not you accept it." We have no 
     <lb/>
     authority. There is only one authority — a New<lb break="no"/>foundland government has power to discuss con<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
        
federation on behalf of Newfoundland because in 
     <lb/>
     1940-41 they took bases and gave them away to 
     <lb/>
     the American government for nothing. If they 
     <lb/>
     have power to do that, they also have power to 
     <lb/>
     give the country away tomorrow. Therefore as far 
     <lb/>
     as the delegation to Ottawa is concerned, I am 
     <lb/>
     voting against that motion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reading the manifesto of Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     Alderdice and after the assumption of office of 
     <lb/>
     Commission government, the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country, particularly those in Conception Bay, 
     <lb/>
     felt they would never see another hungry day. We 
     <lb/>
     were going to sell all the ore; capital was coming 
     <lb/>
     into the country; all the money was going to be 
     <lb/>
     protected — everything that did come in was well 
     <lb/>
     protected — and finally we arrive down to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. How are we going about the fixing- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     up of Newfoundland? I have stated that it was 
     <lb/>
     designed to keep the Commission in office so 
     <lb/>
     they could dissipate the treasury and clean out the 
     <lb/>
     balance, and l defy any man to bring evidence 
     <lb/>
     that that is not so.... When I am asked what 
     <lb/>
     evidence I have, my reply is to ask the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner for Finance — he told me so. I repeat, the 
     <lb/>
     treasury is being cleaned out deliberately. I make 
     <lb/>
     a further forecast, that the policy of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is to clean out the $22 million in the Bank 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal belonging to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the $10-12 million on the other 
     <lb/>
     side belonging to us.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This delegation to Ottawa is entirely unneces<lb break="no"/>sary. When the delegation comes back from 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, then will be the time to decide 
     <lb/>
     whether or not a delegation should go to Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     If that delegation comes back from Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     empty-handed; if they say we refuse to cancel any 
     <lb/>
     portion of your national debt because of your 
     <lb/>
     bases — which they gave away for nothing while 
     <lb/>
     acting as trustees. Your legal mind tells you that 
     <lb/>
     when anyone dissipates the assets of a trust he 
     <lb/>
     goes to jail. What would you say to a government 
     <lb/>
     acting as trustee of the assets of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     which takes those assets and gives them away for 
     <lb/>
     nothing? True, our people got work out of it, and 
     <lb/>
     some people are so pro-British and anti-New<lb break="no"/>foundland they say our people are not entitled to 
     <lb/>
     get the same rates of pay as Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     American workmen. They restricted the rates of 
     <lb/>
     pay, using the excuse that it would upset the 
     <lb/>
     economy, when merchants on Water Street were

     paying more than some of the men were getting 
     <lb/>
     on the bases.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I say Newfoundland is entitled to the cancel<lb break="no"/>lation of that sterling debt.<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> What does it amount 
     <lb/>
     to? Let us look at the debt of Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     date — extemal debt; $72 million against which 
     <lb/>
     there is approximately $8 million in the sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund, $64 million; $12 million more over there 
     <lb/>
     belong to it, $52 million; $22 million down in the 
     <lb/>
     bank belongs to the people of Newfoundland — 
     <lb/>
     down to $32 million; $6-7 million that we owe 
     <lb/>
     here locally — say $40 million net national debt. 
     <lb/>
     The wealthiest country in the world per capita, 
     <lb/>
     less than a $150 a head. Let us take the other 
     <lb/>
     countries. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, for bring<lb break="no"/>ing in parts of the Financial Report, but I can't 
     <lb/>
     help it. This is an historic time in the country. And 
     <lb/>
     I want to say, Mr. Chairman, that I'm not yet 
     <lb/>
     prepared to accept the position offered me in<lb break="no"/>directly some time ago, of Sergeant-at-Arms in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons in Ottawa. What is the 
     <lb/>
     position? $40 million debt —- $150 a head. We 
     <lb/>
     go up to our friends in Ottawa. What's their 
     <lb/>
     position? $1,380 a head. We go across to Uncle 
     <lb/>
     Sam, $1,800 and odd a head. We go across to the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom, over $1,900 a head.... Now that 
     <lb/>
     is the position, and going off begging, knowing 
     <lb/>
     that this country is self-supporting. I maintain 
     <lb/>
     that if this country is self-supporting, it's only 
     <lb/>
     humiliating itself to go to outsiders and say, 
     <lb/>
     "What are you going to offer for the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     taking over our customs revenue and govern<lb break="no"/>ment?" I would not ask them. It is time enough if 
     <lb/>
     we are hard up, particularly in view of that scur<lb break="no"/>rilous attack made on Newfoundland by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa Journal</hi>:

     In my opinion, what is contained in that

     rather than to eat, some are perhaps beginning to 
     <lb/>
     wonder if I have retreated to the position where I 
     <lb/>
     am prepared to be content with two square meals 
     <lb/>
     a day for all instead of three, and with a suit of 
     <lb/>
     clothes somewhat patched and a roof that leaks 
     <lb/>
     just a little. The contrary is the case. I have been 
   

            <cb/>
         

     hearing so much about the brightness and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity which lie ahead that I have been 
     <lb/>
     seriously thinking of upping the minimum re<lb break="no"/>quirements to three square meals a day, a mug-up 
     <lb/>
     going to bed, and two pair of pants with every 
     <lb/>
     suit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I support the motion, because I cannot see how 
     <lb/>
     in conscience I can do anything else —- not<lb break="no"/>withstanding all the ranting and roaring like true 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders that has gone on and all the 
     <lb/>
     hysterics that have been engaged in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For all of us this is the year of consummation 
     <lb/>
     of a most important mission. For all New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders it may well prove to be a year of 
     <lb/>
     momentous decision — of conclusions as will 
     <lb/>
     determine the shape of things to come in this 
     <lb/>
     island for longer than we all shall live. We have 
     <lb/>
     come upon an opportunity unique in the history 
     <lb/>
     of empire, unique, perhaps, in the history of the 
     <lb/>
     world, without passion, without prejudice, 
     <lb/>
     without fear, to take the measure of what our 
     <lb/>
     resources in natural wealth and manhood will 
     <lb/>
     permit us to rise to — and then to shape the future 
     <lb/>
     to the best advantage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At least this once, I hope, the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will be advised of all the facts, and 
     <lb/>
     then will be left to decide for themselves. I hope 
     <lb/>
     nobody with an axe to grind will try to hold the 
     <lb/>
     noses of Newfoundlanders and try to cram down 
     <lb/>
     their throats the particular form of government 
     <lb/>
     that he wants as a grindstone.... God grant that we 
     <lb/>
     shall measure up in this day and generation to the 
     <lb/>
     making of the most of this greatest opportunity 
     <lb/>
     that has ever come to any people. I can hardly 
     <lb/>
     imagine that any man or group of men would be 
     <lb/>
     so utterly foul as to want to interpose his or their 
     <lb/>
     private plans between this opportunity and the 
     <lb/>
     making of the most of it. I can hardly conceive 
     <lb/>
     that any would deliberately and with malice 
     <lb/>
     aforethought, seek the accomplishment of their 
     <lb/>
     own designs at the sacrifice of all the moment 
     <lb/>
     offers. But if such were to rise, they could be 
     <lb/>
     eternally certain that their memories would be 
     <lb/>
     cursed forever more by every succeeding genera<lb break="no"/>tion of Newfoundlanders....

     tial task to perform. We are here by the will of the 
     <lb/>
     people, not by gratuitous assumption of our own 
     <lb/>
     capacity to perform the work that we have in 
     <lb/>
     hand. However we must not forget that it is of 
     <lb/>
     essence of the endeavour to which we are com<lb break="no"/>mitted that it should be debated with open mind 
     <lb/>
     and utter impartiality. I should not be prepared to 
     <lb/>
     see the condition of approach to the matter that 
     <lb/>
     we have in hand altered by anything short of an 
     <lb/>
     act of God. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I support the motion because I am concerned 
     <lb/>
     primarily with the best arrangement with regard 
     <lb/>
     to government that we can make for the future. 
     <lb/>
     And that arrangement will be the one that would 
     <lb/>
     seem to offer us the best chance to eat as well as 
     <lb/>
     to vote. I do think that there are people left who 
     <lb/>
     think that it is of some importance to be con<lb break="no"/>cerned with eating ... people isolated in many 
     <lb/>
     places who are not quite certain of their meal 
     <lb/>
     ticket for the next decade, and whilst I would 
     <lb/>
     hesitate to say that these people think food is 
     <lb/>
     more important than votes, I think that they 
     <lb/>
     would decidedly like to have their breakfasts on 
     <lb/>
     the morning they go out to vote for their favourite 
     <lb/>
     politician. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To some it may seem a truly strange form of 
     <lb/>
     political thought to drag food into politics, to 
     <lb/>
     speak of stomachs in the same breath as ballot 
     <lb/>
     boxes, to assert that to eat is as important as to 
     <lb/>
     vote. But those who have followed through his<lb break="no"/>tory the impact of hunger upon the body politic 
     <lb/>
     will find nothing so very strange in all that. Those 
     <lb/>
     who know history know, for instance, that all the 
     <lb/>
     great revolutions began in the pits of men's 
     <lb/>
     stomachs. And history has a habit of repeating 
     <lb/>
     itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do find, however, that those who talk of 
     <lb/>
     strange forms of political thought do seem to 
     <lb/>
     become somewhat inconsistent in their thinking 
     <lb/>
     when they come across some utterances bearing 
     <lb/>
     upon the economic that seem to serve their pur<lb break="no"/>poses. Thus it does seem a strange inconsistency 
     <lb/>
     that can attribute bad faith to the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment in setting up this Convention, yet can im<lb break="no"/>mediately change when the representatives of that 
     <lb/>
     government suggest that we are self-supporting.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be well that the problem of New<lb break="no"/>foundland cannot be dealt with as a problem in 
     <lb/>
     mathematics, that the question of self-support 
     <lb/>
     cannot be resolved by the rule of three. We should 
     <lb/>
     consequently not hazard the resolution by the rule 
    

            <cb/>
         

     of thumb. And so we shall have to exercise a little 
     <lb/>
     more than snapjudgement in the matter. It would 
     <lb/>
     not contribute to our prestige if we were to troop 
     <lb/>
     down the front steps outside someday singing, 
     <lb/>
     "Let all the people rejoice; you are hereby 
     <lb/>
     declared to be self-supporting again", only to be 
     <lb/>
     met at the bottom by one of those who are again 
     <lb/>
     on the dole holding out his hand.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Just to keep the record straight I should like to 
     <lb/>
     make it clear that I am not one of those who 
     <lb/>
     believe it is the duty of government to wind the 
     <lb/>
     life of the individual in a cocoon of economic 
     <lb/>
     security. But I am one of those who believes that 
     <lb/>
     this minimum all men may demand of life — the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity through honest effort to make a 
     <lb/>
     decent living according to the standards of his 
     <lb/>
     times, and not on the basis that what was good 
     <lb/>
     enough for his grandfather should be good 
     <lb/>
     enough for him.... And ifyou say that not all men 
     <lb/>
     can have that, then I shall have to ask you just 
     <lb/>
     what men are you going to require to be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with just how much less? The giving of such an 
     <lb/>
     answer might well serve to demonstrate the ur<lb break="no"/>gency of the economic to any Doubting Thomas 
     <lb/>
     politician who would care to undertake the giving 
     <lb/>
     of such answer the night immediately before an 
     <lb/>
     election.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The best political arrangement for New<lb break="no"/>foundland is the one that will make for the 
     <lb/>
     greatest measure of civic liberty coincident with 
     <lb/>
     the greatest opportunity for all to come by three 
     <lb/>
     square meals a day and a decent suit of clothes on 
     <lb/>
     the back, and a tight roof over the head. And I feel 
     <lb/>
     quite confident that out of the choices presented 
     <lb/>
     to them the people will decide for that political 
     <lb/>
     form most likely to have such result. And so I 
     <lb/>
     repeat we are committed to assist the people to 
     <lb/>
     make such choice. As a matter of fact we oursel<lb break="no"/>ves have no choice in the matter. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     the ultimate position is as simple as this: even if 
     <lb/>
     there should be but one man in this island who 
     <lb/>
     wants to hear the terms of confederation he is 
     <lb/>
     entitled to hear them — even if that one solitary 
     <lb/>
     individual should happen to be Mr. Joseph 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. Even if there should be but one man 
     <lb/>
     on this island who wants return of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government to appear on the referendum ballot 
     <lb/>
     paper he is entitled to have it appear thereon — 
     <lb/>
     even if that solitary individual should happen to 
     <lb/>
     be Major Peter Cashin. And this too, gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     — if there should be but one man in this island

     who wants to have an opportunity to vote for 
     <lb/>
     retention of Commission of Government or some 
     <lb/>
     modification of it — he is entitled to have that 
     <lb/>
     chance, even if he should happen to be my last 
     <lb/>
     forgotten fisherman on the Bill of Cape St. 
     <lb/>
     George. And I do hereby give solemn warning to 
     <lb/>
     the members of this Convention that the names 
     <lb/>
     of all of us will go down to historic dishonour, if 
     <lb/>
     we do not prove as solicitous for the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     that last forgotten fisherman on the Bill of Cape 
     <lb/>
     St. George, as for the wishes of Mr. Joseph 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, or Major Peter Cashin or anybody 
     <lb/>
     else in this Convention or anybody else in this 
     <lb/>
     island. On that score too, Mr. Chairman, we who 
     <lb/>
     are gathered here cannot escape the verdict of 
     <lb/>
     history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> ....I support both the spirit and words 
     <lb/>
     of this motion. When it first came in my mind to 
     <lb/>
     represent the district of Trinity North the sending 
     <lb/>
     of certain delegations seemed to me unavoidable. 
     <lb/>
     Now some have suggested leaving the matter of 
     <lb/>
     a delegation to Ottawa until the results of a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to England are examined. They argue 
     <lb/>
     that the terms from England may be so good that 
     <lb/>
     it may not be necessary to send a delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. I can do no more than assure this Con<lb break="no"/>vention that there is no member here more 
     <lb/>
     anxious to find that this may be so. If it is, what 
     <lb/>
     has anyone opposed to it got to worry about, 
     <lb/>
     because the people of Newfoundland, you can 
     <lb/>
     rest assured, will vote for what in their opinion 
     <lb/>
     they consider best.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going to take up any more of our 
     <lb/>
     valuable time than is really necessary, but I 
     <lb/>
     would just take you back for a few moments to 
     <lb/>
     1932. Iwas the only independent candidate in the 
     <lb/>
     1932 election. Just prior to going to the district a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who is now living, and undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     will hear my voice tonight, gave me a letter of 
     <lb/>
     introduction to go to the then acting Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, with the suggestion that I go to the same 
     <lb/>
     district that I eventually faced but for that party. 
     <lb/>
     I spent about two hours in that interview, and 
     <lb/>
     asked for their platform as a result of my deter<lb break="no"/>mination to do all possible to prevent New<lb break="no"/>foundland from losing her franchise. I told that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman,<ref target="#fn_13">[1]</ref> who is now passed on, that I 
     <lb/>
     regretted that I could not, under any circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces accept his offer, but was going to face the 
 

            <cb/>
            

     District of Trinity North as an independent. I was 
     <lb/>
     not admired by my own family or friends for 
     <lb/>
     taking such a stand. It is well remembered in the 
     <lb/>
     District of Trinity North that I said from every 
     <lb/>
     platform that I stood on, that they were going to 
     <lb/>
     be sold like cattle on the auction block. I had as 
     <lb/>
     my authority the well-remembered words of the 
     <lb/>
     acting Prime Minister, when he assured me that 
     <lb/>
     he could not take the risk of going back to the 
     <lb/>
     people, that the Prime Minister that he had suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded<ref target="#fn_14">[2]</ref> could not under any circumstances be 
     <lb/>
     given charge of this country again, he was 
     <lb/>
     branded as a crook. He came to the railway 
     <lb/>
     station when I went out with my manifesto, and 
     <lb/>
     he asked me to destroy it and come back and have 
     <lb/>
     another one printed. He followed me in his car to 
     <lb/>
     Manuels and I still refused, and I have never 
     <lb/>
     regretted it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as Commission of Government is con<lb break="no"/>cerned I have tried to give them full credit for 
     <lb/>
     everything they have done. I took the trouble to 
     <lb/>
     write them a letter a few days ago congratulating 
     <lb/>
     them in connection with what they have done for 
     <lb/>
     the farmers of this country. Everything good I 
     <lb/>
     have seen I have taken occasion to remind them 
     <lb/>
     of it, and everything they did to the detriment of 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country and their liberty as well. 
     <lb/>
     I have never felt that those who associated with 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government went with that 
     <lb/>
     body for any other reason except to enrich their 
     <lb/>
     pockets at the expense of the people. I remind this 
     <lb/>
     House that as a much younger man than the 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who spoke a few minutes ago I served 
     <lb/>
     in the first war, and was held up on account of my 
     <lb/>
     age in the last war, being wounded at least four 
     <lb/>
     times in both wars. But as sure as I gave all I had 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of saving this island home, just as 
     <lb/>
     sure I would most willingly give all that's left of 
     <lb/>
     me for what I consider to be the best for this 
     <lb/>
     country. I have been dragged through the mud by 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government. They have at<lb break="no"/>tempted to bribe me (I hope they are listening). 
     <lb/>
     As long as I hold my head up I will defend this 
     <lb/>
     country in the way I think will be to the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of the people coming after me. My boys 
     <lb/>
     served in the war as well as myself, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     have to make any apology for saying this, and I 
     <lb/>
     hope no one who thinks differently towards this 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     motion of even date shall have returned from 
     <lb/>
     London and submitted its report to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, but not before." Does that make the same

     idea?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, quite acceptable. There is a 
     <lb/>
     possibility, and it may not be a remote one, that 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom government will say, "We 
     <lb/>
     can answer these questions without having you 
     <lb/>
     fellows come over here, and answer them in black 
     <lb/>
     and white." As the motion of the member from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre expresses it, his delegation will 
     <lb/>
     go to Canada whether or not there is one going to 
     <lb/>
     England. I would like to make sure of this be<lb break="no"/>cause I can't express here now what I feel about 
     <lb/>
     the matter, but I have my doubts about some<lb break="no"/>thing. While I am on my feet, if you will permit 


            <cb/>


     me I will speak to the motion under considera<lb break="no"/>tion, but before that I would like to say that I, too, 
     <lb/>
     have felt the cold icy blast from Labrador this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Will you permit me to get this 
     <lb/>
     quite straight now. Mr. Hollett suggests all the 
     <lb/>
     words after "the" in the last paragraph of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's resolution should be stricken out, 
     <lb/>
     and the following substituted therefore: "return 
     <lb/>
     of the delegation elected pursuant to the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion proposed by Mr. Hollett and adopted by this 
     <lb/>
     Convention on this date, but not before." Now 
     <lb/>
     that's acceptable to you, Mr. Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Hon. Mr. Job, is it acceptable to 
     <lb/>
     you? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Thank you. it now reads as it has 
     <lb/>
     been amended, and that now stands as the original

     motion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. I do feel somewhat as though I were 
     <lb/>
     included in the expressions used by my friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labrador this afternoon relative to certain 
     <lb/>
     things that may have been said in this assembly 
     <lb/>
     with regard to, as he said, the British people. 
     <lb/>
     There is no greater admirer in this assembly than 
     <lb/>
     myself of the British people as such, but I do not 
     <lb/>
     regard Dominions Office as truly representing 
     <lb/>
     the British people so far as Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     concerned. Any remarks I have made which may 
     <lb/>
     appear derogatory to the Dominions Office do 
     <lb/>
     not apply to the British people; like Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, I have given of my body for the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, and when we meet here to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the future of Newfoundland we are not 
     <lb/>
     going to be so very particular about some of the 
     <lb/>
     things we say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This afternoon there was a resolution passed 
     <lb/>
     that we send a delegation to Great Britain to 
     <lb/>
     interview the British government and not the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office. I would not be surprised if we 
     <lb/>
     did land in the Dominions Office, but I want it 
     <lb/>
     clearly understood that any delegation has not got 
     <lb/>
     to go over there with their fingers in their mouths, 
     <lb/>
     or in the conciliatory spirit that was proposed by 
     <lb/>
     my friend from Labrador. That delegation is not 
     <lb/>
     going to look for anything which it does not 
     <lb/>
     deserve. We are not going begging, and the 
     <lb/>
     delegation will not go in a conciliatory mood but

     in a fighting mood.... I realise I have said some 
     <lb/>
     things concerning these matters, but I meant them 
     <lb/>
     and I believe they were true and I have a right to 
     <lb/>
     stand up and express my opinion without having 
     <lb/>
     someone jump up and reflect on something I have 
     <lb/>
     said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to this particular motion, you 
     <lb/>
     know I have repeatedly expressed the idea that 
     <lb/>
     we have no mandate whatever to go to Canada 
     <lb/>
     and look for terms, no mandate under the Con<lb break="no"/>vention Act. Before you take any drastic steps 
     <lb/>
     with regard to any change in the constitution, you 
     <lb/>
     must have the mandated power of the people 
     <lb/>
     behind you. You cannot sneak in the back door 
     <lb/>
     as this is an attempt to do. I have nothing against 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian people or government; I have no 
     <lb/>
     objections to going into confederation, when and 
     <lb/>
     only when our people have been given an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to say definitely that that is what they want 
     <lb/>
     I must stand by that strongly. We are told by the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government we cannot talk fis<lb break="no"/>cal things; we cannot talk on economic matters; 
     <lb/>
     we cannot bring up politics. How can we possibly 
     <lb/>
     go to the Dominion of Canada to look for terms 
     <lb/>
     if you cannot talk fiscal things, economic matters 
     <lb/>
     or politics? Is the committee or government so 
     <lb/>
     anxious because they know they have some very 
     <lb/>
     attractive terms to lay before us? I fail to see what 
     <lb/>
     good can be derived by any approach to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government by a delegation from this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. The Department of External Affairs 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa is the department with which a delega<lb break="no"/>tion would have to deal; I fail to see how they can 
     <lb/>
     possibly talk to a delegation from here if they 
     <lb/>
     cannot talk about the things pertaining to the very 
     <lb/>
     matter about which they are going to enquire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are some who want these terms. They 
     <lb/>
     want to know what Canada is handing out. I 
     <lb/>
     maintain Canada is handing out nothing. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people and government are too shrewd 
     <lb/>
     to commit themselves to an absolutely un<lb break="no"/>authorised body like this with terms of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I am quite sure any delegation sent from this 
     <lb/>
     Convention would be wasting its time unless and 
     <lb/>
     until they have, as I said before, the mandatory 
     <lb/>
     power of the people behind them. It is immaterial 
     <lb/>
     to me whether a delegation goes or not, because 
     <lb/>
     I am convinced they cannot submit final terms to 
     <lb/>
     this Convention. They may offer terms, broadly 
     <lb/>
     speaking. I was looking over the discussions of 
     <lb/>
     1895 when we had a delegation proceed to Ot<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     tawa to discuss terms of confederation. There 
     <lb/>
     were 30 or 40 subjects discussed and every one 
     <lb/>
     referred to matters fiscal, economical and politi<lb break="no"/>cal. Yet we are foolish enough to send a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Canada to talk confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not want the people to be fooled as in 1932 
     <lb/>
     when the then Prime Minister promised the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country that there would be no 
     <lb/>
     change made in the constitutional status until the 
     <lb/>
     matter was referred back to the people by way of 
     <lb/>
     a referendum. It was not, and this status which we 
     <lb/>
     have now slipped in the back door. I would not 
     <lb/>
     be surprised if here is not the same sort of thing. 
     <lb/>
     This squandering of money is such that our 
     <lb/>
     surplus will not last six months, $40 million 
     <lb/>
     expenditure in this one year. How do we expect 
     <lb/>
     to have any government of any kind if the Com<lb break="no"/>mission is going to set that standard before our 
     <lb/>
     people? I pity any government that gets in after 
     <lb/>
     this government goes out — they will just be a 
     <lb/>
     clean-up government. I am against the motion on 
     <lb/>
     principle only. If we are going to deal with our 
     <lb/>
     country and talk about our country, we must do 
     <lb/>
     it by proper constitutional means. On any other 
     <lb/>
     basis you will fail miserably. I shall vote against 
     <lb/>
     the motion. 
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> There has been quite a lot said about 
     <lb/>"approach." I know something of this question. I 
     <lb/>came up the hard way. There is something I lack, 
     <lb/>but I have tried to make up for it in other ways. 
     <lb/>Some years ago I felt I could be of some assis<lb break="no"/>tance to my fellow men, and realising they had 
     <lb/>confidence in me I took upon myself the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility of leading and helping the underdog. I am 
     <lb/>afraid if I was to take the attitude some members 
     <lb/>advocate, to go along to the employer and say 
     <lb/>"Yes, sir" and "No, sir", I can assure you 1 would 
     <lb/>not have gotten very far. Our people in New<lb break="no"/>foundland should be given a chance to earn their 
     <lb/>living. I have some people over on the other side 
     <lb/>in fact I visited some of the old folks in the years 
     <lb/>gone by. I feel that we should go to England 
     <lb/>because I realise that part of the assets belonging 
     <lb/>to this country is over there and it should be on <lb/>the stock sheet here. We are going to try and 
     <lb/>dicker with an outside concern. I am not at all 
     <lb/>satisfied until l am positive all the fittings and 
     <lb/>gear are aboard of this one. Therefore part of the 
     <lb/>fittings belonging to this country is over there and 
     <lb/>I say we should surely see to it that all the gear 
     <lb/>comes back to this little ship before we decide to

     make a deal.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> ....I supported wholeheartedly the 
     <lb/>
     resolution presented by my friend from Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls, a man for whom I have every respect. I have 
     <lb/>
     no reason for doing otherwise, I have known him 
     <lb/>
     for a number of years and I know he is sincere in 
     <lb/>
     his remarks. One portion of that resolution which 
     <lb/>
     enabled me to support it whole-heartedly was 
     <lb/>
     "any other suitable form of government." I rise 
     <lb/>
     to support the resolution as presented by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, simply because I happen to know 
     <lb/>
     that the people of this country are looking for 
     <lb/>
     information in every particular and not in one 
     <lb/>
     particular. I am convinced that all the information 
     <lb/>
     we can get is not going to hurt anybody and unless 
     <lb/>
     we get the information from every source, how 
     <lb/>
     can we be expected to make a wise decision? Is 
     <lb/>
     it right we should deny the people ofthis country 
     <lb/>
     information which they are expecting to receive? 
     <lb/>
     It does not follow that because we receive that 
     <lb/>
     information we are going to accept it. I say in all 
     <lb/>
     sincerity let us not keep from the people what is 
     <lb/>
     their legal right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> It is most important that we be 
     <lb/>
     realistic concerning the whole matter. First I have 
     <lb/>
     to admit that there are a number of people who 
     <lb/>
     possibly favour the idea of federal union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada. There are also a number of people who 
     <lb/>
     may desire that we should continue under the 
     <lb/>
     protecting arm of the Dominions Office and 
     <lb/>
     hence retain the present dictatorial form of 
     <lb/>
     government, which according to the Letters 
     <lb/>
     Patent of 1934 should have been replaced as long 
     <lb/>
     ago as 1942 by responsible government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to responsible government we 
     <lb/>
     believe that there is a large number who still 
     <lb/>
     consider it the most suitable form of government 
     <lb/>
     for this country. It will be remembered that when 
     <lb/>
     the question of confederation with Canada be<lb break="no"/>came a live issue in 1895, we were in rather dire 
     <lb/>
     straits financially and economically and it might 
     <lb/>
     have been expected that the government of the 
     <lb/>
     day would have grasped at any straw floating 
     <lb/>
     down the stream of necessity. At that time how<lb break="no"/>ever, Canada, thinking we were actually on the 
     <lb/>
     verge of financial demise, became so niggardly 
     <lb/>
     that the terms offered were so disgusting to our 
     <lb/>
     government and our people that they would have 
     <lb/>
     nothing to do with her. At that time Canada was 
     <lb/>
     of the opinion that she possessed the 110,000 
  

            <cb/>
            

     square miles of Labrador, later awarded to us in 
     <lb/>
     1927, and she saw in this country nothing but a 
     <lb/>
     barren land, where a few thousand poor fisher<lb break="no"/>men eked out a bare existence. What does she see 
     <lb/>
     today? She sees Labrador with its possibilities for 
     <lb/>
     great mineral wealth, and wherein she has a lease 
     <lb/>
     for an air base for 99 years, and in the building of 
     <lb/>
     which she has expended many millions of dollars. 
     <lb/>
     She sees a Newfoundland apparently economi<lb break="no"/>cally sound with balanced budgets and surpluses, 
     <lb/>
     a country which last year bought her goods to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of $40 million, which has one of the finest 
     <lb/>
     air bases in the world, and which must, of neces<lb break="no"/>sity, for 90-odd years to come, be in close and 
     <lb/>
     friendly relations with the great and powerful 
     <lb/>
     USA by reason of the bases which that country 
     <lb/>
     has here. As a consequence she looks toward us 
     <lb/>
     with envious eyes, especially in view of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that she herself is bound to the USA by their 
     <lb/>
     recent mutual defence pact. Is it not to be ex<lb break="no"/>pected that she would be desirous of obtaining 
     <lb/>
     absolute control of this country and thereby ce<lb break="no"/>ment more closely her economic ties with the 
     <lb/>
     USA? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that Canada might be prepared to 
     <lb/>
     offer terms which may appear very attractive. It 
     <lb/>
     is my opinion that the people of this country owe 
     <lb/>
     it to future generations to consider well and care<lb break="no"/>fully the whole issue at stake, before being car<lb break="no"/>ried away by the rosy picture which the agents of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are endeavouring to paint. We have only 
     <lb/>
     to look at the economic history of all the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian provinces except Ontario or Quebec to 
     <lb/>
     see that confederation will by no manner of 
     <lb/>
     means bring us that utopia which some people 
     <lb/>
     would have us believe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I heartily agree with the opinion which has 
     <lb/>
     often been expressed in this Convention that con<lb break="no"/>federation is of such importance that it can only 
     <lb/>
     be discussed by the duly elected governments of 
     <lb/>
     both countries. We have it on the authority of the 
     <lb/>
     present government and consequently on the 
     <lb/>
     authority of the Dominions Office, that we have 
     <lb/>
     no right to discuss fiscal, political or economic 
     <lb/>
     arrangements with the Dominion of Canada, as 
     <lb/>
     according to the report of the special committee 
     <lb/>
     appointed to interview the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government,<ref target="#fn_16">[1]</ref> these are, "matters entirely for dis<lb break="no"/>cussion between governments." Where is the 
     <lb/>
     point in our sending a delegation to Canada? I

     have no desire to withhold the terms from anyone 
     <lb/>
     wishing to have them; but I contend that there is 
     <lb/>
     no need to send a delegation when the Governor 
     <lb/>
     in Commission is prepared to communicate with 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada and request such in<lb break="no"/>formation as the Convention is permitted to ask, 
     <lb/>
     relative to the terms of federal union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some may say that I am inconsistent in that I 
     <lb/>
     voted for sending a delegation to the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom. But I would point out, first, our politi<lb break="no"/>cal affiliations with England demand that this 
     <lb/>
     Convention get in closer touch with the real 
     <lb/>
     government which has controlled our destinies 
     <lb/>
     for the past 13 years; secondly, the Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Commission made no stipulation as to the subject 
     <lb/>
     matter of our enquiries from the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom as they did in the case of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The more I ponder this question the 
     <lb/>
     more I am convinced that the sending of a delega<lb break="no"/>tion is neither necessary, desirable nor constitu<lb break="no"/>tional.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, on the night of 
     <lb/>
     Wednesday, October 20, 1943, at a Jubilee dinner 
     <lb/>
     in the Newfoundland Hotel, I proposed a toast to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. In my toast, besides many other 
     <lb/>
     things, I said: "In spite of even the latest sample 
     <lb/>
     of mismanagement, every bit as deliberate as the 
     <lb/>
     former anti-settlement laws in its eventual pur<lb break="no"/>pose to hinder rather than to help, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     today, through a combination of world events is 
     <lb/>
     standing on the threshold of our inevitable des<lb break="no"/>tiny, the geographical centre of the empire of the 
     <lb/>
     air." The "latest sample of mismanagement" 
     <lb/>
     referred to, was as everyone knew, the regime 
     <lb/>
     known as Commission of Government. It was 
     <lb/>
     with a sense of vindication that I heard members 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention during the debate last Decem<lb break="no"/>ber on the Report of the Committee on Transpor<lb break="no"/>tation and Communications, say the same thing 
     <lb/>
     in different words. Principally it was said in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the sections of the report dealing 
     <lb/>
     with Gander and tourism, and I made particular 
     <lb/>
     note of Mr. Higgins' expressing himself in words 
     <lb/>
     to this effect: "It seems as if the Commission of 
 

            <cb/>
       

     Government do not want this country to prosper." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Two months after the speech referred to, I 
     <lb/>
     succeeded Mr. Smallwood as "The Barrelman"<ref target="#fn_17">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     and as editor of <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Newfoundlander</hi>.<ref target="#fn_18">[2]</ref> I inherited 
     <lb/>
     his historical mantle and as I believed, his politi<lb break="no"/>cal philosophy, which was identical with my 
     <lb/>
     own. At least it was then. For the past three years 
     <lb/>
     I have made no secret of my political philosophy. 
     <lb/>
     On the radio and in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Newfoundlander</hi> I 
     <lb/>
     stressed the doctrine of self-help; that New 
     <lb/>
     foundlanders would only progress by their own 
     <lb/>
     efforts; that a dictatorship, however benevolent, 
     <lb/>
     was a monument of shame to people who had 
     <lb/>
     governed themselves, wisely or unwisely, well or 
     <lb/>
     unwell, under representative institutions since 
     <lb/>
     1832 and under responsible government since 
     <lb/>
     1855. I believed that in l943. l believed it long 
     <lb/>
     before that. I believe it now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I assumed editorship of The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fishermen- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Worker's Tribune</hi><ref target="#fn_19">[3]</ref> in 1944, and first became 
     <lb/>
     associated with Mr. K.M. Brown, the proprietor, 
     <lb/>
     and later delegate for Bonavista East until his 
     <lb/>
     regrettable seizure in this very House, I expressed 
     <lb/>
     the same view in my editorials. And lest it be 
     <lb/>
     alleged that these views were not mine but some 
     <lb/>
     one else's, l but refer you to a letter which I wrote 
     <lb/>
     to <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Daily News</hi> in 1945, in which I stated flatly 
     <lb/>
     that in my opinion there was only one course 
     <lb/>
     open to us, namely, that we should seek to return 
     <lb/>
     immediately to full responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     "Otherwise", I said, "we are a lost people." Had 
     <lb/>
     I been divinely inspired I don't think I could have 
     <lb/>
     been more prophetic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Early in the spring of 1946 I was asked to take 
     <lb/>
     part in a debate on the resolution "That the Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention is the best method of selecting 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's future form of government." By 
     <lb/>
     choice I took the negative side. The debate, which 
     <lb/>
     took place in a well-known literary association<ref target="#fn_20">[4]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     in the West End of St. John's, was won by the 
     <lb/>
     negative which side was favoured by both the 
     <lb/>
     silent and standing votes. I believed in my argu<lb break="no"/>ments. I believed that the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     would ultimately serve to "make confusion 
     <lb/>
     worse confounded" in this country, and who will

     say in his heart that present tendencies will not 
     <lb/>
     bear me out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For such reasons I intended to have no part in 
     <lb/>
     it. If it was to be a trick, as some have called it, I 
     <lb/>
     would not be one of the tricksters. If it was to be 
     <lb/>
     a Tower of Babel, I would not be one of the 
     <lb/>
     "divers tongues". So I reasoned, in a vain effort 
     <lb/>
     to persuade the thin, small voice of conscience 
     <lb/>
     that told me I was shirking the very responsibility 
     <lb/>
     thatI was urging on my fellow Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
     In the end like Jacob I wrestled with an angel 
     <lb/>
     whose name was reluctance and at 5 pm on 
     <lb/>
     Thursday, the 30th of May, 1946, I decided I 
     <lb/>
     would put my name in nomination the following 
     <lb/>
     day. Even then I felt my chances were very slim, 
     <lb/>
     as the opposition in St. John's (City) West was 
     <lb/>
     tremendous from the standpoint of the calibre of 
     <lb/>
     the other 11 candidates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have said all these things merely to underline 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the district that elected me knew what 
     <lb/>
     I stood for. Indeed, I will go so far as to say that 
     <lb/>
     the country knew it. But now that I was into the 
     <lb/>
     fray, I left no stone unturned in order to keep the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the electorate clear on what I repre<lb break="no"/>sented. In the month and a half preceding the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention elections, I was engaged in 
     <lb/>
     writing a column for the St. John's <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sunday 
     <lb/>
     Herald</hi>, under the caption "Looking Ahead." In 
     <lb/>
     one of my columns I wrote, "The more one con<lb break="no"/>siders that clause of the statement relating to the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention, which suggests that can<lb break="no"/>didates should have an open mind, the more one 
     <lb/>
     is inclined — especially a candidate — to come 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that it is either a very stupid 
     <lb/>
     clause or a very clever one. It has put every 
     <lb/>
     candidate in a somewhat embarrassing position, 
     <lb/>
     to say the least, and it has put the voting public 
     <lb/>
     into more confusion than previously existed." In 
     <lb/>
     the light of past developments I am forced to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that it was a very clever clause, in the 
     <lb/>
     shady meaning of the word "clever". Far better 
     <lb/>
     would it have been if every man could have gone 
     <lb/>
     out and campaigned on his own particular belief; 
     <lb/>
     when the election was over, we would have had 
     <lb/>
     a pretty good idea of where the country stood. 
     <lb/>
     The delegates who did that, although against the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the Convention as alleged, were by far 
     <lb/>
     the wisest of us all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In another weekly column during the same 
     <lb/>
     period subtitled "Confederation" I wrote: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     There's a lot of loose talk in certain 
  

            <cb/>
     

     quarters about confederation. Proponents of 
     <lb/>
     the union are busily engaged in setting forth 
     <lb/>
     facts and figures". endeavouring to make the

     proposition look attractive to a degree. They 
     <lb/>
     have a perfect right to do so.... But one right 
     <lb/>
     that some advocates of confederation are as<lb break="no"/>suming, which does not belong to them, is to 
     <lb/>
     make the National Convention a possible 
     <lb/>
     instrument of achieving their aims. It is no 
     <lb/>
     secret that some candidates to the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention have every intention of making 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation issue a paramount one". 
     <lb/>
     The National Convention is not, and never

     can be even a remote equivalent ofa national

     government... Before Newfoundlanders can 
     <lb/>
     seriously consider confederation they must 
     <lb/>
     be free, independent people, in the sense that 
     <lb/>
     they will be represented by a government 
     <lb/>
     which has been elected by a majority opinion. 
     <lb/>
     It certainly cannot be negotiated by an as<lb break="no"/>sembly elected by every shade of political 
     <lb/>
     belief, and theoretically without any beliefs 
     <lb/>
     or opinions of their own; representing no 
     <lb/>
     national majority, and in many cases, possib<lb break="no"/>ly, representing only local minorities.... 
     </p></quote>



            <p>It was that belief, strengthened by subsequent 
     <lb/>events that caused me to adopt my uncompromis<lb break="no"/>ing attitude in the debate last fall on the motion 
     <lb/>to send a delegation to Ottawa 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>On June 14, one week before election day, 
     <lb/>over radio station VOCM in a campaign speech, 
     <lb/>I said: "Ever since the announcement of the 
     <lb/>machinery of the National Convention, and even 
     <lb/>before whenever the question arose, I followed 
     <lb/>the same line of reasoning, both in my Barrelman 
     <lb/>radio program, and my editorials in a local 
     <lb/>newspaper. First, we have to make a decision as 
     <lb/>to whether we wish to retain the present commis<lb break="no"/>sion form of government or to return to self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>government. If the decision is to return to 
     <lb/>self-government, then the second step is to decide 
     <lb/>as a people what form of self-govemment we 
     <lb/>think best for our needs — the 49th state of the 
     <lb/>American union; the tenth province of the 
     <lb/>Dominion of Canada; a status like that of North<lb break="no"/>ern Ireland with control in London; or to remain 
     <lb/>under responsible government as from 1855 to 
     <lb/>I934." My views are no different now than they 
     <lb/>were when each of these statements was made. If 
     <lb/>anything, lam more certain now that I knew then 
     <lb/>what I was talking about. 
     <lb/>

<p>
     As for what I think about the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, I reserve that for a later date when 
     <lb/>
     forms of government are discussed. At this par<lb break="no"/>ticular time I am concerned with our terms of 
     <lb/>
     reference. When I contested St. John's West I 
     <lb/>
     foresaw the stretching and manipulating of these 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference which could be carried out by 
     <lb/>
     unscrupulous or undisceming men. If I could 
     <lb/>
     have been assured that the terms of reference 
     <lb/>
     would be interpreted as I believed, I would not, 
     <lb/>
     most likely, be in this House today. But sensing 
     <lb/>
     then what I realise now, I could not leave that 
     <lb/>
     much to blind chance. One of the main reasons 
     <lb/>
     that impelled me to seek election was to help to 
     <lb/>
     forestall any move to submerge the identity of 
     <lb/>
     this country into any larger unit without our first 
     <lb/>
     going through an intermediate state, in which the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country under a duly constituted 
     <lb/>
     and responsible government could thrash out 
     <lb/>
     vital and irrevocable issues in a state of complete 
     <lb/>
     autonomy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have made this brief review for a very 
     <lb/>
     definite purpose. I wish to make it quite clear to 
     <lb/>
     everyone concerned that this attitude, this stand, 
     <lb/>
     which I have followed and intend to follow is not 
     <lb/>
     something born of recent months. It is to prove, 
     <lb/>
     if there is any doubt, that I have bowed to the line 
     <lb/>
     of those convictions surely and steadfastly, for a 
     <lb/>
     principle which I believe in.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe in Newfoundland, in its people, in its 
     <lb/>
     resources, in its potentialities. I believe that an 
     <lb/>
     independent Newfoundland offers a far better 
     <lb/>
     opportunity for Newfoundlanders today than it 
     <lb/>
     ever did. I believe that the time for union, espe<lb break="no"/>cially with Canada, is past; that half a century 
     <lb/>
     ago, after the bank crash, or three-quarters of a 
     <lb/>
     century ago, when the Maritime provinces were 
     <lb/>
     going in, were far more appropriate times than 
     <lb/>
     now. We have come a long way since then. We 
     <lb/>
     have now the beginnings of acountry, of a nation; 
     <lb/>
     the increasing population, the diversification of 
     <lb/>
     industry, a strategic position with immense bar<lb break="no"/>gaining power, the spreading grasp of local and 
     <lb/>
     world affairs which was only the possession of a 
     <lb/>
     few. In short, we are now on the way to becoming 
     <lb/>
     a people, a real Newfoundland people, with a 
     <lb/>
     solidifying national consciousness, a national 
     <lb/>
     culture. Indeed, I fail completely to understand 
     <lb/>
     how Mr. Smallwood, who contributed so much 


            <cb/>
      

     in the past, to that national consciousness and 
     <lb/>
     culture, can reconcile himself with his more 
     <lb/>
     recent declarations of defeat and despair, that 
     <lb/>
     seeks to make solvency the main condition for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders' governing themselves in an 
     <lb/>
     insolvent world. I believe that having held aloof 
     <lb/>
     from absorption, from union, so long, that the 
     <lb/>
     step at this time would be next to fatal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Others will differ, of course. Some of them 
     <lb/>
     will do so sincerely; others out of motive and 
     <lb/>
     design. So be it. I have said what I will say at 
     <lb/>
     much greater length and in far more detail when 
     <lb/>
     we reach the debate on forms of government. 
     <lb/>
     When the Hon. Mr. Job introduced his motion 
     <lb/>
     some weeks ago<ref target="#fn_21">[1]</ref> I voted against it, for it included 
     <lb/>
     the confederation question which directly con<lb break="no"/>cerns the sovereignty of Newfoundland. I did not 
     <lb/>
     speak on the motion, because my previous at<lb break="no"/>titude on this matter was unequivocal; it was 
     <lb/>
     plain. I did not say I was an anticonfederate but 
     <lb/>
     thought we ought to see the terms when I opposed 
     <lb/>
     the October motion.<ref target="#fn_22">[2]</ref> For the question in my mind 
     <lb/>
     was, "What terms?" I shall have something to say 
     <lb/>
     later on that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said then and I reaffirm now, that "the final 
     <lb/>
     decision on confederation must rest with the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, and that they should be 
     <lb/>
     asked to register that decision only after negotia<lb break="no"/>tions to secure the best offer of terms from 
     <lb/>
     Canada have been completed on their behalf by 
     <lb/>
     a sovereign government of their own choosing. 
     <lb/>
     If these negotiations were to be considered under 
     <lb/>
     any other auspices, the terms secured would be 
     <lb/>
     bound to be suspect, and even if confederation 
     <lb/>
     were achieved in this manner, it would leave a 
     <lb/>
     heritage of discontent, which might well imperil 
     <lb/>
     the satisfactory operation of the agreement." That 
     <lb/>
     statement was made in an impartial paper on 
     <lb/>
     "The Political and Financial Implications of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation" which was read before the Royal 
     <lb/>
     Institute of International Affairs, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Branch, by Prof. A.M. Fraser, M.A., of the 
     <lb/>
     Memorial University College on March 15, 1946 
     <lb/>
     — months before the National Convention was 
     <lb/>
     even elected. The fact that Prof. Fraser lectures 
     <lb/>
     at Memorial University College and Professor 
     <lb/>
     Wheare at Oxford is no reason why I should 
     <lb/>
     accept the latter's opinion in preference to the 
     <lb/>
     former's.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName>'s motion, harmless as it may have 
     <lb/>
     appeared on the surface, had too many far-reach<lb break="no"/>ing implications, besides being at odds with my 
     <lb/>
     conception of the duties of the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, for me to support it. Furthermore, believing

     what I do about the Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>
     I could not find it in my heart to ask their advice 
     <lb/>
     on something of so essential a nature. Apart from 
     <lb/>
     the matter contained in the motion, the method of 
     <lb/>
     presentation was above reproach and befitting an 
     <lb/>
     elder statesman, and there was no need for con<lb break="no"/>troversy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The bar of history, Mr. Chairman, is a figure 
     <lb/>
     of speech that has been quoted from time to time 
     <lb/>
     in this chamber by several delegates in recent 
     <lb/>
     months, and I believe they were aware of its 
     <lb/>
     import. But if I were to say I am less aware of the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of that phrase on this occasion, I would 
     <lb/>
     not be correct. In my speech at the opening of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention,<ref target="#fn_23">[1]</ref> in support of Hon. Mr. Job moving 
     <lb/>
     an address of loyalty, I said that few men who 
     <lb/>
     make history realise at the time they are making 
     <lb/>
     it. I, sir, am trying to realise that; trying to keep 
     <lb/>
     in mind the fact that this is an epochal assembly 
     <lb/>
     — without precedent — and what I say and do 
     <lb/>
     now at this crossroads in our island's story is 
     <lb/>
     more important to me than anything I know. Time 
     <lb/>
     may prove me wrong. I will take that chance. 
     <lb/>
     After my speech in opposition to the motion to 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to Ottawa, I was termed naive 
     <lb/>
     because I was honest; politically immature be<lb break="no"/>cause I let the cat out of the bag. I would rather 
     <lb/>
     be naive and immature and a poor politician then, 
     <lb/>
     and now and anytime, than be lumped with the 
     <lb/>
     quislings in the years ahead, in the event that out 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention this island loses its 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty, and loses it by absorption into a 
     <lb/>
     union that is not the best union that might be 
     <lb/>
     secured. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin has condemned this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, accusing the British government of lack of 
     <lb/>
     faith in substituting it in place of the 1933 agree<lb break="no"/>ment. He believes responsible government 
     <lb/>
     should be restored without any Convention. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood thinks the Convention the summit of 
     <lb/>
     political and democratic brilliance, principally 
     <lb/>
     because he means to use it, and has used it in 
     <lb/>
     every way to further his pet cause: to wage a 
     <lb/>
     complete campaign for confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada from almost the Opening day. I agree with 
   

            <cb/>
           

     Major Cashin up to a point, which l will explain 
     <lb/>
     later. I disagree with Mr. Smallwood completely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My interpretation of the functions, duties and 
     <lb/>
     scope of this National Convention lies some<lb break="no"/>where in between both their more or less extreme 
     <lb/>
     views. It is to my mind the only interpretation that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention should have allowed itself. The 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference which outlined the work of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates said in part that they were "to consider 
     <lb/>
     and discuss among themselves, the financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic condition of the country and to 
     <lb/>
     recommend forms of government which might be 
     <lb/>
     put before the people as a basis for a national 
     <lb/>
     referendum...." Actually there was no need for 
     <lb/>
     this Convention. The British government knew 
     <lb/>
     the island was self-supporting and could have 
     <lb/>
     arranged a referendum on the basis of this reason<lb break="no"/>ing: "The island is self-supporting, we intend to 
     <lb/>
     carry out the 1933 agreement, we will give you a 
     <lb/>
     referendum in which you will be asked to choose 
     <lb/>
     between Commission of Government and 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. If you by a majority 
     <lb/>
     select responsible government, that will be res<lb break="no"/>tored." That could have been done. If it had been, 
     <lb/>
     I doubt if anyone would or could have questioned 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, the British government may have 
     <lb/>
     argued that there were many people in between 
     <lb/>
     both forms of government, who wanted the out<lb break="no"/>side control that Commission represented with 
     <lb/>
     the satisfaction of at least electing a lower house. 
     <lb/>
     In accordance with the 1933 agreement they 
     <lb/>
     could not put representative government on the 
     <lb/>
     referendum, so they evolved the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention to consider and discuss among themsel<lb break="no"/>ves and recommend forms of government for a 
     <lb/>
     referendum which could, if the Convention saw 
     <lb/>
     fit, include representative government. If that is 
     <lb/>
     what they had in mind, I do not think the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion is a stall or a red herring. Like Mr. Hollett, I 
     <lb/>
     see nothing and can read nothing in the terms of 
     <lb/>
     reference that would permit us to recommend to 
     <lb/>
     the people a form of government (i.e. confedera<lb break="no"/>tion) which might jeopardise the sovereignty of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and perhaps result in the loss of 
     <lb/>
     that sovereignty without proper consideration of 
     <lb/>
     such an unalterable decision under a sovereign 
     <lb/>
     government responsible to the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is one interpretation of the reason for the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention. There is another. The

     policy of the present British government appears 
     <lb/>
     to be in good faith to let those parts of the Empire 
     <lb/>
     which wish to assume responsibility, have it. if 
     <lb/>
     that is so in respect to peoples who have never 
     <lb/>
     even had representative institutions, then it 
     <lb/>
     should be doubly so with respect to a country 
     <lb/>
     which has had representative institutions for 102 
     <lb/>
     years, and responsible government for 80 years, 
     <lb/>
     and which enjoyed dominion status, now in 
     <lb/>
     suspension with the Letters Patent. Yet how to do 
     <lb/>
     this? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin's petition to the contrary not<lb break="no"/>withstanding,<ref target="#fn_24">[1]</ref> the people of Newfoundland had 
     <lb/>
     never directly requested the restoration of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution. That does not prove they did not 
     <lb/>
     want it; it chiefly means they did not have the 
     <lb/>
     leaders. So by means of the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     the British government sees to it that they get at 
     <lb/>
     least representatives, and possibly leaders as 
     <lb/>
     well. Then the British government tells the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland that financially they can 
     <lb/>
     expect to be on their own. The mother country 
     <lb/>
     cannot help out any further. A report (Chadwick- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Jones) is prepared and submitted to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, which amongst other things informs us the 
     <lb/>
     country is self-supporting. Commissioner Wild 
     <lb/>
     before leaving the country tells the Convention 
     <lb/>
     the country is self-supporting. The various 
     <lb/>
     reports of the Convention when added up will 
     <lb/>
     show the same situation. What then? What else 
     <lb/>
     can the Convention do but recommend respon<lb break="no"/>sible government? As representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people, they are the people. Again the 1933 
     <lb/>
     agreement is fulfilled. Why then a referendum? 
     <lb/>
     Why indeed? Why many things? Why, above all, 
     <lb/>
     the introduction of confederation under the rather 
     <lb/>
     loose term of federal union? Why the steady flow 
     <lb/>
     of propaganda reiterating, insisting that the 
     <lb/>
     referendum involve three issues, none of which 
     <lb/>
     is representative government? Why should there 
     <lb/>
     be two forms of one form of government on a 
     <lb/>
     referendum, the second of which, confederation, 
     <lb/>
     is in reality an act of union with a larger state, 
     <lb/>
     which by its very appearance on a ballot paper 
     <lb/>
     presupposes that the people have already sig<lb break="no"/>nified their desire for self-government? For we 
     <lb/>
     cannot be a province of Canada with a commis<lb break="no"/>sion form of government, nor with a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative form of government. We must have a 
  
            <cb/>
       

     responsible form of government before we can 
     <lb/>
     enter a confederation or league of self-governing 
     <lb/>
     provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Why, indeed? On my interpretation of our 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference and the definition of forms of 
     <lb/>
     government for the purpose of this National Con<lb break="no"/>vention, I will go along with the Convention as 
     <lb/>
     set up and with the good faith of the British 
     <lb/>
     government. Up to that point, we see fairly well 
     <lb/>
     eye to eye. At that point, namely the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of what is for the time being an extraneous and 
     <lb/>
     confusing issue, my views, and the view of the 
     <lb/>
     British government — if that is the view — part 
     <lb/>
     company. If, as I and many others in the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion are being forced to conclude. and many in 
     <lb/>
     the country, the National Convention was osten<lb break="no"/>sibly set up to give Newfoundlanders an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to choose between forms of government, 
     <lb/>
     as l have set them forth, but in reality to engineer 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into confederation willy-nilly, 
     <lb/>
     without due regard for its effect on the ultimate 
     <lb/>
     welfare of our people as a whole, then it's a horse 
     <lb/>
     of another colour.... We have seen and heard 
     <lb/>
     enough to know that, to paraphrase the poet, 
     <lb/>
     "There is something rotten in the state of New<lb break="no"/>foundland", and if we strain our ears we can 
     <lb/>
     perhaps hear in the distance the jingling of the 30 
     <lb/>
     pieces of silver. So much for the terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence and forms of government. I stand by my 
     <lb/>
     interpretation, Mr. Chairman, in spite of all that 
     <lb/>
     is said at public banquets or by professors of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional history in public sessions of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. I am not a lawyer, nor a constitution<lb break="no"/>al historian, but I know people who are, and who 
     <lb/>
     agree with me, and we are not ignorant men. In 
     <lb/>
     short, if people are told to tell me a certain thing, 
     <lb/>
     which they would like me to do, is that any real 
     <lb/>
     reason why I should believe them or do it? I don't 
     <lb/>
     think so. Furthermore, I do not think I am being 
     <lb/>
     discourteous when I say that on such vital and 
     <lb/>
     fundamental issues I consider my opinion as 
     <lb/>
     good as either yours or Professor Wheare's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I will leave the purely technical aspect 
     <lb/>
     of the matter for a moment to consider the more 
     <lb/>
     emotional side of this declaration. For obvious 
     <lb/>
     reasons, I shall be charged with several so-called 
     <lb/>
     crimes — a defender of vested interests and 
     <lb/>
     predatory money, which we heard so much about 
     <lb/>
     a few weeks ago. To that charge I will only say 
   

<note xml:id="fn_24">[1] Early in 1946 Mr. Cashin had circulated a petition demanding that the National Convention be cancelled,

    and responsible government he immediately restored. </note>

     "tommy-rot" for I am no more a tool of the 
     <lb/>
     merchants than is Mr. Hollett, or Mr. Bailey, as 
     <lb/>
     well as the many other men in this Convention 
     <lb/>
     who in the last analysis share the same beliefs. 
     <lb/>
     The second charge, no doubt, will be that I, and 
     <lb/>
     anybody else who believes as I do, is restricting 
     <lb/>
     the choice of the people of Newfoundland by 
     <lb/>
     trying to block confederation. I have already ex<lb break="no"/>plained my position with regard to that matter, 
     <lb/>
     but I intend to go a little further to clear up that 
     <lb/>
     misapprehension and allegation in advance. I 
     <lb/>
     believe we are here to discuss and recommend 
     <lb/>
     forms of government, as I have outlined them, not 
     <lb/>
     forms of a form of government. If we are to 
     <lb/>
     discuss and recommend confederation on certain 
     <lb/>
     terms, for the sake of argument, then there are 
     <lb/>
     several other forms of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     we have to discuss and recommend, and in that 
     <lb/>
     case we shall be here another year, and none of 
     <lb/>
     us want that. The proponents of confederation 
     <lb/>
     know that for every one person in this island that 
     <lb/>
     advocates confederation, there are at least three 
     <lb/>
     who advocate union with or annexation by the 
     <lb/>
     United States. There are others who have a voice 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention in Mr. Bailey, who is a staunch 
     <lb/>
     believer in some sort of union with the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, something on the lines of Northern 
     <lb/>
     Ireland. There are extremists too, who advocate 
     <lb/>
     secession from the Empire, with intent to estab<lb break="no"/>lish a free state or a republic. These are all forms 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government. If we are to discuss 
     <lb/>
     and recommend one on a basis of terms like 
     <lb/>
     confederation, then we must get terms or condi<lb break="no"/>tions with respect to them all and discuss and 
     <lb/>
     possibly recommend them all. Where would it 
     <lb/>
     end? Where would we be? What confusion we 
     <lb/>
     would have. It is plain there are four options 
     <lb/>
     under responsible government open to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland: 1. Dominion status; 2. Union 
     <lb/>
     with the United States; 3. Confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada; 4. Union with the United Kingdom. The 
     <lb/>
     second of these I intend to refer to next, and in 
     <lb/>
     doing so I will rebut the third charge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The third charge levelled at me will no doubt 
     <lb/>
     be the hackneyed one of narrow nationalism. 
     <lb/>
     Why? Because I believe in an independent New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the doctrine that God helps those 
     <lb/>
     who help themselves; because I believe that in 
     <lb/>
     this world no one gets something for nothing. Yet 
     <lb/>
     the very people who would make that charge will 
     <lb/>
     themselves likely raise a great outcry because it 
   

            <cb/>
    

     is merely suggested that if Newfoundland is ever 
     <lb/>
     to relinquish her sovereignty and lose her identity 
     <lb/>
     in a larger unit, she could do worse than seek to 
     <lb/>
     lose it in the orbit of the United States. Just south 
     <lb/>
     of us lies the richest, most powerful nation in the 
     <lb/>
     world today.... If we are to forget such things as 
     <lb/>
     independence and national pride; if we are to 
     <lb/>
     ignore the truth that man does not live by bread 
     <lb/>
     alone; if we are more satisfied with servility on a 
     <lb/>
     full stomach than freedom with an empty one, but 
     <lb/>
     with the means to fill it if we strive; if we are to 
     <lb/>
     take the mess of pottage in exchange for the 
     <lb/>
     birthright, and sell ourselves to the highest bid<lb break="no"/>der, then our calculations cannot exclude con<lb break="no"/>sideration of what the United States has to offer. 
     <lb/>
     It is apparent to everyone that it has been con<lb break="no"/>sidered by those who control us. I have always 
     <lb/>
     believed that one of the main reasons why the 
     <lb/>
     report ofthe Goodwill Mission of 1943 was never 
     <lb/>
     published was that it had discovered that a 
     <lb/>
     majority of our people looked to the United States 
     <lb/>
     as a far more attractive possibility than either 
     <lb/>
     Canada or the United Kingdom. And that, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, is not to say I am anti-British. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is just as apparent to everyone that such a 
     <lb/>
     union could never be achieved unless this country 
     <lb/>
     were once again a free agent. That is to say, not 
     <lb/>
     until our people are the masters of their own 
     <lb/>
     house, a sovereign people with a sovereign 
     <lb/>
     government which could sign the Statute of 
     <lb/>
     Westminster. It could never happen while we are 
     <lb/>
     controlled by a puppet dictatorship which dances 
     <lb/>
     when the strings are pulled in London. Equally, 
     <lb/>
     it would never happen if Newfoundland became 
     <lb/>
     a province of Canada. We are no Alaska, as the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ottawa Journal</hi> insinuates. Many Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers fail to realise that Washington, D.C., is 
     <lb/>
     only a hundred miles farther than Ottawa, as the 
     <lb/>
     crow flies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some months ago in a debate in this chamber 
     <lb/>
     the view was expressed that in time there might 
     <lb/>
     be a federal union of North America. That is a 
     <lb/>
     view I have long held. In ancient times, when a 
     <lb/>
     vast area of Europe, Africa and Asia was included 
     <lb/>
     in the Roman Empire, it was the boast of many 
     <lb/>
     men of many nations, "Civis Romanus Sum" — 
     <lb/>
     I am a Roman citizen. Perhaps that day may not 
     <lb/>
     be far away when "I am a citizen of North 
     <lb/>
     America" may be no idle boast. Such federal 
     <lb/>
     union may not be as far away as some people 
     <lb/>
     think. No one in his right senses then will deny 
  

            <pb n="358" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-02-28_Page_0358.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">358</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">February 1947</fw>
         

     that Newfoundland's entry into such a union 
     <lb/>
     would be immeasurably more advantageous as a 
     <lb/>
     sovereign nation than as a province of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     That rapidly approaching possibility is alone al<lb break="no"/>most enough to convince us of the wisdom of not 
     <lb/>
     taking such an irrevocable step as confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But enough of that digression. Now on this 
     <lb/>
     matter of Canadian terms. I have asked, "What 
     <lb/>
     terms?" The foolish argument is advanced that 
     <lb/>
     some of us are afraid to get the terms because they 
     <lb/>
     will be so good that only a fool would refuse to 
     <lb/>
     accept them. So say the confederates — it is just 
     <lb/>
     as well to give them their names, to call a spade 
     <lb/>
     a spade. An equally foolish argument is advanced 
     <lb/>
     by some anticonfederates, namely, "If we don't 
     <lb/>
     get the terms, even the anticonfederates will 
     <lb/>
     begin to get suspicious and wonder about this 
     <lb/>
     vision of utopia that the Convention is trying to 
     <lb/>
     veil from the eyes of the people." Again I ask, 
     <lb/>
     "What terms?" The British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     lays down the conditions under which New<lb break="no"/>foundland may expect to be admitted into the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian confederation. It is alleged New<lb break="no"/>foundland will get special considerations through 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, which same Convention has not 
     <lb/>
     even the power much less the right to negotiate. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood himself in a letter in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Daily 
     <lb/>
     News</hi> some weeks ago, in reply to a letter of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bailey's, admitted that we already knew 95% of 
     <lb/>
     the terms, it was the other 5% we had to find out 
     <lb/>
     about. Even admitting that narrow margin be<lb break="no"/>tween our present position and our position in 
     <lb/>
     confederation, it is plain from the committee's 
     <lb/>
     report of the interview with Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government that the 5 %, the special concessions, 
     <lb/>
     cannot even be discussed by a delegation; I refer 
     <lb/>
     you to page 2 of said report,<ref target="#fn_25">[1]</ref> which says that 
     <lb/>
     "Your Committee was advised that the words 'or 
     <lb/>
     what other fiscal, political or economic arrange<lb break="no"/>ments may be possible,' appearing in clause 3 of 
     <lb/>
     the resolution, should not be included in any 
     <lb/>
     enquiry or in the terms of reference of any delega<lb break="no"/>tion to the Dominion of Canada as these are 
     <lb/>
     matters entirely for discussion between govern<lb break="no"/>ments." In other words, we are told indirectly that 
     <lb/>
     to properly negotiate satisfactory terms for entry 
     <lb/>
     into confederation we must do so through a 
     <lb/>
     proper government, and that, as far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, is responsible government. The only 
     <lb/>
     ground upon which I would be satisfied for this 
  

            <cb/>
           

     Convention to get any terms from Canada would 
     <lb/>
     be this: if I were assured that such terms would 
     <lb/>
     be merely for the information of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     and the people; that they would be used only as 
     <lb/>
     a basis for negotiation in the event that at the 
     <lb/>
     referendum the people expressed a preference for 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and that the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, having obtained such terms, would not be 
     <lb/>
     levered into putting confederation on these terms 
     <lb/>
     in the referendum. But there is no such assurance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, Mr. Chairman, I will say that I see 
     <lb/>
     underlying this indecision about the merits of 
     <lb/>
     confederation as a form of government, the fear 
     <lb/>
     of some members in this assembly that in the 
     <lb/>
     event of confederation not being on a referendum 
     <lb/>
     the country will approve the status quo and these 
     <lb/>
     members will never get into politics. I do not 
     <lb/>
     share this fear. I think the majority of our people 
     <lb/>
     will repudiate Commission government when the 
     <lb/>
     time comes. If I am wrong, and they do not, then 
     <lb/>
     as much as it is against my grain, I will abide by 
     <lb/>
     their decision. Others will claim that if we get 
     <lb/>
     back responsible government we will never again 
     <lb/>
     hear tell of confederation. That is absurd. Any 
     <lb/>
     man or group of men can form a confederate 
     <lb/>
     party and go to the country. If that democratic fact 
     <lb/>
     and right is not convincing enough proof of the 
     <lb/>
     absurdity of the above claim, then I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     within the right of this Convention to put respon<lb break="no"/>sible government on the referendum, with a man<lb break="no"/>date which will ensure the people that should they 
     <lb/>
     accept responsible govemment, that government 
     <lb/>
     will undertake to explore all other feasible con<lb break="no"/>stitutional forms of responsible government, be<lb break="no"/>sides dominion status, to enable the people to 
     <lb/>
     determine whether or not they would be better 
     <lb/>
     served by entry into one or other of the unions I 
     <lb/>
     have mentioned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On these several counts I agree whole-heart<lb break="no"/>edly with the very able and statesmanlike speech 
     <lb/>
     made by Mr. Hollett yesterday which lucidly and 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly summed up the present situation and 
     <lb/>
     showed the international web with which we are 
     <lb/>
     entangled. His appraisal of the facts and his unim<lb break="no"/>passioned though pungent delivery of his convic<lb break="no"/>tions will stand out in the records of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention as one of the finest pronouncements 
     <lb/>
     ever uttered here.

     Newfoundland is sensible and well within my 
     <lb/>
     reading of our terms of reference. The British 
     <lb/>
     government must have some attitude with regard 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland's future position in the world, 
     <lb/>
     and it is only right that we should meet tdghfghhem with 
     <lb/>
     cards on the table, find out what the position is 
     <lb/>
     with regard to our national debt et cetera, so that 
     <lb/>
     we may be better able to assess the financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic position of our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     About the Ottawa delegation, I have said all I 
     <lb/>
     have to say. Mr. Smallwood's suggestion that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country be asked to make a decision 
     <lb/>
     to go into confederation on terms handed to a 
     <lb/>
     delegation of this Convention without bargaining 
     <lb/>
     or negotiation is fantastic. The Canadians would 
     <lb/>
     think we are fools if we accepted such a position. 
     <lb/>
     Accordingly, I propose the following resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     In view of the vital necessity of getting 
     <lb/>

     financial and economic position, which must 
     <lb/>
     properly be known by this Convention before

     within or without the British Empire for

     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I wish to second Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Harrington's amendment for the following 
     <lb/>
     reason. If we cannot discuss the fiscal, political 
     <lb/>
     and economic situation of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canada intelligently, then just what are we to talk 
     <lb/>
     about? This is the people's house and the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the people only should enquire into this 
     <lb/>
     all-important matter, This issue can only be 
     <lb/>
     decided by the people and not by a few of us here 
     <lb/>
     present tonight wanting to know the terms. I am 
     <lb/>
     not opposed to getting these terms through the 
     <lb/>
     proper channels. The only means I know of is, 
     <lb/>
     first to elect our own government which will then 
     <lb/>
     decide what they want, and open negotiations 
     <lb/>
     with the Dominion government and see what 
     <lb/>
     arrangements can be made if any. I am not an<lb break="no"/>ticipating, after we have the terms, on living with 
     <lb/>
     silver spoons in our months. We are the 
     <lb/>
     crossroads of the world today, and hold in our 
     <lb/>
     hand the ace card. May God give us strength in 
     <lb/>
     this opportunity to think wisely and well... 
     <lb/>
     Gentlemen, when we sign our names to any 
 
<cb/>

     terms. let us be sincere and honest in all our 
     <lb/>
     dealings and may our hand not waver in this 
     <lb/>
     all—important issue.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I have listened for some four or 
     <lb/>
     five months to the question of confederation 
     <lb/>
     debated by confederates and anticonfederates. 
     <lb/>
     When I was elected in the West End of St. John's 
     <lb/>
     I did not know confederation could or would be 
     <lb/>
     an issue. However, we have been told by the late 
     <lb/>
     Chairman and by Professor Wheare that it is a 
     <lb/>
     form of government that might be recommended 
     <lb/>
     by the Convention for the referendum. This being 
     <lb/>
     so, I do not see why this House should be delayed 
     <lb/>
     any longer objecting to a delegation going to 
     <lb/>
     Canada and coming back with the terms. I agree 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Harrington that there is an awful lot of 
     <lb/>
     loose talk of federal terms and propaganda going 
     <lb/>
     around, and I think the time has come when we 
     <lb/>
     should pin down the loose talk. If Canada has 
     <lb/>
     terms, let us get them; let us know what we are 
     <lb/>
     talking about. We were elected for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     finding out the financial and economic position 
     <lb/>
     of this country, and personally I am going to vote 
     <lb/>
     against the amendment. The question of con» 
     <lb/>
     federation can be safely left in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     voters.

     to stall us a little while longer. Many, who on 
     <lb/>
     previous occasions voted against getting the 
     <lb/>
     terms of confederation, said at that time that it 
     <lb/>
     was part of our duty to get them, but that the 
     <lb/>
     matter was premature and that we should not send 
     <lb/>
     a delegation anywhere at that time. That tech<lb break="no"/>nicality has been destroyed by the fact we have 
     <lb/>
     already voted to send a delegation to England. I 
     <lb/>
     see no reason why, in order to facilitate the work

     of the Convention, we should not get this busi<lb break="no"/>

     ness disposed of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel that the proceedings of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     and the extramural activities of some of its mem<lb break="no"/>bers must be very disappointing to the people 
     <lb/>
     who sent us here. The talk of political intrigue 
     <lb/>
     that is going on, of ganging up in groups, the 
     <lb/>
     determination beforehand of attitudes that should 
     <lb/>
     be resolved in debate, the closed minds to every<lb break="no"/>thing that one does not approve, are a very 
     <lb/>
     definite setback to the birth of democracy in this 
     <lb/>
     land. But I suppose it will be heartening for the 
     <lb/>
     whole country to learn from the remarks of two 
     <lb/>
     of the most outspoken, if not the most unbiased 
     <lb/>
     members that the people are our masters. I had 
     <lb/>
     begun to wonder if we were forgetting that. it is 
     <lb/>
     very encouraging to note that we are not going to 
     <lb/>
     tell the people of Newfoundland what they must 
     <lb/>
     do. Let us hope that spirit continues. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Meanwhile we are here. And if the people are 
     <lb/>
     our masters, what is it they want us to do? They 
     <lb/>
     want us, surely, to secure the facts, the informa<lb break="no"/>tion on which they can base their decision. They 
     <lb/>
     did not send us here to devise methods for limit<lb break="no"/>ing their choice in that decision, or to inaugurate 
     <lb/>
     political careers for ourselves. Above all, they 
     <lb/>
     expect us to behave as rational, sensible men. 
     <lb/>
     They expect us to have the mentality of a jury. 
     <lb/>
     They expect us to be fair-minded, not supermen. 
     <lb/>
     As reports come in here they do not expect them 
     <lb/>
     to be coloured by the political views of the 
     <lb/>
     authors — or maybe by this time they do. If we 
     <lb/>
     cannot be honest, objective and impartial about 
     <lb/>
     this thing, what are we here for? Who cares what 
     <lb/>
     form of government we, as individuals, believe 
     <lb/>
     in? We each have one vote in the referendum and 
     <lb/>
     no more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This Convention is unique not because it is a 
     <lb/>
     stall or a sham or a makeshift — that's baloney, 
     <lb/>
     and we all know it. It's unique because we have 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity to sit down coolly and soberly 
     <lb/>
     and figure out possible forms for a future con<lb break="no"/>stitution for our country. Upon the basis of our 
     <lb/>
     findings the whole people will decide the form 
     <lb/>
     they prefer. Nothing could possibly be more 
     <lb/>
     democratic than that. We can make a good job of 
     <lb/>
     it, or we can foul it up. It's up to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Meanwhile, our mandate from the people is 
     <lb/>
     clear and unmistakable. At least, mine is, A year 
     <lb/>
     ago the people whom I represent were holding 
     <lb/>
     meetings and discussing their future government. 
     <lb/>
     Some of them, in their community study groups, 
   

            <cb/>
          

     have been discussing things like economic 
     <lb/>
     security for five or six years now, and doing 
     <lb/>
     things about it too. I think I can claim that they 
     <lb/>
     are more politically alert than many parts, even 
     <lb/>
     the Avalon Peninsula, from whose glittering 
     <lb/>
     highways I first took my bearings. Some thought 
     <lb/>
     a revised form of the present system might be 
     <lb/>
     workable and desirable, at least for some time. 
     <lb/>
     There were a great many who thought that, and 
     <lb/>
     no doubt they still do. Others wondered if union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada might not be more practicable, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly from an economic standpoint. Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     therein lay economic freedom. They wanted to 
     <lb/>
     know. I don't know how they feel about it now, 
     <lb/>
     but i imagine they must be pleased to learn from 
     <lb/>
     the member from Grand Falls that he thinks they 
     <lb/>
     still have a chance to qualify as loyal Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers. Most of them, frankly, found it difficult 
     <lb/>
     to make up their minds. They know what they 
     <lb/>
     don't want — ever again. They weren't so sure 
     <lb/>
     of what they did want. So I'm here to get certain 
     <lb/>
     information for them. And that is why I support 
     <lb/>
     this motion. I cannot conscientiously do other<lb break="no"/>wise. I wouldn't want to decide the issue. Let 
     <lb/>
     those who will suffer or enjoy the consequences 
     <lb/>
     make the decision. If we are ever confronted with 
     <lb/>
     the choice of freedom or poverty — and with 
     <lb/>
     poverty there is no freedom — and we choose to 
     <lb/>
     be poor but proud, let that decision be made by 
     <lb/>
     those to whom poverty is something more than a 
     <lb/>
     polite expression, and who have often in the past 
     <lb/>
     had to swallow their pride and accept a handout 
     <lb/>
     in one form or another. Whatever the choices are, 
     <lb/>
     they must be put as clearly as possible. That is 
     <lb/>
     our work. The choosing is for the country as a 
     <lb/>
     whole. I not only believe in the right of the people 
     <lb/>
     to decide, but I have faith in their ability to decide 
     <lb/>
     wisely.... if any of us believe that we are the 
     <lb/>
     servants of the people who sent us here, we must 
     <lb/>
     do the work for which we were sent. And we must 
     <lb/>
     stop inventing excuses for not doing it.

     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> I do not think I can be charged 
     <lb/>
     with using up very much time in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     I do not intend to say much now. During the 
     <lb/>
     debates, there have been many issues brought in 
     <lb/>
     foreign to the subject matter, and the same thing 
     <lb/>
     applies tonight. We are talking about confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. There is no such issue before the Chair. Why 
     <lb/>
     then talk about confederation? The motion as 
     <lb/>
     tabled by Mr. Smallwood is that a delegation be 
     <lb/>
     appointed to be sent to Ottawa and that motion to 
    

            <pb n="361" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-02-28_Page_0361.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">February 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">361</fw>
          

     be voted on forthwith. The amendment says that 
     <lb/>
     the question be deferred until the delegation 
     <lb/>
     comes back from England. What right have we 
     <lb/>
     to believe that any delegation will be permitted 
     <lb/>
     to go to Canada? All we do know is that the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government is going to see if the 
     <lb/>
     English government will receive a delegation, 
     <lb/>
     and what happens there will certainly have a 
     <lb/>
     bearing on the delegation's going to Canada — 
     <lb/>
     if it is necessary. As I see it, it is doubtful whether 
     <lb/>
     our terms of reference permit a delegation to go 
     <lb/>
     to Canada at all. I have looked into the matter and 
     <lb/>
     I am prepared to believe that to be the case and I 
     <lb/>
     would like to read excerpts form an editorial in 
     <lb/>
     today's issue of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If these editorials are calculated 
     <lb/>
     in any way to prejudice the debate, I cannot allow 
     <lb/>
     them to be read. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> has no seat in 
     <lb/>
     this House; its pronouncements are not permis<lb break="no"/>sible as such. If, however, you wish to state it as 
     <lb/>
     your own viewpoint and not the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> 
     <lb/>
     viewpoint, it is allowed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> I state it as my own viewpoint. 
     <lb/>
     "On the third point of the Job resolution an 
     <lb/>
     answer has been made that is quite unequivocal 
     <lb/>
     and substantiates the position that the negotiation 
     <lb/>
     of terms of union with Dominion of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     between governments. On the question of steps 
     <lb/>
     to establish economic or fiscal relationship... the 
     <lb/>
     position is that it is doubtful if the matter comes 
     <lb/>
     within the terms of reference." That is exactly my 
     <lb/>
     position. I am not prepared to vote for the motion 
     <lb/>
     before the House. Do the members think the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada would risk the chance of 
     <lb/>
     holding themselves up to ridicule by giving to a 
     <lb/>
     wholly unauthorised body terms of union, when 
     <lb/>
     nobody is assured that Dominions Office will 
     <lb/>
     allow it to be put on the ballot paper? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> Mr. Chairman, when the debate 
     <lb/>
     on this resolution started it was not my intention 
     <lb/>
     to make a speech. It is not my intention to do so 
     <lb/>
     now. But since a lot of delegates seem to be 
     <lb/>
     explaining why they are going to vote for the 
     <lb/>
     resolution or against it, I think that maybe I 
     <lb/>
     should make my position clear also. I am going 
     <lb/>
     to vote for the motion and in doing so want to 
     <lb/>
     make it clear that I am not necessarily for con<lb break="no"/>federation; that is something upon which I shall 
     <lb/>
     make up my mind if and when we hear the terms. 
     <lb/>
     In the issue now before the Convention I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned only that the people of this country 
  

            <cb/>
         

     should not be restricted in their choice. I stand 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Keough that it is important for the 
     <lb/>
     people to have enough and a little to spare. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want the people to hear the terms of con<lb break="no"/>federation because I know that some of them are 
     <lb/>
     expecting to hear them; to have a chance to vote 
     <lb/>
     for Commission of Government in its present 
     <lb/>
     form or modified form, if either be possible if 
     <lb/>
     they so wish; to vote for responsible government 
     <lb/>
     if they so wish. It is all a matter of what they wish. 
     <lb/>
     I do not want to see them restricted in their choice 
     <lb/>
     in any way. And so, I stand to support the motion. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ROBE2">Mr. Roberts</persName> After the impassioned speeches 
     <lb/>made here by quite a number of the delegates, I 
     <lb/>will not delay the House long with my feeble 
     <lb/>remarks. Some time ago I voted against a motion 
     <lb/>such as this, not that I thought it should not have 
     <lb/>been made, but because I thought it premature. 
     <lb/>This time I do not think it premature and I am 
     <lb/>going to support the motion. I will give you a brief 
     <lb/>history of the political life of St. Barbe district, 
     <lb/>known as the forgotten northwest coast, forgotten 
     <lb/>not only by Commission of Government but by 
     <lb/>all responsible governments; and although I 
     <lb/>would at the moment vote for return of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, I would not bind myself to it if 
     <lb/>I saw a better form. The man who runs for mem<lb break="no"/>ber in the St. Barbe district on a responsible ticket 
     <lb/>will have to be a superior gentleman to be able to 
     <lb/>convince these people that responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be the cure-all for their ills. As far as I 
     <lb/>can gather, and I know a good deal about the 
     <lb/>political feelings of our people, Commission of 
     <lb/>Government with all their mistakes would get a 
     <lb/>substantial vote in St. Barbe, on account of the 
     <lb/>founding of the co-operative societies which 
     <lb/>have played a large part in the economic well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>being of our people, as well as the building of 
     <lb/>hospitals and roads in the Bonne Bay end of the 
     <lb/>district. These things came during the tenure of 
     <lb/>the Commission, not responsible government. 
     <lb/>On the other hand, our people have had so much 
     <lb/>contact with Canada from the days of the first 
     <lb/>settlers up to the present, that quite a bond of 
     <lb/>friendship has grown up between our two 
     <lb/>peoples, and I have no hesitation in saying quite 
     <lb/>a number ofour people would vote for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, terms or no terms. I have received since I 
     <lb/>came here letters and telegrams from quite a 
     <lb/>number of respectable and intelligent people 
     <lb/>from all parts of the district asking me to vote to 


            <pb n="362" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-02-28_Page_0362.jpg"/>

     get the terms of confederation, and how can I, in 
     <lb/>
     fairness to these people, deliberately vote against 
     <lb/>
     this motion? I can't see what all this bally-hoo is 
     <lb/>
     about. Send the delegation and if there are no 
     <lb/>
     terms that will put an end to delegations going to 
     <lb/>
     Canada for many years to come. Whether we 
     <lb/>
     want it or not, a delegation will go to Canada 
     <lb/>
     some day, either from this Convention or from 
     <lb/>
     some future government. So, why not now, and 
     <lb/>
     get it over with? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I rise to support the amendment. I 
     <lb/>
     think you are all aware of my feelings. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that first we want to have a government so that 
     <lb/>
     we can decide in the right way. I paid particular 
     <lb/>
     attention to my friend from White Bay wherein 
     <lb/>
     he told us they have had quite a lot of meetings, 
     <lb/>
     and talked about certain forms of government. I 
     <lb/>
     presume he was speaking for his district. He did 
     <lb/>
     say there was one particular form of government 
     <lb/>
     they did not want. I have an idea what form he 
     <lb/>
     meant. Suppose I want that form, have I not got 
     <lb/>
     the right to recommend it? As far as Humber 
     <lb/>
     district is concerned, I am here as a representative 
     <lb/>
     and I have endeavoured to do the best I can. I am 
     <lb/>
     not afraid to return home. If they want something 
     <lb/>
     better than I recommended, they are entitled to it. 
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I think the member from Comer 
     <lb/>Brook has misinterpreted something I have said. 
     <lb/>I did not say some have expressed preference for 
     <lb/>two specific forms of government — what I did 
     <lb/>say, however, and in my own mind I was thinking 
     <lb/>of economic conditions, was they were quite 
     <lb/>certain what they did not want — ever again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I have listened carefully this after<lb break="no"/>noon and evening to some fine addresses from all 
     <lb/>shadows of political opinion — if you put it that 
     <lb/>way —- those who profess a leaning towards 
     <lb/>confederation and those who lean towards home 
     <lb/>rule. At times I have been somewhat amused, at 
     <lb/>times somewhat sorry at some of the expressions 
     <lb/>I have heard.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In that speech today there was too much dig<lb break="no"/>ging up of the graves of people who never had 
     <lb/>
     any possible hope of being represented here — 
     <lb/>
     they are dead. Records of dead people do not 
     <lb/>
     concern this Convention. What is the point in 
     <lb/>
     bringing up the records of prime ministers? What 
     <lb/>
     is the point in bringing up records of commis<lb break="no"/>sioners? It has nothing to do with this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. There is entirely too much of the broken 
     <lb/>
     record, too much of this 1933 agreement, this 
 

            <cb/>
          

     broken pledge. That has nothing to do with us. 
     <lb/>
     We do not care if the Prime Minister made a 
     <lb/>
     pledge he did not keep. We are here only as a 
     <lb/>
     board of enquiry. We are not trying prime mini<lb break="no"/>sters; we are not trying commissioners; we are 
     <lb/>
     merely trying to find out under the terms of our 
     <lb/>
     Convention Act certain information, and 
     <lb/>
     anybody who brings in other things befogging 
     <lb/>
     that issue is not playing the game by us in the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. Today the Hon. Labour member for 
     <lb/>
     Humber was discussing the ship of state and the 
     <lb/>
     various articles we should have on the ship. One 
     <lb/>
     important thing he forgot, one part of the equip<lb break="no"/>ment we should have is a bilge pump — we are 
     <lb/>
     going to be sunk unless we can get rid ofthe bilge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have the suggestion that they will not 
     <lb/>
     discuss the matter of terms with us. Who says 
     <lb/>
     that? The only way we can find out things of that 
     <lb/>
     nature is by written briefs. We have some official 
     <lb/>
     accounts from Canadian ministers who said they 
     <lb/>
     would discuss the matter with Convention repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, if they so desired. One of the speakers 
     <lb/>
     tonight who delivered a fine speech, said that 
     <lb/>
     some people were anticonfederates but they 
     <lb/>
     wanted to hear the terms. I say that lest there be 
     <lb/>
     any misunderstanding about my anticonfederacy 
     <lb/>
     — I am definitely pro-responsible government 
     <lb/>
     and nothing else — but between pro-responsible 
     <lb/>
     government and not doing my duty as a member 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention, there is a job. When the time 
     <lb/>
     comes there is no doubt in my mind about how I 
     <lb/>
     am going to vote, and no doubt about the way I 
     <lb/>
     feel on this approach to Canada or any other 
     <lb/>
     country. It is only because we have a job we must 
     <lb/>
     do. Much has been said about our not having the 
     <lb/>
     power from the people. I am certain that we do 
     <lb/>
     have a mandate from the people to make all the 
     <lb/>
     enquiries possible into all the forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment that we think might possibly come within 
     <lb/>
     the purview of the national referendum. I am no 
     <lb/>
     constitutional lawyer — merely an ordinary 
     <lb/>
     general practitioner — but at least I have suffi<lb break="no"/>cient common sense to interpret the simple terms 
     <lb/>
     of reference. The other angle by the people who 
     <lb/>
     are against these terms, is what is the point of 
     <lb/>
     going to Canada, you have not the power to 
     <lb/>
     bargain, you are merely a post office. I do not care 
     <lb/>
     if we are a rubber stamp, we will get what we can. 
     <lb/>
     Once we have gotten that we have discharged our 
     <lb/>
     obligation, and for all who are pro-responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, if we could get better terms by bar<lb break="no"/>

     gaining and if we cannot bargain, then we are in 
     <lb/>
     a better position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not see any argument against getting 
     <lb/>
     whatever we can get in the way of information — 
     <lb/>
     and as Mr. Nowell properly put it, when this 
     <lb/>
     matter was discussed the last time, we had all the 
     <lb/>
     same arguments for two days and everyone, ex<lb break="no"/>cept one or two, did agree we had to get those 
     <lb/>
     terms sometime.... I do not feel like belabouring 
     <lb/>
     the question, but we have had much more talk on 
     <lb/>
     the matter than is needed under the circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces. I am prepared to move that the question be 
     <lb/>
     now put. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Before the question is put, I would 
     <lb/>
     like to say a word. I would like to speak against 
     <lb/>
     the amendment because it is going to deny me 
     <lb/>
     some information I was sent here to get. The 
     <lb/>
     people whom I represent want to get it as they 
     <lb/>
     might want to use it in the future. Four months 
     <lb/>
     ago I voted on a motion similar to the motion 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair now. I am convinced more than 
     <lb/>
     ever that I should be in favour of a motion like 
     <lb/>
     that at the present time. I have studied and 
     <lb/>
     laboured with the rest of you on various commit<lb break="no"/>tee work and I am not convinced yet that we are 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting. I can see where a budget might 
     <lb/>
     be balanced, and leave many people in this 
     <lb/>
     country and Labrador in the same living condi<lb break="no"/>tions they have been in all down through the 
     <lb/>
     years, when fishermen have had to live on $100 
     <lb/>
     a year. Balancing a budget like that, we could do 
     <lb/>
     it. I am not convinced that that is what we are here 
     <lb/>
     to do. When I think of that $20 million surplus, a 
     <lb/>
     strange feeling comes over me I am not very 
     <lb/>
     proud of that surplus I would like to get informa<lb break="no"/>tion on the possibility of joining up with bigger 
     <lb/>
     units, on the possibility of better living conditions 
     <lb/>
     and a better system than we have had in the past. 
     <lb/>
     I was very interested in the speech of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Keough. I figured to myself that that comes from 
     <lb/>
     the background of a man of service to the poor 
     <lb/>
     people of this country. I noticed the spirit he was 
     <lb/>
     giving it in; knew what was in his mind; knew his 
     <lb/>
     feelings. I have had experience such as that 
     <lb/>
     myself; I have lived among people who are living 
     <lb/>
     in poverty, degradation and misery, great num<lb break="no"/>bers of them.... I am wondering what kind of 
     <lb/>
     government we can get to enable these people to 
     <lb/>
     get a more decent living.... I am willing to take 
     <lb/>
     any chance to get information that will enable me 
     <lb/>
     to come to a decision later that will get this 
   

            <cb/>
           

     country of ours a better government, one that will 
     <lb/>
     give the people a higher standard of living. I am 
     <lb/>
     not voting for confederation, and whether I do so 
     <lb/>
     later depends on the information I receive.... 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> ....Mr. Burry states all he wants is 
     <lb/>information. If he would read the British North 
     <lb/>America Act he will find the information there. 
     <lb/>The only thing they cannot give without argu<lb break="no"/>ment is how much per capita are they going to 
     <lb/>pay us in the event of our giving up income tax; 
     <lb/>that is the only information a delegation can get. 
     <lb/>All the other things are laid down in the act and 
     <lb/>unless the British government amends that act, 
     <lb/>there can be no other terms, except these. At the 
     <lb/>present time in Canada the federal government is 
     <lb/>in deep argument with the governments of the 
     <lb/>provinces trying to arrive at a satisfactory amount 
     <lb/>of taxes. The idea of sending a delegation to 
     <lb/>Canada is unconstitutional and on that I firmly 
     <lb/>stand. I care not whether the delegation goes or 
     <lb/>not; I am merely stating the point; I do not think 
     <lb/>we have sufficient authority to go there....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> We have a motion here before us 
     <lb/>
     similar to one we had last fall, At that time I 
     <lb/>
     supported that motion. I still contend the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country should know the terms of con<lb break="no"/>federation. Early this month we sent a delegation 
     <lb/>
     to confer with the Commission of Government to 
     <lb/>
     get their advice on certain matters; one was the 
     <lb/>
     sending of a delegation to Canada to discuss 
     <lb/>
     terms of federal union. That committee brings 
     <lb/>
     back a report which says that fiscal, political and 
     <lb/>
     economic matters are matters entirely between 
     <lb/>
     governments. If the delegation to Canada cannot 
     <lb/>
     discuss these things, what are they going to talk 
     <lb/>
     about? If the Canadians <hi rendition="simple:italic">did</hi> give us the terms, we 
     <lb/>
     could not discuss them. It is a matter between 
     <lb/>
     governments. In that case, would a delegation 
     <lb/>
     from this Convention get the same terms as a duly 
     <lb/>
     authorised government of this country? We can<lb break="no"/>not bargain. We cannot talk back. I want to get 
     <lb/>
     the information and I would like to see the terms 
     <lb/>
     of confederation, but I honestly cannot support 
     <lb/>
     the sending of a delegation to Canada under these 
     <lb/>
     conditions. It would be a waste of time. I am 
     <lb/>
     going to vote for the amendment.

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I would like to clear up a matter that has 
     <lb/>
     been raised once or twice. "Fiscal relations" was 
     <lb/>
     not intended to refer to confederation; that matter 
     <lb/>
     was raised by me in the event of confederation 
     <lb/>
     not being discussed; whether we could discuss 


            <pb n="364" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-02-28_Page_0364.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">364</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">February 1947</fw>
           

     other matters. That was ruled out — there was no 
     <lb/>
     ruling out of the idea that we could discuss any<lb break="no"/>thing which the Canadian government was will<lb break="no"/>ing to discuss. This discussion is getting to a stage 
     <lb/>
     where it is tiresome, it is such a simple matter. 
     <lb/>
     We are not committing ourselves to confedera<lb break="no"/>tion; we are simply trying to get some informa<lb break="no"/>tion which we know some people in the country 
     <lb/>
     want and some people in this Convention want. 
     <lb/>
     Why we should object to getting that informa<lb break="no"/>tion, I really cannot tell. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I have listened to many speakers 
     <lb/>
     here today and tonight. I am not worried about 
     <lb/>
     the legal aspects of what we should do, or what 
     <lb/>
     we can or cannot do. I came into this Convention 
     <lb/>
     after 30-odd years travelling on this earth and I 
     <lb/>
     am here tonight for one reason, because I have 
     <lb/>
     not found any place better to live than this island 
     <lb/>
     home of ours. I am not interested in the terms of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. I am interested in the way the 
     <lb/>
     people in that country live. I have never believed 
     <lb/>
     a large country could be as well governed as a 
     <lb/>
     smaller one Everybody seems to be afraid of the 
     <lb/>
     future because of the past. We talk about a trans<lb break="no"/>insular road. In Canada during the depression of 
     <lb/>
     1931-32 they put men working on the roads; they 
     <lb/>
     were paid $5 in the summer and $10 in the winter, 
     <lb/>
     they put the men in camps, 100 men to every five 
     <lb/>
     miles; sometimes they received a cheque for 8 


            <cb/>
            

     cents or 10 cents. They worked in temperatures 
     <lb/>
     of 60 below zero. The Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     handled the depression their way If the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government had done that, we would 
     <lb/>
     certainly have had a cheap road During the 
     <lb/>
     depression of 1929 I went lo the United States I 
     <lb/>
     stayed there until 1936 because 1 could not get 
     <lb/>
     enough money to get out of it. From October, 
     <lb/>
     1931 to April, 1933, I received $378.78. There 
     <lb/>
     was nothing for me but the Salvation Army soup 
     <lb/>
     kitchens and the Sisters of Charity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We are not concerned in this 
     <lb/>
     resolution with conditions in the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America. Please confine yourself to the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion and the amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> They had depression in other places 
     <lb/>
     besides Newfoundland, that is what I am trying 
     <lb/>
     to show. I do not believe anyone in this world can 
     <lb/>
     do anything for Newfoundland, only her people; 
     <lb/>
     and I am afraid if we go off the deep end and do 
     <lb/>
     not trust the right people in this country now, we 
     <lb/>
     are going to pay in the future. I do not believe in 
     <lb/>
     confederation because I do not believe it can do 
     <lb/>
     anything for Newfoundland — Canada did not do 
     <lb/>
     it in the past when they had a chance I vote for 
     <lb/>
     the amendment and against the resolution.
