<div type="section">
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, yesterday we 
     <lb/>
     finished reading clause 16, and I wonder if the 
     <lb/>
     Convention is ready to go with clause 17? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> One question only. Would Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood describe the type of ship meant under 
     <lb/>
     paragraph I, clause 16. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh, that's the ferry on the Gulf. 
     <lb/>
     What Mr. Higgins probably has in mind is some 
     <lb/>
     discussion that took place in one of the last plen<lb break="no"/>ary sessions we had in Ottawa, where I think Mr. 
     <lb/>
     St. Laurent, the chairman of the plenary sessions, 
     <lb/>
     gave us verbally a part description of a boat that 
     <lb/>
     he said their steamship advisers figured might be 
     <lb/>
     the kind of boat that they would put on the Gulf. 
     <lb/>
     There was nothing final about it, nothing in writ<lb break="no"/>ing; it was merely a description by word of 
     <lb/>
     mouth... I have forgotten the specifications and 
     <lb/>
     dimensions that they spoke of tentatively, but I 
     <lb/>
     do remember that Mr. Higgins, who sat next to 
     <lb/>
     me whispered, "Well, Joe, it looks to me as if they 
     <lb/>
     are willing to give us anything we ask for." He 
     <lb/>
     was very pleased with the possibilities of the 
     <lb/>
     tourist trade in Newfoundland, and I was very 
     <lb/>
     pleased, at least at the thought that a fine ferry 
     <lb/>
     boat would be put on the Gulf the kind of boat 
     <lb/>
     that would bring tourists and their cars across the 
     <lb/>
     Gulf. I think that's what Mr. Higgins is referring 
     <lb/>
     to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes, that is what I was referring to. 
     <lb/>
     I wonder, would it be possible if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's memory later on might help him in 
     <lb/>
     giving us a description? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Bradley has apparently 
     <lb/>
     been interested for years past in ships and ship<lb break="no"/>ping, I am sure when he gets back he will be able 
     <lb/>
     to repeat these details and specifications because 
     <lb/>
     he was very interested in these from the technical 
     <lb/>
     standpoint. I don't know much about ships and 
     <lb/>
     shipping, and I was not in a position to judge. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     St. Laurent, I believe, read from a written memo 
     <lb/>
     that had been handed to him by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government shipping people, but if Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     would wait until Monday, Mr. Bradley will be 
     <lb/>
     here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Is that quite satisfactory? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Have they got the plans drawn up 
     <lb/>
     already? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, that would be sort of taking 
     <lb/>
     the bull by the horns. It was this: knowing the 
     <lb/>
     Gulf as they do, and the boat we have had on the 
     <lb/>
     Gulf, and with their general knowledge of steam<lb break="no"/>ship service and practice, their steamship people 
     <lb/>
     ... worked out something on paper, something in 
     <lb/>
     general of the type of ship that might be needed 
     <lb/>
     for that purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Mr. Chairman, the CNR delega<lb break="no"/>tion, assuming that if and when we become a 
     <lb/>
     province they would have to take all these things 
     <lb/>
     into consideration, considered the matter of a 
     <lb/>
     ferry on the Gulf; and because of that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government went into just what kind of 
     <lb/>
     an outfit they would put there, and that was where 
     <lb/>
     they got the idea of making an estimate of what 
     <lb/>
     it would cost. The kind of boats they anticipate 
     <lb/>
     would cost about $2.5 million, and would take 30 
     <lb/>
     cars, and give a daily service back and forth. 
     <lb/>
     That's a lot better than we get now. But that is 
     <lb/>
     what they anticipated, and that is exactly what 
     <lb/>
     they told us in this session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I am waiting for Mr. Bradley's 
     <lb/>
     memory! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I am not worrying about Mr. Brad<lb break="no"/>ley. You were there, and you heard it, and you 
     <lb/>
     said it was fine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I wonder if Mr. Ballam could tell us 
     <lb/>
     if, at the time they were discussing the ship across 
     <lb/>
     the Gulf, they took up the matter of a subsidy that 
     <lb/>
     they might or should have paid us in the last 20 
     <lb/>
     years across the Gulf? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> If we become a province we would 
     <lb/>
     not need a subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, we will get a lot of things for 
     <lb/>
     nothing then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The other day when Mr. Bal<lb break="no"/>lam was absent for a day, I was trying to remem<lb break="no"/>ber which of the delegation it was that had the 
     <lb/>
     conversation with Commander Edwards, who 
     <lb/>
     was telling us how he had been in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and knew our railway system well, and this mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the committee said to him in a friendly 
     <lb/>
     way, "What would happen if the CNR took over 
     

            <pb n="884" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-28_Page_0884.jpg"/>

    <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> 
   <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> 
   

     our railway, would we get any improvements?" 
     <lb/>
     Then Commander Edwards went ahead. I wonder 
     <lb/>
     if Mr. Ballam would care to give us a rough 
     <lb/>
     outline of what Commander Edwards said? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> No, I will not say what Commander 
     <lb/>
     Edwards said to me. It was off the record, a 
     <lb/>
     conversation while we were walking the streets. 
     <lb/>
     But Commander Edwards was in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     years ago and spent four days on the Gaff Topsail 
     <lb/>
     stuck in the snow, and he has been down around 
     <lb/>
     the lighthouses and wireless stations, and you 
     <lb/>
     know half of these things in Newfoundland are 
     <lb/>
     looked after by the Canadian government. He is 
     <lb/>
     the Deputy Minister of Transport, and what he 
     <lb/>
     said to me was just between ourselves and is not 
     <lb/>
     on the record, and I would not repeat it here. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> But Mr. Ballam, did l understand 
     <lb/>you to say that this ship or ferry that they are 
     <lb/>going to put on the Gulf is going to cost $2.5 
     <lb/>million? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Yes, but that's a small one to start. 
     <lb/>
     They have a $6-7 million one at Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island; but it would be foolish to build a big one 
     <lb/>
     and put it on the Gulf when we have not the cars, 
     <lb/>
     etc. We hope to have a road from Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     to Port-aux-Basques by the time this ferry is built, 
     <lb/>
     and we will look after our own affairs after that; 
     <lb/>
     but if you fellows get wise enough to build a road 
     <lb/>
     all across the country then we will have a $7

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would remind you, Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins, that the corporate status that the Railway 
     <lb/>
     possessed up to 1934 or 1935 was taken away 
     <lb/>
     when all the assets of the Railway were, by

     special act, vested in the Commissioner for

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Are all these employees now

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, not civil servants. It is rather 
     <lb/>
     difficult. For example they are not exempted 
     <lb/>
     from jury service as the ordinary civil servant 
     <lb/>
     would be, but in all other respects they are 
     <lb/>
     definitely government employees, because the 
     <lb/>
     Railway is a utility owned and operated by the 
     <lb/>
     government, and they have not even bothered to 
     <lb/>
     superimpose upon the railway operation the 
     <lb/>
     status of a corporation. In the case of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Broadcasting Corporation, however, 
     <lb/>
     that is something entirely different. I do suggest 
     <lb/>
     to you that the employees of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, I have not examined the

     I have had occasion to examine the constitution

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> The Fisheries Board, as at 
     <lb/>
     present set up, cannot operate under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. Isn't it an illegal body under confederation,

     the present Fisheries Board?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I can say that they told us that the

     fisheries set-up we have in this country would be 
     <lb/>
     maintained.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would remind you that under 
     <lb/>
     the company laws of Canada, if you are going to 
     <lb/>
     operate in a single province then of course you 
     <lb/>
     take out a provincial charter.... The point is this: 
     <lb/>
     if you want the right to do business nationally 
     <lb/>
     then you apply for a federal charter, but that does 
     <lb/>
     not affect the right of any province to grant to any 
     <lb/>
     individual the right to operate in that province, 
     <lb/>
     therefore the Fisheries Board, if the set-up is as I 
     <lb/>
     see it, would be operating under a provincial 
     <lb/>
     law.... If we went into confederation, it would not 
     <lb/>
     in any way effect the provincial status that the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board charter would then take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> Mr. Chairman, my impression 
     <lb/>
     was that the Fisheries Board, as it operates in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, has the right to import and ex<lb break="no"/>port. Under the BNA Act, a province has no such 
     <lb/>
     right, and naturally the Fisheries Board must go 
     <lb/>
     out of operation, but I think, in these terms, it is 
     <lb/>
     provided that the Fisheries Board may go under 
     <lb/>
     their board as a representative of the New 
     <lb/>
     foundland fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....The Fisheries Board would 
     <lb/>
     be hampered from operating within other provin<lb break="no"/>ces unless it took out a federal charter, or a series 
     <lb/>
     of ancilliary corporations ... but that would not 
     <lb/>
     affect its right to operate within the Province of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, there's a few ques<lb break="no"/>tions I would like to ask. I would be glad if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood would answer briefly. "Employees of 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Newfoundland in services 
     <lb/>
     taken over by Canada as provided for in clause 5 
     <lb/>
     above will be offered employment in the corres<lb break="no"/>ponding Canadian service under the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions governing employment in that ser<lb break="no"/>vice..." Take the Customs department, which 
     <lb/>
     employs 250 people, and collects today over $20 
     <lb/>
     million. When and if we went into confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada, according to statistics we have here, 
     <lb/>
     the customs revenue will be only $4 million. Now 
     <lb/>
     are all these employees going to be retained down 
     <lb/>
     here, or laid off and offered positions in other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the Customs of Canada?... Will they 
     <lb/>
     reorganise our Customs ...? Have you any 
     <lb/>
     guarantee, in other words, that the men are going 
     <lb/>
     to be retained in the Customs service in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? I don't see anything here to 
     <lb/>
     cover that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the next thing. "Pensions of employees 
     <lb/>
     of the Government of Newfoundland superan<lb break="no"/>nuated or retired on pension before the service 
     <lb/>
     concerned is taken over by Canada will remain 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of the Province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like Mr. Smallwood to explain what 
     <lb/>
     is going to happen to the postal telegraph depart<lb break="no"/>ment particularly. These are practically all over 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. If the telegraphs are taken over, 
     <lb/>
     they will be the Canadian National Telegraphs, 
     <lb/>
     which control the system of Canada. Are they 
     <lb/>
     going to keep the telegraph offices open in White 
     <lb/>
     Bay, Aquaforte and all such places? Are we 
     <lb/>
     assured that these communications are going to 
     <lb/>
     be maintained or are they going to be cut? There 
     <lb/>
     is nothing to show whether they are going to be 
     <lb/>
     maintained or whether they are not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> First, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada will take over a number of services we 
     <lb/>
     now have today, take on quite a number of new 
     <lb/>
     men; on top of that they will introduce into New<lb break="no"/>foundland a number of services we have not got 
     <lb/>
     at all. For those services they have to take on 
     <lb/>
     many more men and they have to be Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Not Canadian? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Under section 63 of the Civil 
     <lb/>
     Service Act the Canadian government, except in

     persons who are ordinarily resident in the 
     <lb/>
     province where they are going to employ them. 
     <lb/>
     In other words, having taken over the Railway 
     <lb/>
     and the employees of the Railway; the broadcast<lb break="no"/>ing station and the employees of the broadcasting 
     <lb/>
     station; Gander airport and the employees there; 
     <lb/>
     the Customs offices' and the postal-telegraph 
     <lb/>
     offices' employees, and putting them under 
     <lb/>
     Canadian rates of pay; they have also got to 
     <lb/>
     establish brand new other federal services in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as in the rest of Canada, and in 
     <lb/>
     doing so have to take on a large number of new 
     <lb/>
     civil servants who will be federal government 
     <lb/>
     civil servants. These must be Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> I question that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would be willing to debate it 
     <lb/>
     any time at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> From 1935-37 — I was educated 
     <lb/>
     in Canada — I went through Nova Scotia and as 
     <lb/>
     far as what Mr. Smallwood said, I know there is 
     <lb/>
     no foundation for it at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is foundation for it by 
     <lb/>
     virtue of the fact that he quoted from the Civil 
     <lb/>
     Service Act, section 63. If you are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     show that he is incorrect in that, there is some 
     <lb/>
     justification for your observation. You have to 
     <lb/>
     lay the foundation for the observation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> One of the things that would 
     <lb/>
     happen if Newfoundland ever became a 
     <lb/>
     province, is that in a number of departments of 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Newfoundland there would 
     <lb/>
     not be as many employees needed as they have 
     <lb/>
     today. Take for example the Auditor General's 
     <lb/>
     department which audits everything the govern<lb break="no"/>ment runs. The government would not be running 
     <lb/>
     as many things; not as much auditing to be done; 
     <lb/>
     therefore the department would not need to be as 
     <lb/>
     big. The same thing applies to a number of 
     <lb/>
     present government departments. But in view of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the Government of Canada would be 
     <lb/>
     introducing quite a number of new federal ser<lb break="no"/>vices that we have not got today and that they 
     <lb/>
     would be manning new departments, and must 
     <lb/>
     employ Newfoundlanders, obviously there will 
     <lb/>
     be many opportunities for men to be engaged in 
     <lb/>
     these new departments and for these civil ser<lb break="no"/>vants in Newfoundland departments that would 
     <lb/>
     not no longer be needed.... We discussed that 
     <lb/>
     matter. There is a clear-cut understanding that the 
     <lb/>
     first men and women to get a chance in the new 
     <lb/>
     Canadian federal government departments to be 


            <cb/>
           

     established in Newfoundland, if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province, will be Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     civil servants who no longer are needed by the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government because some of the 
     <lb/>
     departments would obviously be smaller than 
     <lb/>
     they are today. In reply to Major Cashin, all the 
     <lb/>
     employees will be offered work in these services 
     <lb/>
     taken over by the Government of Canada. It is 
     <lb/>
     very clear — it is in clause 17, section 1.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> What new opportunities of employ<lb break="no"/>ment or departments are they going to open up 
     <lb/>
     here? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Number one is, they have to 
     <lb/>
     establish a regional family allowances division. 
     <lb/>
     That is one. In every province the family al<lb break="no"/>lowance cheques are sent out every month, not 
     <lb/>
     from Ottawa, but from the provincial head<lb break="no"/>quarters, so there would be one in New<lb break="no"/>foundland.... An unemployment insurance 
     <lb/>
     office, a Department of Veterans' Affairs has to 
     <lb/>
     be opened. Major Cashin caught me short — I 
     <lb/>
     will have to sit down and make a list, I can have 
     <lb/>
     that Monday....

     section 2 in our budget the delegation estimated,

     Cashin is looking at this from the standpoint of a 
     <lb/>
     budget. That is quite right. The budget he will 
     <lb/>
     find in the Black Books was drawn here in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's by the delegation weeks before we went 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa at all, before we had the benefit of what 
     <lb/>
     we learned. That budget in many respects is very 
     <lb/>
     much out of date, and an entirely new one will 
     <lb/>
     have to be brought in. He would be well advised 
     <lb/>
     not to pay too much attention to the budget in the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It was drawn up before we went

     to Ottawa at all. We did learn quite a bit in Ottawa

     in our three months.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think Mr. Smallwood will agree, 
     <lb/>
     when we start to tackle this, it has to be tackled 
     <lb/>
     from a financial angle and we have to look for 
     <lb/>
     money somewhere.

     <lb/>
     before the service concerned is taken over by 
     <lb/>
     Canada will remain the responsibility of the

     <lb/>
     at the present time by the Finance Department 
     <lb/>
     and amounts to over $202,000 a year. In this book 
     <lb/>
     here, it shows it as $101,000. I do not know who 
     <lb/>
     drew this up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We did.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You made a mistake of $101,000. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Quite right. We thought that in 
     <lb/>the departments of the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment that would be taken over by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, they would also be responsible 
     <lb/>for the pensions of the people who were now 
     <lb/>retired, and not the provincial government.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> This is the position, when you even<lb break="no"/>tually got around and talked money, they said, 
     <lb/>
     "No, we are not going to take this over, nor are 
     <lb/>
     we going to take over provincial deficits." You 
     <lb/>
     are short $175,000 in interest and sinking fund

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not accept your figures, but 
     <lb/>
     I accept the position. You must remember, under 
     <lb/>
     clause 3, the pensions refer only to those of 
     <lb/>
     people who are not pensioned before the depart<lb break="no"/>ment is taken over by Canada. We have to break 
     <lb/>
     down the figures of pensions. We will come to

     that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You will find that in Volume 1,

     describing appendix 2 — "Memorandum

     presented at the commencement of discussions", 
     <lb/>
     pages 17 to 70 inclusive.

            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I think what Mr. Smallwood said 
     <lb/>about employees not being put out of employ<lb break="no"/>ment through other services being opened is all 
     <lb/>out of kilter — men going to be taken over by 
     <lb/>other departments. Take a tidewaiter, I do not see 
     <lb/>any authority whereby he would be taken over 
     <lb/>and become an old age pensioner. And those 
     <lb/>family allowances and so on. I do not see how it 
     <lb/>can work, myself. I was struck forcibly when I 
     <lb/>came in here and got the Black Books. I think the 
     <lb/>work would have been a lot easier if the New<lb break="no"/>foundland data had been put in one book and the 
     <lb/>data from Canada in the other, so we would have 
     <lb/>an official book. One day we are told it is official, 
     <lb/>next day we are told it is not official. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We are not told it is not official. 
     <lb/>
     In part 1 it says "Memorandum presented by the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation at the commencement 
     <lb/>
     of the discussions." That is not official. It does 
     <lb/>
     not pretend to be. Be fair! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I am fair. I was told they were offi<lb break="no"/>cial. I think everyone else was told they were 
     <lb/>
     official. But it would have been easier if the 
     <lb/>
     memorandum only was in one book and to have 
     <lb/>
     the memorandum from Canada in the other. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I wonder if Mr. Smallwood could tell 
     <lb/>us if the pensions in the civil service are on a 
     <lb/>contributory basis? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not know if I have the 
     <lb/>
     superannuation act here. I have it down at my 
     <lb/>
     house. It is a magnificent civil service pensions 
     <lb/>
     and superannuation scheme; one of the very best 
     <lb/>
     of any country. In fact, it might be a good idea if 
     <lb/>
     we got a copy of that act for every member of the

            </p>

     interested in that. I am interested in the fact that 
     <lb/>
     civil servants have to contribute towards the pen<lb break="no"/>sions. The point is they would have to contribute 
     <lb/>
     — today they have not got to contribute. It is 
     <lb/>
     something like 5 1/2% or 6%.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You are guessing.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I am not guessing. The point is, civil 
     <lb/>
     servants will have to contribute. Today they do

     not have to contribute. Another thing, our provin<lb break="no"/>cial pensions will be paid by the provincial

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Which means that the province would

     have to get a contributory scheme, or we would

     have part of the civil service getting pensions 
     <lb/>
     from the provincial government — one part 
     <lb/>
     would be servants of the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the other, civil servants of Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I was going to refer to this.... Up to 
     <lb/>
     now, the Railway paid its pensions out of the 
     <lb/>
     earnings of the Railway. Now we find, after the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     pay, the province is stuck with the superannua<lb break="no"/>tion for another 50 or 60 years before this is

     finished.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Those pensioned up to the time 
     <lb/>
     the Railway is taken over by the Canadian Na<lb break="no"/>tional Railway, not those pensioned after.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Although the province has lost the

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How would the province lose

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> The earning power would go to the

            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> We take it for granted it is not going 
     <lb/>to be run at a loss if it can be made to pay. If it

     <lb/>After all, the pensions should come under the

     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Did I understand you to say that the

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I thought the responsibility lay with 
     <lb/>
     the Railway and not with the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government. These people have acquired no pen<lb break="no"/>sion rights under the Newfoundland law. Who is

     going to be responsible for all those who are now

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is here in section 3, clause 17.

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> That relates to employees of

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If I were Mr. Fogwill — he is 
     <lb/>
     a railway man and a trade union man — I would

     not make such a dogmatic statement as that. 
     <lb/>
     Whether they acquired them is a delicate matter. 
     <lb/>
     I would not brandish it about and broadcast it; it 
     <lb/>
     may not be the case. There is a very delicate 
     <lb/>
     situation there, as Mr. Fogwill knows. Mr. Fog<lb break="no"/>will knows the inside story of the pensions of

     railroaders and the legal position surrounding it. 
     <lb/>
     I would not brandish it around by saying, "They 
     <lb/>
     have no legal right to a pension." I happen to

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What would happen under con<lb break="no"/>federation in that matter is stated in section 3 of 
     <lb/>
     this clause. Let me put it in my words. New<lb break="no"/>foundland becomes a province on a certain date; 
     <lb/>
     certain men have been pensioned from public 
     <lb/>
     services that the Government of Canada would 
     <lb/>
     take over on that date. The pensions due those 
     <lb/>
     men who had been pensioned, retired on pen<lb break="no"/>sions, before Canada took over, their pensions 
     <lb/>

     They could close down the railway here and send

     of government, like most governments in the

     world, then we might reasonably expect that they 
     <lb/>
     would give us a half-decent deal; but if they are 
     <lb/>
     wholly indecent, if they are just another "Hitler"

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We did not discuss it. We did 
     <lb/>
     not say to the Canadian government, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly Dr. McCann, Minister of National 
     <lb/>
     Revenue, under whom it comes, "Look, the 
     

            <cb/>
         

     Broadcasting Corporation has roughly a 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 cash surplus in the bank, with which 
     <lb/>
     they are going to build a new studio in St. John's, 
     <lb/>
     and put up a new transmitter in Grand Falls, and 
     <lb/>
     they are doing this, that and the other." What we 
     <lb/>
     did say was, "What would be the position under 
     <lb/>
     confederation in connection with the Broadcast<lb break="no"/>ing Corporation?" We had a discussion on it, and 
     <lb/>
     we had a written reply, which you will find some<lb break="no"/>where in the Black Books. Their reply was this, 
     <lb/>
     "It would become part of the network of the 
     <lb/>
     CBC." He said, "We would aim at improving it 
     <lb/>
     and enlarging it, and giving the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland a far better average radio broadcasting 
     <lb/>
     coverage than they have now." The $100,000 to 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Watton refers, they would spend that 
     <lb/>
     and many another with it, right here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, to make a broadcasting service that 
     <lb/>
     would cover the entire island, which our corpora<lb break="no"/>tion does not do now. After all, look at the es<lb break="no"/>timates, look what they spend on that CBC, it is 
     <lb/>
     up in the millions a year.

     we retain it as a province or not? Personally, I

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will put it to you this way. If

     <lb/>
     I would love to have that Broadcasting Corpora<lb break="no"/>tion as a sort of private toy of my own. Whether 
     <lb/>
     that would be good for Newfoundland is another 
     <lb/>
     thing. I would hate to see the Broadcasting Cor<lb break="no"/>poration become a political tool for politicians. If 
     <lb/>
     it becomes part and parcel of the CBC, a national 
     <lb/>
     network reaching from St. John's to Vancouver, 
     <lb/>
     I think the people and the employees will get a 
     <lb/>
     square deal from it. I would not like to see the 
     <lb/>
     Broadcasting Corporation become just a tool for 
     <lb/>
     politicians, which I am afraid it would if it were 
     <lb/>
     controlled by an elected Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. It is bad enough now with the Com<lb break="no"/>mission controlling it. I don't believe one story in 
     <lb/>
     one hundred that you will hear of the "dictator<lb break="no"/>ship" and the way the Broadcasting Corporation 
     <lb/>
     is used by the government. I think, as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     fact, when you look back over the years since it 
     <lb/>
     was started, I think the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, the Commission of Government, has 
     <lb/>
     been very clean and decent about it. I don't think 
     <lb/>
     they have used it as a political tool.

            <p>
     Since, under the Unemployment In<lb break="no"/>surance Act, 1940, and amendments, unem<lb break="no"/>ployment benefits are ordinarily available 
     <lb/>
     only to workers who have built up reserves 
     <lb/>
     by a period of continuous employment in 
     <lb/>
     insurable employment, Canada will provide 
     <lb/>
     for transitional unemployment benefits as 
     <lb/>
     follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Residents of Newfoundland in insurable 
     <lb/>
     employment who lose their employment 
     <lb/>
     within six months prior to the date of union 
     <lb/>
     and are still unemployed at that date, or who 
     <lb/>
     lose their employment within a six months' 
     <lb/>
     period after that date, will be entitled for a 
     <lb/>
     period of six months from the date of union 
     <lb/>
     or six months from the date of unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment, whichever is the later, to assistance on 
     <lb/>
     the same scale and under the same conditions 
     <lb/>
     as unemployment insurance benefits. The 
     <lb/>
     rates of payment will be based on the 
     <lb/>
     individual's wage record for the three months 
     <lb/>
     preceding his loss of employment. The cost 
     <lb/>
     of this assistance will be borne directly out of 
     <lb/>
     moneys appropriated by Parliament for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose and not out of the Unemployment

     Insurance Fund.

     Sir, that sounds a little complicated, but ac<lb break="no"/>tually it means simply this: any men in New<lb break="no"/>foundland who were working in a class of 
     <lb/>
     employment that is insured under the act, who 
     <lb/>
     become unemployed any time within six months 
     <lb/>
     before we become a province, or six months after 
     <lb/>
     — ordinarily they would get no benefits from the 
     <lb/>
     Unemployment Insurance Fund, because they 
     <lb/>
     would not have been paying into the fund, they 
     <lb/>
     would not have made any contributions. Now 
     <lb/>
     that would be the ordinary position, but this 
     <lb/>
     clause provides that they will get the benefits just 
     <lb/>
     the same as if they had been insured under the 
     <lb/>
     fund, and just the same as if they had been making 
     <lb/>
     contributions into the fund right along, just as if 
     <lb/>
     they had been in a province right along. They will 
     <lb/>
     be entitled to that for six months — if they 
     <lb/>
     become unemployed within six months after 
     <lb/>
     union. It's a little bit complicated, I think I under<lb break="no"/>stand it, but I don't know if I can explain it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> What they will get amounts to ex<lb break="no"/>actly 36 days. That is just what they get, 36 days

     and nothing more.

     They will receive the benefits for six months. I

     think Mr. Fogwill has misread that. They will be

     actually paid unemployment benefits for 24 
     <lb/>
     weeks, is it? Six months.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Oh no, 36 days...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Was not the purpose that in the

     <lb/>
     protected during that period?

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is that I suppose, among other

     things.... Anyone becoming unemployed within 
     <lb/>
     six months before confederation or six months 
     <lb/>
     after confederation, he will receive the benefits 
     <lb/>
     for six months....

     wrong. Six months, that is the limit, isn't it? In 
     <lb/>
     six months it would only amount to 180 days, and 
     <lb/>
     he would get 36 days if he were paying six 
     <lb/>
     months, so that is the limit he would get. Tell the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     receive unemployment benefits for six months. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever the legal interpretation may be, that's

     my clear understanding of the matter, and I main<lb break="no"/>tained that until Mr. Fogwill got up.

     put it in as it stands, and my understanding is 
     <lb/>
     something like Mr. Fogwill's: under the same

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, I interpret that section to

     <lb/>
     people were laid off. It should be clearly laid

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't know if I can clear it up in 
     <lb/>
     any way for you. It is my understanding that that 
     <lb/>
     particular clause was inserted with the idea that 
     <lb/>
     if industry was disrupted during the period imme<lb break="no"/>diately prior to, or immediately following con<lb break="no"/>federation, then any insurable person working at 
     <lb/>
     that time, who lost employment within six

     months before or six months after confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and were still unemployed at that date, or who

     lose their employment within six months, are

     <lb/>
     months and more since we left Ottawa, and about 
     <lb/>
     three weeks before we left they were getting 
     <lb/>
     ready to bring loggers and longshoremen in.

     Whether they are in yet or not, I don't know.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Crummey is entirely

     The Government could not readily con<lb break="no"/>template any change in these arrangements

     <lb/>
     on Canada. On the other hand, with respect

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     All I want to say about that clause is this. In 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland we have had for many years, 
     <lb/>
     before any of us was born, a system of education 
     <lb/>
     that has grown up based on the beliefs and the 
     <lb/>
     ideas and the needs of our people.... It is a system 
     <lb/>
     under which the various religious denominations 
     <lb/>
     have their own school system. Each denomina<lb break="no"/>tion has its own schools and these schools are 
     <lb/>
     supported by the government out of the public 
     <lb/>
     funds, most of them. They also raise money of 
     <lb/>
     their own, as we all know.... Clause 19 says that 
     <lb/>
     first of all, only the legislature of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     can pass any laws concerning education if we 
     <lb/>
     become a province.... Secondly, they could not 
     <lb/>
     pass any law which would affect the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     different denominations to have their own 
     <lb/>
     schools; their rights are protected and they can go 
     <lb/>
     on as long as time lasts because no law can be 
     <lb/>
     made to change that. If any two denominations 
     <lb/>
     or more should ever wish to unite their schools 
     <lb/>
     into one system, their right is protected here and 
     <lb/>
     it is left entirely to the people and the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, and no one else can interfere 
     <lb/>
     in it. In other words, this clause protects our 
     <lb/>
     present school system, leaves it just like it is, 
     <lb/>
     unless we Newfoundlanders should ever wish to 
     <lb/>
     change it ourselves.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> They could amalgamate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, by uniting any two or 
     <lb/>
     more schools. If any denomination wishes to go 
     <lb/>
     on forever with its own system of schools, their 
     <lb/>
     right is guaranteed in clause 19. The Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister has made it quite clear that if Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     wishes to change that clause, if this Convention 
     <lb/>
     desired to ask the Government of Canada if they 
     <lb/>
     would change it in some way, they are open to 
     <lb/>
     receive the request. If far more responsible 
     <lb/>
     people than this Convention wish to take up the 
     <lb/>
     matter, the way is open. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think it is a closed matter as far 
  

            <cb/>
          

     as the government is concerned. It is the right of 
     <lb/>
     any community to see that its rights shall not be 
     <lb/>
     taken away; if they desired to change by amal<lb break="no"/>gamation, that would be brought before the 
     <lb/>
     provincial legislature. In either of those cases, I 
     <lb/>
     feel that any communication between the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada is futile and absolutely unneces<lb break="no"/>sary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not see it quite that way. 
     <lb/>
     Knowing as they do in the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada what our school system is, they were 
     <lb/>
     most anxious to protect our rights as they stand 
     <lb/>
     today. So they put in a clause to do that. It does 
     <lb/>
     exactly that. But the Prime Minister says, "With 
     <lb/>
     respect to those matters which are primarily of 
     <lb/>
     provincial concern, such as education, the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada would not wish to set 
     <lb/>
     down any rigid conditions, and it would be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to give reasonable consideration to sug<lb break="no"/>gestions for modification or addition"... They are 
     <lb/>
     open to make it even more binding than it is for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of guaranteeing and protecting the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the various classes of persons in New<lb break="no"/>foundland.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> What is the idea of clause 19 being 
     <lb/>put in here? If the BNA Act covers it, why inject 
     <lb/>it in these terms? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am afraid section 93 does not 
     <lb/>cover the points in the clause in our terms. There 
     <lb/>are two points that seemed and seem to be highly 
     <lb/>desirable in this country today. One point is this: 
     <lb/>any denomination that has its own schools must 
     <lb/>be guaranteed the right to have their schools as 
     <lb/>long as ever they want them to be so; all the rights 
     <lb/>they have now must be guaranteed to last forever 
     <lb/>— to have separate denominational schools and 
     <lb/>to have them paid for out of the public chest.... 
     <lb/>On the other hand, if any two denominations who 
     <lb/>want to unite their two systems of schools ... the 
     <lb/>right to do that is also in these terms, so that all 
     <lb/>rights are protected; to stay as they are or to go 
     <lb/>on to something else. That is left entirely to 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. The Government of Canada does 
     <lb/>not want to interfere in the matter. We all ap<lb break="no"/>preciate why that is. It is a delicate matter, a 
     <lb/>matter of conscience, and the government does 
     <lb/>not want to dicker or interfere or meddle where 
     <lb/>our conscience is at stake. They want to protect 
     <lb/>the rights we have without changing them one 
     <lb/>iota. If there is any change, we Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>or our school authorities or heads must change 
     <lb/>them. I do not think there is much likelihood of 
     <lb/>that. But the right to do it is guaranteed. If not, 
     <lb/>the right to carry on is guaranteed. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It was not guaranteed under the

     the provincial legislature said, "Go ahead" — 
     <lb/>
     section 93 freezes it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In the absence of appeal, it can 
     <lb/>
     be decided upon the intervention made by the 
     <lb/>
     government at Ottawa?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Only to enforce section 93, never 
     <lb/>
     to change it. You cannot change it; once you 
     <lb/>
     adopt section 93, we are under section 93 as a 
     <lb/>
     province forever, and the present setup could 
     <lb/>
     never be disturbed at all. Under section 93, the 
     <lb/>
     right to amalgamate is not there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, under section 93, the right 
     <lb/>
     to amalgamate is not given. I go all the way with 
     <lb/>
     you there.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The difference between section 
     <lb/>
     93 of the BNA Act and this clause in the terms, 
     <lb/>
     is this... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I know the difference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was not saying it for your 
     <lb/>
     benefit. The difference is this, under the BNA 
     <lb/>
     Act, if section 93 applied to Newfoundland the 
     <lb/>
     school system we have now would be frozen 
     <lb/>
     upon us. It could never change, the denomina<lb break="no"/>tions now have schools and would go on having 
     <lb/>
     them for all time; no two denominations could 
     <lb/>
     unite their schools if they wanted to do so. In the 
     <lb/>
     clause in our terms, all denominations are 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed the right to go on forever, as long as 
     <lb/>
     they want to go on, with their own separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. But there is something else added: any 
     <lb/>
     two denominations or more that should ever wish 
     <lb/>
     to unite their schools, that right is given in this 
     <lb/>
     clause. All interests are protected, all conscience 
     <lb/>
     is protected; the beliefs of all people are 
     <lb/>
     protected; no one is denied any right at all. You 
     <lb/>
     can stay as you are, or unite with somebody else. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point, Mr. Higgins, is that 
     <lb/>it is frozen, unless this amendment or alteration 
     <lb/>is cited, by amalgamation between two or more 
     <lb/>bodies? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes, unless this present clause is 
     <lb/>
     in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am reading both together. I am 
     <lb/>
     reading section 93 in the light of that clause. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore under section 93 it is frozen; in the 
     <lb/>
     light of that clause, it remains frozen but subject 
     <lb/>
     to alteration in the event of two or more com<lb break="no"/>munities desiring to amalgamate.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> And providing further for payment 
     <lb/>
     of monies. It is a definite amendment to 93.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I am confused. Did I understand him 
   

            <cb/>
          

     to say, on the one hand section 93 freezes the 
     <lb/>
     situation as it is now, and on the other hand, under 
     <lb/>
     section 93 there is no right of amalgamation? No 
     <lb/>
     right? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> There is the right now. As it is now, 
     <lb/>
     it is being done, whether legal or illegal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It was my impression it was 
     <lb/>
     frozen; but I think it is the practice that has been 
     <lb/>
     followed in Canada since union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I believe it is being done unoffi<lb break="no"/>cially. I speak subject to correction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I am not sure. I do not know enough 
     <lb/>
     about it. I know there have been various amend<lb break="no"/>ments to the Education Act. But it is my impres<lb break="no"/>sion that that is covered — the right of groups to 
     <lb/>
     amalgamate if they so desire, no compulsion. If 
     <lb/>
     that is so, I cannot reconcile the statement that if 
     <lb/>
     93 were in force it would remove our right to have 
     <lb/>
     that amalgamation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Higgins' position is that it 
     <lb/>
     remains frozen unless an alteration is desired 
     <lb/>
     through and by amalgamation; if you wanted to 
     <lb/>
     change what would otherwise be frozen, you 
     <lb/>
     would have to have amalgamation, whereupon 
     <lb/>
     the authorities would act upon it and allow you 
     <lb/>
     to bring about amalgamation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In reply to Mr. Newell, and to 
     <lb/>
     throw a little more light on the matter — you will 
     <lb/>
     appreciate that in Ottawa it was one thing to be 
     <lb/>
     talking about money but something else again to 
     <lb/>
     be talking about matters in which they believe 
     <lb/>
     deeply. The last thing we wanted or would wel<lb break="no"/>come would be to run counter to the beliefs or 
     <lb/>
     faiths of the people of Newfoundland. Naturally, 
     <lb/>
     we had to go pretty deeply into this question. 
     <lb/>
     There is a danger, if section 93 applied to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, that only two classes of persons 
     <lb/>
     would be permitted to have schools — Catholic 
     <lb/>
     and Protestant. In other words, the danger would 
     <lb/>
     be that all Protestant schools, whether they liked 
     <lb/>
     it or not, might be forced to unite. Now there is 
     <lb/>
     no good reason why any denomination would be 
     <lb/>
     forced to unite or not to unite. The application of 
     <lb/>
     section 93 might mean exactly that — forcing 
     <lb/>
     that there be only two classes of schools, Catholic 
     <lb/>
     and Protestant, whereas what we have is 
     <lb/>
     Catholic, Church of England, United Church, 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterian, Salvation Army, Seven Day Ad<lb break="no"/>ventist — I do not know any others, Pentecostal? 
     <lb/>
     And with this clause in these terms, any class or

     any denomination that has a school system now 
     <lb/>
     or at the time we become a province at the date 
     <lb/>
     of union, can go on having that system. They are 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed to have them for all time. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, if any two should wish to unite, that right 
     <lb/>
     is also guaranteed them by these terms that are 
     <lb/>
     now offered us by the Government of Canada. All 
     <lb/>
     the rights of everyone are fully protected in these 
     <lb/>
     terms. I do not know if any gentleman in the 
     <lb/>
     Convention desires to take advantage of this 
     <lb/>
     paragraph in the letter of the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     where he says, "On the other hand, with respect 
     <lb/>
     to those matters which are primarily of provincial 
     <lb/>
     concern, such as education, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would not wish to set down any rigid 
     <lb/>
     conditions, and it would be prepared to give 
     <lb/>
     reasonable consideration to suggestions for 
     <lb/>
     modification or addition." I do not know if any 
     <lb/>
     one feels sufficiently knowledgeable, sufficient<lb break="no"/>ly competent to make any suggestions on it. I 
     <lb/>
     would imagine the people most concerned would 
     <lb/>
     probably be the ones to offer any suggestions if 
     <lb/>
     any were to be offered. I do not know if it is a 
     <lb/>
     matter which we as a Convention can do very 
     <lb/>
     much about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> In the case of union, it would be a 
     <lb/>
     matter the government would have to take up — 
     <lb/>
     if there was any alteration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not so sure. In the referen<lb break="no"/>dum the clause remains as it is now; the people 
     <lb/>
     only know the clause that is there now in the 
     <lb/>
     terms. It seems to me, if they voted for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, the government elected after might not have 
     <lb/>
     the authority to change that clause. The time to 
     <lb/>
     change it, if it is to be changed, is before the 
     <lb/>
     referendum is held. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not know that that is al<lb break="no"/>together so. Under this arrangement, if it were to 
     <lb/>
     be adopted, it is made elastic and flexible; which 
     <lb/>
     is why the Prime Minister goes on to point out 
     <lb/>
     that it is not rigid and inflexible. If you want to 
     <lb/>
     suggest any alterations, it would naturally be 
     <lb/>
     done before union takes place quite irrespective 
     <lb/>
     of the manner by which union is effected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We would be negotiating then, 
     <lb/>
     would we not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, definitely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We might not exactly be 
     <lb/>
     negotiating. If any member of this Convention or 
     <lb/>
     one or more people had a suggestion to make on 
     <lb/>
     the question, to ask that that question be for<lb break="no"/>
            

            <cb/>
           
warded to the government of Canada for their 
     <lb/>
     reply — that would not be negotiating. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is clear from the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister's letter that if you want to address any 
     <lb/>
     questions, or if you want any alterations con<lb break="no"/>sidered, they are prepared to take them under 
     <lb/>
     advisement. It is one thing to write and ask ques<lb break="no"/>tions, it is another thing to go back and say you 
     <lb/>
     want this altered. That is really negotiating. It 
     <lb/>
     depends upon the tenor of the communication 
     <lb/>
     addressed as to whether it is negotiating or mere<lb break="no"/>ly seeking information.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The difficulty is this National 
     <lb/>
     Convention is just a temporary thing elected for 
     <lb/>
     a certain limited period of time; when that is done 
     <lb/>
     we go home. Even at best, we are not all lawyers, 
     <lb/>
     not all professional men, in this matter we have 
     <lb/>
     no standing. We are not the educators of the 
     <lb/>
     country, nor are we the heads of denominations, 
     <lb/>
     we are just a crowd of ordinary fellows blunder<lb break="no"/>ing along as best we can. I suppose this letter from 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister will have been read outside 
     <lb/>
     this Convention; if citizens wished to make rep<lb break="no"/>resentations on the matter, they could do so 
     <lb/>
     without being condemned for negotiating or any<lb break="no"/>thing of that character. It is not a matter we can 
     <lb/>
     do very much about. The offer is there, neverthe<lb break="no"/>less, from the Government of Canada, that it 
     <lb/>
     would be prepared to give "reasonable considera<lb break="no"/>tion to suggestions for modification or addition". 
     <lb/>
     If anyone should care to make any suggestions, I

     do not suggest it is necessarily the job for this

     I don't know that there is much I need to say

     Defence. Since he was in Australia attending the

     Ottawa and Australia, between the members of 
     <lb/>
     the Cabinet in Ottawa and Mr. Claxton in 
     <lb/>
     Australia. But then Mr. Claxton came back to 
     <lb/>
     Canada before we left, and I talked with him, and 
     <lb/>
     he said that they would not only establish these 
     <lb/>
     military and naval and air force units in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and maintain and continue the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Regiment, but that every effort would 
     <lb/>
     be made to enlist Newfoundland officers in the 
     <lb/>
     units, but above all in the Newfoundland Regi<lb break="no"/>ment; I think the idea would be that quite a 
     <lb/>
     number of Newfoundlanders with military ex<lb break="no"/>perience of officer material, would be offered the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to serve in these defence units that

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, that section provides for 
     <lb/>free trade between Newfoundland and Canada, 
     <lb/>but in the matter of oleomargarine that would not 
     <lb/>apply. Oleomargarine, although manufactured 
     <lb/>and sold in Newfoundland, would not be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to go into the rest of Canada while the 
     <lb/>Dairy Industry Act forbids it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Thank you Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>that's the point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is a very great and con<lb break="no"/>tinuing pressure from the public of Canada, going 
     <lb/>on for many many months past and still going on 
     <lb/>stronger than ever, to permit the manufacture and 
     <lb/>sale and importation of margarine into Canada.... 
     <lb/>Anyway, sir, the point is whatever is the case in 
     <lb/>Canada, whether or not Canada will ever permit 
     <lb/>margarine to be sold, in Newfoundland it will be 
     <lb/>permitted not only to be sold, but to be manufac<lb break="no"/>tured, and to be exported if we can find a market 
     <lb/>for margarine in any other country except 
     <lb/>Canada. I firmly believe that the Parliament of 
     <lb/>Canada is going to remove the present restriction 
     <lb/>for all Canada just as they offer in these terms, in 
     <lb/>this clause; just as they offer to remove that 
     <lb/>restriction for Newfoundland alone, so they are 
     <lb/>going to do it for all Canada, perhaps. If they do 
     <lb/>sir, it seems at least possible that Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>possessing as she does one of the finest factories 
     <lb/>in the world making margarine, and I refer of 
     <lb/>course to the Newfoundland Butter Company ... 
     <lb/>that the minute Canada removes the restriction, 
     <lb/>then the Maritime Provinces could, and I believe 
     <lb/>would, become at once a natural market for mar<lb break="no"/>garine manufactured in Newfoundland.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I wonder if Mr. Smallwood could 
     <lb/>tell us if the general sales tax of 8% will be 
     <lb/>imposed on the oleomargarine? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As there is no margarine in 
     <lb/>Canada it is a little difficult to say whether the 
     <lb/>sales tax does apply or not.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Well, according to this, if we are 
     <lb/>allowed to manufacture it in Newfoundland it 
     <lb/>will be legal. Therefore I wish to ask Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood if he would find out that information. 
     <lb/>It would amount to quite a tidy sum going to 
     <lb/>Ottawa each year, somewhere around $190,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I don't think a sales tax would apply 
     <lb/>in Canada, as it does not apply to butter. While 
     <lb/>butter in Canada is brought down here ... you will

     I am personally extremely proud of that 
     <lb/>
     clause, and in my belief it is incomparably far and 
     <lb/>
     away the most important clause in these terms 
     <lb/>
     offered by the Government of Canada, and I am 
     <lb/>
     not overlooking the importance of the other 
     <lb/>
     clauses, family allowances, old age pensions, and 
     <lb/>
     the others. I realise how valuable they are, but to 
     <lb/>
     those who say that all my thoughts are of the 
     <lb/>
     social welfare and social security benefits that 
     <lb/>
     might come to us through confederation, and that 
     <lb/>
     these are the things I consider to be most impor<lb break="no"/>tant, in reply I say now that we have come to what 
     <lb/>
     is far and away the most important clause in this 
     <lb/>
     document; and I personally am very proud of it 
     <lb/>
     because I was the father of that clause, and the 
     <lb/>
     other members of the delegation will agree with 
     <lb/>
     me on that. The first time I raised the matter in 
     <lb/>
     the plenary session, it was at night, there had been 
     <lb/>
     a meeting of the cabinet that afternoon that lasted 
     <lb/>
     for five and a half hours. It was the longest cabinet 
     <lb/>
     meeting since the war ended.

     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I contend that Mr. Smallwood spent

     the time in Ottawa talking about these clauses,

     and there is no reason why he should take up the

     time of this Convention talking them over one by 
     <lb/>
     one. It is up to the other delegates here to talk 
     <lb/>
     about them. It is not up to Mr. Smallwood to

     not Mr. Smallwood spends too much or too little 
     <lb/>
     time in the interpretation of any of the clauses, 
     <lb/>
     the point is that the procedure was adopted by the 
     <lb/>
     Convention as a whole, and therefore he is simply 
     <lb/>
     complying with the procedure prescribed by the

            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> That's right, Mr. Chairman. In 
     <lb/>every other report brought in to this Convention 
     <lb/>on Newfoundland affairs, the general procedure 
     <lb/>was for the chairman of each committee to bring 
     <lb/>in the report and make a general explanation of it 
     <lb/>and leave it to the delegates to discuss it, and as 
     <lb/>a consequence...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> To a point of order, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man. This gentleman is completely out of order. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not quite correct, Mr. 
     <lb/>Penney.... It was pointed out that some mode 
     <lb/>of procedure had to be adopted. The mode 
     <lb/>adopted was that the person who should pilot this 
     <lb/>measure, if you will, through the committee of 
     <lb/>the whole, should be such a person as appointed 
     <lb/>by me. In that connection, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>produced and read from a letter from Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>stating his inability to be present, and asking Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood to deputise for Mr. Bradley. I in<lb break="no"/>timated to members at that time that if you vested 
     <lb/>in me the power to appoint somebody to pilot the 
     <lb/>terms, then I would appoint Mr. Smallwood. As 
     <lb/>far as I know the Convention ratified my appoint<lb break="no"/>ment, and as far as I am now concerned Mr. 
     <lb/>Penney, however unwelcome it may appear to 
     <lb/>you, I have to hold at this time that Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood is only following the procedure that 
     <lb/>he was directed, at the instance of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, to follow, when he was appointed by me 
     <lb/>during and because of the absence of Mr. Brad<lb break="no"/>ley, to proceed with the matter now before us.
