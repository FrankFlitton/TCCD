     commissioner, in which case the commissioners 
     <lb/>
     are not only willing but anxious to convenience 
     <lb/>
     you, subject to the conditions which I have been 
     <lb/>
     instructed to set before you.

            <p>
     Mr. Fowler Mr. Chairman, who gave members 
     <lb/>
     of the old House of Assembly the power to sub<lb break="no"/>poena people? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Parliament. It was the old right 
     <lb/>
     of Parliament itself, that came down through the 
     <lb/>
     ages, and it was also a straight act. We have 
     <lb/>
     neither executive or legislative power to compel 
     <lb/>
     anybody to come before us. All our power is 
     <lb/>
     contained in the section of the act to which refer<lb break="no"/>ence is being made in the National Convention. 
     <lb/>
     Well, gentlemen, shall we proceed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [Sections 49 to 53 approved. The committee rose 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     and reported progress. 0n the motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Cashin the order of the day was deferred] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Burry In reference to the questions tabled 
     <lb/>
     — the word "Newfoundland" occurred all 
     <lb/>
     through in reference to our great territory. Would 
     <lb/>
     that also — in the questions of Major Cashin, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood and others — apply to Labrador? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman Technically or specifically? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Burry Will we get information regarding 
     <lb/>Labrador from these questions? I want to be clear 
     <lb/>on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Bradley It provides for that, and in future it 
     <lb/>
     will apply to Labrador all the time. There is one 
     <lb/>
     that refers to Labrador specifically, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The questions tabled at
                                          the last <lb/> sitting were sent immediately to the
                                          various <lb/> departments and answers have not yet been
                                          <lb/> received. In connection with questions, it is <lb/>
                                          natural to suppose that at the commencement of <lb/>
                                          proceedings, all members may not be conversant <lb/> with
                                          the rules of procedure as to the form and <lb/> relevancy
                                          of the question Some of these ques<lb break="no"/>tions
                                          will have to be re~worded; and I feel I should <lb/>
                                          advise with the members privately, rather than in <lb/>
                                          public, because I feel sure that if a member wants <lb/>
                                          to ask questions in the required scope, attention <lb/>
                                          being paid to the rules, he will want to confine <lb/>
                                          himself strictly to relevancy. Therefore, with <lb/> your
                                          permission, we might have a private word <lb/> at an
                                          appropriate occasion when I can outline the <lb/> rules in
                                          regard to questions. Whatever informa<lb break="no"/>tion
                                          is required by the Convention will not alone <lb/> be
                                          obtained, but questions in respect thereof will <lb/> be
                                          in the prescribed form. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Perhaps it might be
                                          better to <lb/> have these questions available to the
                                          press on the <lb/> day when they are asked in the House.
                                          The pro<lb break="no"/>cedure requires that the member
                                          give notice of <lb/> the question and on the following day
                                          asks it <lb/> formally. One of the reasons for the 24-hour
                                          <lb/> interval between notice and asking of questions
                                          <lb/> is that in certain cases the question has to be
                                          <lb/> reviewed by the Chairman, to take care that the
                                          <lb/> question is in the correct form and is relevant. The
                                          <lb/> day following, the chamber hears the question <lb/>
                                          formally, that is, brought forward on the order <lb/>
                                          paper. If copies were then available, as they ap<lb break="no"/>pear on the order paper, it might be
                                          the ap<lb break="no"/>propriate occasion, as being the
                                          subject of <lb/> interrogation on the following day. <lb/>

                                          question in <lb/> connection with section 39. Immediately
                                          on ad<lb break="no"/>journment yesterday afternoon, the

                                          the <lb/> matter at length.... The question had reference
                                          to <lb/> the fact that this Convention may have to con<lb break="no"/>sider, not merely two alternatives, but
                                          one of <lb/> several types of governments, and that we
                                          might <lb/> find that the type of government which had the
                                          <lb/> greatest number of votes, by no means had a <lb/>
                                          majority; and that being the case, it might be that <lb/>
                                          those members who had voted for a certain form, <lb/>
                                          might on second choice have preference for some <lb/>
                                          alternative which, joined with other votes, might <lb/>
                                          better express the voices and plurality be ob<lb break="no"/>tained. The first thing I have to
                                          observe is that this <lb/> Convention decides nothing. We
                                          want to get that <lb/> very clear in our motion. We decide
                                          nothing. We <lb/> can only decide to recommend something;
                                          but <lb/> any recommendation must not necessarily be <lb/>
                                          adopted by the British government. So we make <lb/> no
                                          unalterable decisions. In the next place you <lb/> will
                                          not be asked to decide on any particular form <lb/> of
                                          government, you are not voting for a particular <lb/> type
                                          of government here, the thing to do is to vote <lb/> that
                                          a type or types of government he put on the <lb/> ballot
                                          paper. You will not be asked to choose <lb/> between two,
                                          three or four forms of government. <lb/> That is not the
                                          procedure, but each type of <lb/> government under
                                          consideration will, when duly <lb/> moved, and seconded,
                                          be put to the Convention <lb/> by the Chairman and will
                                          require a majority vote <lb/> of this Convention to put
                                          that type or particular <lb/> form in our recommendations.
                                          That being done, <lb/> some other member of the Convention
                                          may, and <lb/> probably will, propose that some other form
                                          be <lb/> put on the ballot paper and that will be
                                          submitted <lb/> to the vote, and it will require a
                                          majority to be put <lb/> in the recommendations, and so
                                          on. and in each <lb/> case, no member who votes for one is
                                          precluded <lb/> from voting for the other. It is possible
                                          we might <lb/> move that they should all go on. It was not
                                          the <lb/> intention of the committee to deprive the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Convention of the right to
                                          speak or to <lb/> cast their vote. The idea is that
                                          whatever <lb/>
                                          <cb/> preferences a member has should go to the <lb/>
                                          Dominions Office, so that the imperial govern<lb break="no"/>ment would have an opportunity of
                                          knowing <lb/> what each member of the Convention thought;
                                          <lb/> whether he voted with the majority or against it,
                                          <lb/> he still has the right to write out what he thinks
                                          <lb/> of everything — what his preferences are and his
                                          <lb/> reason for it. In fact, this rule, instead of
                                                 restrict<lb break="no"/>ing the members, gives them
                                          rights which they <lb/> would not otherwise have. <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I do not agree with the
                                          terms of <lb/> reference in regard to the form of
                                          government. <lb/> The form of government was made not in
                                          1932, <lb/> it was made in 1855 and that decision was
                                          never <lb/> rescinded by the people of Newfoundland The
                                          <lb/> question was never put to a vote when we lost our
                                          <lb/> democratic rights. Therefore, in my opinion, in
                                          <lb/> regards to terms of reference for future forms of
                                          <lb/> government, it should be strictly boiled down to
                                          <lb/> the present system and responsible government. <lb/>
                                          I have been informed by different people, <lb/> lawyers,
                                          etc., that this form of government is <lb/>
                                          constitutional. I am not a lawyer, and I don't <lb/> know
                                          very much about law, but I cannot see or <lb/> figure out
                                          how we could discuss any forms of <lb/> government other
                                          than responsible government <lb/> and Commission of
                                          Government. For this reason, <lb/> sir, when we lost our
                                          constitutional rights, I am <lb/> pretty certain that at
                                          that time the matter was set <lb/> forth this way to the
                                          people — that when New<lb break="no"/>foundland became
                                          self-supporting, and when <lb/> Newfoundlanders asked for
                                          the return of their <lb/> government, that would be the
                                          end of it. As far as <lb/> l can see, we may discuss
                                          federation, repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government,
                                          etc., but there are really <lb/> only two things we can
                                          discuss, namely Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government
                                          or responsible government. <lb/> I don't know who is
                                          responsible for this, but if I <lb/> am in order I beg to
                                          move that responsible <lb/> government and Commission of
                                          Government be <lb/> the only two issues. <lb/>

                                          possible forms of government to be placed before <lb/> the
                                          people by way of a national referendum. We <lb/> can't
                                          control that. We can't even by unanimous <lb/> vote alter

                                          we can narrow the choice of the <lb/> people of this

                                          possible, and in any case this <lb/> recommendation of the

                                          than fully protect <lb/> the voice of the minority of this

            <p><persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Here is another matter. Possibly <lb/>we can't do
                                          it, but I would suggest that we should <lb/>discuss the
                                          matter here with a view to an amend<lb break="no"/>ment of
                                          the terms. We could send it in at any rate, <lb/>and at
                                          least it would give us a chance to say that <lb/>we are
                                          not going to sit here and have our hands <lb/>tied and do
                                          as we are told to do. We should have <lb/>a definite stand
                                          on matters like this. As far as I <lb/>can see, it is just
                                          boiled down to a question of <lb/>forms of government. We
                                          don't have the final <lb/>choice, but at least we should
                                          be able to try them <lb/>out on the matter anyway. When we
                                          are told that <lb/>we can't do this or that, why don't we
                                          try it? <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Will you consider whether or <lb/>not, if your

                                          limiting the choice of the people of <lb/>Newfoundland,

                                          suitable to the status of this country. Why should <lb/>
                                          we lie ourselves down with something extra <lb/> whereby
                                          each person has to give his own personal <lb/> reasons for

                                          to say, <lb/> "together with any preference which he may
                                                 ex<lb break="no"/>press as to one form of

                                          satisfied to have <lb/> other forms of government, but
                                          there is nothing <lb/> in the terms of reference to

                                          particular thing, <lb/> which seems to be added on, and I
                                          think we <lb/> should vote against its adoption unless the

                                          <lb/> it is also a very onerous duty, and looking at it

                                          sir, that you, as <lb/> Chairman, appoint all committees.
                                          His point is <lb/> well taken. You have perhaps more
                                                 parliamen<lb break="no"/>tary experience than any

                                          connection. I think that considerable work may <lb/> have
                                          to be referred to certain committees. The <lb/> steering
                                          or business committee is one of the most <lb/> important
                                          committees which will be appointed, <lb/> and we should
                                          have that committee at the very <lb/> earliest moment. A
                                          certain timetable should be <lb/> devised by this steering
                                          or business committee <lb/> which might form a blueprint
                                          for the members of <lb/> the Convention, in order that we
                                          can get down to <lb/> certain definite business. We need a
                                          plan, and <lb/> realising the amount of work which
                                          confronts us, <lb/> it seems to me that only by appointing
                                          different <lb/> committees and studying the different
                                          estimates <lb/> which bear upon the financial and economic
                                          con~ <lb/> dition of the country, shall we get down to
                                                 some<lb break="no"/>thing whereby we can
                                          intelligently study the <lb/> various reports of the
                                          committees. Otherwise it <lb/>
                                          <cb/> will be the duty of each member of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion to himself undertake the
                                          exhaustive and <lb/> complete study of the economy of
                                                 New<lb break="no"/>foundland, which will be a very
                                          onerous and <lb/> difficult task. I believe that a lot of
                                          this work <lb/> could be referred to various committees
                                          who <lb/> would meet in the morning, or after the
                                                 adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment, or in the evenings.
                                          Unless this is done, and <lb/> some of this work
                                          apportioned to the various <lb/> committees, I believe
                                          that the task will be most <lb/> difficult and the
                                          sittings unduly prolonged. I am <lb/> prepared to vote for
                                          the adoption of this section. <lb/>

                                          with the chamber as it was, <lb/>and who has any feeling
                                          for the glories of the past, <lb/>must have deep gratitude
                                          to you for the <lb/>meticulous care you have given to
                                          getting the <lb/>chamber back to what it used to be. The
                                          mere <lb/>physical job of gathering desks and chairs that
                                          <lb/>have disappeared, never to be recovered some of
                                          <lb/>them, carpets that have been sold by auction and
                                          <lb/>could not be replaced, great draperies that have
                                          <lb/>disappeared to be replaced by the best that could
                                          <lb/>be obtained, the paintings that have been restored
                                          <lb/>by our own Clem Murphy, I believe. You have <lb/>done
                                          all within your power, and as far as the $34 <lb/>million
                                          resources of the country would permit, to <lb/>get this
                                          chamber fit to receive the new represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the Newfoundland people. I have heard
                                          <lb/>that you are determined to restore the old legisla<lb break="no"/>tive library, and we all know the
                                          earnest way in <lb/>which you are endeavoring to bring the
                                          old <lb/>people's house back to its pristine beauty, and I
                                          <lb/>think we can say how deeply grateful we are to
                                          <lb/>you. <lb/>

                                          well. I believe the members <lb/> of this Convention agree
                                          with me that you are the <lb/> right man to appoint

                                          of any <lb/> person more suitable than he is. Before this

                                          for every man <lb/> elected to it, our responsibilities
                                          are tremendous. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     This is indeed and always will be an historic 
     <lb/>
     occasion in the life of Newfoundland. Those of 
     <lb/>
     us who were successful at the polls have been 
     <lb/>
     summoned to perform a common task. Let us 
     <lb/>
     keep faith with those whose confidence has made 
     <lb/>
     these gatherings possible. Let us examine each 
     <lb/>
     fact on its merit and as true loyal New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, at all times put our country first. I 
     <lb/>
     sincerely hope that the results of our deliberations 
     <lb/>
     will be motivated by a keen honest desire to 
     <lb/>
     restore to our people a truly democratic way of 
     <lb/>
     life. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have in His Excellency a man of vision 
     <lb/>
     and character, who will not be influenced by any 
     <lb/>
     who might prove disloyal, a great leader who has 
     <lb/>
     the courage of his convictions, and I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that in future history his name will be associated 
     <lb/>
     with those who will make it possible for New<lb break="no"/>foundland to take her proper place as a proud 
     <lb/>
     member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gentlemen, we have a job to do, let us be 
     <lb/>
     tolerant with one another, always respecting the 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges of each member as the 
     <lb/>
     elected representative of his district, and at all 
     <lb/>
     times upholding the dignity of the chair. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     that our worthy Chairman will allow us plenty of 
     <lb/>
     latitude to intelligently discuss any matter which 
     <lb/>
     is brought on the floors of the Convention cham<lb break="no"/>ber. Those of us who are only boys in politics will 
     <lb/>
     at first be inclined to watch the big guns across 
     <lb/>
     the Channel, and more or less take full stock of

            <p><persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I would like to speak on a per<lb break="no"/>sonal
                                          matter that applies to all of us. I refer to a <lb/>report
                                          in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi>
                                          regarding yesterday's <lb/>proceedings. I notice that the
                                          report says some of <lb/>the delegates were absent and it
                                          does not give the <lb/>names. I am from an outport and I
                                          am certain that <lb/>my supporters at home are watching
                                          the papers <lb/>daily and when they see a report that some
                                          of the <lb/>delegates were absent, it is quite possible
                                          that <lb/>they are going to mark me down as being off the
                                          <lb/>job. I do not think a delegate should absent him<lb break="no"/>self from a session unless under
                                          circumstances <lb/>beyond his control. When a member is
                                          unable to <lb/>attend he should notify the Secretary and
                                          in future <lb/>the names, as regards absenteeism, should
                                          be <lb/>given in the reports. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> I would be the first to disagree with <lb/>that. If
                                          this Convention lasts six months, six <lb/>weeks or two
                                          years, I am not going to be here <lb/>every sitting and
                                          there are few members of this <lb/>Convention who have not
                                          business that will not <lb/>permit their attending all
                                          sittings. I may have to <lb/>go to a meeting of the Woods
                                          Labour Board or <lb/>some other such convention; I cannot
                                          be in both <lb/>places at the one time and one thing is
                                          just as <lb/>important as the other. Down through the
                                          years <lb/>there never was anything in the rules, to my
                                          <lb/>knowledge, that prevented a man's being absent. <lb/>

                                          asked if it would be all right to go and said I would

                                          the House <lb/> present but we did not inquire into their <lb/>
                                          <cb/> reasons.... It might form the occasion for some

                                          have his name posted. I do not think any member <lb/> who
                                          has of necessity the confidence of his district <lb/>
                                          which elected him need fear that confidence is <lb/> going

                                                 after<lb break="no"/>noon that it would be
                                          desirable, in the opinion of <lb/> the members, that Mr.
                                          Wild be invited to address <lb/> the committee of the
                                          whole in private, I saw him, <lb/> and he asked me to
                                          inform you that he is very <lb/> happy to do so at
                                          whatever time is suitable, and <lb/> not alone tomorrow,
                                          but thereafter for as many <lb/> days as he can find it
                                          possible to come. <lb/>

            <p>
                                          <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Mr. Chairman, I
                                          appreciate the <lb/> point made by Major Cashin, but
                                          another thought <lb/> occurs to me: many of us are not so
                                          well ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with financial matters as
                                          Major Cashin, <lb/> and the sooner we can get some light
                                          the better. <lb/> If Commissioner Wild can come tomorrow I
                                          <lb/> believe he would have to speak to us for at least
                                          <lb/> an hour, and there won't be much time for Major
                                          <lb/> Cashin to ask many questions, and in the mean<lb break="no"/>time we can get some information. It
                                          might <lb/>
                                          <cb/> facilitate Major Cashin's ideas if the commis~ <lb/>
                                          sioner would come tomorrow, with the under<lb break="no"/>standing that he will come again on some <lb/>
                                          subsequent day. <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I know from my own
                                          experience <lb/> that a lot of the information I have
                                          requested is <lb/> going to take several days to prepare,
                                          and I don't <lb/> want him to be inconvenienced, and when
                                          he <lb/> comes he should make a good job of it. Any <lb/>
                                          member is entitled to ask questions and I know <lb/> he
                                          can't get it ready before the end of the week. <lb/></p>

     <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Would that be convenient to <lb/> you? <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well then - <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Will he come the second time? <lb/>
                                   </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Not alone is he prepared to <lb/>come tomorrow, but
                                          on other occasions. <lb/>
                                   </p>

                                          <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I want it understood that
                                          if he is not <lb/> prepared to come back the second time,
                                                 par<lb break="no"/>ticularly when they don't want
                                          to come before the <lb/> public, the people here are
                                          entitled to every bit of <lb/> information. The position
                                          the Commission has <lb/> taken, is that they refuse to
                                          come before the <lb/> public. Now on questions in the past
                                          I have gone <lb/> through the ropes myself. When a
                                          question was <lb/> directed towards a minister, the
                                          minister brought <lb/> in a reply to that question, and if
                                          the answer did <lb/> not suit the inquisitor, he
                                          questioned him further <lb/> there on the floor of the
                                          House. I realise we have <lb/> no right to subpoena
                                          people, but this is a different <lb/> question. We are
                                          here to represent the people and <lb/> they say, "we will
                                          only go up there privately"; <lb/> and if we get
                                          information from them privately, <lb/> the press,
                                          forinstance, cannot give it to the public. <lb/> Now how
                                          are we to get it to the public? Are we <lb/> to give it
                                          out as a kind of rumour? I contend that <lb/> whilst we
                                          have no power to drag them here, every <lb/> member of the
                                          Commission should come before, <lb/> the Convention
                                          publicly. It creates more con <lb/> fidence for
                                          themselves, because when the people <lb/> find out that
                                          they won't come publicly they feel, <lb/> "Well, what has
                                          he to hide?" However, they have <lb/> indicated they are
                                          not prepared to do that, so the <lb/> next best thing is
                                          to get them before a committee <lb/> of the Convention,
                                          but when that time arrives the <lb/> questions,
                                          particularly these financial questions, <lb/> have got to
                                          be answered properly. There is noth<lb break="no"/>ing in
                                          it that is not in the public interest, and no <lb/>
                                          excuses will be taken by me for any refusal to <lb/>
                                          answer these questions... However, Mr. Wild <lb/>

                                          came up <lb/> in the Committee on Rules and Procedure, my
                                          <lb/> understanding is that the general principle is that
                                          <lb/> all information that they produce to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion meeting in the committee of the

                                          the <lb/> public, with exceptions. There might be oc<lb break="no"/>casions, we do not know what they might

                                          process of negotiation, and yet <lb/> these negotiations
                                          could be dragged on for <lb/> months. They might be
                                          prepared to give us that <lb/> information if we did not
                                          immediately hand it <lb/> over to the public. If the
                                          principle is established <lb/> that we are to be the
                                          judges, on condition that it <lb/> does not become public
                                          property immediately, <lb/> thenwhere are our rights?
                                          Denied? And is the <lb/> public interest attacked? I am as
                                          keen as <lb/> Mr. Crosbie and Major Cashin that the
                                                 informa<lb break="no"/>tion coming before this
                                          Convention should come <lb/> before the Newfoundland
                                          public. I feel so deeply <lb/> on it that I have come to
                                          this conclusion, that if <lb/> things are right and the
                                          public of Newfoundland <lb/> gets everything that we get,
                                          then before we make <lb/> our report to the public, it,
                                          having the same <lb/> evidence will have come to the same
                                          conclusions, <lb/> and made up its mind for itself. That
                                          can be done <lb/> only if the Newfoundland people get the
                                                 infor<lb break="no"/>mation that we get. In spite
                                          of that there may be <lb/> occasions when that principle
                                          might have to be <lb/> waived in the interests of getting
                                          information. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Take the case of
                                          negotiations. <lb/> Of necessity the views of the
                                          negotiating party on <lb/> the other side might have to be
                                          considered. Take <lb/> some public promotion planning the
                                          utilisation of <lb/> public resources, in which the
                                          government of the <lb/> day is negotiating with some
                                          outside concern to <lb/> develop these resources. I can
                                          imagine a situation <lb/> where the promoter on the other
                                          side says, "No, <lb/> I want these discussions secret and
                                          confidential <lb/> between you and me until such time as
                                          the con<lb break="no"/>tract is consummated or concluded".
                                          We have to <lb/> take into consideration not only the
                                          views but the <lb/> directives on the other side, for
                                          instance the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of tariffs between
                                          the US and the New<lb break="no"/>foundland governments.
                                          The Newfoundland <lb/> government might be willing indeed
                                          to take the <lb/> public into its confidence, but the US
                                                 govern<lb break="no"/>ment may say, "No, we are

                                          government, and for the <lb/> immediate present we will

                                          What then? There may <lb/> be other instances where
                                          definitely it would not <lb/> be in the public interest to

                                          the broad principle <lb/> that all information,
                                          commitments, obligations <lb/> and national situations as
                                          we know it (with cer<lb break="no"/>tain well expected
                                          reservations) will be made <lb/> available to the
                                          Convention; but we are not to <lb/> forget that there may
                                          be negotiations which no <lb/> government, no matter how
                                          willing it is to take <lb/> the people into its
                                          confidence, can disclose. Take <lb/> a Water Street
                                          merchant who may have some <lb/> negotiations with the
                                          government that are pend<lb break="no"/>ing conclusion. He
                                          won't want to have the situa<lb break="no"/>tion publicly
                                          canvassed until it is concluded, and <lb/> I don't think
                                          it would be fair that the matter be <lb/> publicised under
                                          those circumstances. We have <lb/> to bear in mind these

                                          <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I quite agree. But you
                                          might ask a <lb/> lot of questions, 15 or 20. You meet Mr.
                                          X, <lb/> commissioner, in conference and he says, <lb/>
                                          "Gentlemen I don't want you to make this <lb/> public." If
                                          the answers can't be made public, why <lb/> should the
                                          questions be asked? <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It is most unfortunate
                                          that they have <lb/> taken this attitude. Do you think
                                          that they can <lb/> give us information, 45 men or so, not
                                          sworn or <lb/> anything, and net expect it to leak out?
                                          Are the <lb/> persons of the Commission of Government not
                                          to <lb/> be allowed to come and see us in public? They
                                          <lb/> defeat their own ends by refusing to come before
                                          <lb/> the public. In any case, if an official comes here
                                          <lb/> we know that if he is not allowed to disclose <lb/>
                                          something he is not going to. I think it is most <lb/>
                                          unfortunate, and gentlemen I submit that there is <lb/>
                                          nothing for us to do but take it gracefully and hear <lb/>
                                          the commissioner in committee of the whole. <lb/>

                                          trying to <lb/> make is, Mr. Wild may say, "We will speak
                                          to <lb/>
                                          <cb/> you as a committee of the whole, but we will not
                                          <lb/> speak to your committee with the public there."
                                          <lb/> Why? They have not explained the reason why <lb/>
                                          they won't do that. They have some reason for it, <lb/>
                                          and I think they are playing their cards very <lb/> badly,
                                          because the public can say, "There must <lb/> be something
                                          wrong, what is it?" Are they afraid <lb/> they will be
                                          asked an embarrassing question <lb/> which they don't want
                                          to answer? We delegates <lb/> were to enquire into
                                          everything and the sessions <lb/> were to be open to the
                                          public, and now we find <lb/> that if Mr. Wild comes here
                                          we have to bar that <lb/> door, and John Citizen cannot
                                          get in while Mr. <lb/> Wild tells us how he handled this
                                          or that. If Mr. <lb/> Wild was across the House and was
                                          asked a <lb/> question by a leader of the opposition he
                                          would <lb/> have to answer it. Now he says, "Bar the
                                          doors". <lb/> That is not democracy. We can't make them
                                          <lb/> come, but if they don't come publicly they should
                                          <lb/> stay out altogether. With your permission I put an
                                          <lb/> amendment in this form, that when this invitation

                                          House tomorrow afternoon, and that when he <lb/> does come
                                          the House will be in public session, <lb/> and ask his

                                          bound by the terms of <lb/>reference under that authority.
                                          We are faced with <lb/>an unalterable fact. We cannot
                                          compel people to <lb/>come here.... <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> The commissioners are appointees <lb/>of the home

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I do not think it is a matter of dictating <lb/>to the
                                          Commission, but we should ask them for a
                                          <lb/>reconsideration with a different spirit. If we dic<lb break="no"/>tated to them they would probably
                                          dictate back. <lb/>If we approach them in the spirit that
                                          we want to <lb/>get the best we can for this country, they
                                          may be <lb/>willing to reconsider it. I suggest further we
                                          are <lb/>discussing a time-honoured problem, one that has
                                          <lb/>been handled on many occasions. If a minister <lb/>
                                          <cb/> comes before the public he gives all the informa<lb break="no"/>tion he can give. That is all we
                                          ask.... I suggest <lb/> we approach them in the spirit of
                                          wanting the <lb/> information we can get, not for
                                          ourselves, but for <lb/> the people of this country, and
                                          in that spirit to <lb/> reconsider the position. If there
                                          is information <lb/> beyond a shadow of doubt not in the
                                          public <lb/> interest, he may withhold it. If I ask a
                                          minister a <lb/> certain question and he says, "I cannot
                                          answer <lb/> that", and I ask him 20 more questions and he
                                          still <lb/> says, "I cannot answer them", I will not take
                                          that <lb/> lying down. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I was notified by a commissioner <lb/>about two
                                          years ago on a question put to him that <lb/>we had no
                                          authority to call witnesses. He gave <lb/>me to understand
                                          his authority came from the <lb/>Dominions Office. I
                                          understand this act has been <lb/>drawn up by the
                                          Commission. If that is so, by <lb/>what authority are we
                                          acting? What I want to <lb/>bring out is that if the
                                          commissioners refuse to <lb/>meet us in public, let us
                                          have them removed and <lb/>others put in. Secondly, the

                                          is not possible <lb/>to have the commissioners attend here
                                          and give <lb/>us what we want in public. The Commission of
                                          <lb/>Government is not a secret organisation, nor are
                                          <lb/>we a secret body. Every matter to be dealt with
                                          <lb/>here should get the fullest possible ventilation.

            <p>
     There is another committee of very great im<lb break="no"/>portance, and that is the library committee. We 
     <lb/>
     need to have available to the members of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention reference and data of all kinds 
     <lb/>
     referable to the legislature and public affairs of 
     <lb/>
     the colony. We had a well-balanced, invaluable 
     <lb/>
     legislative library. That library no longer exists, 
     <lb/>
     as we knew it. It may be there are some of those 
     <lb/>
     books held by the public library, but to what 
     <lb/>
     extent, I do not know. I do feel there is an urgent 
     <lb/>
     necessity to restore that library as well as for the 
     <lb/>
     immediate information of members of this con<lb break="no"/>vention, as also out of veneration for the past, and 
     <lb/>
     I think we should make a beginning and get all 
     <lb/>
     the books we can belonging to that library and put 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
           
     them back, as the first step. The first duty is the 
     <lb/>
     restoration of that library to serve your needs as 
     <lb/>
     well as to safeguard invaluable manuscripts 
     <lb/>
     belonging to the legislature of this colony.

                                          <persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> That is a crime. I remember
                                          the first <lb/> day I held office here. The librarian,
                                          Miss Morris, <lb/> sent down for me to come to the
                                          library. She <lb/> asked me to pass down the first book on
                                          the top <lb/> shelf. I passed it down and she said, "Open
                                          it, you <lb/> will see the name of your great-grandfather
                                          there, <lb/> one of the first members of responsible
                                                 govern<lb break="no"/>ment." I would not like to
                                          know today that these <lb/> books had been destroyed. It
                                          is criminal to <lb/> destroy the library and I would not
                                          like to say <lb/> what should be done with the person or
                                          persons <lb/> who destroyed it. I do not know of a more

                                          statistician- <lb break="yes"/> economist to enable us the
                                          better to assess the <lb/> financial and economic
                                          condition and prospects <lb/> of the country. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     We have appointed already to the Convention 
     <lb/>
     an authority on constitutional history, practice, 
     <lb/>
     and theory in the person of Professor Wheare of 
     <lb/>
     Oxford University. Up to the present time, per<lb break="no"/>haps for weeks or months, the Convention may 
     <lb/>
     not be able to make as much use of his particular 
     <lb/>
     knowledge and advice as it will have to do when 
     <lb/>
     we get to the question of considering particular 
     <lb/>
     types of government. In the meantime the job of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention as it is beginning to emerge very 
     <lb/>
     plainly now, is going to be one of gathering, 
     <lb/>
     compiling and assessing data of an economic and 
     <lb/>
     financial character. Speaking for myself, I have 
     <lb/>
     made a profession — in part earned my living - <lb/>by collecting statistics and facts about New<lb break="no"/>foundland trade and industry, but I confess frank<lb break="no"/><pb n="26" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-09-17_Page_0026.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">26</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">September 1946</fw>ly that when I see Major Cashin's questions and 
     <lb/>
     others already asked, and I imagine many yet to 
     <lb/>
     be asked, I feel profoundly my inability to ana<lb break="no"/>lyse and assess the importance of the data. It so 
     <lb/>
     happens that I am not very good at arithmetic. I 
     <lb/>
     feel that if the government were to give us a 
     <lb/>
     statistician-economist of at least equal academic 
     <lb/>
     and professional standing of Professor Wheare, 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional authority, whether he be ob<lb break="no"/>tained in the United States or any other English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking country, if he be a thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     competent man, he can be of enormous value in 
     <lb/>
     what is a monumental job. I think we are over<lb break="no"/><cb/>awed and weighed down, not with the burden of 
     <lb/>
     the world, but by the realisation of the tremen<lb break="no"/>dous task of setting out to assess the real state of 
     <lb/>
     this country. If we can get help from a profes<lb break="no"/>sional man, one who has no axe to grind and who 
     <lb/>
     does not care what kind of government we may 
     <lb/>
     have; if we can get such a man as that it will be 
     <lb/>
     of tremendous help to the members of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention in discharging the duty they have had laid 
     <lb/>
     upon them.

            <p>Mr. Ashbourne It was perfectly clear to my 
     <lb/>mind when I made the motion to invite the com<lb break="no"/>missioner to address the committee of the whole, 
     <lb/>that it had been decided by the Commission of 
     <lb/>Government, and transmitted to us through you, 
     <lb/>that the commissioners were not prepared to at<lb break="no"/>tend before us in public session, but in private 
     <lb/>session. I move now that the Hon. Commissioner 
     <lb/>for Finance be invited to attend in private session 
     <lb/>tomorrow September 19 at 4 pm if convenient, to 
     <lb/>address us on the general financial condition of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland.
