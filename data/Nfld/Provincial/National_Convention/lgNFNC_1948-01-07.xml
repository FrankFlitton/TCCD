<!-- GL, 2017-08-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 



<!--<p>
     Now, of course, it is no good in our looking in 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book or the Black Books for this infor<lb break="no"/>mation. But there are other places we can look, 
     <lb/>
     fortunately, and what we see there is not so good. 
     <lb/>
     For instance, we find that in 1931 Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     had to go off the gold standard in order to save 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian chartered banks from bankruptcy. 
     <lb/>
     We know that Newfoundland depositors in these 
     <lb/>
     banks lost some $20 million through the raising 
     <lb/>
     of the price of gold in 1933, and that the central 
     <lb/>
     bank of Canada made this large profit at the 
     <lb/>
     expense of Newfoundland depositors. We know 
     <lb/>
     that during World War Two, the same Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada had the advantage of having the use of 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of American dollars spent 
     <lb/>
     in this country, and though the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland made nothing, it is estimated that the 
     <lb/>
     Bank of Canada made upwards of $150 million 
     <lb/>
     from such sources. We know that this same 
     <lb/>
     Canada is at this very moment sending an SOS to 
     <lb/>
     Uncle Sam for financial help, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people are being forced to take the first 
     <lb/>
     steps on the hard road of austerity, that road 
     <lb/>
     which the people of Great Britain have travelled 
     <lb/>
     so long. Is it any wonder then, that in view of 
     <lb/>
     these things we fail to be able to see Canada as a 
     <lb/>
     land of milk and honey, which Mr. Smallwood so 
     <lb/>
     enthusiastically described and to which he wants 
     <lb/>
     us to come? Is it strange that we feel like asking 
     <lb/>
     such questions now, as what is the exact financial 
     <lb/>
     position of the central bank of Canada? What is 
     <lb/>
     the total of Bank of Canada notes now in circula<lb break="no"/>tion? What amount of gold is in reserve as 
     <lb/>
     security against this paper currency? In short, we 
     <lb/>
     want to know, and I say we are entitled to know, 
     <lb/>
     what is the actual financial position of this 
     <lb/>
     country that wants us to go into partnership. We 
     <lb/>
     want to know and we must know if Canada today 
     <lb/>
     is a solvent country. Is she financially sound? 
     <lb/>
     And we also want to know before we consider 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada, what would become of the 
     <lb/>
     $110 million in our local Canadian banks? What 
     <lb/>
     would happen to the Newfoundland Savings 
     <lb/>
     Bank and to the money of our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     depositors in these banks and in Canadian bonds? 
     <lb/>
     Incidentally, speaking of Canadian bonds, when 
     <lb/>
     I took up the morning paper today, the first thing 
     <lb/>
     I saw was that Canadian bonds had slumped a 
     <lb/>
     couple percent. Canada's financial position 
     <lb/>
     might not be so hot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are vital questions, Mr. Chairman. They 
     <lb/>
     should be known to this Convention, to the 
     <lb/>
     country and to the Newfoundland people. They 
     <lb/>
     represent the very basis of this whole discussion. 
     <lb/>
     But we do not know them. They are not to be 
     <lb/>
     found in either the Grey Book or the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books. I have asked these questions in this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, but as yet I have received no reply. 
     <lb/>
     Yesterday I received an evasive answer, 
     <lb/>
     deliberately evasive. Mr. Smallwood has not told 
     <lb/>
     us. No member of the Ottawa delegation has told 
     <lb/>
     us anything about them. To all appearances, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, the Ottawa delegation has absolutely 
     <lb/>
     failed in its duty, in not getting this information 
     <lb/>
     for us while in Canada. Do they think, does 
     <lb/>
     anybody think, that we Newfoundlanders are 
     <lb/>
     going to allow ourselves to be dragged into this 
     <lb/>
     sort of a transaction and buy a pig in a bag? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the present time Canada is all out trying to 
     <lb/>
     bank itself to the future on the Marshall Plan. If 
     <lb/>
     the Plan does go through, it will mean expendi<lb break="no"/>tures by the United States for $67 billion worth 
     <lb/>
     of goods a year for European countries, and some 
     <lb/>
     of these purchases will be made in Canada and 
     <lb/>
     will be paid for in American funds to Canada. If 
     <lb/>
     the Plan does not go through, none of us knows 
     <lb/>
     what might happen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, in moving the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the debate, I might say with regard to this 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting — I want to make it known, as far 
     <lb/>
     as having the debate broadcast or not, a lot of 
     <lb/>
     people want to hear themselves over the radio. I 
     <lb/>
     am not one of those. What talking I have done, I 
     <lb/>
     have not gotten it gratis from the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government over the radio. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>[The committee rose and reported progress, and 
     <lb/>the Convention adjourned]

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When the committee rose yesterday 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, I was addressing the Convention on 
     <lb/>
     the issue of confederation. This afternoon, whilst 
     <lb/>
     it would be my privilege, according to what has 
     <lb/>
     been going on here lately, to give some "tedious 
     <lb/>
     repetition", as it would be termed, it is not my 
     <lb/>
     purpose to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I took my seat yesterday I was discuss<lb break="no"/>ing the Marshall Plan and how it would affect 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I pointed out that Canada is longing for 
     <lb/>
     this Marshall Plan to go through in order that she 
     <lb/>
     may get some very badly needed American dol<lb break="no"/>lars. For this reason, if this plan goes through it 
     <lb/>
     will involve an expenditure of $7 billion a year, 
     <lb/>
     a lot of purchases for which might be made in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and consequently will give Canada con<lb break="no"/>siderable American funds which she now needs 
     <lb/>
     so badly. I intend to go on from that part of my 
     <lb/>
     talk. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us take another look at these proposals. 
     <lb/>
     Annex IV in the Grey Book<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> tells us that the total 
     <lb/>
     revenue which Canada will expect to obtain from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, if we become a province, is 
     <lb/>
     slightly over $20 million annually. These figures 
     <lb/>
     may be just guesses, otherwise they are 
     <lb/>
     fraudulent and dishonest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. Major Cashin is 
     <lb/>
     now attributing very dishonorable motives, to say 
     <lb/>
     the least, to the Government of Canada. A former 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, Judge Fox, ruled that it is not com<lb break="no"/>petent for members of the Convention to refer in 
     <lb/>
     disrespect or in terms of that type to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not think you can impute 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They cannot substantiate the 
     <lb/>
     figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It does not follow that if the 
     <lb/>
     figures are incorrect they are fraudulent. I am not 
     <lb/>
     listening to charges of fraud. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> These figures were handed by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian experts to the Newfoundland delega<lb break="no"/>tion to take home. They are not worth the paper 
     <lb/>
     they are written on. Mr. Smallwood never ques<lb break="no"/>tioned the figures. Why? Because it was part of 
     <lb/>
     his game. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Unless there are questions of

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am anxious to sit here and

     listen as long as he does not make charges of that

     <lb/>
     I will not stand for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That fact that you believe the

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When I presented the Economic

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These figures, of course, are not ours. They 
     <lb/>
     were handed by the Canadian experts to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland delegation to take home. And the Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa delegation apparently took these figures 
     <lb/>
     without even asking a word of explanation; never 
     <lb/>
     questioned them. They have no explanation to 
     <lb/>
     offer. I want to compliment Mr. Fogwill on the 
     <lb/>
     effort he made in dissecting these figures. I know, 
     <lb/>
     as a former minister of finance, what he was up 
     <lb/>
     against. He had to go through that Blue Book and 
     <lb/>
     he had to go through it from cover to cover, trying 
     <lb/>
     to prove his figures. We have no proof here. No

     Cashin. As an appointee of the Chair, it does not 
     <lb/>
     follow that he is the agent of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> These figures were handed by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian experts to the Newfoundland delega<lb break="no"/>tion to take home; and the Ottawa delegation took 
     <lb/>
     these figures without even asking a word of ex<lb break="no"/>planation. Mr. Smallwood eulogised these 
     <lb/>
     Canadian experts as individuals who knew more 
     <lb/>
     about our country than we do ourselves. We are 
     <lb/>
     sick and tired, Mr. Chairman, of hearing about 
     <lb/>
     experts in this country. Nicholas Murray Butler, 
     <lb/>
     the late President of Columbia University in New 
     <lb/>
     York gives the definition of an expert as follows: 
     <lb/>
     "An individual who knows more and more about 
     <lb/>
     less and less." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Anyhow, let us see how these estimates from 
     <lb/>
     these Canadian experts stand up against the hard 
     <lb/>
     facts. Today we are collecting $10.5 million an<lb break="no"/>nually in personal income tax, corporation tax, 
     <lb/>
     and death duties (or, as they call it in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     "succession duties"). The Canadians say that 
     <lb/>
     under confederation they expect to collect from 
     <lb/>
     these sources about $11 million annually. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I ask, is this reasonable? Is this an accurate es<lb break="no"/>timate in view of the actual position? The first 
     <lb/>
     point is that, under confederation, this particular 
     <lb/>
     field of taxation would be far larger than it is now. 
     <lb/>
     Also, the Canadian rate of taxation would be 
     <lb/>
     higher. Just consider, for instance, the matter of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland income tax. With us, this tax ap<lb break="no"/>plies to single persons earning over $1,000 year<lb break="no"/>ly. But in Canada it takes in everyone who is 
     <lb/>
     single and not married, earning over $750 yearly. 
     <lb/>
     In Newfoundland a married man does not pay 
     <lb/>
     income tax on earnings up to $2,000 yearly. In 
     <lb/>
     Canada, it takes in persons earning over $1,500 
     <lb/>
     annually. The ordinary clerk on Water Street 
     <lb/>
     earning $1,000 a year if he is a single man, or if 
     <lb/>
     he is a married man and earning $1,500, under 
     <lb/>
     the income tax law he is not allowed to put in his 
     <lb/>
     own income tax; the Canadian government does 
     <lb/>
     not trust the employee; it is deducted off his 
     <lb/>
     salary each month. In Canada today there is $80- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     odd million in refunds to be made, some of them 
     <lb/>
     to persons who are dead and buried and I hope 
     <lb/>
     are in heaven, and to whom the income tax 
     <lb/>
     refunds are no good. These were taken by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government and used during the past 
     <lb/>
     seven or eight years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Will not then this increase in the income tax 
  

            <cb/>
       

     brackets place hundreds, and possibly thousands 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundlanders under taxation who are now 
     <lb/>
     free? This means that under Canadian income tax 
     <lb/>
     laws, all fishermen, loggers, farmers, miners, 
     <lb/>
     longshoremen, labourers, stenographers, nurses 
     <lb/>
     and clerks who are single and earn over $750 
     <lb/>
     annually will be subject to income tax, and will 
     <lb/>
     not this increase the amount of taxes collected? 
     <lb/>
     The same applies to married people earning over 
     <lb/>
     $1,500 yearly. And does it not indicate that when 
     <lb/>
     these Canadian experts say that they expect to 
     <lb/>
     collect only $3.2 million from personal income 
     <lb/>
     tax annually, that the rest of it is incorrect? I asked 
     <lb/>
     about that the other day and the answer they gave 
     <lb/>
     me was evasive. They told me, in so many words, 
     <lb/>
     to read the Grey Book and I would get the infor<lb break="no"/>mation, as if I had not read it. The most insulting 
     <lb/>
     document that ever entered the doors of this 
     <lb/>
     assembly. Mr. Chairman, I say they will collect 
     <lb/>
     not less than $4 million annually or nearly $1 
     <lb/>
     million in excess of the figure they give. And the 
     <lb/>
     same thing applies to corporation tax and succes<lb break="no"/>sion duties, they will also be higher than the 
     <lb/>
     misleading figures given us. And there is another 
     <lb/>
     feature. With us, no death duties attach to life 
     <lb/>
     insurance policies made payable to beneficiaries. 
     <lb/>
     But this is not so in Canada. If we enter confeder<lb break="no"/>ation we will have to pay death duties or succes<lb break="no"/>sion duties on these policies. And we were told 
     <lb/>
     we were not going to have any new taxes! And 
     <lb/>
     as we know, in this country there are some 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands of dollars paid bene<lb break="no"/>ficiaries annually by Canadian life insurance 
     <lb/>
     companies. Here again we have an instance 
     <lb/>
     where, under confederation, new taxes would be 
     <lb/>
     imposed on Newfoundlanders, and consequently 
     <lb/>
     we have another source whereby the taxation 
     <lb/>
     payable to Canada would be increased. Mr. Fog<lb break="no"/>will made a breakdown of these taxes. The ex<lb break="no"/>perts did not come down here and tell us all about 
     <lb/>
     these taxes, neither did they give the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation any information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Smallwood said that there will be much 
     <lb/>
     duty free goods coming in here and that will 
     <lb/>
     decrease revenues correspondingly. I want to say 
     <lb/>
     that all kinds of goods are coming in here today 
     <lb/>
     and those goods originate in the United States — 
     <lb/>
     take cotton goods, steel products, Canada has to 
     <lb/>
     pay duty on them entering Canada. Did these 
     <lb/>
     experts take the invoices in the Customs? Did 
     <lb/>
     they get the points of origin of things? Certainly 
   

            <pb n="1064" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-07_Page_1064.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1064</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     not. They took the Blue Book and they guessed 
     <lb/>
     at them. Furthermore, are we to take it that be<lb break="no"/>cause Mr. Smallwood says so, that we will be 
     <lb/>
     importing our goods from Canada? Will we not 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to buy anywhere else? Why, last 
     <lb/>
     year, we imported $25 million worth of goods 
     <lb/>
     from the United States on which duties of not less 
     <lb/>
     than $3 million were paid — I am estimating that. 
     <lb/>
     I say they probably collected nearly $4 million; 
     <lb/>
     and those so-called experts say we will get $2 
     <lb/>
     million. And again on flour; we are told we will 
     <lb/>
     get it in duty free from Canada. That reminds me, 
     <lb/>
     in connection with flour coming into the country, 
     <lb/>
     the Canadians are tipping Newfoundlanders with 
     <lb/>
     the flour, because they are selling wheat in Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain for $1.50 a bushel, market price, and it is 
     <lb/>
     $3 a bushel in Newfoundland. We in New<lb break="no"/>foundland have been paying on wheat based at 
     <lb/>
     $3 a bushel; while in Great Britain they are 
     <lb/>
     paying on wheat based on $1.50 a bushel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They say they will collect $400,000 in liquor 
     <lb/>
     taxes. If you can tell me they were not guessing, 
     <lb/>
     I will eat my hat. In 1946-47 we collected over 
     <lb/>
     $1.5 million in taxes on liquor. I am glad I am 
     <lb/>
     talking on this liquor business. In Canada, they 
     <lb/>
     can never unload the Scotch manufactured in 
     <lb/>
     Canada on the Canadian people. The distillers, 
     <lb/>
     like Seagrams, have to pay $12 a gallon in the 
     <lb/>
     form of excise duties to the federal government. 
     <lb/>
     It is coming here duty free, but they forgot to put 
     <lb/>
     in the $12 a gallon they collect there. It was 
     <lb/>
     deliberately done or else they are not experts. The 
     <lb/>
     same thing applies to mm which they import 
     <lb/>
     from the West Indies; the duty is much higher 
     <lb/>
     than it is here at the present time. And again on 
     <lb/>
     cigarettes — take Lucky Strikes; they are 52 
     <lb/>
     cents to 55 cents in Canada. You do not hear them 
     <lb/>
     telling us that. Under confederation we will 
     <lb/>
     probably pay 20% or 25% more than we pay now. 
     <lb/>
     I have a package I bought here for 37 cents; I 
     <lb/>
     bought them in Montreal the other day for 44 
     <lb/>
     cents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Prior to that I referred to the significant fact 
     <lb/>
     that the gentleman who is now High Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner in Ottawa for the United Kingdom played 
     <lb/>
     a prominent part in the compilation of the in<lb break="no"/>famous Amulree Report; I gave his name, Sir 
     <lb/>
     Alexander Peter Clutterbuck. I understand that 
     <lb/>
     during our recess — I was out of the country — 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners went on the air and advised the 
     <lb/>
     people to vote in the referendum; they advised 
  

            <cb/>
        

     them on many things, but neither one of them told 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland what they were 
     <lb/>
     parties to and are continuing to be parties to, that 
     <lb/>
     is the violation of the 1933 agreement. They are 
     <lb/>
     more concerned — some of them — with refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the morals in St. John's East and St. John's 
     <lb/>
     West; whilst these violations are offences, they 
     <lb/>
     themselves violated the very statutes under 
     <lb/>
     which they exist. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, I think I have shown 
     <lb/>
     conclusively that based on our present financial 
     <lb/>
     and economic position, if Newfoundland entered 
     <lb/>
     into confederation Canada would stand to gain 
     <lb/>
     many billions of dollars annually over and above 
     <lb/>
     the subsidies paid to this Country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us for a moment refer to Annex IV of the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book which gives the possible expenditures 
     <lb/>
     of the federal government annually in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Great stress has been made by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood on the importance of the pay<lb break="no"/>ment of family allowances which are estimated 
     <lb/>
     to amount to $8.35 million yearly. I refer now to 
     <lb/>
     what is generally called the "baby bonus". To get 
     <lb/>
     to the root of this matter, it is necessary to give a 
     <lb/>
     somewhat brief history of how it was brought 
     <lb/>
     about in the Dominion of Canada. I go so far now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, as to term this piece of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     legislation the most immoral and corrupt enact<lb break="no"/>ment that has ever stained the pages of the 
     <lb/>
     statutes of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1944 the Mackenzie King government was 
     <lb/>
     on the verge of total collapse, because efforts 
     <lb/>
     were being made by many of its outstanding 
     <lb/>
     members to bring about conscription into the 
     <lb/>
     armed forces of Canada for the purpose of rein<lb break="no"/>forcing the Canadian army.... Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     King — who has always depended for his politi<lb break="no"/>cal support and his retention of the government 
     <lb/>
     on the political backing of the French province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec — was trying to dodge the conscription 
     <lb/>
     issue. He compromised, so to speak, with the 
     <lb/>
     French element in his party, putting through the 
     <lb/>
     conscription legislation; but on the other hand, in 
     <lb/>
     order to placate his followers and the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Quebec he introduced this Family 
     <lb/>
     Allowances Act, which is the "baby bonus" legis<lb break="no"/>lation. This particular legislation was introduced 
     <lb/>
     principally forthe purpose of healing the political 
     <lb/>
     sore which was created in the French Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec by the passing of the Conscription Act, 
     <lb/>
     which compelled the French Canadians to join 
  

            <pb n="1065" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-07_Page_1065.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1065</fw>
           

     the various armed forces of Canada — it being a 
     <lb/>
     well-known fact that the people of French 
     <lb/>
     Canada were not enthusiastic to take part in any 
     <lb/>
     wars that did not involve their homeland directly. 
     <lb/>
     Mind you, there were several outstanding French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian regiments, but it is generally speaking 
     <lb/>
     I am talking about. The same thing applied to the 
     <lb/>
     First World War. This corrupt legislation has cost 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian nation and the Canadian taxpayers 
     <lb/>
     over $200 million annually. The same immoral 
     <lb/>
     legislation is now being held out as a bait to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to induce them to join 
     <lb/>
     the federal union; but I would like to point out 
     <lb/>
     that there is no definite indication that this par<lb break="no"/>ticular legislation will be continued. As a matter 
     <lb/>
     of fact, there are thousands of Canadian citizens 
     <lb/>
     throughout the entire Dominion of Canada who 
     <lb/>
     are advocating its repeal. And in view of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that Canada is today in a difficult financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion, having to impose further taxation on its 
     <lb/>
     already over-taxed people, it is not unlikely that 
     <lb/>
     this legislation will be stricken from the statutes 
     <lb/>
     within a very short period. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Nonsense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is not nonsense. If that is all you 
     <lb/>
     have to offer, it ought to be thrown out through 
     <lb/>
     the window. Go into the Province of Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     see what you will find. Everyone who knows 
     <lb/>
     anything about the legislation, knows they are 
     <lb/>
     only doing it for political purposes. Prime Mini<lb break="no"/>ster King had to do that, otherwise he would have 
     <lb/>
     had to resign. And incidentally, he was defeated 
     <lb/>
     in his own constituency of Prince Albert. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This particular feature of the proposals for the 
     <lb/>
     union of Newfoundland with Canada is being 
     <lb/>
     stressed with every effort by the advocates of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. They feel that it is the one bright 
     <lb/>
     spot in their annexation platform. They realise 
     <lb/>
     that the other terms of union have no basic or 
     <lb/>
     solid foundation, and at every opportunity that is 
     <lb/>
     afforded them, they try to drill into the minds of 
     <lb/>
     our people that once they become a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada all our difficulties will be ended, and the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people will at last have entered 
     <lb/>
     into a land of milk and honey. They conveniently 
     <lb/>
     forget that the taxpayers of the country will be 
     <lb/>
     compelled to find these fictitious monies through 
     <lb/>
     either direct or indirect taxation. One would im<lb break="no"/>agine to hear some of these people talk, that 
     <lb/>
     money is growing on trees. They deliberately try 
     <lb/>
     to avoid discussing the present average tax of 
   

            <cb/>
        

     Canada as compared with the average tax of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, which as I have already said, is 
     <lb/>
     favourable to Newfoundland in the amount of 
     <lb/>
     $110 per head for every man, woman and child 
     <lb/>
     in the country. Let me repeat and further em<lb break="no"/>phasise the fact that union with Canada means 
     <lb/>
     extra taxation on our people of an additional $35 
     <lb/>
     million annually. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us make a brief review of the Old Age 
     <lb/>
    Pension Act as it exists and functions in Canada. 
     <lb/>A man or woman, to become eligible for this 
     <lb/>stipend, must be practically a pauper, and then 
     <lb/>before he or she receives this $30 per month 
     <lb/>allowance, he or she must assign to the federal 
     <lb/>government any property or assets they may 
     <lb/>have; which in the event of death is taken over by 
     <lb/>the Canadian government and sold in order to 
     <lb/>repay the federal treasury the amount so paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You will have plenty of opportunity 
     <lb/>to reply to me later. We can get the act. The 
     <lb/>people of Canada are raising Cain over the means 
     <lb/>test. It is wrong to give a man an old age pension 
     <lb/>if when he dies the government takes his estate, 
     <lb/>unless he violates a law and has it made over to 
     <lb/>his successor some years before. It is an induce<lb break="no"/>ment to law-breaking. In our Economic Report 
     <lb/>we outlined a plan whereby we would be in a 
     <lb/>position to supplement our present old age pen<lb break="no"/>sions scheme to bring the stipend up to $25 per 
     <lb/>month. But never in the history of our country, 
     <lb/>since the old age pension was first instituted some 
     <lb/>40 years ago, has the pensioner been compelled 
     <lb/>to assign or mortgage his properties or assets to 
     <lb/>the government in order to become eligible for 
     <lb/>this pension. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Also, with respect to the unemployment in<lb break="no"/>surance scheme now in force in Canada, it is 
     <lb/>
     proper that our people should know that those 
     <lb/>
     affected or those eligible for recompense under 
     <lb/>
     this particular plan, in the event of union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, would not be our primary producers. It 
     <lb/>
     does not affect our fishermen, our loggers, our 
     <lb/>
     miners, our farmers, our longshoremen or others 
     <lb/>
     of the labouring class, and consequently would 
     <lb/>
     be of little help to the employed of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we refer now to the probable expenditures 
     <lb/>
     under Annex IV, we find that the sum of $9.4 
     <lb/>
     million is set down to be spent by the federal 
     <lb/>
     government annually in what they term "Other 
   

            <pb n="1066" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-07_Page_1066.jpg"/>

     Department Expenditures". It took a question 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. Hollett to get some information on it. I 
     <lb/>
     have not seen the answer. Here is the position I 
     <lb/>
     take: the members of the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     looked at this $9 million, surely they should have 
     <lb/>
     asked about it. They took what they gave them 
     <lb/>
     and brought it home. That is the way it appears. 
     <lb/>
     We have asked the Ottawa delegation to give us 
     <lb/>
     some idea of what these expenditures would be, 
     <lb/>
     and through what particular channels the monies 
     <lb/>
     will be disbursed, but they have failed to give us 
     <lb/>
     any concrete answer. They do not know definite<lb break="no"/>ly and can only surmise. Again I am forced to 
     <lb/>
     point out that nearly all the estimates contained 
     <lb/>
     in these Canadian proposals, given us through the 
     <lb/>
     efforts of the Ottawa delegation on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission government, are absolutely fic<lb break="no"/>titious and most unreliable. They are based on 
     <lb/>
     nothing concrete. The Ottawa delegation, 
     <lb/>
     through Mr. Smallwood, has admitted to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention that these estimates of both revenues 
     <lb/>
     and expenditures contained in the Grey Book 
     <lb/>
     were prepared by the federal government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada months before the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegation went to Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I never said that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You told us that in the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee. Mr, Higgins, Mr. Hollett and Mr.

     <lb/>
     the truth. We will have a showdown on this.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do recall a statement that 
     <lb/>something was prepared; but frankly, honestly, I 
     <lb/>do not recall at what period it was prepared.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is too bad we do not keep minutes

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Let me first say that I said at the 
     <lb/>
     Steering Committee that the bulk of the material 
     <lb/>
     given to us by the Canadians was prepared long 
     <lb/>
     before we arrived. The first public meeting was 
     <lb/>
     held that afternoon. They presented us with two 
     <lb/>
     volumes of black books; not these Black Books. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Where are they? They are not the 
     <lb/>same. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is smart. You do not want 
     <lb/>
     the solid truth. You want to get off a few gags. I 
     <lb/>
     am not dumb. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You are not dumb — you occupied 
     <lb/>
     70% of the time in this Convention, talking for 
     <lb/>
     the last 16 months. I wonder, Mr. Chairman, on 
     <lb/>
     what authority or on what basis were these 
     <lb/>
     figures prepared by the Ottawa experts. Who 
  

            <cb/>
          

     asked the Canadian government to have these 
     <lb/>
     estimates prepared? On what supposition did the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government anticipate a delegation 
     <lb/>
     from this Convention? When Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     went to Ottawa shortly after the Convention elec<lb break="no"/>tion in July, 1946, did he inform the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government that such a delegation would be 
     <lb/>
     forthcoming and did he request the Ottawa ex<lb break="no"/>perts to prepare these estimates at that time? Is it 
     <lb/>
     not conclusive proof, Mr. Chairman, that this 
     <lb/>
     whole confederation idea had been planned long 
     <lb/>
     before this Convention met here over 16 months 
     <lb/>
     ago? Is it not just a further confirmation of the 
     <lb/>
     facts of history, that it has been the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     imperial government for nearly 80 years to force 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into confederation? Is it not 
     <lb/>
     definite proof of this whole scandalous transac<lb break="no"/>tion, and that the Commission government, who 
     <lb/>
     are the local agents in Newfoundland for the 
     <lb/>
     British government, are aiding and abetting the 
     <lb/>
     present move? Let me repeat what I have fre<lb break="no"/>quently stated before: that if this is not the case, 
     <lb/>
     why has not the United Kingdom government 
     <lb/>
     carried out its solemn agreement made with the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government in 1933? Lord Ad<lb break="no"/>dison refused to tell us when he was confronted 
     <lb/>
     with this matter in London last May. Is it a case 
     <lb/>
     of the British government treating its sacred 
     <lb/>
     pledges to one of her own dominions as just 
     <lb/>
     merely another scrap of paper? If that is not so, 
     <lb/>
     then will someone tell me why this particular 
     <lb/>
     agreement has not been carried out? I appeal to 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency the Governor to come out and tell 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland why His Majesty's 
     <lb/>
     Government in the United Kingdom has failed to 
     <lb/>
     keep its promise to the Newfoundland people. In 
     <lb/>
     that agreement there was no mention made of 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada, conventions or pleb<lb break="no"/>iscites. The people of this country are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     know the truth in this respect and I know of no 
     <lb/>
     other person in the country today more capable 
     <lb/>
     of telling them the truth than His Majesty's rep<lb break="no"/>resentative. The time has arrived, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     when all cards should be laid on the table and this 
     <lb/>
     trifling with the people and their rights should 
     <lb/>
     cease immediately. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are niggers in the woodpile somewhere, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, and I think that after 16 months 
     <lb/>
     existence of this National Convention, the 
     <lb/>
     delegates here today know that the niggers are the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government and the Canadian

     government. Mr. Chairman, if I were as ardent a 
     <lb/>
     confederate as Mr. Smallwood, I would go out 
     <lb/>
     and campaign vigorously for the carrying out of 
     <lb/>
     the agreement of 1933, and then I would further 
     <lb/>
     campaign this country in the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     retention of Commission of Government. I would 
     <lb/>
     do this because I feel sure that it is the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom government, the historical 
     <lb/>
     imperial policy, that Newfoundland must be<lb break="no"/>come a part of Canada. I would campaign, if I 
     <lb/>
     were Mr. Smallwood, for the retention of Com<lb break="no"/>mission government, because I would feel confi<lb break="no"/>dent that the Commission government, through 
     <lb/>
     its bosses in Downing Street, would hand this 
     <lb/>
     country over to Canada, lock, stock and barrel, 
     <lb/>
     within six months after the referendum was 
     <lb/>
     taken, should the people decide to continue under 
     <lb/>
     commission form of government. I challenge any 
     <lb/>
     member of the Commission government, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly do I challenge the representative of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom government on that 
     <lb/>
     Commission, to come out openly and honestly 
     <lb/>
     and tell the people that their bosses in Downing 
     <lb/>
     Street are not using their efforts to bring 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into union with the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. If they deny that such is the case, then I 
     <lb/>
     say to them, each and every member of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission government: tell us why you are not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to carry out your agreement with the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, and why you have been 
     <lb/>
     spending and are continuing to spend the money 
     <lb/>
     belonging to the people of Newfoundland like a 
     <lb/>
     bunch of drunken sailors, which in my opinion is 
     <lb/>
     being done for the sole purpose of trying to break 
     <lb/>
     our country. Take up this morning's paper — the 
     <lb/>
     revenue and expenditures are given — $31.6 
     <lb/>
     million in revenue and practically the same in 
     <lb/>
     expenditure for nine months; and an indication 
     <lb/>
     given by the Commissioner of Finance, that we 
     <lb/>
     are going to have a deficit this year on a $40 
     <lb/>
     million revenue. What is that but deliberately 
     <lb/>
     squandering the taxpayers' money, and it is being 
     <lb/>
     done purposely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I go further now and state, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     the financial policy of the Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment is more or less being run from Ottawa at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. We all know that because of the 
     <lb/>
     financial difficulties of the Canadian nation, with 
     <lb/>
     particular emphasis on its shortage of American 
     <lb/>
     dollars, that an austerity program has been 
     <lb/>
     launched in order to conserve United States dol<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
       lars; that heavy increases in taxation have been 
     <lb/>
     imposed; that Canadians travelling between 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United States are at present being 
     <lb/>
     subjected by Canadian Customs officials to the 
     <lb/>
     most undignified examination of their person and 
     <lb/>
     their personal belongings, which treatment is also 
     <lb/>
     being meted out to Newfoundland citizens 
     <lb/>
     travelling between Canada and the Untied States 
     <lb/>
     on their own business with their own money. This 
     <lb/>
     policy is now being felt right here in our own 
     <lb/>
     country, despite the fact that Newfoundland has 
     <lb/>
     a favourable balance of trade with the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Now here is the position. All the newsprint 
     <lb/>
     is sold in American funds, plus all the ore from 
     <lb/>
     Buchans. At least $40 million of American funds 
     <lb/>
     coming out of Newfoundland, whereas we buy 
     <lb/>
     very little, $20 million or $25 million from the 
     <lb/>
     United States, therefore we have a credit which 
     <lb/>
     Canada benefits from, and our people are being 
     <lb/>
     subjected to undignified search in case they have 
     <lb/>
     a $20 American bill stuck down in their sock or 
     <lb/>
     anything like that. Their own money. An an<lb break="no"/>nouncement has been made from Ottawa that this 
     <lb/>
     policy will be continued until 1950. Again with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the controlling of our finances by 
     <lb/>
     Canadian politicians, I would like to bring your 
     <lb/>
     minds back to February, 1943, when the Com<lb break="no"/>mission government imposed the retroactive in<lb break="no"/>come tax legislation. You yourself, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, as a member of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Board of Trade, proposed a motion at a public 
     <lb/>
     meeting of that body condemning such iniquitous 
     <lb/>
     and dictatorial legislation. Let me tell you, sir, 
     <lb/>
     and let me tell the people of Newfoundland, that 
     <lb/>
     this particular legislation, what I would term im<lb break="no"/>moral legislation, was enacted at the instance of 
     <lb/>
     the then Canadian finance minister, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of curbing inflation. The people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, who include the businessmen as well 
     <lb/>
     as the ordinary workers, were reaping rewards 
     <lb/>
     which has been due them for over 80 years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have heard people saying that all our 
     <lb/>
     prosperity was due to the war. Why 80 years ago 
     <lb/>
     this base construction was recommended to the 
     <lb/>
     British government, but it took them 80 years to 
     <lb/>
     find out the importance of the country. Our 
     <lb/>
     people had just emerged from untold suffering 
     <lb/>
     and privation. Their every belonging had been 
     <lb/>
     swept away during the depression of the 30s. 
     <lb/>
     They had been forced to exist on six cents a day 
     <lb/>
     for nearly ten years. The construction of 


            <pb n="1068" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-07_Page_1068.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1068</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     American bases in the country brought the first 
     <lb/>
     real money we had seen for over ten years. They 
     <lb/>
     were making efforts to rehabilitate themselves. 
     <lb/>
     But the Canadian government, in order to bolster 
     <lb/>
     up its own financial position, influenced the 
     <lb/>
     Commission government to inaugurate this vi<lb break="no"/>cious and immoral legislation. Now again the 
     <lb/>
     story repeats itself, and we find the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government again financially embarrassed, and 
     <lb/>
     they are compelled to stoop to a low level in order 
     <lb/>
     to curb our disbursement of our own moneys. Let 
     <lb/>
     me also remind you, Mr. Chairman, that just a 
     <lb/>
     few months ago, the financial position of Canada 
     <lb/>
     became so acute that she was forced to seek aid 
     <lb/>
     from the American government. Yesterday, in 
     <lb/>
     answer to a question which I placed I received an 
     <lb/>
     answer, or the Convention did, from the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, an evasive answer, to the 
     <lb/>
     effect that they had made arrangements with the 
     <lb/>
     International Bank for $3 million. But they did 
     <lb/>
     not tell the truth. My question was, "How much 
     <lb/>
     did they apply for from the Americans, and how 
     <lb/>
     much did they receive?" The Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment asked for a temporary loan of around $700 
     <lb/>
     million but received temporary assistance by way 
     <lb/>
     of a loan of $300 million. This is the country with 
     <lb/>
     which we, as a solvent and prosperous people, are 
     <lb/>
     now asked to enter into partnership. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I enter into discussion of the attempted 
     <lb/>
     fictitious budget presented by Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     over a month ago, which purports to cover the 
     <lb/>
     administration of the affairs of Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     a province, let me make a sort of recapitulation 
     <lb/>
     of the moneys and assets which would accrue to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government, as well as the disbur<lb break="no"/>sements which will be made by that government 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, should we unite with Canada 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have stated that the amount of $20 million 
     <lb/>
     shown in Annex IV of the Grey Book is not 
     <lb/>
     correct. In my opinion the amount would be 
     <lb/>
     closer to $30 million annually in the form of 
     <lb/>
     revenue that would be collected by the federal 
     <lb/>
     government. The Canadian government would 
     <lb/>
     assume our sterling debt, which would amount to 
     <lb/>
     some $64 million. This sterling debt would be 
     <lb/>
     added to the national debt of Canada, and it 
     <lb/>
     would appear that the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would not be liable for the interest and sinking 
     <lb/>
     fund, as well as the final payment of the principal 
     <lb/>
     and interest. If that is not trying to deceive our 
     <lb/>
     people, I don't know what is. It really means that 
  

            <cb/>
         

     the people of Canada would assume an additional 
     <lb/>
     $5 per capita debt, whilst the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would assume a per capita debt of over 
     <lb/>
     $1,400 as against a present per capita debt of 
     <lb/>
     slightly over $250. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Canadian government according to the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book would assume the responsibility for 
     <lb/>
     the operation of our railway and general transpor<lb break="no"/>tation system, which includes coastal boats, etc. 
     <lb/>
     However, the Canadian government does not 
     <lb/>
     agree, either in the Black Books or the Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book, to keep up our present railway schedule or 
     <lb/>
     coastal boat schedules. Yesterday afternoon Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood was trying to tangle up my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fogwill in connection with the figures he had in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the 15% tax on passengers, 
     <lb/>
     pointing out, he said, that the rate in Canada was 
     <lb/>
     3 1/2 cents, while it was 5-7 cents here. He forgot 
     <lb/>
     to tell us that at the present time both the CNR 
     <lb/>
     and the Canadian Pacific are trying to get an 
     <lb/>
     increase amounting to 30%, which, if you add it 
     <lb/>
     to 3 1/2 cents would bring it close up to 5 cents. I 
     <lb/>
     think he estimated $400,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> $400,000 total, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I figure he is $100,000 short. You 
     <lb/>
     have not been able to figure it out. We have got 
     <lb/>
     to take into consideration that every man who 
     <lb/>
     goes on a bus from here to Carbonear has to pay 
     <lb/>
     15% on his ticket, and every man travelling on 
     <lb/>
     TCA and the Furness boats and everything else 
     <lb/>
     coming into this country. It would be interesting 
     <lb/>
     to find out the total monies paid by our people 
     <lb/>
     annually for transportation. I am sure the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government do not know. Everything 
     <lb/>
     is grand with the Canadian government. Neither 
     <lb/>
     does it agree to maintain our present Railway 
     <lb/>
     employees in their jobs or agree to the present 
     <lb/>
     pension system of our Railway workers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, it does. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No. Rather has the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government indicated to us that it would be their 
     <lb/>
     policy to dispense with a large number of our 
     <lb/>
     Railway workers, and thereby create consider<lb break="no"/>able unemployment. In this connection I quote 
     <lb/>
     from one of the so-called secret documents sup<lb break="no"/>plied the Ottawa delegation by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     authorities. This is what the Canadian delegation 
     <lb/>
     told me, and I remember that when Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     brought it up he said it was not official, what was 
     <lb/>
     official was in the Black Books:

            <p>And they tell us they would be offered employ<lb break="no"/>ment by the CNR. Where? Vancouver or St. 
     <lb/>John's? Would they have to pick up their things 
     <lb/>and move out of here? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of this and in view of the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     General Manager of the Railway has indicated 
     <lb/>
     that once our present capital expenditures are 
     <lb/>
     completed, the Railway and its various subsid<lb break="no"/>iaries would be operated at a loss of not more than 
     <lb/>
     $750,000 annually, we must draw the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that under the management of the Canadian Na<lb break="no"/>tional Railway system, the railway accounts 
     <lb/>
     would be balanced and that no deficits would be 
     <lb/>
     incurred. Therefore in federal revenues the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government would collect an amount 
     <lb/>
     of not less than $30 million annually. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now what amount does the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment propose to spend annually in New<lb break="no"/>foundland? We have no definite information on 
     <lb/>
     this matter beyond what appears in Annex IV in 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book (and the reply which Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     received yesterday, which was very indefinite), 
     <lb/>
     which states that including subsidies the federal 
     <lb/>
     government would spend in Newfoundland some 
     <lb/>
     $27 million annually. This includes $8.35 million 
     <lb/>
     in family allowances which amount may, and 
     <lb/>
     probably will, be eliminated very shortly. I have 
     <lb/>
     already referred to this matter in the early part of 
     <lb/>
     this address. However, the amount of $27 million 
     <lb/>
     does not include $3.5 million transitional grant, 
     <lb/>
     which in my opinion is nothing more or less than 
     <lb/>
     a "coaxer", or attempted bribe to influence our 
     <lb/>
     people to join Canada. It is not a permanent grant, 
     <lb/>
     as it expires within 12 years. Therefore, in addi<lb break="no"/>tion to taking over all our assets, which I estimate 
     <lb/>
     are worth not less than $120 million and which 
     <lb/>
     would be under Canadian control, the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government would make an annual profit on the 
     <lb/>
     administration of Newfoundland of around $3 
     <lb/>
     million. Yesterday Mr. Higgins had a reply to a 
     <lb/>
     question as to what they could replace all these 
     <lb/>
     things for, what it would cost, and everything. 
     <lb/>
     The Commission government had not brains 
     <lb/>
     enough to figure it out, because he had a nil 


            <cb/>
         

     answer. This does not take into account any 
     <lb/>
     profits that may accrue from the development of 
     <lb/>
     our Labrador iron properties or the further 
     <lb/>
     development of our forest industries on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. Neither does it include any possible 
     <lb/>
     revenues that may accrue from the earnings of 
     <lb/>
     those people who would be employed in the 
     <lb/>
     development of those industries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another possible source of revenue for 
     <lb/>
     Canada, or if not revenue we will call it bargain<lb break="no"/>ing power, has not been taken into consideration. 
     <lb/>
     I refer now to the American bases located in our 
     <lb/>
     country, the 99-year leases of which were granted 
     <lb/>
     the American government by the government of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom during the latter part of 
     <lb/>
     1941. During the course of this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     many questions have been asked and addressed 
     <lb/>
     to the Commission of Government, requesting 
     <lb/>
     information which we thought would be neces<lb break="no"/>sary for our deliberations, and many times we 
     <lb/>
     have failed to receive satisfactory answers. In 
     <lb/>
     some instances we were practically told to mind 
     <lb/>
     our own business. It was therefore with some 
     <lb/>
     surprise that I noticed that Mr. Hollett had suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in dragging forth an answer to his ques<lb break="no"/>tion respecting the position of our military bases, 
     <lb/>
     if and when Newfoundland should enter con<lb break="no"/>federation with Canada.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you know, the text of this answer is that in 
     <lb/>
     such an event, the Government of Canada would 
     <lb/>
     replace the Government of Newfoundland as the 
     <lb/>
     lessor of these bases. I regard this position as most 
     <lb/>
     significant, because what does it mean? It means 
     <lb/>
     this: in the event of confederation, New<lb break="no"/>foundland would lose all and every right, 
     <lb/>
     privilege, and benefit which might have been 
     <lb/>
     otherwise hers. Our people, the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, would be finally and absolutely 
     <lb/>
     deprived of all opportunity of capitalising on our 
     <lb/>
     leased territories. And in this connection, it must 
     <lb/>
     be remembered that it was one of our hopes to be 
     <lb/>
     able to use our rights in these bases as an impor<lb break="no"/>tant bargaining power in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     possible export of our fish and other products to 
     <lb/>
     the American market. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now this is but one phase of the matter. There 
     <lb/>
     is another one which to me at least seems of even 
     <lb/>
     greater importance. It is a well known fact that 
     <lb/>
     during 1946 a mutual defence pact was made 
     <lb/>
     between Canada and the USA relating to the 
     <lb/>
     defence of North America. And under the terms 


            <pb n="1070" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-07_Page_1070.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1070</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     of this pact it was provided that Canada would 
     <lb/>
     control and maintain all defense locations under 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian flag. What does this mean? It means 
     <lb/>
     that all military, naval and air bases in this 
     <lb/>
     country would be occupied by Canadian forces. 
     <lb/>
     It would mean that all Americans would be 
     <lb/>
     evacuated. It would mean that some $3,500 or 
     <lb/>
     more Newfoundlanders now employed on the 
     <lb/>
     American bases would be in jeopardy of losing 
     <lb/>
     their jobs. It would mean that this country would 
     <lb/>
     be deprived of the very considerable amount of 
     <lb/>
     American dollars which are now being expended 
     <lb/>
     and circulated. Of course, such a set-up should be 
     <lb/>
     highly profitable to Canada, inasmuch as it would 
     <lb/>
     consist of her receiving a free gift, as it were: after 
     <lb/>
     all we have given them for nothing — the Torbay 
     <lb/>
     airport and the Goose Bay airport.

     to bring the matter to the attention of the

     as evidence of gross neglect and dereliction in 
     <lb/>
     their duty of protecting and safeguarding the

     interests of Newfoundland. But it would seem

     that as far as Ottawa is concerned, the rights of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland are of no importance whatever in

     this one-sided contract which they have sent to

     of an adverse nature, I question whether we have 
     <lb/>
     not in this instance alone grounds, ample

     <lb/>vicinity of $30 million. According to the 
     <lb/>Economic Report it was $40 million, but it is $38

     <lb/>However, we will use Mr. Smallwood's figures

     <lb/>Nevertheless, we must remember that with the

     unspent portion thereof at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     eight-year period to become available for the 
     <lb/>
     unrestricted use of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     In view of this, it is seen that under these 
     <lb/>
     proposed terms of union that $10 million of this 
     <lb/>
     accumulated surplus at the time of union shall be 
     <lb/>
     set aside either in trust or on deposit with the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada at Newfoundland's op<lb break="no"/>tion, withdrawable by the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment as required, only for expenditures on 
     <lb/>
     current account. Therefore $20 million of this 
     <lb/>
     surplus remains. Nearly $10 million of this 
     <lb/>
     money is now to our credit in London in the form 
     <lb/>
     of interest—free loans to the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government, and therefore it will become neces<lb break="no"/>sary to convert this money to dollar currency, and 
     <lb/>
     no provision has been made for this in the 
     <lb/>
     proposals now before us. Mr. Smallwood tells us 
     <lb/>
     in an offhand way that he feels confident that it 
     <lb/>
     can be arranged. The Canadian government does 
     <lb/>
     not undertake to do this, either in the Black Books 
     <lb/>
     or the Grey Book. We therefore, under these 
     <lb/>
     arrangements find ourselves in the position 
     <lb/>
     where $10 million has to be set aside in trust for 
     <lb/>
     current expenditures and another $10 million is 
     <lb/>
     located in England, and no undertaking to con<lb break="no"/>vert it to dollars. Therefore, there is only another 
     <lb/>
     $10 million available. Now, of this latter $10 
     <lb/>
     million, at least $6 million will be necessary for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of payment of fish this past year; so 
     <lb/>
     out of all our surplus there will remain only $4 
     <lb/>
     million available in actual dollar currency for 
     <lb/>
     purposes of capital expenditure. This means that 
     <lb/>
     $16 million of our surpluses is now held in ster<lb break="no"/>ling and there is no indication when it will be 
     <lb/>
     converted into dollars. 1 would like to know how 
     <lb/>
     much money has been paid for the conversion of 
     <lb/>
     sterling as payments for fish, particularly in View 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that in recent weeks the government 
     <lb/>
     has made available to Italy considerable money, 
     <lb/>
     and it would have been necessary for us to find 
     <lb/>
     dollar currency for Italian fish. These are matters 
     <lb/>
     one can only get if in contact with the government 
     <lb/>
     daily. We all know the difficulties that the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government are having with regard to 
     <lb/>
     dollar currency, but even despite the shortage in 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain of American dollars, they have 
     <lb/>
     been compelled to help Canada with American 
     <lb/>
     dollars during the past 12 months, and when Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Dalton was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he 
     <lb/>
     made a public pronouncement to the effect that 


            <cb/>
     

     Canada was in just as great a need of American 
     <lb/>
     dollars as Great Britain. However, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood may have something up his sleeve in 
     <lb/>
     this respect, for if we follow his explanations of 
     <lb/>
     all these matters we must conclude that he has 
     <lb/>
     been appointed the representative of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government as well as the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government. However, I feel certain that any 
     <lb/>
     such statements made by Mr. Smallwood have 
     <lb/>
     been based purely on personal opinions, and that 
     <lb/>
     he has no foundation in fact for any of these wild 
     <lb/>
     statements he has been making. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then again, I am forced to refer to the present 
     <lb/>
     serious financial predicament in which Canada 
     <lb/>
     finds herself. It is only a couple of months ago, 
     <lb/>
     whilst Prime Minister King was on an official 
     <lb/>
     visit to England, that serious steps had to be taken 
     <lb/>
     by the Canadian government to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     financial position. As a matter of fact, unprece<lb break="no"/>dented steps were taken. These were the restric<lb break="no"/>tions of the purchase by Canadians of a long list 
     <lb/>
     of consumer goods from the United States. In 
     <lb/>
     addition, extra taxation had to be placed upon 
     <lb/>
     consumer goods at home and all this was done by 
     <lb/>
     minute of council. Now it is well known that 
     <lb/>
     under British procedure, no taxation can be legis<lb break="no"/>lated for by minute of council. Such legislation 
     <lb/>
     must be passed by Parliament. We had it happen 
     <lb/>
     here over 50 years ago — an incident whereby a 
     <lb/>
     certain gentleman who was in public life went 
     <lb/>
     down on the wharf and took goods off it because 
     <lb/>
     the budget had not been passed and he got away 
     <lb/>
     without paying any duty. Some of their relatives 
     <lb/>
     occupy high positions in the present set-up of our 
     <lb/>
     civil service. However, I ran into conflict before, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not want to do it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I said a moment ago, the situation was so 
     <lb/>
     serious that this present austerity programme was 
     <lb/>
     instituted by the Canadian cabinet and at the 
     <lb/>
     present time it is being fought bitterly in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian House of Commons. Canada had ap<lb break="no"/>plied many months ago for a loan of $800,000 in 
     <lb/>
     the United States and was forced to accept a 
     <lb/>
     temporary loan of but $300,000. In addition, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railway, which is seeking a 
     <lb/>
     loan of some $60 million from the public, has 
     <lb/>
     been forced to withdraw the application for such 
     <lb/>
     loan temporarily because underwriters' offers 
     <lb/>
     were unsatisfactory, according to reliable reports. 
     <lb/>
     In view therefore of these known facts, how are 
     <lb/>
     we to expect the Canadian government to be in a 
  

            <pb n="1072" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-07_Page_1072.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1072</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     position to convert this $16 million now owed us 
     <lb/>
     by the United Kingdom, when the records show 
     <lb/>
     us conclusively that Canada is on the hard dark 
     <lb/>
     road of austerity herself, and is at present, 
     <lb/>
     through the medium of Canadian banks operating 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, taking advantage of our credit 
     <lb/>
     balance of American dollars to bolster up her own 
     <lb/>
     credit. In my opinion this whole matter is a matter 
     <lb/>
     of such serious importance that I consider that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention as a body is not competent to 
     <lb/>
     deal with it. It is a matter for proper negotiation 
     <lb/>
     between two governments elected by the people 
     <lb/>
     of both countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again I state that this confederation issue has 
     <lb/>
     been deliberately engineered by both the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government and the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment for the purpose of confusing the minds of 
     <lb/>
     our people in such a way as to convey to the world 
     <lb/>
     that we Newfoundlanders do not know what we 
     <lb/>
     want, what we really want in the form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. People have come out from England during 
     <lb/>
     the past five or six years and went back, and said 
     <lb/>
     that we do not know what we want, and that is 
     <lb/>
     the way they want to keep us. It is a definite 
     <lb/>
     violation of the solemn pact made between the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the United Kingdom in 1933, and we as 
     <lb/>
     delegates to this National Convention have made 
     <lb/>
     ourselves parties to the violation of that agree<lb break="no"/>ment. Today, many of our people have forgotten 
     <lb/>
     about this agreement of 1933, but there are a great 
     <lb/>
     number of those who voted for that legislation in 
     <lb/>
     1933 still in this country, several of whom now 
     <lb/>
     occupy positions of trust in the service of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I hold that these gentlemen who voted 
     <lb/>
     for that legislation in 1933 should now come 
     <lb/>
     forward in the interest of the country and give to 
     <lb/>
     our people the particulars of what happened at 
     <lb/>
     that time — what undertakings, if any, were 
     <lb/>
     given regarding the passing of this legislation I 
     <lb/>
     say, sir, that these gentlemen should come for<lb break="no"/>ward now and make public what transpired, un<lb break="no"/>less they also are prepared to see a solemn 
     <lb/>
     agreement to which they were a party, unless they 
     <lb/>
     too wish to witness that solemn pact being ground 
     <lb/>
     in the mud under the iron heel of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are drawing a conclusion. 
     <lb/>
     You are on thin ice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That is my personal opinion as a 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander, and I am entitled to it. They 


            <cb/>
         

     should come forward and tell the people what 
     <lb/>
     actually transpired and what was the under<lb break="no"/>standing in 1933. I will go further and say that if 
     <lb/>
     they do not come forward, if they fail to do that, 
     <lb/>
     then they fail in their duty to the country and to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country and will be considered 
     <lb/>
     as such. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I have stated before, the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     brought back no report to this Convention. The 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation has not been able to supply us 
     <lb/>
     with any definite or concrete replies to our 
     <lb/>
     numerous questions. There has been no effort by 
     <lb/>
     any other delegate of that delegation to enlighten 
     <lb/>
     us in any way with the exception of what we have 
     <lb/>
     been told by Mr. Smallwood. And even Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has admitted to the Convention and 
     <lb/>
     to the people of the country that these various 
     <lb/>
     estimates of expenditures and revenues were 
     <lb/>
     prepared for the Newfoundland delegation 
     <lb/>
     months before they arrived in Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have not. That is not true. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We have not received any explana<lb break="no"/>tion of this from any other member of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>delegation and we can only surmise that the Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa government had been supplied with various 
     <lb/>statistical information in advance by the Com<lb break="no"/>mission government. It is therefore apparent that 
     <lb/>the Ottawa delegation were acting more or less 
     <lb/>as a sort of international brokerage association on 
     <lb/>behalf of the Commission of Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. The Ottawa 
     <lb/>delegation was sent to Ottawa by this Convention 
     <lb/>and acted for this Convention, not as agents of 
     <lb/>the Commission of Government. I ask him to take 
     <lb/>that back. If he is fair, he will retract that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The actual position is this: this

     anticipated revenue and expenditure of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland provincial government. This docu<lb break="no"/>ment, by the way, is not presented on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation, but rather by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood himself, and we must therefore con<lb break="no"/>clude that the Ottawa delegation had no act or 
     <lb/>
     part in its compilation. At the outset, let me say 
     <lb/>
     that in my 25 years experience as a member of 
     <lb/>
     the House of Assembly, and as a close student of 
     <lb/>
     our financial affairs — after having read every 
     <lb/>
     budget speech since 1909, Imust confess that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's attempt displays the most glaring 
     <lb/>
     and highfiying attempt at "frenzied finance" that 
     <lb/>
     I have ever witnessed. Well do we remember Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's deliberate attempt to belittle the 
     <lb/>
     efforts of the Finance Committee in its presenta<lb break="no"/>tion of both the Financial and Economic Report, 
     <lb/>
     how he used every conceivable method to show 
     <lb/>
     to the country the hopelessness of our financial 
     <lb/>
     and economic position; now he has the gall to 
     <lb/>
     attempt to shove down the throats of the delegates 
     <lb/>
     and the people of Newfoundland this proposed 
     <lb/>
     provincial budget, which in my opinion is cooked 
     <lb/>
     up from beginning to end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, to a point of 
     <lb/>
     order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am going to prove that it is cooked 
     <lb/>
     up, so sit down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I may say that the word "cook<lb break="no"/>ed up" is a favorite word of Mr. Cashin's. Does 
     <lb/>
     he mean falsify ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I said "cooked", not "falsified".

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Will he explain what he means 
     <lb/>by "cooked up"? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is soggy, it is not done. Did you 
     <lb/>
     ever see a soggy doughboy? It is not based on any 
     <lb/>
     sound foundation whatever. To use Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's own words, there is nothing in these 
     <lb/>
     few pages worth tearing to pieces. Let us have a

     look at this mysterious proposal, this personal 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood plan for the proposed administration 
     <lb/>
     of the affairs of Newfoundland as a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It is not a budget in the strict sense of the 
     <lb/>
     word. This thing does not contain any explana<lb break="no"/>tions of the various items of revenue and expen<lb break="no"/>ditures in its few and scattered pages and 
     <lb/>
     guesswork estimates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When Mr. Smallwood went in to hysterics in 
     <lb/>
     his feeble effort to tear to pieces the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, he ridiculed the Finance Committee for 
     <lb/>
     its attempt to introduce a document which 
     <lb/>
     forecast the future of Newfoundland for a period 
     <lb/>
     of three years. He now has the impudence to 
     <lb/>
     come into this chamber and introduce a con<lb break="no"/>cocted document based on practically nothing, 
     <lb/>
     but he tells us, and he tells the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, he is making his forecast, not for three 
     <lb/>
     years mind you, but for a period of eight years. 
     <lb/>
     He practically tells the world, as Mr. Reddy so 
     <lb/>
     aptly put it, that he alone, Joseph R. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     is the only individual in this Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     ours who should be permitted, and who is capable 
     <lb/>
     of producing such a forecast. He tells us, so to 
     <lb/>
     speak, that he is infallible, and that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the country, north, south, east and west, must 
     <lb/>
     recognise in the delegate from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     the only individual in the country who knows 
     <lb/>
     what will happen within any given period. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Pretty clever, what? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Smallwood has stressed the 
     <lb/>
     infallibility of Canadian experts. He now evi<lb break="no"/>dently has taken upon himself the role of 
     <lb/>
     astrologer or fortune teller for the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood himself 
     <lb/>
     has admitted that the forecasts which the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation, of which he was secretary, gave to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     revenues and expenditures of a Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     provincial government were incorrect, and in 
     <lb/>
     view of that fact he has taken upon himself to 
     <lb/>
     present a corrected estimate on his own. In the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book, Volume 2, is to be found the es<lb break="no"/>timates of expenditures of Newfoundland as a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. These amount to $14.4 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Today the estimates of expenditure 
   

            <cb/>


     presented by Mr. Smallwood for the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of the province of Newfoundland come to 
     <lb/>
     approximately $15.5 million, or $1 million more 
     <lb/>
     per annum than contained in the Black Book. 
     <lb/>
     This deficiency was made up by the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation forgot to include in their ex<lb break="no"/>penditures approximately $500,000 in interest 
     <lb/>
     and sinking fund on our local debt, as well as an 
     <lb/>
     additional $100,000 for civil pensions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we peruse these estimates what do we find? 
     <lb/>
     We find that at least 1,200 civil servants will be 
     <lb/>
     laid off from work, but Mr. Smallwood tells us 
     <lb/>
     that once we become a province these people who 
     <lb/>
     have been dispensed with provincially will be 
     <lb/>
     employed in other departments of the federal 
     <lb/>
     government established in Newfoundland. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, he went so far as to say that an additional 
     <lb/>
     1,000 people would be required to administer the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the Canadian federal government. This 
     <lb/>
     to my mind was a wild and incorrect statement, 
     <lb/>
     and there is no evidence contained in any of the 
     <lb/>
     documents to show that this will occur. Rather do 
     <lb/>
     I hazard the opinion, my personal opinion, that 
     <lb/>
     many hundreds of our civil servants would be put 
     <lb/>
     on the unemployed list. In the estimates for 
     <lb/>
     Public Health and Welfare as contained in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book we are told by the OttaWa delegation 
     <lb/>
     that an amount of $4,767,000 will be sufficient. 
     <lb/>
     However, Mr. Smallwood has increased this by 
     <lb/>
     another half million dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us survey the various departments 
     <lb/>
     which would have to be financed by the province 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland should our people decide that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would unite with Canada. What 
     <lb/>
     do we find? We find that the following depart<lb break="no"/>ments would be those over which the control of 
     <lb/>
     expenditure would come within the scope of the 
     <lb/>
     province: Education, Justice, Natural Resources, 
     <lb/>
     Public Works, Public Health and Welfare, the 
     <lb/>
     Liquor Control, Home Affairs and provincial 
     <lb/>
     treasury. All these departments, according to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, would involve an annual expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of approximately $15.5 million. Let us see 
     <lb/>
     what these departments are disbursing now in 
     <lb/>
     comparison to Mr. Smallwood's estimate....
