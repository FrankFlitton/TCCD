 <!--<p>
     connection with the salmon fishery. The English 
     <lb/>
     market had been lost; none of the people who had 
     <lb/>
     been marketing salmon had made any arrange<lb break="no"/>ments with the American market; where I hap<lb break="no"/>pened to live the people had been salmon fishing 
     <lb/>
     for years and then found there was no way to 
     <lb/>
     dispose of the salmon. No one wanted them, so 
     <lb/>
     they thought. These people learned their lesson 
     <lb/>
     the hard way. I want to assure the Convention that 
     <lb/>
     they will never be caught in that position again. 
     <lb/>
     They have an organisation that will put it on the 
     <lb/>
     market for them. It seems to me that while it is 
     <lb/>
     not quite self-evident, while we ought to have a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of faith in the produce of the 
     <lb/>
     country and in the fisheries, I, at any rate, do not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate in going so far out on a limb as to say that 
     <lb/>
     barring absolute blank catches, the fisheries can 
     <lb/>
     be so organised as to give a decent living to the 
     <lb/>
     people engaged in it.... If I did not think that, I 
     <lb/>
     would clear out of this country. We have to have 
     <lb/>
     a different approach from anything in the past.... 
     <lb/>
     While I concur with the government's putting 
     <lb/>
     more money into research; while I have nothing 
     <lb/>
     but the highest esteem for people who have faith 
     <lb/>
     enough to build cold storage industries and try to 
     <lb/>
     develop new markets; I feel there is one essential 
     <lb/>
     factor in the long or perhaps in the short run, the 
     <lb/>
     success or failure of our Newfoundland fisheries 
     <lb/>
     will depend to a very great extent on the people 
     <lb/>
     who are engaged in the primary production. 
     <lb/>
     There are two ways we can get their interest 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     in their own welfare more than they have shown 
     <lb/>
     in the past: one is through educational methods, 
     <lb/>
     educating the people in the fishing boats to a 
     <lb/>
     better standard of values with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     produce they have to market, in the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     new methods of handling. Even that is not 
     <lb/>
     enough. The normal average individual will only 
     <lb/>
     have the biggest interest in anything when his 
     <lb/>
     own financial returns are tied up with that inter<lb break="no"/>est, and in the past we have suffered much be<lb break="no"/>cause there was never discrimination between the 
     <lb/>
     man who made a good product and the man who 
     <lb/>
     made an inferior one. The fisheries will only be 
     <lb/>
     successful when the fishermen are shareholders 
     <lb/>
     of the enterprise and when their income depends 
     <lb/>
     as much on the successful marketing operation as 
     <lb/>
     on the catch. The average fisherman feels his job 
     <lb/>
     is done when he has salted it, dried it and passed 
     <lb/>
     it over to the merchants. That is why I deplore 
     <lb/>
     any niggardliness with regard to the investment 
     <lb/>
     of public monies on such things as co-operative 
     <lb/>
     education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fogwill It is not my intention to debate this 
     <lb/>
     excellent report but I was most interested in the 
     <lb/>
     fresh fish question. In reference to some figures 
     <lb/>
     quoted by Mr. Smallwood, I think he quoted 
     <lb/>
     400,000 pounds of fish in 1943. Has he got those 
     <lb/>
     figures broken down?

     has not been possible. I hope he will be able to

     appear before the whole Convention before its

     tribution to our deliberations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are those who point to the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government as those who have instituted a 
     <lb/>
     new day in public health and welfare services in 
     <lb/>
     this country. I do not see how it could have started 
     <lb/>
     on the scale it did a decade ago had it not been 
     <lb/>
     for the financial assistance afforded by the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom. The aid received made it possible to 
     <lb/>
     make a good start in enlarging the health and 
     <lb/>
     social services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The family doctor is filling and has filled a 
     <lb/>
     very important place in the sphere of social wel<lb break="no"/>fare and health services. In going his rounds he 
     <lb/>
     has not only built up his practice but left an 
     <lb/>
     influence which, when he is no longer available, 
     <lb/>
     leaves a void very difficult to fill. The modern 
     <lb/>
     tendency for the majority of doctors graduating 
     <lb/>
     is to specialise, and it seems these prefer to prac<lb break="no"/>tice where a hospital is located and where hospi<lb break="no"/>tal facilities are readily procurable. In the rapid 
     <lb/>
     strides and advances that have taken place in the 
     <lb/>
     field of medical science and scientific knowledge 
     <lb/>
     it is admitted even by the layman that methods 
     <lb/>
     may quickly become outmoded; thus it is under<lb break="no"/>standable that doctors may prefer to join the staff 
     <lb/>
     of a hospital, but in the viewpoint of many who 
     <lb/>
     have had the valuable services of the family 
     <lb/>
     practitioner, they still much prefer to see the 
     <lb/>
     genial face of the family doctor, rather than 
     <lb/>
     having to take their sick to the hospital. There 
     <lb/>
     may be some who wonder if our medical services 
     <lb/>
     have not been extended too rapidly and spread 
     <lb/>
     out too thin, so to speak, and question if the 
     <lb/>
     country can afford to carry them. But the big 
     <lb/>
     question is, can the country afford not to have 
     <lb/>
     them? These cottage hospitals (a special feature 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland) are part of a system of 
     <lb/>
     modified socialised medicine No country can 
     <lb/>
     expect to reach its utmost capacity of production 
     <lb/>
     unless its inhabitants attain a satisfactory stand<lb break="no"/>ard of health, and a nation's health is a matter of 
     <lb/>
     the most vital concern and consideration, and the 
     <lb/>
     provision of adequate health and welfare services 
     <lb/>
     is of paramount importance. We must look not 
     <lb/>
     only at the present but also to the future, and we 
     <lb/>
     see need of further expansion yet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The shortage of nurses is a serious problem. It 
     <lb/>
     is readily understood that hospitals require doc<lb break="no"/>tors and many nurses to staff them, and if they are 
     <lb/>
     to function properly, the need of sufficient 
     <lb/>
     trained personnel is most apparent. During the 
 

            <cb/>
         

     war there was a greater scarcity of doctors and as 
     <lb/>
     time goes on and more medical students graduate 
     <lb/>
     this shortage will be gradually overcome. Many 
     <lb/>
     nurses marry after graduation and unless they 
     <lb/>
     take up private nursing, generally speaking they 
     <lb/>
     are not available. It has been questioned whether 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of self-sacrifice in this noble profession 
     <lb/>
     is not dying out. Personally I do not think it is. I 
     <lb/>
     understand the same situation exists in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The scale of payments in Newfoundland offered 
     <lb/>
     to student nurses — $150 for the first year, $200 
     <lb/>
     for the second year and $250 for the third year, 
     <lb/>
     may account for some of the shortage. During the 
     <lb/>
     war many young ladies found more remunerative 
     <lb/>
     employment at the bases and elsewhere and 
     <lb/>
     many entered the teaching profession. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The opening up of the new buildings at the 
     <lb/>
     Sanaton'um has been delayed by the lack of nur<lb break="no"/>ses. The need of many more nurses is urgent; also 
     <lb/>
     more beds for patients. The tremendous work of 
     <lb/>
     the Department of Public Health and Welfare 
     <lb/>
     itself suffered during the war owing to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that it lost some of its key men through enlist<lb break="no"/>ments, and the higher wages paid by outside 
     <lb/>
     companies naturally attracted others at head<lb break="no"/>quarters to better paid positions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Perhaps it is not out of order to mention that 
     <lb/>
     the success of efforts on behalf of preventative 
     <lb/>
     and curative medicine in Newfoundland, and of 
     <lb/>
     any all-round general scheme of health and social 
     <lb/>
     services, depends on the degree of co-operation 
     <lb/>
     between the people, the medical and nursing 
     <lb/>
     professions and the government. Our system of 
     <lb/>
     taxation should provide that all can get the neces<lb break="no"/>sities of life at the very lowest prices. The matter 
     <lb/>
     of nutrition is intimately connected and linked up 
     <lb/>
     with health. Proper foods, as well as proper nutri<lb break="no"/>tional values, are vitally necessary for our good 
     <lb/>
     health.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One of the most serious problems affecting 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is the great white plague, the 
     <lb/>
     silent menace, tuberculosis. I add my voice to the 
     <lb/>
     many others who have given unstinted praise to 
     <lb/>
     the laudable efforts of the Newfoundland Tuber<lb break="no"/>culosis Association in the great work it has under<lb break="no"/>taken to assist to the utmost to rid Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     of this scourge. It is hoped that the government 
     <lb/>
     will not only be ever ready but over-zealous to 
     <lb/>
     assist in this colossal work undertaken by a band 
     <lb/>
     of voluntary workers. This dread disease can be 
     <lb/>
     stamped out only by continued and concerted

     action in which the public must be adequately 
     <lb/>
     informed. The response of the public in its pur<lb break="no"/>chases of Christmas Seals and donations indi<lb break="no"/>cates its desire to further the work of the 
     <lb/>
     association. If crippling disease, let it be TB or 
     <lb/>
     anything else, is not checked and eradicated or 
     <lb/>
     brought to the lowest possible minimum, what 
     <lb/>
     avails the efforts of rehabilitation? Public health 
     <lb/>
     must be in the forefront of reconstruction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The appointment of a sub-committee consist<lb break="no"/>ing of Mr. Vardy, Mr. Crummey and Mr. Roberts 
     <lb/>
     was made to draft a report on welfare. Their 
     <lb/>
     report was considered by the whole Committee 
     <lb/>
     and the report as amended forms part of the report 
     <lb/>
     now before you. The hope is that able-bodied 
     <lb/>
     relief, except for isolated cases, will soon be a 
     <lb/>
     thing of the past, and that in its place the govern<lb break="no"/>ment will provide public works or some other 
     <lb/>
     scheme whereby the needs of the people who 
     <lb/>
     have suffered owing to lack of sufficient income 
     <lb/>
     may be met. It is to be hoped that soon the 
     <lb/>
     government will be able to reduce the age limit 
     <lb/>
     at which an old age pension may be obtained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The splendid work done by Dr. Pottle and the 
     <lb/>
     staff under him is included in the welfare report. 
     <lb/>
     The boys and girls of today will be the men and 
     <lb/>
     women of tomorrow, and monies invested in their 
     <lb/>
     welfare will pay real dividends in the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under section 6 you will find a section 
     <lb/>
     devoted to veterans' affairs. It is not saying too 
     <lb/>
     much when we say that everything possible 
     <lb/>
     should be done on behalf of those who answered 
     <lb/>
     the call of king and country. We consider that 
     <lb/>
     labour affairs should be studied by a select com<lb break="no"/>mittee of this Convention and while the delega<lb break="no"/>tions are absent visiting England, and perhaps 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa if one goes there, it might be a good time 
     <lb/>
     if those available in St. John's, and who do not 
     <lb/>
     intend to return home, could be appointed to 
     <lb/>
     study this matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people of Newfoundland deserve the very 
     <lb/>
     best possible in the way of medical services. Who 
     <lb/>
     is going to say that anything less than the best is 
     <lb/>
     good enough for our people? We are dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the greatest asset that Newfoundland possesses 
     <lb/>
     when we are dealing with the people, greater then 
     <lb/>
     the material assets, for it is a spiritual one. While 
     <lb/>
     poverty and disease lurk in our midst it is our duty 
     <lb/>
     to do our utmost to ascertain the underlying 
     <lb/>
     causes and see that they are removed. In building 
  

            <cb/>
    

     a strong and lasting society the deadly forces 
     <lb/>
     which strike at the roots of society and sap the 
     <lb/>
     foundations of national well-being will have to 
     <lb/>
     be attacked, no matter how deeply entrenched 
     <lb/>
     they may be before ultimate recovery can be 
     <lb/>
     hoped for or real progress be attained.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like to call 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the members to the fact that there 
     <lb/>
     is one unfortunate omission in the first page in the 
     <lb/>
     list of names. To that should be added the name 
     <lb/>
     of the Hon. Mr. Quinton. The Committee feels 
     <lb/>
     that your predecessor, Mr. Justice Fox, in the 
     <lb/>
     selection of the convenor for this Committee 
     <lb/>
     made a very wise choice. Mr. Ashbourne, with 
     <lb/>
     his thoroughness and good spirit and persistent 
     <lb/>
     energy, kept us plugging at this work since last 
     <lb/>
     fall until 5 o'clock on Saturday last. We were able 
     <lb/>
     to have 48 main committee meetings, besides 
     <lb/>
     several subcommittee meetings, which meant at 
     <lb/>
     least 103 hours work on this report. I would also 
     <lb/>
     point out that the few references and quotations 
     <lb/>
     in this report coming from the interviews are not 
     <lb/>
     an indication of the value we have placed upon 
     <lb/>
     the interviews. We feel that the interviews with 
     <lb/>
     the various doctors, heads of departments, etc., 
     <lb/>
     were very valuable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We were impressed last fall with the inade<lb break="no"/>quacy of our equipment to cope with this prob<lb break="no"/>lem, and we thought that the best way was to 
     <lb/>
     study the problem of public health and welfare 
     <lb/>
     with men who knew more about it than we did. 
     <lb/>
     We looked upon our interviews as study classes. 
     <lb/>
     We placed a great value upon the knowledge that 
     <lb/>
     was imparted to us by these men and two ladies 
     <lb/>
     who came before us. We recall very vividly the 
     <lb/>
     meeting that we had with the Commissioner, 
     <lb/>
     Hon. John C. Puddester, and how he outlined the 
     <lb/>
     work of his department and the problems that he 
     <lb/>
     had to face, and how it grew up under the needs 
     <lb/>
     of wartime. We also remember the studies upon 
     <lb/>
     TB and the incidence of TB in Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador under Dr. McGrath and Dr. Peters and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Davis....

     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> Was Lamaline omitted? It had been

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I am going to ask one question. In the

     cottage hospitals there are 14 doctors. Are those 
     <lb/>
     in residence or are they just working part-time? 
     <lb/>
     Do they have a doctor at all these cottage hospi<lb break="no"/>tals all the time? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Not as far as I am aware. They 
     <lb/>
     have a doctor associated with some of them, and 
     <lb/>
     they also practice in the other localities around. I 
     <lb/>
     have not a list of the doctors at present associated 
     <lb/>
     with the various hospitals, but I could get that if 
     <lb/>
     you would like to have the names of the doctors 
     <lb/>
     in the different localities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> It was mentioned about dis<lb break="no"/>trict nurses; and on page 10 it says, "304 nurses, 
     <lb/>
     or one for each 1,046 of the population." It should 
     <lb/>
     not be necessary for me to call attention to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the people of Trepasscy and that vicinity 
     <lb/>
     are in urgent need of a nurse. They have quite a 
     <lb/>
     population and are isolated all winter and I have 
     <lb/>
     been trying to get a nurse installed there for some 
     <lb/>
     time but could not do so. Those people have no 
     <lb/>
     doctor or nurse, and over all Conception Bay 
     <lb/>
     there are a lot of nurses in a section connected 
     <lb/>
     with the city by railroad and taxis all winter.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> There has been, yes.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> A similar position exists at

     months, and two years ago we had one for two 
     <lb/>

     there was a shortage of doctors, and when the

     directing while he was there; but the shortage of

     about the 14 cottage hospital doctors working

     <lb/>
     doctors supervise the hospital and do the surgical 
     <lb/>
     work necessary, and serve the community out<lb break="no"/>side on their own, and that's why it is called a

     part-time job. I can speak for Stephenville Cross<lb break="no"/>ing and the Bonne Bay area as well. Usually those

     when I was interviewing the head of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment. He advised us that there was not a doctor 
     <lb/>
     at the present time, but they are hoping to get one 
     <lb/>
     later on. I can't say what the last time was they

     had a doctor.

     know if there is any member from that section

     for four years and very rarely has a nurse. I think 
     <lb/>
     that question is well put and the Committee 
     <lb/>
     should find that out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I have been informed that the ser<lb break="no"/>vice is very satisfactory up there. I think that 
     <lb/>
     requires going into thoroughly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEN3">Mr. Spencer</persName> As far as I know there has not been 
     <lb/>
     a doctor on the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lady Anderson</hi> for the last four or 
     <lb/>
     five years, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lady Anderson</hi> covers that 
     <lb/>
     coast and is very conspicuous by her absence. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In reply to Mr. Hollett, if he 
     <lb/>would look at the table of financial statistics he 
     <lb/>will see that the cost of maintaining and operating 
     <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lady Anderson</hi> for this year, which ends 
     <lb/>today, is $11,800.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> You have to add the salaries — 
     <lb/>
     about $7,000 for wages for the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lady Anderson</hi>. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Rev. Mr. Burry has now gone 
     <lb/>out to try and get that information from the 
     <lb/>department, but I remember it was stressed, at the 
     <lb/>time that we discussed this matter, the difficulty 
     <lb/>that the department had to procure a doctor for 
     <lb/>this service. When there has been a shortage of 
     <lb/>doctors even for their stations on the land we can 
     <lb/>readily appreciate and understand the difficulty 
     <lb/>of procuring a medical man to go on the ship. I 
     <lb/>feel sure there is great need of a medical man to 
     <lb/>serve that part of the coast and that as soon as the 
     <lb/>department can get a qualified doctor willing to 
     <lb/>go on that ship one will be provided. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Whether it cost $11,000 or $35,000 
     <lb/>
     is not to the point at all. What I want to know is 
     <lb/>
     what service the ship can be if she has had no 
     <lb/>
     doctor or nurse for four of five years? It's per<lb break="no"/>tinent to the issue and these are things we want to 
     <lb/>
     find out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I wonder if the Committee visited 
     <lb/>
     any of the hospitals and made inquiries from the 
     <lb/>
     patients there how often they see a doctor? I refer 
     <lb/>
     now to those who go in on the government, not 
     <lb/>
     paying their own hospital bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, various mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Committee have visited various in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. I visited the General Hospital and went 
     <lb/>
     through it, and also the Sanatorium since they 
     <lb/>
     moved into the new wing, the Children's Home 
     <lb/>
     and Merchant Navy Hospital, the Home for the 
     <lb/>
     Aged and Infirm, and I feel sure that other mem<lb break="no"/>bers have visited other government institutions. 
     <lb/>
     During the course of my rounds I questioned 
     <lb/>
     several patients about the food and care which 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
           

     they were being given, and found no complaint. 
     <lb/>
     I took it, of course, that in the general work of 
     <lb/>
     these institutions that the doctors would make 
     <lb/>
     their rounds, probably twice a day, and it did not 
     <lb/>
     occur to me to ask whether the doctors did that 
     <lb/>
     because I took it for granted.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I may say that on the welfare side of 
     <lb/>
     it I visited just aboutevery hospital in town. I was 
     <lb/>
     to the Mental Hospital with other members of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee and have been there on three different 
     <lb/>
     occasions, I have been to the Sanatorium and 
     <lb/>
     talked to the patients. and any observations I have 
     <lb/>
     I propose to make later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> We have a cottage hospital at Old 
     <lb/>
     Perlican, and they also practice with a doctor in 
     <lb/>
     Trinity South. The people of Bay de Verde dis<lb break="no"/>trict, including New Melbourne in Trinity South, 
     <lb/>
     practice with the doctor and hospital in Old Per<lb break="no"/>lican, and the people of Trinity North go to 
     <lb/>
     Heart's Content. As you know a man or woman 
     <lb/>
     has a lot of dependence in a doctor they are used 
     <lb/>
     to; but we always found out that when a patient 
     <lb/>
     went into hospital they had to go under another 
     <lb/>
     doctor, and people often wonder if the medical 
     <lb/>
     services could not have been served better if both 
     <lb/>
     doctors could have had a chance to practice in the 
     <lb/>
     same hospital. I don't know if the doctor has the 
     <lb/>
     same chance to practice, but I know it is not 
     <lb/>
     possible to get under our own doctor's care in Old 
     <lb/>
     Perlican. I don't know if this condition exists in 
     <lb/>
     any other part of the island, because I believe that 
     <lb/>
     when a case puzzles the doctor he just calls in 
     <lb/>
     another one. The people are wondering why it 
     <lb/>
     costs a man in New Melbourne $10 for the doctor 
     <lb/>
     and hospital, and $l4 in Old Perlican. They asked 
     <lb/>
     me to find this out, whether the doctor is barred 
     <lb/>
     from practicing in the hospital or whether it's his 
     <lb/>
     own free will or otherwise. It seems strange when 
     <lb/>
     there is a hospital in the vicinity that all doctors 
     <lb/>
     should not be allowed to practice in them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, as far as I know 
     <lb/>
     the fee for these cottage hospitals is $10. The 
     <lb/>
     doctors who attend the hospital, their wages are 
     <lb/>
     $200 a month and two thirds of the fees collected. 
     <lb/>
     I will try to find out why that additional $2 is 
     <lb/>
     charged — is that it, Mr. Bailey? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> The fee for hospitals is $4. I am 
     <lb/>
     paying $4 and everybody in the district pays $6 
     <lb/>
     to the doctor and $4 for the hospital, a total of 
     <lb/>
     $10. When we come to New Melbourne we pay 
     <lb/>
     $10 for the doctor and the hospital besides.... That 
    

            <pb n="438" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-31_Page_0438.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">438</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw>
          

     is what our people are talking the most about, the 
     <lb/>
     fact that when they go in hospital they go under 
     <lb/>
     another doctor and not their own doctor. Their 
     <lb/>
     own doctor does not practice in the hospital since 
     <lb/>
     it was there. We don't know why, and people 
     <lb/>
     asked me to try and find out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That's probably a government 
     <lb/>
     regulation about having their own doctors in the 
     <lb/>
     various localities. It is quite understandable. You 
     <lb/>
     could not have every doctor in every community 
     <lb/>
     on the hospital staff at $200 a month, it would run 
     <lb/>
     up the cost considerably. I take it that fee you pay 
     <lb/>
     the doctor, who is not associated with the cottage 
     <lb/>
     hospital, is a fee to have your name on his books 
     <lb/>
     as we used to say in years gone by, and whoever 
     <lb/>
     wanted his services, summer or winter, night or 
     <lb/>
     day, would have to put his name on the books and 
     <lb/>
     pay him a certain annual fee. I will try to get that 
     <lb/>
     information for you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> That, to my mind, is a matter for 
     <lb/>
     the local board of health. The fee is $10, and that 
     <lb/>
     covers all settlements. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> There are two points there, one 
     <lb/>
     is that he has the family doctor, but at Old Per<lb break="no"/>lican the doctor does not come within the radius 
     <lb/>
     of the hospital. He pays the family doctor for his 
     <lb/>
     services, but on the other hand he is affiliating 
     <lb/>
     himself with the hospital in case his family has to 
     <lb/>
     go there and get special rates. If he is outside the 
     <lb/>
     territory he pays $4, otherwise it is $10 al<lb break="no"/>together. There is no discrimination against your 
     <lb/>
     doctor going into that hospital, although he has 
     <lb/>
     to go there under the supervision of the other 
     <lb/>
     doctor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> We were wondering about that. I 
     <lb/>
     don't know why because our doctor is a govern<lb break="no"/>ment doctor too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> But he is only getting a subsidy 
     <lb/>
     because of your people who cannot pay. The 
     <lb/>
     hospital doctor is getting his fee as a doctor in the 
     <lb/>
     hospital plus the fees. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> There are various scales of payment 
     <lb/>
     for these cottage hospitals. I think I have a receipt 
     <lb/>
     here from Walwyn Hospital<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> for $15. There is 
     <lb/>
     also a fee for the X-ray, and the $ 10 is the nominal 
     <lb/>
     hospital fee, and there is a special medical fee for 
     <lb/>
     certain special services if you pay the extra $5 
     <lb/>
     and happen to require it. I think that's correct. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> On page 10: 


            <cb/>
         

     Hospital beds: We have 1 for each 111 of our 
     <lb/>
     population. Doctors: We have 1 for each 2,719 
     <lb/>
     of our population. Nurses: We have 1 for each 
     <lb/>
     1,046 of our population 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have no doubt that's statistically correct. I 
     <lb/>
     was wondering if the Committee went into that. 
     <lb/>
     In other words is there a bed available for every 
     <lb/>
     111 people? In practice have they been able to get 
     <lb/>
     to where we have one doctor for every 2,700 
     <lb/>
     people? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> No, it's not a general average. 
     <lb/>
     In St. John's, yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> It does not work out in that way? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Not really. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> In that case you may have one doctor 
     <lb/>
     for 5,000 people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think the figure taken as the 
     <lb/>
     ideal is one doctor per 400 of the population. I 
     <lb/>
     don't suppose there is a country that has reached 
     <lb/>
     that ideal although some come much nearer to it 
     <lb/>
     than we have done. Some countries average one 
     <lb/>
     doctor for every 1,200. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> That does not apply in White Bay 
     <lb/>
     and Green Bay districts. The population down 
     <lb/>
     there is around 30,000, and there is one doctor in 
     <lb/>
     Baie Verte in the Bowater company's operation.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would like a word on that. You 
     <lb/>
     give the infant mortality rate for Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     over a period of years and on the next page the 
     <lb/>
     infant mortality rate by countries. You have 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland down as 91, New Zealand 31, 
     <lb/>
     South Africa 52, Denmark 45, Australia 36, 
     <lb/>
     Canada 21.4. I take it that is per 1,000 births. I 
     <lb/>
     am wondering if that's a typographical error, or 
     <lb/>
     where did you get your statistics? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Perhaps Mr. Smallwood could 
     <lb/>
     answer that question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The statistics affecting 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland were obtained from the Division 
     <lb/>
     of Vital Statistics which has been keeping them 
     <lb/>
     for many years past. The statistics on other 
     <lb/>
     countries were obtained from their year books.... 
     <lb/>
     The particular question that Mr. Hollett has asked 
     <lb/>
     with regard to infant mortality rate by countries, 
     <lb/>
     speaking from memory I could not swear that 
     <lb/>
     there is no typographical error at the bottom of 
     <lb/>
     that table, Canada (1940) the rate 21.4. I suggest 
     <lb/>
     that someone obtain the original script and see

     how it checks with the mimeograph copy. It does 
     <lb/>
     look very low I admit.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That's only one table, the number of children 
     <lb/>
     dying in these countries under the age of one year 
     <lb/>
     per 1,000 births, I am pretty sure that it's per 
     <lb/>
     1,000. They have certain standard rates all over 
     <lb/>
     the world, but they vary. TB is per 100,000; 
     <lb/>
     maternity death rate is per 1,000 live births, what 
     <lb/>
     proportion of the mothers die in childbirth, but in 
     <lb/>
     all these different things it varies. I believe in 
     <lb/>
     infant mortality it is per 1,000 live births. Short 
     <lb/>
     of checking with the original copy, does that 
     <lb/>
     answer you Mr. Hollett? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, but I want to be sure, because 
     <lb/>
     I have here the Canada year book for 1945 which 
     <lb/>
     gives the infant mortality rate by provinces and 
     <lb/>
     for the whole of Canada, and I find that in 1940 
     <lb/>
     the infant mortality rate was 64 for the whole of 
     <lb/>
     Canada.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I have a table showing the world 
     <lb/>
     rates for 1934-35-36, and this is somewhat 
     <lb/>
     similar to those quoted by Mr. Hollett. For the 
     <lb/>
     years 1921-25 the average is 98; in 1934 it was 
     <lb/>
     72; 1935, 71; and 1936, 66. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I am glad Mr. Hollett brought 
     <lb/>
     up that matter. We have here the original script 
     <lb/>
     given to be mimeographed, and I notice that there 
     <lb/>
     are several changes made on this list. Perhaps Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood can explain because I believe he was 
     <lb/>
     responsible for this; for New Zealand the original 
     <lb/>
     he had was 22.6, and several of the others were 
     <lb/>
     corrected and altered to give other figures. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me he has taken the wrong rate. I notice 
     <lb/>
     that New Zealand, Denmark and several others 
     <lb/>
     have been marked off, but the figure for Canada 
     <lb/>
     was left there. It seems as if an error was made. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I notice too that some of the 
     <lb/>figures have been corrected in ink. I don't recall 
     <lb/>from memory, but Australia is raised from 18 up 
     <lb/>to 36 and Great Britain from 15 up to 54, USA 
     <lb/>from 17 up to 40, Denmark from 18.3 up to 45, 
     <lb/>South Africa from 25.3 up to 52, New Zealand 
     <lb/>from 22.6 up to 31. Evidently the wrong figures 
     <lb/>were typed in there in the first place and the 
     <lb/>corrected ones were written in. What strikes me 
     <lb/>as being possible is that Canada was also typed 
     <lb/>and not corrected. I expect that is what hap<lb break="no"/>pened.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I think we want to get this 
     <lb/>
     report as correct as possible. I suggest that this be 
     <lb/>
     amended to read Canada 1936 — 1940, average 


            <cb/>
        

     64, and down below, Canada 1941 — 60. I think 
     <lb/>
     that would cover it. As regards checking the 
     <lb/>
     others I would be only too glad if any member 
     <lb/>
     would do that, because we don't want any mis<lb break="no"/>leading information in our report....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I suppose this table is given to show 
     <lb/>
     something of a picture of Newfoundland's assets. 
     <lb/>
     You will find that there is a little note on one of 
     <lb/>
     these tables which says that this figure of 64 does 
     <lb/>
     not include statistics for the territories. I point out 
     <lb/>
     that nine-tenths of the population of Canada runs 
     <lb/>
     straight across the American boundary. There is 
     <lb/>
     something like 1,400 miles from that up, and 
     <lb/>
     there is one tenth of the population in that area, 
     <lb/>
     and they have a problem of isolation something 
     <lb/>
     the same as we have. We ought to take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration the problem of isolation in this 
     <lb/>
     country as well. I know the problem we have in 
     <lb/>
     public health. It is serious and terrific. We should 
     <lb/>
     all give all the time and attention and energy that 
     <lb/>
     we can do it, but it strikes me as odd that we make 
     <lb/>
     ours out as a little worse than we need to. I think 
     <lb/>
     64 would be a little high if you take in the isolated 
     <lb/>
     districts. I am only just trying to keep in my mind 
     <lb/>
     the fair picture of the problem in relation to our 
     <lb/>
     own and those of other countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> This figure of 93.5 per 1,000 is 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland and Labrador. The same thing 
     <lb/>
     applies to the other countries. You take the figure 
     <lb/>
     for all Newfoundland and you see how it stacks 
     <lb/>
     up against other countries. Naturally, you take the 
     <lb/>
     figure for all Newfoundland, and all the USA and 
     <lb/>
     all of Canada, not a part of it. We had figures for 
     <lb/>
     parts of Newfoundland which were much better 
     <lb/>
     than that, but the average for all Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Labrador is 93.5 per 1,000 live births for 
     <lb/>
     1943, but there are parts of the country that were 
     <lb/>
     deliberately left out of the report because we 
     <lb/>
     thought it would be queer to pick out certain 
     <lb/>
     parts. There was one part that was 210, another 
     <lb/>
     part 145.5, 118.4 ... another part is 43.5, another 
     <lb/>
     part 51, etc ..... Taking the country as a whole with 
     <lb/>
     Labrador it is high, but it is dropping. The report 
     <lb/>
     gives the results from 1920 up to 1944, every year 
     <lb/>
     inclusive, and the rate is dropping. In 1944 it shot 
     <lb/>
     up again, but there is a general fall in the rate, in 
     <lb/>
     other words an improvement in the infant mor<lb break="no"/>tality rate. We have along way to go but our rate 
     <lb/>
     is improving....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am only interested in correcting 
     <lb/>
     the figures presented to us. Apparently there is a 
   

            <pb n="440" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-31_Page_0440.jpg"/>

     grave error concerning the infant mortality rate 
     <lb/>
     in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I wonder if we could know What the 
     <lb/>
     medical services are in those sections where the 
     <lb/>
     infant mortality rate is so high. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not going to mention the 
     <lb/>
     places where the rates are high — where it is 210 
     <lb/>
     the medical service is not good, not too plentiful. 
     <lb/>
     Now the other one — 145 — the rate is high but 
     <lb/>
     the medical services are good, and where it is 141 
     <lb/>
     the medical services are excellent. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand there is one part where the rate is the lowest 
     <lb/>
     in the country and I don't believe there is a doctor 
     <lb/>
     there.... It is not only the medical services, the 
     <lb/>
     doctors and nurses, there are a lot of other factors. 
     <lb/>
   
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> In view of that correction, the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing sentence: "Newfoundland is 300-400% 
     <lb/>worse off in her rate of infant mortality than the 
     <lb/>countries shown", we have to accept that with 
     <lb/>some reservation. That conclusion is definitely 
     <lb/>based on the comparison submitted, and if we 
     <lb/>can't feel they are really correct I don't see how 
     <lb/>we can accept those conclusions. There is 
     <lb/>another point, the report is signed by the full 
     <lb/>Committee, and I would like to ask what liberty 
     <lb/>any one person has to make alterations and add 
     <lb/>more thereto. It seems queer no one knows 
     <lb/>whether these figures are at random or correct or 
     <lb/>what. I don't think that's thorough enough for our 
     <lb/>work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> It seems to me that when errors are 
     <lb/>
     discovered and corrected in other reports, and the 
     <lb/>
     report has been adopted as amended, there has 
     <lb/>
     been dam little said about it. It seems today there 
     <lb/>
     is an attempt being made, because of these errors, 
     <lb/>
     to sort of throw dust over the rest of the reports. 
     <lb/>
     I wonder why? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I suggest the report be amended 
     <lb/>
     and even though I signed the Report as other 
     <lb/>
     members did, believing that those figures were 
     <lb/>
     right, I for one am prepared to have them cor<lb break="no"/>rected, and I believe I can speak for the other 
     <lb/>
     members.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I don't know if this discussion, 
     <lb/>
     which seems to be rather aimless, may be to make 
     <lb/>
     some other country a little worse or our own 
     <lb/>
     country a little better. I suggest that if we don't 
     <lb/>
     know our own country well enough to know the 
     <lb/>
     condition of public health it is time we got around 
     <lb/>
     to finding out.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> No individual tampered with the

     report after it was signed. These changes were 
     <lb/>
     made beforehand, it is only a minor matter, and 
     <lb/>
     we should get on with the report. There were 
     <lb/>
     changes made in every section of every report 
     <lb/>
     brought before this Convention. There were 
     <lb/>
     many times, over the welfare section. when the 
     <lb/>
     guts and almost the ribs were taken out, but I did 
     <lb/>
     not complain. All these 11 men had to agree 
     <lb/>
     practically unanimously. If there were minor 
     <lb/>
     details we disagreed over we still signed the 
     <lb/>
     report, and generally speaking we agreed with the 
     <lb/>
     report.... There was no juggling of figures by 
     <lb/>
     anyone. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I agree with Mr. Miller. There is a 
     <lb/>
     grave error here according to Mr. Hollett's year 
     <lb/>
     book, and it is too bad to try and make New<lb break="no"/>foundland any worse than she is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Reddy, there was nothing 
     <lb/>
     in my mind as regards to trying to do anything in 
     <lb/>
     Canada's favour.... I assure you there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     in my mind about trying to bias the thing in favour 
     <lb/>
     of any other country or show Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     anything other than the true light.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> I think Mr. Reddy made a very 
     <lb/>
     harsh statement in saying that we are trying to 
     <lb/>
     build up a record for Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I am quite satisfied that the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee placed on that report the facts as received. If

     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I would like to make a motion that 
     <lb/>
     the next paragraph on Newfoundland be deleted.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I second that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The motion is that these words

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> That is my motion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I wish that the high infant mortality 
     <lb/>
     rate we have in this country could be stricken out 
     <lb/>
     just as easily. I notice nobody has questioned the 
     <lb/>
     figure of 93.5 for 1943. That's what I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned with, not what it is somewhere else — 
     <lb/>
     ours is still 93.5. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I agree with Mr. Newell. I am not 
     <lb/>
     worried about other countries, but I believe one 
     <lb/>
     of the first things that should have been done is 
     <lb/>
     to see that the medical service as regards our 
     <lb/>
     mothers of the past and future are being looked

     at. Now considering the conditions that our 
     <lb/>
     people live under, and the way they work, espe<lb break="no"/>cially our wives, and the number of children they 
     <lb/>
     bring into the world, I think the time has come in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland when the mothers of the future 
     <lb/>
     won't be bringing children into the world every 
     <lb/>
     year and every second year of their lives. Mothers 
     <lb/>
     of the future will be prepared, because I don't 
     <lb/>
     believe it is possible, especially where a woman 
     <lb/>
     has got to work in the stage and the field, and 
     <lb/>
     work like a dog, to nurse and care for a brood of 
     <lb/>
     15 or 20 children. I believe the time has come 
     <lb/>
     when not only the medical service can be 
     <lb/>
     broadened, but that education should be started 
     <lb/>
     for the mothers-to-be, to give them a break, and 
     <lb/>
     then we will have a healthy population. It is 
     <lb/>
     impossible not to have a high rate going out when 
     <lb/>
     we have so many coming in. That's what's wrong 
     <lb/>
     with the country today.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....I don't think the Committee 
     <lb/>
     would mind if I say that these statistics were 
     <lb/>
     compiled by me. All the members of the Public 
     <lb/>
     Health Committee were given their work to do.... 
     <lb/>
     This particular table, which Mr. Hollett's eagle 
     <lb/>
     eye detected so quickly, was this: this is the 
     <lb/>
     original script.<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> I would like to put myself right 
     <lb/>
     with him. Idon't want you to think I was a Hitler 
     <lb/>
     or a Judas. It was discovered that some of the 
     <lb/>
     figures were wrong and they were corrected by 
     <lb/>
     me with a pen, here they are up here, but they 
     <lb/>
     were not corrected all the way down to the bottom 
     <lb/>
     of the column. I would be willing to stake my life, 
     <lb/>
     it is the only error in this mimeographed copy, 
     <lb/>
     because the error was not corrected in the original 
     <lb/>
     copy. You will find all the other tables correct I 
     <lb/>
     am reasonably sure. I have lived in this country 
     <lb/>
     long enough to expect that my word would be 
     <lb/>
     taken on something or other, but over further 
     <lb/>
     there is another table here where Canada shows 
     <lb/>
     up very badly in comparison with New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and that is in the matter of maternity. 
     <lb/>
     Look at page 6 in the report, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     maternity death rate 3.7, Canada 4. That is quite 
     <lb/>
     a bit worse, quite a difference. Now I did not 
     <lb/>
     change it there, or try to twist it there. The same 
     <lb/>
     comparison runs all through the report.... I am not 
     <lb/>
     such a fool as to make a thing like that deliberately.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am sorry I raised that point. I had

     to do with this. I happened to look at this table 
     <lb/>
     and it struck me as being so very small that I 
     <lb/>
     thought I would bring it up. There is nobody 
     <lb/>
     thinks that he would do that with figures. I have 
     <lb/>
     perfect faith and trust in his manipulation of 
     <lb/>
     figures. If somebody suggests that, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to take him outside. I had no knowledge that you

     these figures to make Newfoundland appear in a

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> ....One thing I have been wondering, 
     <lb/>
     and that is what has been done with patients from 
     <lb/>
     different parts of the island and different hospi<lb break="no"/>tals where they have no care going back to their 
     <lb/>
     homes. I firmly believe that a lot of spreading of 
     <lb/>
     the white killer has been done in that way, 
     <lb/>
     whether through total ignorance or carelessness, 
     <lb/>
     I do not know. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Northern Ranger</hi><ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> should 
     <lb/>
     have been a modern ship — she was a ship which 
     <lb/>
     carried passengers and hospital patients from 
     <lb/>
     north to south and from south to north. Fishermen 
     <lb/>
     also travel on that ship. There was a case of a man 
     <lb/>
     who returned from Belle Isle and shortly after 
     <lb/>
     two of his girls got sick. Four months before he 
     <lb/>
     had called in a doctor and who said there was no 
     <lb/>
     TB. When it was all boiled down, it was found 
     <lb/>
     that there was a TB patient travelling in the 
     <lb/>
     steerage with that man. It ended up with five of 
     <lb/>
     the family getting TB. There should be a special 
     <lb/>
     place on the boats where patients from or to 
     <lb/>
     hospital can be placed. If a nurse is travelling with 
     <lb/>
     them, there should be accommodation for that 
     <lb/>
     nurse. There have been cases on the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Northern 
     <lb/>
     Ranger</hi> where the nurse had to sleep on the table. 
     <lb/>
     That is one of the greatest crimes against us.... 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Mr. Bailey has raised the point of TB 
     <lb/>patients travelling and mixing up with other pas<lb break="no"/>sengers. When I returned from my Christmas 
     <lb/>vacation — you will understand there is only one 
     <lb/>boat on the Placentia Bay route from Lamaline to 
     <lb/>Argentia — at that particular time the boat was 
     <lb/>packed, some sitting on chairs, some lying across 
     <lb/>tables, some walking about the deck, etc. If you 
     <lb/>got a place to lie down for half an hour, you were 
     <lb/>lucky. I had occasion to go down in the second 
     <lb/>class to see someone. The second class was also 
     <lb/>overcrowded. When I went down someone 
     <lb/>remarked, "We have a very sick woman on 
     <lb/>board." As I walked along I looked just below me 
     <lb/>in a berth, a mere frame of a person. Right down 
     <lb/>there among a crowd of passengers.... The boat 
     <lb/>was overcrowded and is nothing but a spreader 
     <lb/>of disease, and to have a patient in that condition 
     <lb/>in the second class among a crowd of passengers, 
     <lb/>I really and sincerely think it is not good 
     <lb/>enough....

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Could you tell me, in the case of

     do they get ordinary relief or do they get an

     where the hospital institutions and services are

     <lb/>
     That $6,730,000 will be spent. Page 5: "The

     these places are built. Fifty nurses are at least

     another $60,000 or more of that $l00,000. The

     Welfare. The Old Perlican cottage hospital, for 
     <lb/>
     the year 1946, collected about $11,000 but in 
     <lb/>
     1945 the amount is shown here as $3,000. I 
     <lb/>
     understand there was no board of health there 
     <lb/>
     previously, or otherwise it was not properly or<lb break="no"/>ganised. That would account for it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I rise to explain how that error 
     <lb/>
     occurred, that we were discussing this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
     You will remember the infant mortality rates as 
     <lb/>
     compared with other countries. This is a copy of 
     <lb/>
     the official year book of the Commonwealth of 
     <lb/>
     Australia. This chapter on vital statistics gives 
     <lb/>
     their statistics and also statistics for other 
     <lb/>
     countries. On page 339, there is a table showing 
     <lb/>
     the infant mortality of many countries. Any 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who wishes to look at it can see that 
     <lb/>
     the figure is 21.4 in Canada; in South Africa 25.3; 
     <lb/>
     in the United States 17.9; Great Britain 15; 
     <lb/>
     Australia 15; New Zealand 22.6. 1 copied those 
     <lb/>
     figures from the Australia year book 1942-43. ln 
     <lb/>
     doing so the mistake is made. Although the head<lb break="no"/>line is 'Infant Mortality' there is also 'Crude Birth 
     <lb/>
     Rate.' I discovered it and made some corrections 
     <lb/>
     in ink. I was in the right table but in the wrong 
     <lb/>
     column of that table. If there is any impression in 
     <lb/>
     anyone's mind that that was done deliberately, I 
     <lb/>
     am most anxious to convince the whole House 
     <lb/>
     that it was an honest mistake that any gentleman 
     <lb/>
     would have made if he were copying from that 
     <lb/>
     same table.

     <lb/>
     statistics — 1934-35 up to 1946-47 — the total 
     <lb/>
     amount spent is $45 1/2 million for the 13 years 
     <lb/>
     that Commission of Government has been here. 
     <lb/>
     The total amount they have spent in that one 
     <lb/>
     department, Health and Welfare, is $3.5 million 
     <lb/>
     a year on average — starting at $2 million and 
     <lb/>
     ending up at $6 million. We all feel that the public 
     <lb/>
     health part of that department has been very good. 
     <lb/>
     There has been big development in public health 
     <lb/>
     institutions and services. It has cost, along with 
     <lb/>
     the rest, $45 million. A staggering sum of money! 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> ....The 1945-46 figures are more up 
     <lb/>to date in that they are the actual expenditures for 
     <lb/>last year. As for the 1946-47 figures, they were 
     <lb/>compiled one month ago. It should not be more 
     <lb/>than a few thousand dollars out. One other cor<lb break="no"/>rection: in the last section "War Pensions", l943-

     the country. I realise a whole lot of this informa<lb break="no"/>tion will be given more fully, but I am inclined to 
     <lb/>
     think we are making big jumps there. All the

     details are not given. If we do not read more

     figures, we will be through the report tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     and the country will know little or nothing about 
     <lb/>
     what we are spending $6 million for. It is the

     heaviest spending department in the government, 
     <lb/>
     especially if we bear in mind that the Department 
     <lb/>
     of Public Works is spending a large amount. We 
     <lb/>
     should, as far as possible, give the country what

     cannot grasp a series of figures delivered one

     <lb/>
     cheque. He is supposed to be pretty much in need 
     <lb/>
     of the old age pension. Still, he does not have to 
     <lb/>
     be in destitute circumstances. Up to quite recent<lb break="no"/>ly, I think, the man was allowed to have $250 in 
     <lb/>
     the bank if he belonged to the outports. He could 
     <lb/>
     have a somewhat larger figure, $400, in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's. Although he had that amount in the bank, 
     <lb/>
     if the relieving officer, after investigation of his 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, approved of his application, the 
     <lb/>
     old age pension could be granted. I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     now $400 in the outports. Naturally an aged 
     <lb/>
     person who had worked hard in the fishing boat 
     <lb/>
     and on the land and had attained the ripe old age 
     <lb/>
     of 75, should not have to be penniless before he 
     <lb/>
     could get the pension. I do not think a man with 
     <lb/>
     $100 would have any difficulty in getting an old 
     <lb/>
     age pension.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Vardy made a very good 
     <lb/>
     point. Your reply, Mr. Ashboume if I may be bold 
     <lb/>
     enough to say it, was very good. There are five 
     <lb/>
     or six pages, masses of figures showing the 
     <lb/>
     money spent the last 13 years by that department. 
     <lb/>
     It is a pity the whole country could not be here 
     <lb/>
     with the figures in front of them, so they could 


            <cb/>
           

     follow them. 1 do not think it would be any harm 
     <lb/>
     just to take one year, the year ending today. On 
     <lb/>
     salaries: doctors, nurses. clerical — 1,374 
     <lb/>
     employees $1.25 million. There were other large 
     <lb/>
     amounts. Next largest is assistance to indigents, 
     <lb/>
     $1 million. Next largest amount for the year, war 
     <lb/>
     pensions, $750,000; next largest amount is nearly 
     <lb/>
     $500,000 for widows, orphans and infirm (sick 
     <lb/>
     people); next largest amount is maintenance of 
     <lb/>
     hospitals and institutions $1,100,000. Another 
     <lb/>
     large one is hospital grants: $150,000; grants 
     <lb/>
     given to orphanages, $41,000. Local councils — 
     <lb/>
     local town councils —- $200,000 for the year. For 
     <lb/>
     the ambulances here in the city, $25,000. For the 
     <lb/>
     year they spent $25,000 on telegrams. Travelling 
     <lb/>
     expenses for employees, $36,000. All that and a 
     <lb/>
     few other items thrown in comes to $6 million. I 
     <lb/>
     think the country ought to know that. That is 
     <lb/>
     roughly how it is made up year by year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I think when we drew up this table 
     <lb/>
     we felt that it was something the members would 
     <lb/>
     study at their leisure. Therefore we did not draw 
     <lb/>
     the conclusions. Two of the largest amounts 
     <lb/>
     spent have been on salaries and maintenance of 
     <lb/>
     institutions. Salaries are just about eight times 
     <lb/>
     what they were in 1934-35 — the total spent, not 
     <lb/>
     the individual salaries. The same is true of hospi<lb break="no"/>tals and other institutions. Approximately eight 
     <lb/>
     times. What I was going to suggest is, that our 
     <lb/>
     report is in two sections — public health as read 
     <lb/>
     and public welfare which we are about to read. 
     <lb/>
     The figures in between are applicable to both. 
     <lb/>
     These figures will have more meaning if they 
     <lb/>
     were taken up after having read the welfare sec<lb break="no"/>tion. There are things in the welfare which might 
     <lb/>
     be asked about here now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> $1,100,000 — what was that spent 
     <lb/>
     for? Is that what was once called dole? Was $1 
     <lb/>
     million in dole given out this year? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I have a breakdown of that. But 
     <lb/>
     first I would like to answer your enquiry about 
     <lb/>
     old age pensions. An old age pensioner is eligible 
     <lb/>
     in the city of St. John's if the applicant is of the 
     <lb/>
     age of 75 years and is in receipt of less than $40 
     <lb/>
     a month or less than $600 capital. Outports: he is 
     <lb/>
     eligible if in receipt of less than $20 a month or 
     <lb/>
     less than $400 capital. <hi rendition="simple:italic">[*See next page]</hi>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Could you give us the exact figures 
     <lb/>
     paid out in dole? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That is the total of relief ac<lb break="no"/>counts, including sick people — $803,450. You

     it, the total number of persons on relief, and costs

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It was not my intention to make 
     <lb/>
     many remarks on this report, but this involves a 
     <lb/>
     huge expenditure of public funds and I think the 
     <lb/>
     people should know how the money was spent. 
     <lb/>
     This report does not tell it all. There is another 
     <lb/>
     report which should have been brought in with 
     <lb/>
     this. Are we going to overlook that and pass this 
     <lb/>
     report by reading out a lot of figures or are we 
     <lb/>
     going to have the whole truth? I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> In reply to Major Cashin, as 
     <lb/>
     regards the other report, you know as much about 
     <lb/>
     that as I do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The public have not been informed 
     <lb/>
     what is going on and the public are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     know. All very well to read off a list of figures; 
     <lb/>
     look at this $1,100,000 — $4,000 overspent. 
     <lb/>
     Where is it going to end? Particularly when there 
     <lb/>
     are suspicions over the whole department. It 
     <lb/>
     should be cleaned up before this report goes any 
     <lb/>
     further. It is up to the government to clean it up. 
     <lb/>
     If we are going to whitewash everything, it is time 
     <lb/>
     to close down the whole Convention. If I am in 
     <lb/>
     order I would move that the committee rise, 
     <lb/>
     report progress and ask leave to sit again; and in 
     <lb/>
     the meantime find out what is happening to the 
     <lb/>
     other affair before we go any further into the 
     <lb/>
     matter.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I second that motion.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Before we vote on it, does 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin really mean that?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When I make a motion of that kind, 
     <lb/>
     I mean it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was wondering, if he puts it to 
     <lb/>
     a vote — I am trying to picture developments 
     <lb/>
     from hour to hour. We have Easter coming up. I 
 

            <cb/>
          

     am sure Major Cashin knows the position of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I understand the position of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee. I think this Convention should 
     <lb/>
     demand an explanation. This document was 
     <lb/>
     given us two or three months ago. Inquiries are 
     <lb/>
     going on in one department and the public knows 
     <lb/>
     nothing about it. Nasty rumours are going around 
     <lb/>
     about this department and I contend we should 
     <lb/>
     not go any further until it is cleaned up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I did not recognise at first what 
     <lb/>
     you had in mind. I appreciate the situation now. 
     <lb/>
     Your motion is still in order, of course. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to point out that this Convention has no 
     <lb/>
     authority to obtain any such information from the 
     <lb/>
     government and if the government refuses, there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing we can do about it. In the meantime, I 
     <lb/>
     do suggest this to you: that these proceedings can 
     <lb/>
     go along. We are not likely to finish the report 
     <lb/>
     tonight. Even should we do so, on the 
     <lb/>
     committee's report you can raise the question 
     <lb/>
     again. I think that would be the better place to 
     <lb/>
     raise it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I appreciate your suggestion. This 
     <lb/>
     has been on the go for some time. True it does not 
     <lb/>
     concern the Convention, but these people are 
     <lb/>
     trustees of the people's money. We are the only 
     <lb/>
     elected representatives of the people in existence. 
     <lb/>
     I hold, whether under the Convention Act or any 
     <lb/>
     other act, we should demand and get an explana<lb break="no"/>tion into the whole business. If not, we are 
     <lb/>
     derelict in our duty here tonight. They saw fit to 
     <lb/>
     give us a document two or three months ago. We 
     <lb/>
     have kept our months shut about it. I want to serve 
     <lb/>
     notice on the government that I am going to open 
     <lb/>
     my mouth about it. My motion still stands. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> In regard to Major Cashin's mo<lb break="no"/>tion, I wonder could we not defer action on that 
     <lb/>
     at this time and proceed with our work and when

     the recapitulation of the reports come in, we will

     have an opportunity then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Getting the information is another 
     <lb/>
     thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Penney has given the thoughts I 
     <lb/>
     had in mind when Major Cashin made the mo<lb break="no"/>tion. I feel if I could go on with the report it would 
     <lb/>
     be better. We have Mining to come in and then 
     <lb/>
     Finance and then the delegation to London has to 
     <lb/>
     move off. This will give us time to consolidate all 
     <lb/>
     this into the main report. Eventually we all have 
     <lb/>
     to take our stand here. We have to pick to pieces 
     <lb/>
     all these reports and it is my firm conviction that 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin will not find himself alone at that 
     <lb/>
     time. I have done all I possibly could to get the 
     <lb/>
     information he refers to released to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion and to the people of this country. A whole 
     <lb/>
     lot of the facts contained in the various docu<lb break="no"/>ments will be looked into when a fully qualified 
     <lb/>
     government takes office in this country, and I do 
     <lb/>
     feel we should do nothing to jeopardise the work 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention. I would like to see Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin reconsider his position. I think we will get 
     <lb/>
     further in the end. We will all support each other 
     <lb/>
     when that main report comes before this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion and every man is called upon to speak ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the dictates of his conscience. Let us 
     <lb/>
     get on with the report. I would again ask Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin to please reconsider his motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In reply to Mr. Vardy, it looks to me 
     <lb/>
     like a case of whitewashing. We all know they 
     <lb/>
     have been down in that department digging up 
     <lb/>
     things and the report is incomplete. It does not 
     <lb/>
     contain the right facts and you know it. When we 
     <lb/>
     go to England I want to know the true statement 
     <lb/>
     of the Public Health and Welfare Department 
     <lb/>
     before I go over and talk to the Dorninions 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, otherwise how am I to know? The 
     <lb/>
     department is under a shadow. Clean it up! They 
     <lb/>
     have been at it six months; it could have been 
     <lb/>
     done three months ago. The Department of 
     <lb/>
     Public Health is deliberately hiding facts from 
     <lb/>
     this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I want to tell Major Cashin and the 
     <lb/>
     House that I am not in favour of smothering 
     <lb/>
     anything. I know in this report there is a whole 
     <lb/>
     lot of stuff hidden that the country and the House 
     <lb/>
     should know. But as I said we shall have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity later to go into that and to demand all 
     <lb/>
     the information we want. I think at this time it is 
     <lb/>
     better to get ahead with all the work we can. You 
     <lb/>
     have to go overseas the 24th or 25th of April and 
   

            <cb/>
   

     we can get that information later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We would like to have it before we 
     <lb/>
     go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I agree with that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am prepared to compromise. I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to go ahead but on condition that the 
     <lb/>
     report will not be definitely received until they 
     <lb/>
     get this information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is a matter for the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion to decide when we have the motion to receive 
     <lb/>
     the report and lay it on the table. That was my 
     <lb/>
     suggestion to you. Am I to understand that your 
     <lb/>
     motion is withdrawn? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I am not satisfied to withdraw. 
     <lb/>
     Three months ago we were asked to receive a 
     <lb/>
     confidential report. We were not allowed to use 
     <lb/>
     it or release it. What have they been doing? Are 
     <lb/>
     they going on investigating until the Convention 
     <lb/>
     winds up? I think the people are entitled to know 
     <lb/>
     about it. I regret very much that I took the con<lb break="no"/>fidential report. If I had not taken it I might be 
     <lb/>
     able to print it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I still suggest that the bringing 
     <lb/>
     up of this matter on the report of the committee 
     <lb/>
     is the proper place to hold up the report. In the 
     <lb/>
     meantime I suggest we let the details of the report 
     <lb/>
     go through. This is a committee of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion to examine the details of the report and to 
     <lb/>
     amend as the committee thinks they ought to be 
     <lb/>
     amended. When the report comes formally 
     <lb/>
     before the Convention, the whole thing is in the

     melting pot again and can be all discussed. I 
     <lb/>
     suggest you let it go through.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In connection with that statement 
     <lb/>
     that $45 million has been spent by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government on public health; also in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the matter raised this afternoon 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lady Anderson</hi>, it was 
     <lb/>
     intimated there was no doctor and no nurse. It was 
     <lb/>
     also insinuated that the hospital ship was not 
     <lb/>
     doing as much as she could in regard to medical 
     <lb/>
     services. I would like to point out....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I rise to a point of order. We 
     <lb/>
     have not said that the hospital ship has not had a 
     <lb/>
     nurse. I have the information here. Since June 
     <lb/>
     1941 there has been no doctor available, but there 
     <lb/>
     has been a nurse on the ship continuously. There 
     <lb/>
     is a nurse on the ship now.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In that connection, I would like to 
     <lb/>
     point out that during the past four years it has cost 
     <lb/>
     the country $45,000 to send a nurse on the south<lb break="no"/>west coast. Whether that is right or not, I do not 
     <lb/>
     know. I am wondering if the Committee enquired 
     <lb/>
     into that?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I think the point is the ship brings 
     <lb/>
     patients from the various places to the hospital, 
     <lb/>
     accompanied by a nurse. She may have been 
     <lb/>
     instrumental in saving a number of lives. If she 
     <lb/>
     has done that it would not have been a waste. 
     <lb/>
     Probably she has been giving better service than 
     <lb/>
     we know. I do not know much about the service.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> There have been periods of time, 
     <lb/>
     longer than a week, when that ship was without

     a nurse. I know what the expenditure is; whether 
     <lb/>
     it is justifiable to the taxpayers of the country, I 
     <lb/>
     do not know.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I telephoned Mr. Crummey and he

     told me the ship has a nurse continuously except

     when they have a change-over and that is a period 
     <lb/>
     of a week or longer.

     point out, as far as I could gather from the inter<lb break="no"/>views, that there is a difference of opinion in the 
     <lb/>
     department as to the value of the ship. As far as 
     <lb/>
     territory is concerned, actually when she went 
     <lb/>
     into service she covered part of the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast, Burgeo to Hermitage. Now she is on the 
     <lb/>
     Fortune Bay run. The point should be made clear 
     <lb/>
     as to what her real value is. If she has saved one 
     <lb/>
     or two lives, her services are worth that.

     know in Flowers Cove where a man had a large

     Humber district — 204 — which at $5 would be 
     <lb/>
     $1,020. The amount given is $1,070.00. I

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I must have been napping. On 
     <lb/>
     page 2 there is a little table that ought to be read 
     <lb/>
     out. It starts in 1934. If I remember, that is the 
     <lb/>
     year the investigation starts with, the changes that 
     <lb/>
     have taken place in Newfoundland since 1934. 
     <lb/>
     The reason 1934 is given is because that is the 
     <lb/>
     year the Commission of Government came here. 
     <lb/>
     This shows from 1934-39, the number of people 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland on relief — March, 1937, 
     <lb/>
     80,000; 1938, 45,000; March 1939, 67,000. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me these ought to be read out. Up to the 
     <lb/>
     outbreak of war we were still on the dole.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I find a lot of people who do 
     <lb/>
     forget it. Thousands of people think that before 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government came the 
     <lb/>
     country was on the dole. I know a lot of people 
     <lb/>
     who will tell you honestly that dole came here 
     <lb/>
     before Commission and that since Commission, 
     <lb/>
     everything has been prosperous. But these 
     <lb/>
     figures that the Commission gave us do not show 
     <lb/>
     that. They show us they had tens of thousands on 
     <lb/>
     the dole up to the day the war broke out; it did not 
     <lb/>
     disappear, it went right on. When the war broke 
     <lb/>
     out they increased it; we were giving them a lot 
     <lb/>
     more money — our money.

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> It is significant that 1933-34, prior

     to the war, the cost of government relief was $1.5 
     <lb/>
     million. Now this year, 1946-47, immediately

     after hostilities, you see the amount spent on 
     <lb/>
     reliefis practically the same $1.1 million. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask, is it a fact that in the outports every 
     <lb/>
     person gets $5 a head for relief? For instance, if 
     <lb/>
     a woman and child is left and her husband is

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> That is the rate, as I understand

     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> If that wife and child should be

     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Only under special orders —

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I have a special case in mind, where 
     <lb/>
     a man is in hospital, expecting to be there ten or 
     <lb/>
     12 months. He has a wife and child of two or three 
     <lb/>
     months; no income to depend on. What, in your

     look encouraging, but when you get down to 
     <lb/>
     brass tacks, those figures do not work out. I agree

     with Mr. Fudge when he said anyone not receiv<lb break="no"/>ing what they are entitled to should wire him. It

     is all right to publish figures and say that the wife

     and the child gets $5 each and $10 for special

     orders, they sound fine and look fine on paper; 
     <lb/>
     but when you come to see them in cold reality, I

     can tell you it is not a bit as encouraging as it is 
     <lb/>
     here. I think everyone in that condition should

     it. Do you think that a wife left with a small child, 
     <lb/>
     her husband in hospital — should they get $5 a 
     <lb/>
     month each and $10 a month extra for sick relief? 
     <lb/>
     Is that the opinion of your Committee? 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> In reply to Mr. Fowler, of 
     <lb/>course this man would have to qualify for relief 
     <lb/>because I presume he has not any means or any 
     <lb/>bank account. If you give me the name of the 
     <lb/>person and the locality, I will investigate it for 
     <lb/>you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I am not questioning you as a min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Crown. I know that you, as chairman 
     <lb/>of the Committee, are doing your utmost. In 
     <lb/>private I will give you the name of the man in 
     <lb/>question and point out to you where he is not 
     <lb/>getting near the amount stated in this report. It is 
     <lb/>not any fault of yourself or your Committee but 
     <lb/>the fault lies somewhere between the relieving 
     <lb/>officer and the department concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I will investigate that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Would this be correct, page 19<ref target="#fn_15">[1]</ref> — 
     <lb/>341 receiving able-bodied relief in March, 1946? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> These are the figures supplied 
     <lb/>us by the department. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> And in April 1939, the total on 
     <lb/>relief was 84,659 — that was five years after 
     <lb/>Commission of Government came here. Would 
     <lb/>that be right? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> In regard to the 341 on able-bodied 
     <lb/>relief in White Bay, I asked the department why 
     <lb/>that was so and they explained it was in a section 
     <lb/>where the fishery was an absolute failure. They 
     <lb/>were compelled to give temporary relief. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With reference to the 84,000, that was the peak 
     <lb/>
     of all time. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> To go back to the "three score 
     <lb/>years and ten". Take an old man of 75 years, he 
     <lb/>gets $12.50. Is that man entitled to able-bodied 


            <cb/>
         

     relief or sick relief? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> No. The amount is different 
     <lb/>
     now, it is $18.1fa man is married, he and his wife 
     <lb/>
     get $30 a quarter.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Perhaps it might be just as well 
     <lb/>
     to run through these tables so that members of the 
     <lb/>
     committee could ask questions. One or two ques<lb break="no"/>tions are given where we have read thus far.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In that summary, under able-bodied 
     <lb/>
     relief, the number is given as 2.688. I look back 
     <lb/>
     to page 18 and I find that is wholly for St. John's. 
     <lb/>
     There is no able-bodied relief anywhere else? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I do not think there was; it was 
     <lb/>practically non-existent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That was the only able-bodied relief 
     <lb/>
     last year. I want to bring that up because I saw 
     <lb/>
     where there were something like 5,600 on relief 
     <lb/>
     in Halifax which is another seaport town. It is 
     <lb/>
     something which is not the general condition of 
     <lb/>
     things either in this country or in Canada, but it 
     <lb/>
     is a seasonal thing which takes place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Yes, it is a seasonal thing. 
     <lb/>
     These men got out of employment and cannot get 
     <lb/>
     any further work, Naturally they have to fall back 
     <lb/>
     on the government. I presume it is mostly 
     <lb/>
     labourers and longshoremen. In winter time work 
     <lb/>
     is slack. I presume the same thing would apply to 
     <lb/>
     Halifax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> If you look through the whole year, 
     <lb/>
     you will find those conditions existed throughout 
     <lb/>
     the year and not seasonally except for White Bay. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> At the present time there are slightly 
     <lb/>over 100 outside the city on able-bodied relief.
