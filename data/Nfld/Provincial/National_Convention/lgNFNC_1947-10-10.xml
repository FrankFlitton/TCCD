     Mr. Chairman It is usual for the Clerk to read 
     <lb/>
     the report. In this particular instance the report is 
     <lb/>
     rather voluminous, and at a meeting of the Steer<lb break="no"/>ing Committee this morning it was suggested that 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the better way would be to read the 
     <lb/>
     introduction only, and the matter could then be 
     <lb/>
     dealt with and a decision made as to how this 
     <lb/>
     report would be handled It was further sug<lb break="no"/>gested, and I don't imagine that either of our 
     <lb/>
     secretaries will object, that in view of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood is more or less familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     document, he might read it. If there are no objec<lb break="no"/>tions I will ask Mr. Smallwood to proceed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jackman I object. I think we have un<lb break="no"/>finished business here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Sit down, please, you are out of 
     <lb/>
     order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Smallwood read the introduction]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, that is the intro<lb break="no"/>duction to the report that this delegation has 
     <lb/>
     brought back from Ottawa, and which is now on 
     <lb/>
     the desk of each member of the Convention. I 
     <lb/>
     intend to say nothing more at this time, except 
     <lb/>
     thatI will move that the report lie on the table and 
     <lb/>
     that the matter of debating it, or even reading it, 
     <lb/>
     be deferred until a more appropriate time. The 
     <lb/>
     thought of the Steering Committee this morning 
     <lb/>
     was that the best time to read this whole report 
     <lb/>
     would be after the terms themselves have arrived 
     <lb/>
     from the Government of Canada; then the terms 
     <lb/>
     and this report can be taken together, because one 
     <lb/>
     belongs to the other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I sit down, I want to raise a matter of 
     <lb/>
     privilege. There is one thing on which all New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders agree: if there is one class of per<lb break="no"/>sons in this country who deserve the respect and 
     <lb/>
     the love and admiration of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, it is the clergy of all denominations, 
     <lb/>
     and I regret to say that in this city there is pub<lb break="no"/>lished a newspaper known as the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> 
     <lb/>
     which, while we were absent doing work for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, was contemptible enough to 
     <lb/>
     publish prominently a vile and a vicious attack 
     <lb/>
     upon a minister of the gospel, and I refer to the 
 

            <cb/>
         

     Rev. Lester L. Burry, who was not even present 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland to defend his good name. That 
     <lb/>
     vile sheet, owned and edited by one of the most 
     <lb/>
     hypocritical, holier-than-thou... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett I rise to a point of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I am going to get this off my 
     <lb/>
     chest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett I understand that we assembled here 
     <lb/>
     to receive and later discuss the report that the 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Ottawa has brought back. I submit 
     <lb/>
     the last speaker is out of order by speaking to 
     <lb/>
     something not on the order paper. And I, for one, 
     <lb/>
     am not going to stay in this Convention room and 
     <lb/>
     allow any man to get up in defense of any man at 
     <lb/>
     this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood You can go out if you like; you 
     <lb/>
     are better off out of it anyway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Order! If I cannot have order, I 
     <lb/>
     shall leave the Chair, While I am in the Chair, I 
     <lb/>
     will tell you what you will do. When I go out, you 
     <lb/>
     can do as you please; but while I am here, I will 
     <lb/>
     rule. In the first place, Mr. Smallwood's motion 
     <lb/>
     was to receive and lay on the table the report of 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation. He made that motion. 
     <lb/>
     Before he sat down, he took occasion to refer to 
     <lb/>
     an attack which had been made by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> 
     <lb/>
     upon a member of this Convention. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has every right to raise it as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of privilege; but he has not the right to raise it 
     <lb/>
     immediately upon moving a resolution. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, you cannot proceed with that perora<lb break="no"/>tion of yours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I bow to your ruling, but I want 
     <lb/>
     to serve notice on the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> that the lid is 
     <lb/>
     coming off — and on Mr. Hollett, too — this is 
     <lb/>
     one time the truth is going to be told about that 
     <lb/>
     rag, and I will do it at the proper time in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with the rules. I move that the report lie on 
     <lb/>
     the table of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Crosbie I second that motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Miller Before the question is put, there is 
     <lb/>
     one point I would like to be clear on — footnote 
     <lb/>
     on page 4:<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> "This summary of proceedings was 
     <lb/>
     considered and agreed to at the final meeting of 
 

<note xml:id="fn_01">[1] During this debate, the members of the Convention are referring to the so-called Black Books, which are not 
     <lb/>
     reproduced here. These volumes contained information on the Canadian federal system, and minutes of meet<lb break="no"/>ings in Ottawa. The proposed terms of union were communicated on November 6, 1947. Volume II:510. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>

     the Conference on September 29th." I think, as 
     <lb/>
     additional information, Mr. Smallwood might 
     <lb/>
     tell us the names of those who attended the final 
     <lb/>
     meeting, and if the summary was agreed to by all 
     <lb/>
     parties. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman It is up to Mr. Smallwood to 
     <lb/>decide what information he will give; it is not 
     <lb/>relevant. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood The meeting was the last plen<lb break="no"/>ary session held before we left Ottawa, Septem<lb break="no"/>ber 29. That was attended by all members of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation, a number of ministers 
     <lb/>
     of the cabinet of Canada, and a number of per<lb break="no"/>manent officials who had been sitting in on our 
     <lb/>
     various plenary sessions. It was agreed to by all 
     <lb/>
     members of the Newfoundland delegation and by 
     <lb/>
     all members of the cabinet of Canada who at<lb break="no"/>tended. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt On page 6, paragraph 12: "The follow<lb break="no"/>ing sub-committees were appointed..." By 
     <lb/>
     whom? How? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman They were appointed verbally. 
     <lb/>
     The Canadian members of the sub-committees 
     <lb/>
     were appointed by the Hon. Mr. St. Laurent, the 
     <lb/>
     chairman; and the Newfoundland members of the 
     <lb/>
     sub-committees were appointed by me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt Page 7: "Sub-committee on Economic 
     <lb/>
     Development composed of to examine into the 
     <lb/>
     availability of data on the physical resources and 
     <lb/>
     general economic conditions of Newfoundland." 
     <lb/>
     Did that sub-committee report? There is no ap<lb break="no"/>pendix according to the regular pattern. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwnod The answer to that question 
     <lb/>
     will be very gladly given at the moment the terms 
     <lb/>
     arrive, because the answer to that will be in the 
     <lb/>
     terms, in my belief; that refers to the economic 
     <lb/>
     surveys to be made of the resources of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to see what can be done, if anything, 
     <lb/>
     and how and when to develop the resources of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Dawe Was the subject of the Crown Lands 
     <lb/>
     Act discussed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman There was no specific discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the Crown Lands Act of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Jackman When we adjourned we had a lot 
     <lb/>of unfinished business. I think that is the first 
     <lb/>thing to be taken care of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman You can raise that question 
     <lb/>
     when this particular question has been dealt with. 
     <lb/>
     The question before the Chair is the reception of 
     <lb/>
     this report and the laying of it upon the table. I 
 

            <cb/>
          

     will gladly give you an opportunity to inquire into 
     <lb/>
     any matters on which you need light when this 
     <lb/>
     particular resolution has been dealt with.

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Notices of motion. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin to give notice that he will on tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     move that the report of the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     be reconsidered.

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin This Finance report has been in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Convention since the 16 of April. I 
     <lb/>
     give notice that I will move that the Convention 
     <lb/>
     resolve itself into a committee of the whole to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the findings of the Finance Committee.

            </p>
            <p>Mr. Butt I give notice that I will move the

     <lb/>to the attention of members of this Convention 
     <lb/>that its presiding officer, both in his official 
     <lb/>capacity.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Just a moment; I have some<lb break="no"/>thing to say. A good many of you here present — 
     <lb/>
     and I refer now, of course, to the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, not to those technically termed 
     <lb/>
     "strangers" outside the bar — a good many of you 
     <lb/>
     will remember that when I was first approached 
     <lb/>
     to allow myself to be recommended for the posi<lb break="no"/>tion as Chairman, I refused point blank to do so. 
     <lb/>
     I had no desire whatever to be Chairman. I was 
     <lb/>
     not sent here for that purpose. I finally consented, 
     <lb/>
     and in doing so, I made it crystal clear that I had 
     <lb/>
     no intention of giving up my rights as an elected 
     <lb/>
     member. Whatever rights you have, I have. If you 
     <lb/>
     have a right to believe in this or that form of 
     <lb/>
     government, I have exactly the same right. If you 
     <lb/>
     have the right to express, either in private or in 
     <lb/>
     public. your beliefs or opinions about forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, I have exactly that same right. These 
     <lb/>
     facts I made perfectly plain from the outset. Al<lb break="no"/>though I was not present at the meeting at which 
     <lb/>
     I was recommended — unanimously, incidental<lb break="no"/>ly — to the government for the office of Chair<lb break="no"/>man, I have it from good sources that it was made 
     <lb/>
     abundantly clear to you all that I would not accept 
     <lb/>
     your recommendation except upon the definite 
     <lb/>
     understanding that all my rights as an elected 
     <lb/>
     member were preserved to me in their entirety. 
     <lb/>
     That fact is made perfectly clear in the act which 
     <lb/>
     authorised my appointment. But, though I for<lb break="no"/>feited no rights when I became Chairman, I did 
     <lb/>
     take on additional and special duties. What were 
     <lb/>
     those duties? Simply these: that I would faithfully 
     <lb/>
     and impartially conduct the proceedings of the

     Convention, carry out the by-laws and rules of 
     <lb/>
     debate and enforce rules of order. That is all the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman of the Convention, acting as Chair<lb break="no"/>man, can be expected to do.

     If I have erred at all, it has been on the side of

     leniency — leniency to all members, for I recog<lb break="no"/>nised that 14 years without any form of democra<lb break="no"/>tic institutions did not lend itself to the fostering 
     <lb/>
     or the development. of skilled parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     debaters, well versed in the rules and order of 
     <lb/>
     debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The position of Chairman, of course, takes me 
     <lb/>
     out of the realm of debate. I have never taken 
     <lb/>
     advantage of my undoubted right to place the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary temporarily in the Chair and go to the 
     <lb/>
     floor for the purpose of expressing my views. I 
     <lb/>
     had the right to do that, but I have never done it. 
     <lb/>
     That tight I would only exercise upon the gravest 
     <lb/>
     of issues. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In some respects the position of Chairman is 
     <lb/>
     exceptional Because of his position it would be 
     <lb/>
     entirely improper for him to engage in the cut and 
     <lb/>
     thrust of debate. He is therefore in all well-or<lb break="no"/>dered organisations held to be immune from per<lb break="no"/>sonal attack. In fact such an attack, whether 
     <lb/>
     justified or not, has the effect of destroying his 
     <lb/>
     usefulness in office; it impugns his integrity, 
     <lb/>
     whether justifiable or not; moreover, such an 
     <lb/>
     attack is unfair to the Chairman for he cannot 
     <lb/>
     adequately defend himself without taking part in 
     <lb/>
     the ruck of the debate on the floor. Being in that 
     <lb/>
     position, the Chairman of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     should, by all the canons of decency, propriety 
     <lb/>
     and fair play be immune from attack or insinua<lb break="no"/>tion so long as he faithfully carries out the rules 
     <lb/>
     of the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Once already my integrity has been called into 
     <lb/>
     question in this House. I refer to the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     report of the London delegation when I made a 
     <lb/>
     specific and unmistakable statement about the 
     <lb/>
     form of our conversations with the British 
     <lb/>
     government. May I say I appreciate very highly 
     <lb/>
     the co-operation of the two members of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation who stood in their places and sup<lb break="no"/>ported my statements. I overlooked that incident. 
     <lb/>
     It was the first of its kind and I was willing to 
     <lb/>
     attribute it to the heat of debate. Now another 
     <lb/>
     such occasion has arisen, and I have to inform this 
     <lb/>
     Convention that I have not the slightest intention 
     <lb/>
     of tolerating further attack in a position where I 
     <lb/>
     cannot defend myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     I am perfectly well aware that a sort of cam<lb break="no"/>paign of slander has been carried on against me 
     <lb/>
     by persons whose views I am not in agreement 
     <lb/>
     with. I am supposed to be in receipt of a sizeable 
     <lb/>
     salary as Chairman, even the amount is named, 
     <lb/>
     when the simple truth is I never asked for any 
     <lb/>
     salary, I never was offered any, I have never 
     <lb/>
     received a cent, and lastly, I would not take it. I 
     <lb/>
     have received exactly the same salary as you 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen received and nothing more. I pay scant 
     <lb/>
     attention to these slanders. What I do object to is 
     <lb/>
     the slightest hint or insinuation that as Chairman 
     <lb/>
     I have failed at any time to be fair, impartial and 
     <lb/>
     honourable to all members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This Chairmanship has meant nothing to me; 
     <lb/>
     nothing but additional work, worry and physical 
     <lb/>
     discomfort. I will not tolerate any attempt to call 
     <lb/>
     my impartiality as Chairman into question. I shall 
     <lb/>
     resume my seat in the main body of this chamber 
     <lb/>
     and confine my activities and exercise my right 
     <lb/>
     as an elected member; but before doing so I 
     <lb/>
     would offer a last word of sound advice which 
     <lb/>
     you would do well to heed. It is this: remember 
     <lb/>
     always, please, that the eyes of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland are upon us; they are watching 
     <lb/>
     our every more and listening to our every word; 
     <lb/>
     they are weighing us. At times I fear we have 
     <lb/>
     gone far to bring democratic institutions into 
     <lb/>
     contempt; we have gone far to create a distaste 
     <lb/>
     for all forms of elective government. I warn you 
     <lb/>
     to remember that not we, but the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country are the masters, and we had better not try 
     <lb/>
     their tolerance too far if we value our reputations 
     <lb/>
     as public men. Gentlemen, this Convention is 
     <lb/>
     without a Chairman.

            <p>[The Acting Chairman¹ read a commission ap-<lb break="maybe"/>pointingJohn Bernard McEvoy as Chairman]<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     
     
     Mr. Bradley Mr. Secretary, may I avail myself 
     <lb/>
     of this, the first opportunity, to publicly convey 
     <lb/>
     my congratulations to my very good friend, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McEvoy, our new Chairman, on his appointment 
     <lb/>
     to this most important office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not think that I am unduly egotistic when 
     <lb/>
     I say there is no one in this Convention more 
     <lb/>
     qualified to appreciate the problems and the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties which at times beset the Chairman than 
     <lb/>
     myself, for I occupied the post for a period of 
     <lb/>
     nearly 12 months and I had particular opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to observe those errors which contribute so large<lb break="no"/>ly to the Chairman's problems. One of the very 
     <lb/>
     greatest of our errors has been a casual assump<lb break="no"/>tion that we are a political body, even a partly 
     <lb/>
     political body. The method of our election by the 
     <lb/>
     people has tended to foster that illusion and our 
     <lb/>
     adoption of a parliamentary framework for our 
     <lb/>
     deliberations has tended to confirm it. There is a 
     <lb/>
     tendency to assume that we may speak for the 
     <lb/>
     people in a representative capacity, where no 
     <lb/>
     such right exists. And that for two reasons: the 
     <lb/>
     first, in its nature double, I suppose, has to do with 
     <lb/>
     our election to the seats which we now occupy. 
     <lb/>
     A substantial number of us are here by acclama<lb break="no"/>tion and received no votes. Many others of us 
     <lb/>
     received votes and hold our seats by the franchise 
     <lb/>
     of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25% of 
     <lb/>
     the electorate of our particular district. We can 
     <lb/>
     hardly then claim to have been sent here as a body 
     <lb/>
     by a majority of the electors of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there is an even greater reason for this. We 
     <lb/>
     were not elected to carry out any particular 
     <lb/>
     policy, for no such policy could properly exist. 
     <lb/>
     Far from pledging allegiance to any form of 
     <lb/>
     government or policy, our duty under the act 
     <lb/>
     which created us was nothing more or less than 
     <lb/>
     that of investigating and recommending, as a 
     <lb/>
     result of our investigations, to the Crown. We 
     <lb/>
     were and are in the nature of somewhat numerous 
     <lb/>
     royal commissions charged with duties as inves- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     tigators of facts, and obligated to make recom<lb break="no"/>mendations to the Crown just as a royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion does. It is fair to say that in reality the only 
     <lb/>
     difference between this Convention and a royal 
     <lb/>
     commission is the method of our selection. Quite 
     <lb/>
     clearly, it is outside our province to advocate 
     <lb/>
     particular forms of government. It is quite 
     <lb/>
     human, of course, that we should have opinions 
     <lb/>
     as to forms of government. I think l am not going 
     <lb/>
     too far if I say that any man who has not got 
     <lb/>
     personal opinions about forms of government is 
     <lb/>
     not a man fitted to be in this Convention at all. 
     <lb/>
     But those views should not be allowed to obtrude 
     <lb/>
     themselves into our deliberations. Our duty is not 
     <lb/>
     to advocate, but simply and objectively to recom<lb break="no"/>mend, not the particular form of government 
     <lb/>
     which appeals to us, but those forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment which may be suitable in the circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     Ours is not the right to decide; we have nothing 
     <lb/>
     to do with decisions. It is ours to recommend 
     <lb/>
     forms upon which the people themselves will 
     <lb/>
     decide. Theirs is the duty, theirs alone the right to 
     <lb/>
     make the ultimate selection. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Speaking for myself, as I see the position 
     <lb/>
     today, I shall have to recommend to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government, insofar as my vote in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention goes, one form of government which 
     <lb/>
     I do not altogether like, and another which I shall 
     <lb/>
     definitely vote against at the plebiscite. I must 
     <lb/>
     recommend them notwithstanding that I do not 
     <lb/>
     like them — I do not like the one and I am 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the other — because they are forms 
     <lb/>
     which might be suitable and which the people 
     <lb/>
     might select; and I have no right whatever to 
     <lb/>
     debar the people from the right to vote for or 
     <lb/>
     against any form of government which might be 
     <lb/>
     suitable. If we could have kept that one point in 
     <lb/>
     view, many of our difficulties could not have 
     <lb/>
     arisen and much of the ill-will which has 
     <lb/>
     developed could have been avoided. Unfortu<lb break="no"/>nately it was not so. Political ideologies were 
     <lb/>
     adopted and fought for — sincerely enough, per<lb break="no"/>haps, but definitely erroneous.
