<!--<p>
     of development. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are many who hold that this country has 
     <lb/>
     suffered grievously by being tied down to the 
     <lb/>
     system of education of other countries. They do 
     <lb/>
     not believe that any system, no matter how excel<lb break="no"/>lent in its own country, is really suited to our life 
     <lb/>
     and problems. It is their belief that we must 
     <lb/>
     evolve our own system of education completely 
     <lb/>
     independently of other countries, so that New- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     foundlanders may develop their own way of life 
     <lb/>
     with the enlightenment and enrichment that only 
     <lb/>
     a sound educational system can provide, and in 
     <lb/>
     my belief this system can only be developed from 
     <lb/>
     the establishing of a cultural focus, such as a 
     <lb/>
     university. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I now wish to move the following resolution: 
     <lb/>
     I move that the report of the Committee on 
     <lb/>
     Education be further considered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt I second that motion. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>[The motion carried.] 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I ask leave to move the following 
     <lb/>resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas it is the opinion of this Convention 
     <lb/>that the status of the Memorial University 
     <lb/>College should be raised to that of a degree- 
     <lb break="yes"/>conferring institution, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Be it therefore resolved that this Convention 
     <lb/>places itself on record as being of opinion that 
     <lb/>the necessary financial arrangements should 
     <lb/>be made immediately by the Honourable the 
     <lb/>Commission of Government for this purpose, 
     <lb/>And be it further resolved that a copy of this 
     <lb/>resolution be forwarded to the Honourable 
     <lb/>the Commission of Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The situation is very awkward. 
     <lb/>That is not an amendment to the Education 
     <lb/>Report. It is an expression of opinion to be sent 
     <lb/>to the Commission of Government. I cannot see 
     <lb/>the connection. Frankly, I did not know what 
     <lb/>your motion was to be. I thought there was some<lb break="no"/>thing to be added to the Education Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I understood the only way I could

     bring it in was to move that the report be con<lb break="no"/>sidered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You have the report on the table 
     <lb/>
     for further consideration; what do you propose to 
     <lb/>
     do with it? I think it is unnecessary to touch the 
     <lb/>
     report for the purpose of Mr. Higgins' making his 
     <lb/>
     resolution. I am prepared to receive the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The Education Committee recom<lb break="no"/>mended that the Memorial College should be 
     <lb/>
     extended to a degree conferring institution, but 
     <lb/>
     they did not recommend that the government find 
     <lb/>
     the money for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Why not let it stay at that? In 
     <lb/>
     incorporating it in the report it does not go to the 
     <lb/>
     government. The government has nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with our reports. Here is a recommendation to the 
     <lb/>
     government. Some months ago we made a 
     <lb/>
     recommendation that nothing further be done 
     <lb/>
     with the assets of the country. That resolution was 
     <lb/>
     adopted and sent to the Commission. Now 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins thinks we should send another ex<lb break="no"/>pression of opinion, that the Memorial University 
     <lb/>
     College be given full university status. There is 
     <lb/>
     no reason why we cannot do that and not disturb 
     <lb/>
     the Education Report.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The Education Report is now

     I am directed to point out to you that the 
     <lb/>
     question raised in this resolution is substan<lb break="no"/>tially the same question as was raised in 
     <lb/>
     clause I of the resolution adopted by the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention pursuant to motion of 
     <lb/>
     February 4th, 1947, and discussed at the con<lb break="no"/>ference of a Committee of the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention with His Excellency the Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Commission held at Government House on 
     <lb/>
     February 8th, 1947. The Report of that Con<lb break="no"/>ference, which was adopted by the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, states that upon the question "respecting 
     <lb/>
     steps for establishing economic or fiscal 
     <lb/>
     relationship between the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland your Committee was in<lb break="no"/>formed that this question was one for 
     <lb/>
     negotiation between Governments through 
     <lb/>
     the regular diplomatic channels". The Com<lb break="no"/>mission consider that this statement applied 
     <lb/>
     equally to the discussions proposed by your 
     <lb/>
     resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the conference it was pointed out that 
     <lb/>
     it was doubtful whether the subject matter of 
  

            <cb/>
           

     the clause came within the terms of reference 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention. Respecting the proposal 
     <lb/>
     in the present resolution for trade and 
     <lb/>
     economic discussions between a delegation 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention and the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America, the Commission 
     <lb/>
     consider that that is entirely outside the terms 
     <lb/>
     of reference and the powers and authority of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not clear from the resolution whether 
     <lb/>
     it is the desire of the Convention that the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland make any ar<lb break="no"/>rangements in this matter. In case this should 
     <lb/>
     be the desire of the Convention, I am to point 
     <lb/>
     out that the Commission could not take any 
     <lb/>
     steps towards arranging for any such discus<lb break="no"/>sions.

     seconded the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have looked up some facts concerning near<lb break="no"/>by parts of the world, those nearest to New<lb break="no"/>foundland — Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward island. The population of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, with Labrador, is about 320,000. In 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, with a population less than twice the 
     <lb/>
     population of Newfoundland, they have eight 
     <lb/>
     degree-conferring educational institutions. In the 


            <cb/>
         

     city of Halifax alone there are five.... in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, with less than 200,000 more than our 
     <lb/>
     own population, they have five degree-confer<lb break="no"/>ring institutions and in the tiny province of 
     <lb/>
     PEI, with only 95,000, they have one.... We have 
     <lb/>
     not got even one. Not one in all the island, where 
     <lb/>
     a Newfoundland boy or girl, young man and 
     <lb/>
     young woman can attend and take sufficient 
     <lb/>
     training to lead to the conferring of a degree. This 
     <lb/>
     motion is to the effect that, in the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, not that we can do anything about it, 
     <lb/>
     the Memorial University College ought to be 
     <lb/>
     raised to the status of a degree-conferring institu<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am no authority on education but I am fully 
     <lb/>
     agreed that from a purely educational standpoint 
     <lb/>
     the Memorial College ought to be raised to that 
     <lb/>
     status, but there is another side to it, another angle 
     <lb/>
     that interests me a great deal. in this country of 
     <lb/>
     ours we have had 450 years of a very remarkable 
     <lb/>
     history — perhaps the most remarkable history 
     <lb/>
     of any part of the western half of the world. This 
     <lb/>
     is a country in which we have developed very 
     <lb/>
     distinctive peculiarities. We have our own tradi<lb break="no"/>tions. We have our own folklore. We have our

     own folkmusic. I remember on one occasion in 
     <lb/>
     London going to talk to Miss Maud Karpeles, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps one of the world's greatest authorities on 
     <lb/>
     world folksongs, and her telling me that in New<lb break="no"/>foundland there had been discovered some of the 
     <lb/>
     oldest and most interesting folksongs anywhere 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the Atlantic. We have got a distinc<lb break="no"/>tive culture all our own, and yet we have nothing 
     <lb/>
     ...with the exception of the O'Leary poetry award 
     <lb/>
     which is given annually, we have nothing, nor 
     <lb/>
     have we had anything to foster and encourage the 
     <lb/>
     development and growth and recognition of a 
     <lb/>
     distinctly Newfoundland culture. And one of the 
     <lb/>
     most attractive possibilities of the Memorial 
     <lb/>
     University, if it became a university, would be 
     <lb/>
     that of having the university become a dynamo, 
     <lb/>
     a power-house, in the inculcation and dissemina<lb break="no"/>tion and encouragement of a distinctly New<lb break="no"/>foundland culture, because mark this, whatever 
     <lb/>
     form of government we may have in the future ... 
     <lb/>
     remember this, that we Newfoundlanders must 
     <lb/>
     never for a moment forget or neglect or turn our 
     <lb/>
     backs on our own distinctive Newfoundland out<lb break="no"/>look on life, our distinctive Newfoundland cul<lb break="no"/>ture. I go a step further; in the case of our deciding 
     <lb/>
     some day this fall, perhaps, in the national 
     <lb/>
     referendum, to link this country with another 
     <lb/>
     country, in such a case it will be more important 
     <lb/>
     than ever to see to it that our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     culture is preserved and encouraged and fostered 
     <lb/>
     and developed, and in no way can that be done 
     <lb/>
     better than through the creation of a New<lb break="no"/>foundland university. I wanted to make that 
     <lb/>
     point. It is not a new point, I have been making it 
     <lb/>
     for many, many years, and I want to associate 
     <lb/>
     myself very heartily indeed with the motion.... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JONE5">Mr. Jones</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have been con<lb break="no"/>nected with education all my life, having taught 
     <lb/>in some of the principal high schools of this 
     <lb/>country, and I rise to support the resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I consider that Memorial College should be a 
     <lb/>
     degree-conferring institution. There have been 
     <lb/>
     many boys and girls thwarted in their education 
     <lb/>
     by the lack of such an institution in this country. 
     <lb/>
     During the last ten or 15 years I know of many 
     <lb/>
     young men and women who, having completed 
     <lb/>
     their second year at the Memorial College, were 
     <lb/>
     handicapped by the lack of funds from continuing 
     <lb/>
     their studies abroad. Had we such an institution 
     <lb/>
     in this country, some of these boys and girls 
     <lb/>
     would have been able to continue their studies 


            <cb/>
           

     and obtained their BA degree. The same of 
     <lb/>
     course applies to any other course of studies 
     <lb/>
     taken at the Memorial College. As time goes on, 
     <lb/>
     the need of such an institution will be more urgent 
     <lb/>
     because many of our young people are beginning 
     <lb/>
     to realise the necessity of such an education. Why 
     <lb/>
     should we not do our utmost to make it possible 
     <lb/>
     for these young people to reach their goal? I hope 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government will give the 
     <lb/>
     matter their serious consideration; if so, it will be 
     <lb/>
     one of the best things they have done for our 
     <lb/>
     young people during their reign.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> As a Newfoundlander first, 
     <lb/>
     deeply concerned with the customs, traditions, 
     <lb/>
     progress and destiny of my native land, and 
     <lb/>
     secondly as a graduate of the Memorial College, 
     <lb/>
     I am more than glad to be in a position of national 
     <lb/>
     significance today, whereby I am able to support 
     <lb/>
     the motion of Mr. Higgins that the Memorial 
     <lb/>
     College be granted the necessary charter by the 
     <lb/>
     government enabling it to confer degrees. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not propose to speak at any great length 
     <lb/>
     on this matter, which is beyond controversy. The 
     <lb/>
     mover has summed up most of the arguments in 
     <lb/>
     favour, and at the same time disposed of some of 
     <lb/>
     the most outstanding antagonisms with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the elevation of the Memorial College to full 
     <lb/>
     university status. Other speakers have enlarged 
     <lb/>
     on the theme and it has been covered rather 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly. Yet I cannot let this opportunity pass 
     <lb/>
     without adding a few comments of my own on a 
     <lb/>
     subject that is very close to my heart.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What is a university? Too many people have 
     <lb/>
     the wrong idea. They think it means snobbishness 
     <lb/>
     — they think it is a place where a young man or 
     <lb/>
     young woman attends for so many years to 
     <lb/>
     emerge with several letters after his or her name, 
     <lb/>
     which do not mean very much. How mistaken an 
     <lb/>
     idea! In this country, the tendency to think of a 
     <lb/>
     university as a breeding-ground of snobbishness 
     <lb/>
     arises from the fact that only those who can afford 
     <lb/>
     it attend a university. But that is not a true ap<lb break="no"/>preciation of the real case. The reason that so 
     <lb/>
     many of our young people do not, cannot attend 
     <lb/>
     a university, is simply that there is no university 
     <lb/>
     in the country. The cost of attending a university 
     <lb/>
     is relatively small — that is the actual tuition fees, 
     <lb/>
     and so on. In the case of Newfoundlanders, it is 
     <lb/>
     the expense of travelling, board and lodging and 
     <lb/>
     the rest, that makes attending a foreign university 
     <lb/>
     prohibitive to most. The establishment of a New<lb break="no"/>

     foundland university would get over these obsta<lb break="no"/>cles in great part — and even in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     out-of-town student, he or she would be able to 
     <lb/>
     complete a university course at a much lower cost 
     <lb/>
     than formerly possible, and emerge with a degree 
     <lb/>
     from a university peopled, staffed and run by 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders, along lines best suited to the 
     <lb/>
     development of the Newfoundland character, 
     <lb/>
     and with a view to fitting its graduates to cope 
     <lb/>
     more successfully with the more obvious 
     <lb/>
     problems of our national life. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That has been the trouble with us in the past. 
     <lb/>
     All our education, before we got the Memorial 
     <lb/>
     College, and after we had it, tended to fit our boys 
     <lb/>
     and girls, and young men and young women, for 
     <lb/>
     a university education, which could only be ob<lb break="no"/>tained at universities in England and Ireland and 
     <lb/>
     Scotland, and in more recent years the United 
     <lb/>
     States and Canada. Only the well-to-do or the 
     <lb/>
     exceptionally scholarly students who captured 
     <lb/>
     scholarships could ever hope to complete that 
     <lb/>
     education. And when they did, they were being 
     <lb/>
     educated on the curriculum of the particular 
     <lb/>
     university, which in most cases was moulded to 
     <lb/>
     the needs or objects of that particular country. 
     <lb/>
     Our students were educated "away" from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, not in the mere sense of being out 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, but more especially in this 
     <lb/>
     sense: as the word "educate" means "to lead out", 
     <lb/>
     so "educate away" meant also to "lead away 
     <lb/>
     from" Newfoundland, and that's just what hap<lb break="no"/>pened. The majority of our students never came 
     <lb/>
     back; many of those who did were forever more 
     <lb/>
     or less aliens. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The possession of our own Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     university would change that position. The main 
     <lb/>
     purpose of a university is not simply to confer 
     <lb/>
     degrees. Getting a degree is almost incidental — 
     <lb/>
     it is just something that comes at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     university course, as the mechanic receives his 
     <lb/>
     certificate after having served his time. No one 
     <lb/>
     will say that the certificate that the mechanic 
     <lb/>
     receives is more important than the years of his 
     <lb/>
     apprenticeship; by the same token no one should 
     <lb/>
     say that the degree is more important than the 
     <lb/>
     years of study and training that precede its grant<lb break="no"/>ing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In a University of Newfoundland our students 
     <lb/>
     could be trained along lines calculated to help to 
     <lb/>
     develop and broaden the national life and out<lb break="no"/>look. They could be educated with a view to the 


            <cb/>
        

     development of our industries and our culture — 
     <lb/>
     our peculiarly Newfoundland culture, which is 
     <lb/>
     no more like the culture of England, Ireland or 
     <lb/>
     Scotland than it is like the culture of Canada or 
     <lb/>
     the United States. It combines them all. There 
     <lb/>
     could be connected with the university a school 
     <lb/>
     of education for the fisheries. There could be 
     <lb/>
     courses on such subjects as elementary fisheries 
     <lb/>
     conservation, economics of the fishery, and the 
     <lb/>
     countries with which we deal in fish, on process<lb break="no"/>ing, on markets. And of course it is unnecessary 
     <lb/>
     to emphasise the need for more foundational 
     <lb/>
     training and education in connection with re<lb break="no"/>search work in the various fields of fishery 
     <lb/>
     science. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is no need to labour the point. There is 
     <lb/>
     a need for a University of Newfoundland. Its cost 
     <lb/>
     as we have seen is relatively small. The Memorial 
     <lb/>
     College must be enlarged. It is bursting at the 
     <lb/>
     seams now — it must have a new wing, whether 
     <lb/>
     or not it receives its university charter.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The additional cost is so comparatively little 
     <lb/>
     that there would seem to be no reason for holding 
     <lb/>
     back. I understand that the charter is already 
     <lb/>
     prepared and has been in the offices of the 
     <lb/>
     government for some time. awaiting popular 
     <lb/>
     demand. The popular demand is now being made 
     <lb/>
     in full voice, from organisations in all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country. Twenty-five years ago the Memorial 
     <lb/>
     College was established as a war memorial to the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders who died in the First World 
     <lb/>
     War. It could not be more appropriate than to 
     <lb/>
     raise the college to a degree-conferring univer<lb break="no"/>sity this year, as a memorial to the New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders — many of them Old Memorials — 
     <lb/>
     who died in World War Two. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This year 1947 is a very historic year. The 24th 
     <lb/>
     of June next marks the 450th anniversary of 
     <lb/>
     Cabot's landfall. It will be a year of great celebra<lb break="no"/>tions and events. Again, the time is ripe for the 
     <lb/>
     granting of a charter to the Memorial College. 
     <lb/>
     Celebrations, fireworks, these things pass away, 
     <lb/>
     but an institution of learning remains to enlighten 
     <lb/>
     the succeeding generations, and to make their life 
     <lb/>
     richer and their hopes more easily obtainable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I could say a great deal more, but there are 
     <lb/>
     others who will echo what I have said, and add 
     <lb/>
     what I have left out, so I would conclude with a 
     <lb/>
     few words from one of the presidents of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, James A. Garfield, who said: 
     <lb/>
     "Next in importance to freedom and justice is

     popular education, without which neither justice 
     <lb/>
     nor freedom can be permanently maintained" I 
     <lb/>
     leave that thought with all of you — realising that 
     <lb/>
     the establishment of a University of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will be an immense stride forward in 
     <lb/>
     the growth of popular education in New<lb break="no"/>foundland....

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> ....For many months me Convention 
     <lb/>has been occupied with attempting to assess the 
     <lb/>natural resources of this country — fish, ore, 
     <lb/>lumber and other industries. It has not been our 
     <lb/>business to assess that most natural and basic of 
     <lb/>all resources, that is, our people, our human 
     <lb/>resources. There is not one man here who is not 
     <lb/>conscious of the great potentialities of these 
     <lb/>human resources — the stuff and fabric of all we 
     <lb/>have attempted, suffered and achieved. There are 
     <lb/>many who may not yet have realised that our men 
     <lb/>and women, like our industries, are capable of 
     <lb/>infinitely greater development, and that just as we 
     <lb/>need the means for the development of our indus<lb break="no"/>tries, we need the means for developing the 
     <lb/>knowledge, courage, the judgement and the co<lb break="no"/>operative abilities of Newfoundlanders. We need 
     <lb/>these things far more.... Newfoundland needs 
     <lb/>wealth, production, industries, but she also needs 
     <lb/>men and women with imagination, the creative 
     <lb/>abilities, the scientific knowledge and training to 
     <lb/>bring these things about....

     <lb/>suspicions caused by delegations, motions and 
     <lb/>amendments, I am glad that Mr. Higgins found 
     <lb/>time and opportunity to introduce this resolution, 
     <lb/>which if instrumental in giving to this country a 
     <lb/>university, will have a greater effect upon the 
     <lb/>future citizens of Newfoundland than any other 
     <lb/>resolution we have had. A country cannot rise 
     <lb/>above its people, and any progressive policy 
     <lb/>designed to bring about a better Newfoundland 
     <lb/>must of necessity hinge on the ability of our 
     <lb/>youth, the future citizens of this country, to be 
     <lb/>able to carry out that policy. I contend, gentle<lb break="no"/>men, that the ignorance of the masses has been 
     <lb/>the curse of this country down through her long 
     <lb/>history, and unless and until we get a more en<lb break="no"/>lightened people, a people who will be able to 
     <lb/>think and act for themselves, we will be kicked 
     <lb/>about by those who would stoop so low as to 
     <lb/>capitalise on our ignorance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is surprising to me that a charter for a state 
     <lb/>
     university was not sought and obtained years ago.

            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Countries smaller and less historic than ours are 
     <lb/>
     blessed with such institutions, even Iceland with 
     <lb/>
     its small population has its university. Some 
     <lb/>
     people may say, "Oh, that is no benefit to the poor 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. especially in the out<lb break="no"/>ports". That is not true, for as Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     pointed out yesterday the benefits permeate 
     <lb/>
     downwards. The first and immediate benefit 
     <lb/>
     derived by the poorer classes will be to have fully 
     <lb/>
     qualified teachers possessing degrees in the arts

     and sciences going out to teach their children, and 
     <lb/>
     these same children in turn will be drawn through 
     <lb/>
     the channels of their schools and colleges to 
     <lb/>
     climax their studies in their own Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     university. And let it be a Newfoundland university 
     <lb/>
     in the strictest sense of the word, a university 
     <lb/>
     which will cater to the needs of young New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders and fit them to go out and grapple 
     <lb/>
     with the many problems peculiar to their native 
     <lb/>
     land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As the proposed University comes to full stat<lb break="no"/>ure, I would like to see a scheme inaugurated 
     <lb/>whereby one or more scholarships would be 
     <lb/>made available to every district; this, in addition 
     <lb/>to helping to defray the expense of outport stu<lb break="no"/>dents in St. John's, would be a great incentive to 
     <lb/>students to pursue their studies with greater en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm....

            <p><persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> In a little while this land we live in 
     <lb/>will see the end of 450 years of history. More 
     <lb/>often than not those years have been lean. Our 
     <lb/>land has never flowed with milk and honey. Al<lb break="no"/>ways, in this island, it has taken most of a man's 
     <lb/>time to keep body and soul together — to keep 
     <lb/>the wolf at the door in his place. The meagre grey 
     <lb/>existence that has been our historic portion has 
     <lb/>been come by only in consequence of hard work 
     <lb/>and high courage, epic in their proportions. The 
     <lb/>unrelenting struggle we have known has never 
     <lb/>left us with much margin of time for accomplish<lb break="no"/>ment of other than the making of both ends meet. 
     <lb/>We have been far too busy out on the squid-jig<lb break="no"/>ging ground to have made many songs. We have 
     <lb/>spent so much time in little yellow dories as left 
     <lb/>us but a meagre margin for literature and the 
     <lb/>drama. Our hands have been too busy with the 
     <lb/>"knots rotted with the salt water" to have given 
     <lb/>them to painting and sculpture. We have had to 
     <lb/>put so much effort into making cod as to have had 
     <lb/>none to spare to put into making concertos. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     And yet there have been men in the land who

     were equal to the land Those great have walked 
     <lb/>
     among us who wrought some monumental works 
     <lb/>
     in their time. There were Newfoundlanders who 
     <lb/>
     were indeed giants in their day and generation. 
     <lb/>
     And they have bequeathed to us many things of 
     <lb/>
     which we may well be proud — a tradition of 
     <lb/>
     great endeavour to make the most come of the 
     <lb/>
     land's meagreness; a native culture which the 
     <lb/>
     philistine may dismiss as a 'fish-and-brewis' cul<lb break="no"/>ture, but which is of considerable consequence 
     <lb/>
     and meaning to us; and a structure, and a way of 
     <lb/>
     life, Christian to the core. Because our fathers 
     <lb/>
     were what they were, we are still secure in this 
     <lb/>
     island in the realms of the mind and spirit. We are 
     <lb/>
     still convinced that two and two make four. We 
     <lb/>
     are still certain that there is but one God. In this 
     <lb/>
     island we still live in the presence of eternal laws 
     <lb/>
     and great truths that are true unto eternity. We 
     <lb/>
     have certain institutions that we revere; certain 
     <lb/>
     principles that we would live by. We have tested 
     <lb/>
     them and have found them good — as have all 
     <lb/>
     men who have tested them. We are jealous of 
     <lb/>
     their presence amongst us and we will not have 
     <lb/>
     them altered or removed. And, may I say in 
     <lb/>
     passing, that it has been a cause of much concern 
     <lb/>
     to me to learn that because I have laid much 
     <lb/>
     emphasis upon the economic in this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     that I have been misunderstood or misconstrued 
     <lb/>
     to mean that the economic is all that matters. It is 
     <lb/>
     rather amazing how intently some people listen 
     <lb/>
     on the bias. I am quite aware that there are values 
     <lb/>
     that are prior to economic values. I do believe, as 
     <lb/>
     do all men of reason, that not by bread alone doth 
     <lb/>
     man live. But I do believe also that the bread is 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless important. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is ours, who are of this day and generation, 
     <lb/>
     to be caught up in all the turmoil coincident to 
     <lb/>
     one of those historic crises that sees the great 
     <lb/>
     body of mankind lift itself a cubit closer to the 
     <lb/>
     stars, or turn aside from the larger sanity to which 
     <lb/>
     the moment beckons. This is a time that tries 
     <lb/>
     men's souls, and tests their manhood with many 
     <lb/>
     strange new challenges that we in this island must 
     <lb/>
     meet, as must all the peoples of the earth. It is a 
     <lb/>
     moment of high destiny without equal since the 
     <lb/>
     world began. Of all the challenges that must be 
     <lb/>
     met, the greatest is this. This is the challenge that 
     <lb/>
     contains all the others. It is the challenge to 
     <lb/>
     achieve a synthesis of civil liberty and economic 
     <lb/>
     security that will be acceptable to the civilised, 
     <lb/>
     western, Christian conscience. If such a synthesis 


            <cb/>
          

     cannot be achieved, the civilisation we know is 
     <lb/>
     doomed. If it can be achieved, then shall we come 
     <lb/>
     into the inheritance of that stable social order of 
     <lb/>
     which the men of our race have always dreamed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Here in this island we have our own small part 
     <lb/>
    to play in the meeting of that challenge, and on 
     <lb/>that account more than any other, am I anxious 
     <lb/>for the advent of a national university. Because I 
     <lb/>hope that from such an institution there will come 
     <lb/>forth a new economic leadership that will achieve 
     <lb/>for our people a greater measure of security than 
     <lb/>has been their historic measure. Because I hope 
     <lb/>that from such an institution there will come forth 
     <lb/>too a new political leadership that will restore our 
     <lb/>faith in our own ability to conduct ourselves in 
     <lb/>politics and in government with honour and with 
     <lb/>dignity. Finally, because I believe that from a 
     <lb/>national university there will come forth a greater 
     <lb/>company of scholarship than we could otherwise 
     <lb/>come by — a company who will deal competent<lb break="no"/>ly with this greatest challenge of our times, and 
     <lb/>yet contribute the full measure of its scholarship 
     <lb/>to the preservation of that Christian culture and 
     <lb/>way of life that are ours. For there are things in 
     <lb/>this island, Mr. Chairman, that do deserve to 
     <lb/>endure — things that are part and parcel of the 
     <lb/>good, the true, and the beautiful. And their value 
     <lb/>is beyond all time.

     <lb/>that in the debate on the report of the Education

     <lb/>connection with the further extension of the 
     <lb/>Memorial University College, and I think 
     <lb/>Mr. Ashboume gave his support to my remarks. 
     <lb/>There is no need to repeat what I said. The whole 
     <lb/>country is in full accord with the project. I think 
     <lb/>one of the darkest spots in the history of New<lb break="no"/>foundland has been our dire lack of education, 
     <lb/>and the fact that so many ofour youth who could

     <lb/>
     honour of a gallant young airman who gave his 
     <lb/>

     want to make a remark about finance generally. 
     <lb/>
     I would like to remind the delegates that the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Report is the most important report of the 
     <lb/>
     whole Convention, which report lies on the table 
     <lb/>
     without a word of comment being made on it — 
     <lb/>
     not alone any question of debate. The question of 
     <lb/>
     $20,000 extra would be nothing, but the educa<lb break="no"/>tion grant, generally, is a very big one. What will 
     <lb/>
     the people think of us if we made an indefinite 
     <lb/>
     adjournment, as I believe is in the minds of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates, without giving perhaps two or three 
     <lb/>
    days' consideration to this question of finance?....  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We are thinking of adjourning, more or less in<lb break="no"/>definitely, without a word of discussion on our 
     <lb/>
     financial position and particularly without any 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the chief reason for our appoint<lb break="no"/>ment, which was to determine whether the 
     <lb/>
     country is or is not self-supporting, and more 
     <lb/>
     especially, if it will be self-supporting in the 
     <lb/>
     future.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have allowed you to go on now 
     <lb/>
     for five minutes on a subject which is not ger<lb break="no"/>mane to the subject before the Chair.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> On June 24 we shall celebrate 
     <lb/>
     the 450th anniversary of Cabot's discovery of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and it is natural that we ask our<lb break="no"/>selves what progress we have made through the 
     <lb/>
     centuries. A country may be judged by the nature 
     <lb/>
     of its educational institutions, for from these will 
     <lb/>
     come forth the men and women of tomorrow, and 
     <lb/>
     if we wish to do anything permanent for our 
     <lb/>
     country's welfare we must be concerned about 
     <lb/>
     our schools. Our Department of Education has 
     <lb/>
     done and is continuing to do a good job. Our 
     <lb/>
     teachers are giving invaluable service for small 
     <lb/>
     pay. Our system of education is good, but it does 
     <lb/>
     not go far enough as our young men and women 
     <lb/>
     have to leave the country to pursue higher studies 
     <lb/>
     in arts and sciences. The time has come for the 
     <lb/>
     Memorial College to be raised to university 
     <lb/>
     status.... At present comparatively few can afford 
     <lb/>
     to continue their studies, particularly students 
     <lb/>
     from the outports who, after paying their way at 
     <lb/>
     St. John's for two or three years, find it financial<lb break="no"/>ly impossible to go on to Canada or the USA. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Our teachers in particular should be given 
     <lb/>
     every possible advantage, because on them will 
     <lb/>
     depend to a large degree the moulding of our 
     <lb/>
     future citizens. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Apart from this, a Newfoundland university 
     <lb/>
    would be able to pass on our traditions, and look 
     <lb/>at current problems with a view to the country's 
     <lb/>good. Our men and women attending foreign 
     <lb/>universities cannot get a Newfoundland outlook, 
     <lb/>and in many instances are attracted away from the 
     <lb/>country, whereas if they studied at a New<lb break="no"/>foundland university, they would become more 
     <lb/>keenly aware of the country's problems and pos<lb break="no"/>sibilities, and they would remain to devote their 
     <lb/>energies to building a better Newfoundland. A 
     <lb/>university could also be of great value to count<lb break="no"/>less people, other than those seeking degrees, 
     <lb/>through extension courses.... The granting of a 
     <lb/>charter to the Memorial College would be the 
     <lb/>most acceptable way of recognizing the 450th 
     <lb/>anniversary of our country's discovery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Newfoundland should have a 
     <lb/>university of its own.... We realise that there are 
     <lb/>those who can afford to travel to other cities and 
     <lb/>study at the universities of their choice; but there 
     <lb/>are some who have done this at no little incon<lb break="no"/>venience to themselves, and even at considerable 
     <lb/>expense. If there is a university in our midst, and 
     <lb/>should there be those who prefer to study else<lb break="no"/>where, there would be nothing to restrict them. 
     <lb/>With a university here I believe there would be 
     <lb/>many who could be afforded an opportunity for 
     <lb/>studying for a degree....

            <p>
     The decision of the government to continue 
     <lb/>
     the vocational school as a technical school is a 
     <lb/>
     progressive move. The need of such a technical 
     <lb/>
     institution has been apparent for some time, and 
     <lb/>
     the government is to be congratulated in this 
     <lb/>
     regard.

     The matter of raising of the Memorial College

     and comment. Now, with regard to the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report,<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> there is nothing to stop the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee from preparing it. I am only one 
     <lb/>
     member of the committee — there are eight or 
     <lb/>
     nine others. I cannot see why the load should be 
     <lb/>
     thrown on me to prepare the Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     when there are eight or nine members just as 
     <lb/>
     competent as I am. With regard to the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Report, briefly, it is divided into four portions. 
     <lb/>
     The first relates to the government from 1909- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     1920. If my memory serves me right, it shows that 
     <lb/>
     in that period, under responsible government, we 
     <lb/>
     had a surplus of some $7 million. The next sec<lb break="no"/>tion deals with the government from 1919-20 up 
     <lb/>
     to the time Commission took over in 1933-34, 
     <lb/>
     and it shows we had an average deficit, if my 
     <lb/>
     memory serves me correctly, of $2 million a year. 
     <lb/>
     Then it goes from 1933-34 to 1939-40, and it 
     <lb/>
     shows the deficits had increased, even though a 
     <lb/>
     reduction in interest annually had been made of 
     <lb/>
     $2 million. Finally it winds up with the period 
     <lb/>
     1940 to March 31, 1947, and it shows we had 
     <lb/>
     surplus in cash of something over $30 million. In 
     <lb/>
     other words, the Finance Report was a cash book, 
     <lb/>
     and showed we had available at the moment 
     <lb/>
     surpluses of around $30 million. The report 
     <lb/>
     covers the railway from the time it was taken over 
     <lb/>
     by the government in 1923 to the present time, 
     <lb/>
     and shows it cost $30 million in deficits and 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditure. It shows the taking over of 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland Hotel — we paid $450,000, 
     <lb/>
     and up to the present time it has cost considerable 
     <lb/>
     additional money. It is not an economic report. 
     <lb/>
     The position of an economic report, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it, would be the presentation of a budget. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I am going to take the position now that this 
     <lb/>
     House, under the terms of reference, has not any 
     <lb/>
     power to prepare a budget, and that is what an 
     <lb/>
     economic report is. Last year, when this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion opened, Mr. Wild told us it would cost from 
     <lb/>
     $23-23.5 million a year to administer the affairs 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. Now we have another budget 
     <lb/>
     which shows that Mr. Wild was wrong.<ref target="#fn_05">[2]</ref> He did 
     <lb/>
     not know what he was talking about. They have 
     <lb/>
     raised it up $4 million. We find today, according 
     <lb/>
     to the Commissioner for Finance, that it is going 
     <lb/>
     to cost $27 million, in addition to which there is 
     <lb/>
     to be an expenditure on capital account of $ 10- 12 
     <lb/>
     million. For the life of me, I cannot see how 
  

         
            <cb/>
     

     anyone here, under these circumstances, can 
     <lb/>
     prepare an economic report, because we have no 
     <lb/>
     stability; there is no one in the government with 
     <lb/>
     the stability to foreshadow a budget. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     be sure it is going to be carried out, because the 
     <lb/>
     Commission will not take advice from us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The London delegation went away to England 
     <lb/>
     trying to find out if we could get anything on 
     <lb/>
     which to build a budget. We were told to mind 
     <lb/>
     our own business and come home. We were told, 
     <lb/>
     "We will give you an order for fish, if we feel like 
     <lb/>
     it; we will give you an order for iron ore if we feel 
     <lb/>
     like it." Personally, I feel I would not be able to 
     <lb/>
     prepare an economic report on my own, and 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances 1 have to plead I am 
     <lb/>
     unable to do it, and l challenge the fact that 
     <lb/>
     anyone else is able to do it. We know we are 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting. Lord Addison told us we were 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting Mr. Wild told us we were self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting; Mr. Attlee in the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     in December 1945 said so; Lord Cranborne said 
     <lb/>
     so. Better authorities than I am have told us we 
     <lb/>
     are self-supporting. Whether we will be self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting in years to come, no one knows — not 
     <lb/>
     even me, not even Lord Addison or anyone else; 
     <lb/>
     not even Mr. Smallwood. We have been assured 
     <lb/>
     that if we had a government — any other form of 
     <lb/>
     government — we would have power to find out 
     <lb/>
     whether we are able to sell our fish; whether we 
     <lb/>
     are able to sell o're. We know we can sell 
     <lb/>
     newsprint — it is a private business — and there 
     <lb/>
     is a big demand for it. The three major industries 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland are, today, fish, iron ore, 
     <lb/>
     Buchans and pulp and paper. We know where we 
     <lb/>
     stand in regard to pulp and paper; we know there 
     <lb/>
     is a big expansion going on. A motion was 
     <lb/>
     brought in to send a delegation to Washington to 
     <lb/>
     try and find out about sales of fish and iron ore, 
     <lb/>
     and we were told it was not within our terms of 
     <lb/>
     reference. Why does not the government of the 
     <lb/>
     country do something about it? The government 
     <lb/>
     cannot do it because we were told in London that 
     <lb/>
     the British government is not in a position to 
     <lb/>
     approach the United States and ask them whether 
     <lb/>
     they could give us any concessions, and they will 
     <lb/>
     not allow the people of Newfoundland to do it. 
     <lb/>
     That is the position also with regard to iron ore. 
     <lb/>
     "We will take it if we can." They told us in 1930 
     <lb/>
     that our iron ore was not suitable for their fur<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_04">[1] Volume II:435. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>

     naces. Yet their furnaces have not changed, and 
     <lb/>
     they have used it. Either the grade of iron ore has 
     <lb/>
     changed, or the furnaces changed, or it was a lie

     they were telling us from the beginning.

            <p>
     So far as I am concerned, the Finance Report 
     <lb/>
     is there and you can debate it all you like. It 
     <lb/>
     cannot change the balance sheet of $30 million. 
     <lb/>
     You cannot make it more or less. If you leave the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government here much longer 
     <lb/>
     you will not have much of the $30 million left. 
     <lb/>
     They will clean it out from stem to stem; that is 
     <lb/>
     their policy now, and will be in the future.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Major Cashin was offering a 
     <lb/>
     sort of explanation. There is nothing before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair upon which I can permit a debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I move the adjournment until tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     and I would like to see this budget speech debated 
     <lb/>
     here tomorrow. I understand Major Cashin is 
     <lb/>
     going away; but he will be here tomorrow and we 
     <lb/>
     will have the advantage of his presence. I believe 
     <lb/>
     we might debate it even for one day — even one 
     <lb/>
     day will get some information to the country. 
     <lb/>
     Would I have to give notice? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You could give notice of mo<lb break="no"/>tion to debate the Finance Report in the light of 
     <lb/>
     the budget speech. You could give notice of that 
     <lb/>
     kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Perhaps I could do that, with the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the House.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is no need for the consent 
     <lb/>
     of the House. You will have to have my consent 
     <lb/>
     to make the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I give notice to ask your consent.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I do not want to upset Mr. Job's 
     <lb/>
     programme, but we came to an informal under<lb break="no"/>standing on Friday afternoon, and on that under<lb break="no"/>standing a lot of the members have made plans to 
    

            <cb/>
         

     go home. Some have already gone. If we are 
     <lb/>
     going to begin a debate of this nature, not only 
     <lb/>
     may Major Cashin miss his plane, but a lot of the 
     <lb/>
     boys will miss their boats. As far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I do not see the point of going into this, 
     <lb/>
     and I move the formal adjournment of the House 
     <lb/>
     to the call of the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BANF1">Mr. Banfield</persName> I second that motion. A lot of us 
     <lb/>
     have made arrangements to return home. If we 
     <lb/>
     have to come back tomorrow there will be a lot 
     <lb/>
     of members who will miss their boats.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It seems to be the wish of the House to

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Does it not occur to you that, 
     <lb/>
     after all, the report which we have received is, as 
     <lb/>
     the chairman stated. in the nature of a cash book? 
     <lb/>
     There is very little to debate, except, in the light 
     <lb/>
     of the budget speech of the new Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     for Finance. Would that not come in more ad<lb break="no"/>vantageously in the general debate that will occur 
     <lb/>
     after the House resumes?

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It is a long time away.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, and if we have it now it

     may be the more easily forgotten.

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When the House re-assembles, the

     can do it, that is.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As you claim you are unable to

     do it, perhaps we will ask Mr. Job to do it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, perhaps Mr. Job can do that. 
     <lb/>
     The Finance Report is nothing more than a cash 
     <lb/>
     book, which shows what has happened over the 
     <lb/>
     past 40 years. There is no auditor can come in 
     <lb/>
     here and say we have not got $30 million. All the 
     <lb/>
     debating in the world won't change the figures.
