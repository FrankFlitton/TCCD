<!--<p>
     concessions if that is possible. In conclusion, I 
     <lb/>
     think our delegation to Ottawa did a fairly good 
     <lb/>
     job under the circumstances, and that their report 
     <lb/>
     as contained in the Black Books shows they did 
     <lb/>
     the best they could and most decidedly as good 
     <lb/>
     as any delegation we might have sent. I thank 
     <lb/>
     you, Mr. Chairman, for your forbearance and 
     <lb/>
     wish to say that any further remarks I may make 
     <lb/>
     on this matter now before the Chair may be left 
     <lb/>
     until the question of recommendations comes up. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> May I ask you, if in case the motion 
     <lb/>is adopted, will the delegates be allowed to com<lb break="no"/>ment on confederation under the heading of 
     <lb/>forms of government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, Mr. Penney, I've given 
     <lb/>
     considerable thought to the question. Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     has a motion on the order paper, covering respon<lb break="no"/>sible government or Commission government. 
     <lb/>
     As far as Mr. Higgins' motion is concerned, it 
     <lb/>
     follows that discussion will have to be confined 
     <lb/>
     to the two forms of government. In addition to 
     <lb/>
     this, Mr. Smallwood has given notice of motion 
     <lb/>
     covering three forms of government including 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada... In other words, the 
     <lb/>
     position is that under Mr. Higgins' motion, re<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>sponsible government and Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government would be disposed off. Once Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins' motion is disposed off by the House, 
     <lb/>
     you will not be able to re-introduce discussion on 
     <lb/>
     either of the two forms of government covered by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins' motion because it's res judicata. 
     <lb/>
     It's been disposed of by the House and that's the 
     <lb/>
     end of it. It will therefore mean that the con<lb break="no"/>federation matter will have to be dealt with by the 
     <lb/>
     Convention on Mr. Smallwood's motion. There<lb break="no"/>fore to answer your question in a roundabout 
     <lb/>
     way, yes, you will have an opportunity of ex<lb break="no"/>pressing your opinion on the confederation ques<lb break="no"/>tion after and when Mr. Higgins' motion has been 
     <lb/>
     disposed of by the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I in<lb break="no"/>tended to say something on about confederation 
     <lb/>
     and forms of government, and I wouldn't like to 
     <lb/>
     be deprived of that privilege...

     <lb/>

     table of the House for future reference... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     formally by Mr. Hollett. On Wednesday I 
     <lb/>
     deferred it for 48 hours. It can hardly be alleged 
     <lb/>
     that the thing was railroaded through and that 
     <lb/>
     every member was not given sufficient oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to speak to the business then before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. As I intimated on Wednesday and again 
     <lb/>
     yesterday afternoon, I think I have exercised my 
     <lb/>
     discretion to the utmost limits. I feel now that the 
     <lb/>
     time has come when the fate of this motion must 
     <lb/>
     become the responsibility of the House. Before I 
     <lb/>
     put the motion, I want to make it clear that it is 
     <lb/>
     not debatable, not amendable. The House there<lb break="no"/>fore must accept or reject the motion as is. The 
     <lb/>
     motion before the Chair is "that the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     proposals received on November 6 from the Rt. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. The Prime Minister of Canada shall not be 
     <lb/>
     further adjourned."

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before going on to the next order 
     <lb/>
     on the order paper, I would like to make a sug<lb break="no"/>gestion to you and to the House. It appears fairly 
     <lb/>
     definite now that we are going to try and conclude 
     <lb/>
     our business before the end of this month. That 
     <lb/>
     would give us very little more than ten clear days 
     <lb/>
     between now and the end of our sessions. We 
     <lb/>
     have given no thought or no definite expressed 
     <lb/>
     thought to the idea of how we are going to con<lb break="no"/>clude the business of the house — how we are 
     <lb/>
     going to finally wind up the Convention, what 
     <lb/>
     procedure we should take, whether it should be 
     <lb/>
     by formal report drafted by a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     House or some other such procedure, or just in 
     <lb/>
     what form the final wind-up should be made. For 
     <lb/>
     that reason I feel that before we go on to another 
     <lb/>
     matter, because of the shortness of time, it would 
     <lb/>
     be advisable in the interests of members and the 
     <lb/>
     business of the House, if instead of discussing the 
     <lb/>
     next motion we decided to go into a private 
     <lb/>
     meeting immediately after we adjourn, if mem<lb break="no"/>bers are agreeable to adjourn, to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     whole matter. With that idea in mind and with the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the whole House, I now move that we 
     <lb/>
     adjourn until Monday or Tuesday and immedi<lb break="no"/>ately following the finalisation of the orders of 
  

            <cb/>
           

     the day, we should have that private session. I 
     <lb/>
     move that, and feel that not only will we be 
     <lb/>
     expediting our business but will certainly be 
     <lb/>
     doing something of great value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think the point is very well 
     <lb/>
     taken. As members will recall, section 3 lays 
     <lb/>
     upon this Convention the duty of making recom<lb break="no"/>mendations. Further than that, standing order 39 
     <lb/>
     requires members to make a report to the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs on the 
     <lb/>
     forms of government which, in the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, would be inserted in the referendum 
     <lb/>
     presumably to take place next spring. The matter 
     <lb/>
     has given me considerable concern; and while I 
     <lb/>
     have some ideas about it, I would like to put them 
     <lb/>
     before members and have an exchange of ideas. 
     <lb/>
     We have to decide future procedure particularly 
     <lb/>
     in view of the fact that time is running out. The 
     <lb/>
     sooner we get at it, the sooner we will know 
     <lb/>
     where everybody is. The House must decide what 
     <lb/>
     is going to happen. I associate myself un<lb break="no"/>qualifiedly with the view expressed by Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins. I do not know how other members feel about 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I would like to say that for four 
     <lb/>
     days and four nights most of the members have 
     <lb/>
     spoken and I doubt if very many are ready to 
     <lb/>
     continue the debate on this motion. The next two 
     <lb/>
     days would give them a good opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     prepare to go on. I have much pleasure in second<lb break="no"/>ing the motion to adjourn, and say 15 minutes 
     <lb/>
     later to have a private session.
