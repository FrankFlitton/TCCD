<!-- GL, 2017-07-24, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

 <!--<p>
     given this House, no adequate reason, why my 
     <lb/>
     motion should be split in two and part of it 
     <lb/>
     deducted. There is every reason why it should 
     <lb/>
     stand as it is. In the ordinary course of events it 
     <lb/>
     is now suggested that it should be split. For what 
     <lb/>
     purpose? What valuable object can be obtained 
     <lb/>
     by splitting it? If I. can be shown that I will agree, 
     <lb/>
     but not if there has been no effort to show that 
     <lb/>
     there is adequate reason for it, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to allow it to be pushed aside in that 
     <lb/>
     manner. If that sort of thing is going to be done, 
     <lb/>
     and in view of happenings in this House and out 
     <lb/>
     of it, and around it, during the past few days, we 
     <lb/>
     are justified in suspecting pretty near anything. If 
     <lb/>
     there is going to be anything of that sort done here 
     <lb/>
     the cards are coming out on the table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I rise to a point of order. If my 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. Bradley is making any happenings in 
     <lb/>
     this House or out of it in the past few days into 
     <lb/>
     the form of a motion he has put up, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know about it. I think it is entirely out of order. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I am not making any personal 
     <lb/>reflections upon you or upon anyone else, but I 
     <lb/>am saying there is no reason in the world why this 
     <lb/>motion cannot come before this House, or why 
     <lb/>that motion should be split. None. And yet we are 
     <lb/>asked to split it. What for? Incidentally there is 
     <lb/>another motion coming in here which, if it is split, 
     <lb/>would give precedence over a portion of my 
     <lb/>motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except that in fairness to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins he has undertaken to give your notice 
     <lb/>
     precedence. I would take and give your notice of 
     <lb/>
     motion priority to his. He has definitely stated 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     that he would not want to go ahead of you in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Mr. Chairman, a majority of this 
     <lb/>
     House can supersede this House or the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee, and I don't know what a majority of 
     <lb/>
     this House is going to do, but I am going to find 
     <lb/>
     out now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Hear, hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The original motion is: "To 
     <lb/>
     move that the communication from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment be received, and that the Convention 
     <lb/>
     resolve itself into a committee of the whole on 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow to consider the said communication." 
     <lb/>
     To this an amendment has been moved and 
     <lb/>
     seconded, that all the words following the word 
     <lb/>
     "received" should be deleted. 50 that the amend<lb break="no"/>ment means to move that the communication 
     <lb/>
     from the Government of Canada be received. Are 
     <lb/>
     you ready for the amendment?.... Will all the 
     <lb/>
     members in favour of the amendment please rise 
     <lb/>
     — 21. Will all those against the amendment 
     <lb/>
     please rise — 15. The amendment is carried on a 
     <lb/>
     vote of 21 — 15.... Now I have to put the motion 
     <lb/>
     in its amended form, so that if there is any other 
     <lb/>
     member who desires to address himself on it he 
     <lb/>
     can do it. The motion in its amended from now 
     <lb/>
     is: "To move that the communication from the 
     <lb/>
     Government be received." That is the motion as 
     <lb/>
     amended. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
     <lb/>
     the motion as amended? Are you ready for the 
     <lb/>
     question? Carried. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Now Mr. Chairman, we shall see 
     <lb/>
     what happens.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Chairman, when I first came 
     <lb/>
     to this House I had a very different opinion of 
     <lb/>
     what was to be done and how we were to do it. 
     <lb/>
     As I understood it, the Convention was to be 
     <lb/>
     something like a royal commission. There was 
     <lb/>
     certain work to be done of a fact-finding nature 
     <lb/>
     and I assumed that it was our duty to get these 
     <lb/>
     facts, examine and check, and then use them as a 
     <lb/>
     basis for hard and fast opinions that would be 
     <lb/>
     useful in deciding the state of the country and its 
     <lb/>
     prospects. I thought we would get down to that 
     <lb/>
     job like a group of businessmen and that our 
     <lb/>
     debates would be chiefly like the discussions that 
     <lb/>
     go on around a council table. I thought that once 
     <lb/>
     we had agreed on the question of fact, we would 
     <lb/>
     enter into a dignified discussion of the constitutional 
     <lb/>
       question. I have been surprised at the dif<lb break="no"/>ference between my ideas of what would happen 
     <lb/>
     and what has actually occurred, and I regret that 
     <lb/>
     issues were injected into this Convention, before 
     <lb/>
     we had been here long enough to find our feet, 
     <lb/>
     that have given a different and, in my opinion, an 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate turn to our proceedings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When we come down to the practical problem 
     <lb/>
     that was put before the Finance Committee, it 
     <lb/>
     must be admitted that it amounted to a matter of 
     <lb/>
     getting what facts we could and doing our best to 
     <lb/>
     try and draw the correct conclusions from them. 
     <lb/>
     I have listened with impatience to a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     silly talk about the report being full of estimates, 
     <lb/>
     guesses and so on. But, Mr. Chairman, neither 
     <lb/>
     you nor I nor any member of this House can say 
     <lb/>
     with certainty where he will be an hour from 
     <lb/>
     now. The Finance Committee could not do any 
     <lb/>
     more than take what information it could get 
     <lb/>
     together, examine it in the light of such 
     <lb/>
     knowledge as we have of general conditions, and 
     <lb/>
     say, "In our opinion the position of this country 
     <lb/>
     for the next three years should be so and so".... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> has rightly said that the terms of 
     <lb/>
     reference do not ask us to determine if this 
     <lb/>
     country is self-supporting. At least, they do not 
     <lb/>
     ask this question directly. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     reference to the conditions laid down in the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Act for a change of the island's con<lb break="no"/>
        


  

            <cb/>
          

     stitution sets out that when we are again self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting and on request of the people, self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be restored. The primary condition for 
     <lb/>
     the restoration of self-govemment, which is the 
     <lb/>
     only alternative to the Commission that was con<lb break="no"/>sidered by the British government, is that the 
     <lb/>
     island should be self-supporting. Exactly what is 
     <lb/>
     meant by that term of self-support may be 
     <lb/>
     debatable. The Finance Committee recognised 
     <lb/>
     that, and tried to limit its predictions to inferences 
     <lb/>
     that seemed completely reasonable, and to a 
     <lb/>
     period that might lend itself to sensible predict<lb break="no"/>ability. That was the only systcm we could work 
     <lb/>
     by and it was my understanding that our report, 
     <lb/>
     when it had been completed to our satisfaction, 
     <lb/>
     would be considered in the light of the problems 
     <lb/>
     it involved and in a decent and impartial way. The 
     <lb/>
     business of the Convention was that of taking the 
     <lb/>
     report, examining it, correcting it if it was found 
     <lb/>
     we had made some mistakes, and then of agreeing 
     <lb/>
       in the end either on our conclusions or an 
     <lb/>
     amendment to them. Nothing could have 
     <lb/>
     astonished me more than to hear the attack on the 
     <lb/>
     report by the member for Bonavista Centre. I 
     <lb/>
     resented that attack, Mr. Chairman. It was un<lb break="no"/>called for, and it was uttered in language so 
     <lb/>
     insulting to the Committee and so bitter that I 
     <lb/>
     cannot help wondering just what was the motive 
     <lb/>
     behind it. I am not a politician and I came to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to try and give some service to the 
     <lb/>
     country. I have no axe to grind and in helping to 
     <lb/>
     frame the report, I did my best within my personal 
     <lb/>
     limitations. The report presents a completely 
     <lb/>
     honest view of the country's position and its 
     <lb/>
     prospects so far as any person with some 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of business and finance can foresee 
     <lb/>
     them. Nothing was farther from my mind that I 
     <lb/>
     should have to come and hear that report tom to 
     <lb/>
     shreds in the destructive and discourteous speech 
     <lb/>
     made by Mr. Smallwood.... We were simply car<lb break="no"/>rying out a job that had been given to us by the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, and the surest way to kill all thought 
     <lb/>
     of personal service of a public nature, is to have 
     <lb/>
     honest efforts subjected to the violent type of 
     <lb/>
     attack that the member for Bonavista Centre 
    

<note xml:id="fn_01">[1] Volume 11:425. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>

     directed at this report. Don't misunderstand me, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I can take it and what was said 
     <lb/>
     does not bother me as an individual, but the 
     <lb/>
     principle of the thing is wrong. No one knows it 
     <lb/>
     all, even if he thinks he does. Mr. Hollett quoted 
     <lb/>
     some predictions made by Mr. Smallwood in 
     <lb/>
     1931 which showed how wrong he could be when 
     <lb/>
     he ventured into the field of prophecy. I think it 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile to refer to this matter because it 
     <lb/>
     shows how things and opinions change. In 1931 
     <lb/>
     the member for Bonavista Centre figured that 
     <lb/>
     conditions in Newfoundland were far better than 
     <lb/>
     they were in the cities of Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Today Mr. Smallwood sees nothing but 
     <lb/>
     rocks ahead. Why? That is what I have been 
     <lb/>
     asking myself, and what a lot of other people like 
     <lb/>
     me have been asking since they heard the destruc<lb break="no"/>tive opening attack on the report. Was it neces<lb break="no"/>sary to take up this report, pick a few sentences 
     <lb/>
     from it and try to make them sound as if the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee had nothing else in mind 
     <lb/>
     except to deceive the people of the country? I 
     <lb/>
     want to know also what gain there is to be found 
     <lb/>
     in proclaiming to the world that Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     future is grim and depressing when, as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     aware, there is no basis for it. That speech 
     <lb/>
     sounded like the prediction that all who entered 
     <lb/>
     here should abandon hope. I am content, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to leave the decision on the usefulness of 
     <lb/>
     the report to the people of this island and also to 
     <lb/>
     put it on the conscience of its opponents as to 
     <lb/>
     whether their forebodings are not one of the most 
     <lb/>
     harmful things to be heard in this country for a 
     <lb/>
     very long time. I tell you that nothing can so 
     <lb/>
     easily undermine prosperity than a loss of con<lb break="no"/>fidence, and anything that is done to discourage 
     <lb/>
     our productive workers is a dangerous thing. I 
     <lb/>
     don't believe in concealing the true facts of a bad 
     <lb/>
     situation, but there is nothing in the report that is 
     <lb/>
     deceitful or that hides anything. If there are errors 
     <lb/>
     of fact they are accidental and they are not, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, relevant to our main conclusions. As a 
     <lb/>
     businessman, I don't believe in fooling myself or 
     <lb/>
     trying to fool anyone else on a matter of such 
     <lb/>
     importance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, while this report con<lb break="no"/>tains an estimate of past financial results and 
     <lb/>
     includes some suggestions as to how the 
     <lb/>
     surpluses of future years might be used, the im<lb break="no"/>portant thing is to know just what is the position 
     <lb/>
     of the economy at the present time, and what is 
   

            <cb/>
       

     the outlook for the chief industries and for 
     <lb/>
     employment. In coming to conclusions about the 
     <lb/>
     condition of the economy we have been guided 
     <lb/>
     by the facts that are available — many of them 
     <lb/>
     from the reports of the various committees that 
     <lb/>
     have reported— and by such knowledge as members 
     <lb/>
       of the Finance Committee have themselves, 
     <lb/>
     or have been able to obtain from others who are 
     <lb/>
     reliable witnesses. When it came to the estima<lb break="no"/>tion of the condition and future of the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     we had, of course, to be guided by the opinions 
     <lb/>
     of those people who are fully conversant with all 
     <lb/>
     sides of that great industry. The people who are 
     <lb/>
     investing large sums of money in the future of the 
     <lb/>
     fishing industry are better guides than others who 
     <lb/>
     are looking in from the outside. in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     paper industry the same thing is true. We had all 
     <lb/>
     the leading figures in the Newfoundland forest 
     <lb/>
     industry give evidence to the Forestry Commit<lb break="no"/>tee, and the House is aware of their optimism and 
     <lb/>
     must surely accept their words before those of 
     <lb/>
     others who have no inside knowledge. I want to 
     <lb/>
     emphasise again that to the best of our ability we 
     <lb/>
     got all the facts we could get, and all the opinions 
     <lb/>
     we could find that we thought useful and valuable 
     <lb/>
       We were not a committee of experts. We 
     <lb/>
     were only a few ordinary people trying to use our 
     <lb/>
     common sense as well as we could, and we were 
     <lb/>
     not interested in trying to fool the people or 
     <lb/>
     creating a sense of false optimism. I would ask 
     <lb/>
     the House to examine the picture very briefly 
     <lb/>
     because others, lam sure, will be prepared to go 
     <lb/>
     into greater detail on certain industries with 
     <lb/>
     which they are fully acquainted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fishery is still the main industry in the size 
     <lb/>
     of the employment it gives. Anyone who says that 
     <lb/>
     the fishing industry is not stronger than it was 
     <lb/>
     before the war does not know what he is talking 
     <lb/>
     about. Prices may be benefitting today from a 
     <lb/>
     measure of world inflation. That is true of every 
     <lb/>
     commodity that is produced. The point is that the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries are today on much stronger foundations 
     <lb/>
     than they ever were in the history of this country. 
     <lb/>
     We haven't yet reached the point of perfection, 
     <lb/>
     but we are moving steadily forward and every 
     <lb/>
     year sees new improvements that will give 
     <lb/>
     greater security to the producers who are the 
     <lb/>
     life-blood of this and every country. The demand 
     <lb/>
     for saltfish will always exist because in certain 
     <lb/>
     tropical countries it is the ideal food for a number 
     <lb/>
     of reasons, On top of that we have a very large 


            <pb n="692" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-10_Page_0692.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">692</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          

     investment in the cold storage industry and that 
     <lb/>
     is not only diversifying the codfishery, but in<lb break="no"/>creasing the number of kinds of fish that we can 
     <lb/>
     use. There is also the fish reduction business 
     <lb/>
     which is going to be a big thing. If you look at the 
     <lb/>
     picture you will see ahead of us a certain demand 
     <lb/>
     for a large quantity of salt cod, a growing demand 
     <lb/>
     for canned fish of all kinds, and the commercial 
     <lb/>
     use in increasing quantities of haddock, rosefish, 
     <lb/>
     herring, caplin, mackerel and other species by 
     <lb/>
     either the cold storage, the canning or the fish 
     <lb/>
     meal plants. It does not require any great prophet 
     <lb/>
     to say that the use of so many species of fish in 
     <lb/>
     so many different ways is an assurance that the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries can never again go back to the darkest 
     <lb/>
     moments of the 1930s. I know that at the moment 
     <lb/>
     there is an exchange problem that may be 
     <lb/>
     troublesome. On the other hand, that problem has 
     <lb/>
     to be solved or the whole world will come tum<lb break="no"/>bling about our ears. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland cannot expect to be prosper<lb break="no"/>ous in a world torn by conflict or sunk in depres<lb break="no"/>sion. We know, in the words of the member for 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre, that things looked pretty good 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland while the bread lines were 
     <lb/>
     forming in the cities of Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Just the same, we can't fool ourselves. If 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the world is stricken with poverty, we 
     <lb/>
     can't expect to have prosperity. That does not 
     <lb/>
     mean there is anything wrong with our industries 
     <lb/>
     or their future, and I am as certain as the day that 
     <lb/>
     everything is going to come right. The world 
     <lb/>
     cannot go down. In fact, the world is going to 
     <lb/>
     revive because to have peace we must have 
     <lb/>
     general prosperity. The United States is going to 
     <lb/>
     pour its resources into the poor countries that 
     <lb/>
     have been ravaged by war, and build up their 
     <lb/>
     economies with its help. As the purchasing power 
     <lb/>
     of Europe revives, so will the prospects of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity being secured in Newfoundland in<lb break="no"/>crease. We have been improving the means of 
     <lb/>
     catching and processing fish of all kinds. More 
     <lb/>
     draggers and schooners are reaping the rich har<lb break="no"/>vests of the Banks and the fish are going into 
     <lb/>
     fillets for the American market or being cured for 
     <lb/>
     our saltfish markets. We are improving the cure 
     <lb/>
     our saltfish and new methods of drying are beginning 
     <lb/>
     ning to be employed to help improve the quality. 
     <lb/>
     Purse seiners and other modern equipment are 
     <lb/>
     being used to build up other parts of the fish 
     <lb/>
     industry. We have now a central marketing sys<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
           

     tem so that nobody can bring prices down by 
     <lb/>
     cutting other people's throats by underselling 
     <lb/>
     them in the markets. All these things cannot be 
     <lb/>
     ignored in considering the prospects of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now there have been some references to the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador fishery. In any industry that is control<lb break="no"/>led largely by nature, there will always be black 
     <lb/>
     spots. We hear of a big wheat crop in Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     we don't hear anything about the farmers who 
     <lb/>
     lost millions of bushels because of weather con<lb break="no"/>ditions last summer. Those farmers whose crops 
     <lb/>
     were wiped out were much like our fishermen 
     <lb/>
     who didn't get enough fish. Everyone is naturally 
     <lb/>
     sympathetic to these hardy producers who are 
     <lb/>
     treated badly by nature, and we have to do what 
     <lb/>
     we can to help them. Just the same, the fact that 
     <lb/>
     a percentage of people have had bad luck or are 
     <lb/>
     unemployed for some reason beyond their con<lb break="no"/>trol does not mean that the whole economy is 
     <lb/>
     depressed. We may have to find some means by 
     <lb/>
     which the producers can be given greater security 
     <lb/>
     in the future, so that we can eliminate as far as we 
     <lb/>
     can the gamble of the voyage. In a country like 
     <lb/>
     this a wise government will try always to keep 
     <lb/>
     some special public works in hand to meet special 
     <lb/>
     emergencies where people have had hard luck. I 
     <lb/>
     do not agree with the principle of spending every 
     <lb/>
     cent the country has in a time of general 
     <lb/>
     prosperity and we ought, in my opinion, to be 
     <lb/>
     adding to our surplus at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As to the forest industry, I can only go by what 
     <lb/>
     the people who know that industry best have said 
     <lb/>
     about its prospects and what they are doing to 
     <lb/>
     back up their words. The demand for newsprint 
     <lb/>
     is so great that the exchange problem does not 
     <lb/>
     concern it very much. The United States and 
     <lb/>
     other countries able to pay in dollars can take all 
     <lb/>
     we produce, and we have the word of people who 
     <lb/>
     know what they are talking about that prosperity 
     <lb/>
     seems to be in store for the forest industries for 
     <lb/>
     several years to come. Anyone can stand up here 
     <lb/>
     and point to what happened in the thirties. But the 
     <lb/>
     world would never again survive a depression 
     <lb/>
     like that of the years between the two wars. Our 
     <lb/>
     prospects are good because we are selling all our 
     <lb/>
     produce at good prices, although Britain is not 
     <lb/>
     able to buy so much and other countries in the 
     <lb/>
     sterling group are in difficulties. Their condition 
     <lb/>
     is bound to improve and we shall have better 
     <lb/>
     markets when it does improve. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     While the producer is the backbone of the 
     <lb/>
     country, the volume of employment is much 
     <lb/>
     larger than may be thought by looking at the 
     <lb/>
     number of people in only the productive in<lb break="no"/>dustries. Back in 1935, in the middle of our worst 
     <lb/>
     depression, the total number of people employed 
     <lb/>
     in fishing, farming. logging and mining was less 
     <lb/>
     than the people employed in other things. We 
     <lb/>
     have to keep up the volume of production so that 
     <lb/>
     these others can be employed, but the fact is that 
     <lb/>
     in the service and distributing industries there are 
     <lb/>
     many more thousands employed than there are in 
     <lb/>
     the producing industries. The number of wage 
     <lb/>
     earners has greatly increased, and unemployment 
     <lb/>
     in the wage-earning industries does not neces<lb break="no"/>sarily decline at once because of a weak spot in 
     <lb/>
     one of the producing industries The economic 
     <lb/>
     picture must be seen as a whole so that we can 
     <lb/>
     get an accurate picture of it, and it is a pity we 
     <lb/>
     have not got more statistics to help us piece the 
     <lb/>
     puzzle together. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In my opinion we have many prospects yet to 
     <lb/>
     be tapped. I have heard criticisms of the cost of 
     <lb/>
     the Clarenville fleet, yet these vessels are giving 
     <lb/>
     employment at sea to more than a hundred New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders and are earning large sums in 
     <lb/>
     freights that we used to pay out to foreign bot<lb break="no"/>toms. I don't say we can carry all we produce in 
     <lb/>
     our fleet, but I believe that we can greatly in<lb break="no"/>crease the size of our mercantile marine. We have 
     <lb/>
     the men and if Norway, a country with a population 
     <lb/>
       of a little more than three million, can have 
     <lb/>
     one of the world's largest mercantile marines, 
     <lb/>
     then I can't see any reason why this island should 
     <lb/>
     not have a much larger mercantile marine than 
     <lb/>
     we have. We believe that the employment and 
     <lb/>
     earnings of Newfoundlanders in the trade of 
     <lb/>
     seamanship can be greatly increased. The same 
     <lb/>
     is true of the tourist industry and I am certain that 
     <lb/>
     the right use of capital in the development of that 
     <lb/>
     industry can bring results that will astonish us 
     <lb/>
     all.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some people have said that there was no point 
     <lb/>
     in trying to make up a budget. I can't agree with 
     <lb/>
     that. We are trying to answer the question as to 
     <lb/>
     whether the country is self-supporting. We had to 
     <lb/>
     examine the financial picture, and we had to be 
     <lb/>
     guided by the advice of the Finance Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner who was interviewed by the Convention. 
     <lb/>
     He said the country could balance its ordinary 
     <lb/>
     requirements with a revenue of $23.5 million. We 


            <cb/>
          

     say it will take more than that, and we make the 
     <lb/>
     figure $25 million after allowing for some reduction 
     <lb/>
       in the cost of servicing the debt and in some 
     <lb/>
     other things. We have examined the sources of 
     <lb/>
     revenue and we believe that it is highly im<lb break="no"/>probable that the revenue in the next three years 
     <lb/>
     will fall below an average of $30 million. That is 
     <lb/>
     allowing for a drop of 25% from the present level, 
     <lb/>
     and that leaves a pretty good margin for error. Of 
     <lb/>
     course, if there were to be a big fall in world 
     <lb/>
     prices, there would be a fall in our revenues like 
     <lb/>
     the revenues of every other country. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, if the fall in prices is big, it will mean that 
     <lb/>
     everything will cost less so that we would also 
     <lb/>
     have a fall in our expenses. You cannot foresee 
     <lb/>
     everything but we feel that the figures we have 
     <lb/>
     produced are conservative... My own opinion, 
     <lb/>
     for what it is worth, is that conditions must 
     <lb/>
     remain fairly good, because the consequences of 
     <lb/>
     any grave decline would be terrible beyond 
     <lb/>
     anyone's imagination to the richest nations. 
     <lb/>
     America cannot have prosperity in a poverty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     stricken world. Neither can Canada. Neither can 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. But as far as any ordinary person 
     <lb/>
     can examine our situation and foresee what is 
     <lb/>
     likely to happen, I say that our estimates are 
     <lb/>
     conservative and reasonable, and give as fair a 
     <lb/>
     picture of our prospects as it is possible to give. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are factors which are helpful to us. The 
     <lb/>
     people who live in cities abroad mostly pay rent. 
     <lb/>
     They have to buy coal or oil to heat their homes 
     <lb/>
     and do their cooking. They must earn money to 
     <lb/>
     buy everything they eat and need to live. We do 
     <lb/>
     have a few advantages which are not to be over<lb break="no"/>looked. In the census of 1935 it was shown that 
     <lb/>
     nearly 90% of the houses in Newfoundland are 
     <lb/>
     owned by the people who live in them. There is 
     <lb/>
     no other country in the world ofwhich this is true. 
     <lb/>
     Many of our people — not all but a very great 
     <lb/>
     many — not only own their own homes, but can 
     <lb/>
     have fuel at the expense of their labour, can grow 
     <lb/>
     a part of their own food and get some more of it 
     <lb/>
     from the bounty of nature. Their life is not easy, 
     <lb/>
     but if we can build up the value of our productive 
     <lb/>
     enterprises and maintain a good level of seasonal 
     <lb/>
     employment, we should be able to achieve a 
     <lb/>
     standard of living in this country that will make 
     <lb/>
     for security and happiness. We must bend our 
     <lb/>
     efforts to achieve this end and it is my opinion 
     <lb/>
     that it can be attained... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     estimating the use of a prospective surplus, to do 
     <lb/>
     any more than indicate its opinion of the kind of 
     <lb/>
     thing in which surplus monies could be employed 
     <lb/>
     to produce the greatest benefits for all the people. 
     <lb/>
     We were not required to make that estimate and 
     <lb/>
     it is not actually of great pertinence to the main 
     <lb/>
     object of our deliberations. Our chief point is that 
     <lb/>
     the economy is far stronger than it was, and that 
     <lb/>
     this strength may have come about during a 
     <lb/>
     period of wartime prosperity, but is now estab<lb break="no"/>lished as a permanent feature of our industrial and 
     <lb/>
     financial situation. Our second point is that, on 
     <lb/>
     the basis of what we regard to be the reasonable 
     <lb/>
     volume and value of national production during 
     <lb/>
     the next three years, the budget can be balanced 
     <lb/>
     and a substantial sum be available for capital 
     <lb/>
     expenditure directed towards further strengthen<lb break="no"/>ing of the economy. This is not wishful thinking 
     <lb/>
     but my free and frank opinion on the basis of my 
     <lb/>
     own knowledge of the facts and tendencies. Our 
     <lb/>
     opinions may be subject to challenge by the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of others who read into the facts dif<lb break="no"/>ferent meanings, but that can only be determined 
     <lb/>
     by sensible discussion, and it certainly cannot be 
     <lb/>
     obtained by heated attacks that seem to have a 
     <lb/>
     political motive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For myself I can only say that I signed the 
     <lb/>
    report because I believed it is as accurate a 
     <lb/>forecast of the position as it is possible to obtain. 
     <lb/>I stand by the belief expressed in the soundness 
     <lb/>of this country's economic future, and I am sure 
     <lb/>that if we all work together in harmony for the 
     <lb/>conunon good we shall be able to achieve a much 
     <lb/>higher standard of living for all our people in the 
     <lb/>future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> ....As you all know, I have not used 
     <lb/>up much time in this Convention in making 
     <lb/>speeches. Perhaps I have not used up enough. It 
     <lb/>is not my intention to use up much of that time 
     <lb/>now, but I feel that I must express my opinion 
     <lb/>regarding the Economic Report brought in by the 
     <lb/>Finance Committee. . .. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I most sincerely accept this report as an honest 
     <lb/>
     and sincere presentation of our past and present 
     <lb/>
     economic condition, and the forecast for the 
     <lb/>
     foreseeable future of this country, to be a job well 
     <lb/>
     done and to which I subscribe. No person can say 
     <lb/>
     for certain just exactly what will be the conditions 
     <lb/>
     in this country say ten years hence. But by careful 
     <lb/>
     analysis of present conditions they can make a 
     <lb/>
     fair estimate of what conditions are likely to be 
  

            <cb/>
           

     in the foreseeable future, and I think that Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin and his committee have done just that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to the very important question 
     <lb/>
     of a mercantile marine... Should we or should we 
     <lb/>
     not have a mercantile marine? I think we should. 
     <lb/>
     We are a maritime nation in every sense of the 
     <lb/>
     word. We all agree we must export or die. To 
     <lb/>
     export our produce we must have ships. What are 
     <lb/>
     we doing now? If we want to export our produce, 
     <lb/>
     the first thing we have to do is to approach about 
     <lb/>
     half a dozen different countries for ships to take 
     <lb/>
     our produce to foreign markets. For these we 
     <lb/>
     have to export, to send out of this country 
     <lb/>
     thousands and tens of thousands of precious dol<lb break="no"/>lars to pay for the use of these ships and find 
     <lb/>
     employment for hundreds of foreign seamen. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I think we should have our own ships 
     <lb/>
     to take our own produce to market and to bring 
     <lb/>
     back the things we need. And most important of 
     <lb/>
     all is the fact that we would be finding employment 
     <lb/>
     ment for hundreds of the best seamen in the world 
     <lb/>
     —Newfoundlanders. We shall always need ships 
     <lb/>
     whether we meet up with good times or bad... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....I contend that Gander airport should be 
     <lb/>
     operated at Newfoundland's profit over and 
     <lb/>
     above the employment it provides for some few 
     <lb/>
     hundred Newfoundlanders employed there 
     <lb/>
     today. I say this, if foreign companies — AOA, 
     <lb/>
     TWA, etc. — want to use our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     territories, let them pay for it! Is there any sane 
     <lb/>
     person who would enter into a business deal 
     <lb/>
     knowing he was going to lose out? That is just 
     <lb/>
     what the government of this country has done... 
     <lb/>
     Regardless of whether the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     government is paying part of the deficit or not, it 
     <lb/>
     should not be so. I contend that if this had been 
     <lb/>
     handled properly in the beginning we should be 
     <lb/>
     making a profit, not a deficit. It is in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     a job of the first importance for our future govern<lb break="no"/>ment, whatever form. And we all know what it is 
     <lb/>
     going to be... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to our greatest industry, the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, an industry with which I am closely 
     <lb/>
     connected. I was reared up on fish. I happen to 
     <lb/>
     live on the northeast coast. It has been suggested 
     <lb/>
     that here we have an industry doomed to failure. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot agree. Here we have an industry into 
     <lb/>
     which many cool, hard—headed businessmen are 
     <lb/>
     pouring tens of thousands of dollars for develop<lb break="no"/>ment and for the enlargement of existing 
     <lb/>
     developments. I give you an illustration — only

     a few days ago, a firm from Fogo proper acquired 
     <lb/>
     in Bay Bulls all the extensive naval buildings, 
     <lb/>
     dockyards and piers. I do not know what they 
     <lb/>
     paid for them. And what they have done it for? Is 
     <lb/>
     it for fun, as Mr. Higgins said? They are going in 
     <lb/>
     for the development of fresh fish, frozen fish, 
     <lb/>
     canning and all the rest. There is going to be a 
     <lb/>
     very big development in Bay Bulls in a few years. 
     <lb/>
     Earle and Sons are the business people who are 
     <lb/>
     doing it and they are men of vision. Now are we 
     <lb/>
     to take that as meaning our fish industry is 
     <lb/>
     doomed to failure? I hardly think so. We have 
     <lb/>
     men like Messrs. Crosbie and Job investing 
     <lb/>
     thousands in the fishery — not for now, but for 
     <lb/>
     the future. Is that a criterion that our fishery is 
     <lb/>
     doomed? One thing that was brought up here 
     <lb/>
     about the Labrador fishery — men going to 
     <lb/>
     Labrador and not bringing home any fish. No 
     <lb/>
     person can say how much each individual 
     <lb/>
     schooner is going to bring home. The fishermen 
     <lb/>
     would like to know it. What a person can do is to 
     <lb/>
     look around the world in which he lives and see 
     <lb/>
     what can be done for the fisheries with capable 
     <lb/>
     handling and administration. New processing, 
     <lb/>
     new ways of improving existing processing, 
     <lb/>
     especially in fresh and frozen fish industry, there 
     <lb/>
     I contend lies the future for our fishing industry. 
     <lb/>
     Another thing that can be done is finding bigger 
     <lb/>
     and more profitable markets. That brings me to a 
     <lb/>
     subject which has been discussed by Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job at great length; but to quote our absent friend, 
     <lb/>
     Professor Wheare, "at the risk of being an echo", 
     <lb/>
     I wish to mention this question of markets in the 
     <lb/>
     USA. I firmly believe that there is a market big 
     <lb/>
     enough to take just about every fish we produce, 
     <lb/>
     and that that market could be secured if we could 
     <lb/>
     get at it. I think we can, providing we had the 
     <lb/>
     proper government and we are going to get that 
     <lb/>
     government in the future. The USA was granted 
     <lb/>
     territories in this country for 99 years for practi<lb break="no"/>cally nothing without the consent of the people. 
     <lb/>
     It is my belief that when we get our own govern<lb break="no"/>ment....<lb/>
     
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have over<lb break="no"/>looked that point of order. I have overlooked 
     <lb/>
     several such references from Mr. Watton; refer<lb break="no"/>ences to "when we get our own government" are 
     <lb/>
     completely out of order. If Mr. Watton can do it, 
     <lb/>
     I can do it, and so can any other member. I ask 
     <lb/>
     you to rule it completely out of order, what he has 
     <lb/>
     said in that line, and what he is likely to do. He is 
  

            <cb/>
           

     simply not supposed to do it.

     from any comments. Kindly take your seats. A 
     <lb/>
     word is known by the company it keeps, and if 
     <lb/>
     there is, on this discussion of the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, any reference whatsoever to the political 
     <lb/>
     situation to be superimposed upon the economy 
     <lb/>
     of this country it is definitely out of order. We are

     engaged at the present time in determining what 
     <lb/>
     the economic potentialities of the country are... 
     <lb/>
     Let us confine ourselves to the Economic Report

     and I think no words will go wrong if we avoid 
     <lb/>
     any reference whatsoever to the institutions. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Miller Point of order again, sir. I would like 
     <lb/>
     to be very clear whether or not we are to be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to refer in our economic deliberations 
     <lb/>
     to the program of reconstruction that has been 
     <lb/>
     carried out by the Commission of Government. 
     <lb/>
     Is that out of order? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, that's definitely an 
     <lb/>
     economic matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Well, it is a question of government. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is not a question of govern<lb break="no"/>ment at all.... Reconstruction undertaken by any 
     <lb/>government is one thing, and must not be confused 
     <lb/>fused with reference to the government that un<lb break="no"/>dertakes that policy of reconstruction, which is 
     <lb/>something entirely different. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Still on that point of order which has 
     <lb/>
     been raised. I agree with Mr. Miller, at least I 
     <lb/>
     don't know if I agree, but I am in doubt as to just 
     <lb/>
     how far a person can go in debate on this par<lb break="no"/>ticular point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not going to speculate. If 
     <lb/>
     you don't mind I will deal with any remarks, if 
     <lb/>
     there are any made in the chamber. If a remark is 
     <lb/>
     made by any member, and if it is taken exception 
     <lb/>
     to by any other member rising to a point of order, 
     <lb/>
     then all I could say at this time, Mr. Hollett, is 
     <lb/>
     that I will deal with it then. I can't be asked to 
     <lb/>
     generalise at this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> I am sorry that I created all that 
     <lb/>
     discussion, but may I proceed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, please do, Mr. Watton. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Point of order. I was about to make 
     <lb/>an observation. Am I not to be allowed to make 
     <lb/>a simple observation? I was going to draw your 
     <lb/>attention sir, to one of the concluding paragraphs 
     <lb/>in the address given by the late Chairman, Mr. 
     <lb/>Bradley, when they arrived in Ottawa, wherein 
     <lb/>he stated that the basic economy of this country 
     <lb/>was sound, provided we could get the government. 
     <lb/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I rise to a point of order. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett is refen'ing to something not said in this 
     <lb/>
     chamber, but in Ottawa. What's this got to do 
     <lb/>
     with this debate? 
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I must sustain that. I am not 
     <lb/>concerned with any observations made by any 
     <lb/>member outside this chamber. I am simply con<lb break="no"/>cerned with any remarks which may be addressed 
     <lb/>by any member on this Economic Report. What 
     <lb/>Mr. Bradley said in Ottawa, or any other place, 
     <lb/>is a matter of complete indifference to me at this

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now the observations on that

            <p><persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> I agree with that. That's all I want

     must look for our future economic stability. They 
     <lb/>
     are in a sound position, and are likely to continue 
     <lb/>
     as far as we can see... In my opinion all that is 
     <lb/>
     necessary now is this: just the five letter word 
     <lb/>
     F A I T H, faith in ourselves as individuals, and 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Mr. Chairman, with your per<lb break="no"/>mission, and hoping Mr. Smallwood won't interfere, 
     <lb/>
     I would like to congratulate Mr. Hickman 
     <lb/>
     upon his excellent speech... What of our future? 
     <lb/>
     Some 14 months ago we were sent here by the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country as their representatives. 
     <lb/>
     For what? To try and find out the true condition 
     <lb/>
     of our island home. We started, and after a day or 
     <lb/>
     two a monkey wrench was thrown in. Confederation 
     <lb/>
     tion came on the scene. What happened? Con<lb break="no"/>fusion has reigned ever since. That is the sum and 
     <lb/>
     substance of this Convention today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Order, please. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> We were sent here to see if our 
     <lb/>
     island home is self-supporting or not. We have 
     <lb/>
     not got anywhere. After we came here we realised 
     <lb/>
     our task was immense. Committees were set up 
     <lb/>
     to try to ascertain the true facts of our economy, 
     <lb/>
     and whether our country was self-supporting or 
     <lb/>
     not. Mr. Chairman, for months we worked in 
     <lb/>
     committees, and after many months we brought 
     <lb/>
     here the various reports. They were approved, 
     <lb/>
     debated, and 45 or 44 members okayed each 
     <lb/>
     report in its turn. And so, by piecing together 
     <lb/>
     these various reports, did we not piece together 
     <lb/>
     at the same time the Economic Report? If we did 
     <lb/>
     not, it does not make sense... They became law, 
     <lb/>
     as it were. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, sir. Point of order. That is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely incorrect. No report has yet been 
     <lb/>
     adopted — not one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point is true, but by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that they have been debated and not 
     <lb/>
     objected to, they are tacitly accepted. That is a 
     <lb/>
     point, I think. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> I understood some time ago that 
     <lb/>
     no member on the floor, whether he was correct 
     <lb/>
     or incorrect, was to be interrupted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It was a point of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRUM1">Mr. Crummey</persName> The point of order was not a 
     <lb/>
     point of order. It was questioning a statement 
     <lb/>
     made by a speaker on the floor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have ruled against Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, so I think it has been disposed of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I don't see why Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     can get up every few minutes and say what he 
     <lb/>
     wants to. He has got a lot to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I beg your pardon. Did you say 
     <lb/>
     the Chairman of the Convention had too much to 
     <lb/>
     say? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> No sir, I did not. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I am absolutely satisfied that if ever this country 
     <lb/>
     was self-supporting it is self-supporting today. 
     <lb/>
     When one can pay his bills he or she is solvent. 
     <lb/>
     The same can be said of this country. If we can 
     <lb/>
     balance our budget and have a surplus left we are 
     <lb/>
     financially sound, and Newfoundland today is 
     <lb/>
     just that. I wish to refer you to page 5 of the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report. Unfortunately Major Cashin is 
     <lb/>
     not here, but perhaps... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would say that if you have any 
     <lb/>
     questions, it has been decided by the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee that it would save time if members 
     <lb/>
     might address them, and I will have the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     record them, and we will have Major Cashin deal 
     <lb/>
     with them in a few days time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> You mean all the questions, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman? Thank you. That will cut my time 
     <lb/>
     pretty short... The first I was going to ask was 
     <lb/>
     this: page 5: "In 1930 an approach was made to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government with respect to the 
     <lb/>
     payment of a subsidy in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     operation of our ship on the Gulf service." I was 
     <lb/>
     wondering if Major Cashin took that matter up 
     <lb/>
     with the Commission of Government, as to why 
     <lb/>
     there was no subsidy given since 1933. The 
     <lb/>
     second one was in connection with Gander.... I 
     <lb/>
     was wondering if the Committee could find out 
     <lb/>
     how many millions of gallons of aviation gas was 
     <lb/>
     hauled from Lewisporte to Gander during the 
     <lb/>
     year 1946? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> The answer is no, Mr. Northcott. 
     <lb/>
     
     
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Some ten million gallons. If they 
     <lb/>got one cent a gallon it would increase the 
     <lb/>revenue of the country. I may say though, that 
     <lb/>there is no duty on aviation gasoline, and I can't 
     <lb/>see why it should not be. It is very sensible and 
     <lb/>important to this country, especially when fishermen 
     <lb/>men have to pay high taxes on their gasoline... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEN3">Mr. Spencer</persName> I have no desire to spend much 
     <lb/>time in debating this Economic Report, but I am 
     <lb/>convinced that this committee of the whole is the 
     <lb/>place to speak of it. There can be no doubt that 
     <lb/>we are at the moment in a sound financial condi<lb break="no"/>tion, due in large part to the boom of prosperity

     we experienced during the war years; also to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that we did not have to finance our own war 
     <lb/>
     effort as we did in the first Great War... We are 
     <lb/>
     all aware of the fact that the economics of this 
     <lb/>
     country have always been very unbalanced. We 
     <lb/>
     have always had to depend too much on the 
     <lb/>
     returns of one industry — the fisheries. This 
     <lb/>
     condition has changed somewhat in recent years. 
     <lb/>
     We have such major industries as mining and 
     <lb/>
     logging, and also in very recent years our fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry has been diversified with the coming of 
     <lb/>
     modern fresh fish processing plants, the 
     <lb/>
     manufacture and sale of fishery products other 
     <lb/>
     than cod; and there are good reasons for believing 
     <lb/>
     that the returns from our mineral resources, espe<lb break="no"/>cially the iron ore deposits on the Labrador, will 
     <lb/>
     help in a large measure to balance our economy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But what I would like to find out is how far we 
     <lb/>
     have come towards having a more balanced 
     <lb/>
     economy during the past 12 or 13 years. We still 
     <lb/>
     have around 50% of our people engaged in the 
     <lb/>
     fishing industry, and with this thought in mind I 
     <lb/>
     would like to draw the attention of members to 
     <lb/>
     page 32 of the report, which reads as follows: "At 
     <lb/>
     the present time we figure that not less than 
     <lb/>
     25,000 of our people are engaged in the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry; 15,000 in the pulp and paper industry; 
     <lb/>
     and 3,500 in the mining industry", and then they 
     <lb/>
     give the value of these industries. I am of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that it would have added to the value of 
     <lb/>
     this report, and helped us to more clearly evaluate 
     <lb/>
     the economic conditions of our country, if they 
     <lb/>
     had gone a little farther with this paragraph and 
     <lb/>
     shown in a comparative statement how the per<lb break="no"/>centage of our people engaged in the various 
     <lb/>
     industries has changed in the past 12 or 14 years. 
     <lb/>
     According to the census figures of 1935 those 
     <lb/>
     gainfully employed in the various industries were 
     <lb/>
     as follows: in the fishing industry 36,900 persons; 
     <lb/>
     in the logging industry, including those engaged 
     <lb/>
     in paper-making, 9,700; and in the mining in<lb break="no"/>dustry, 1,800; or if we take them by percentages, 
     <lb/>
     46.7% fishing, 12.4% logging, and 2.3% mining. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know how these percentages would 
     <lb/>
     compare with those engaged in the different in<lb break="no"/>dustries at the present time, but glancing at the 
     <lb/>
     totals we find that the number of those engaged 
     <lb/>
     in in the fishing industry has decreased by about 
     <lb/>
     50%, while those engaged in logging has in<lb break="no"/>creased by about 65%, and those engaged in 
     <lb/>
     mining has nearly doubled. Judging from those 
   

            <cb/>
           

     figures it would seem that we are beginning to 
     <lb/>
     have a more balanced economy. I have no wish 
     <lb/>
     to paint either a bright or gloomy picture of the 
     <lb/>
     economic position, but I want to get, and I want 
     <lb/>
     the people 10 get, a true picture, and I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that such a comparative statement as I 
     <lb/>
     have outlined would help us in getting that pic<lb break="no"/>ture. I realise that the Committee has done a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous amount of work in getting this report 
     <lb/>
     to us in such a short time, but I pass this thought 
     <lb/>
     to them for their consideration.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, first I would like to 
     <lb/>
     congratulate the Finance Committee on this

     report because I believe in the light of the other 
     <lb/>
     reports that have been tabled, this very clearly 
     <lb/>
     sums up the information gathered therein. One 
     <lb/>
     cannot help being struck with the brief and clear 
     <lb/>
     way the facts have been presented so that the 
     <lb/>
     common man can understand them. Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     more could be said if we go back to 1897 and find 
     <lb/>
     out where we stood with regard to our way of life, 
     <lb/>
     and compare it with today.... First, I'll paint a 
     <lb/>
     picture from memory and forget the records. 
     <lb/>
     Let's take the doctor, with 14 miles to go on either 
     <lb/>
     end from where he practised. I'm speaking of my 
     <lb/>
     own locality, New Chelsea, and to get the doctor 
     <lb/>
     to a patient it was shanks's mare in the winter, if 
     <lb/>
     it wasn't dog and slide. And the mails, one a 
     <lb/>
     week; the old courier did his best — 17 miles up 
     <lb/>
     and 17 miles down with a large haversack on his 
     <lb/>
     back. Lighthouses? None. You found your way 
     <lb/>
     through the shoals by guess and by God. Now, I 
     <lb/>
     know that these conditions still exist in some 
     <lb/>
     parts of the island, but there have been great 
     <lb/>
     strides made and I believe we are at the turn in 
     <lb/>
     the road, and should go ahead as much in 15 years 
     <lb/>
     as we have in the last 50 years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Take our income. In 1900 — I am speaking 
     <lb/>
     from memory now - gross exports, less than $9 
     <lb/>
     million; government's income, $1.25 million, 
     <lb/>
     and nearly 7,000 miles of coastline to service, not 
     <lb/>
     counting the interior. Well, either our fathers had 
     <lb/>
     the nerve and faith of their sites, or as we say in 
     <lb/>
     the British navy, "where ignorance is bliss, it's 
     <lb/>
     all my 'blooming eye'." But anyway, I'll bet 
     <lb/>
     there was less weeping and wailing about the 
     <lb/>
     three square meals and the tight roof, beri-beri 
     <lb/>
     and what have you on the whole 7,000—mile 
     <lb/>
     length of that coastline, than there has been in this 
     <lb/>
     chamber since this cod-vention started. One can 
     <lb/>
     be pretty sure that when men who have sung the 


            <pb n="699" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-10_Page_0699.jpg"/>

     praises of their country for 30 or 40 years sudden<lb break="no"/>ly turn around and vilify her before the whole 
     <lb/>
     world, then there's more in it than meets the eye. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was thinking yesterday, as I looked at the end 
     <lb/>
     of this report, if it was only possible to locate a 
     <lb/>
     modern Witch of Endor who would raise up our 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the beginning of this century and put 
     <lb/>
     them in this chamber with a revenue of $40 
     <lb/>
     million, then they'd do something, they would 
     <lb/>
     build something, when we see what they built 
     <lb/>
     with the little they had. I must admit that if they 
     <lb/>
     did not plan well they built well, and had it been 
     <lb/>
     followed through the story of our island home 
     <lb/>
     would have been different today.... More could 
     <lb/>
     have been done during the past 50 years, but one 
     <lb/>
     thing we can be thankful for, we have the mis<lb break="no"/>takes of our leaders of the 1920s, l930s and 
     <lb/>
     19408 to guide us. Experience is a dear school and 
     <lb/>
     a hard teacher, and if we cannot learn there then 
     <lb/>
     nothing can teach us. We have a country that we 
     <lb/>
     can all be proud of, and one of which 1 am proud, 
     <lb/>
     although I have spent almost a lifetime going to 
     <lb/>
     and fro in this world. It has been and always will 
     <lb/>
     be home to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe all the debts we have accumulated 
     <lb/>
     have assets to cover them, many times over.... I 
     <lb/>
     am satisfied the country today is self-supporting 
     <lb/>
     and can be made more so. I have gone through 
     <lb/>
     the different reports and have done work on two 
     <lb/>
     of them. I was a member of the Transportation 
     <lb/>
     Committee and that has been a revelation to me. 
     <lb/>
     I don't hold to be an expert. but since I made my 
     <lb/>
     first trip around Cape Bauld in 1902, l have been 
     <lb/>
     actively engaged in fishing and transportation, 
     <lb/>
     and a man should learn something about all this 
     <lb/>
     in 45 years, especially when I have made a study 
     <lb/>
     of those matters together with the trade of the 
     <lb/>
     country generally, and the countries that I visited. 
     <lb/>
     I have gone into marine transportation as 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly as any layman can and while I'll 
     <lb/>
     move over and make room for any man to find 
     <lb/>
     out, for example, why the railroad doesn't pay, I 
     <lb/>
     still believe I am capable of putting my finger on 
     <lb/>
     a lot of the money that in this one case has gone 
     <lb/>
     up in the air, through the authorities not being 
     <lb/>
     able to adjust themselves to change. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Last week we had to listen to a tirade on why 
     <lb/>
     we shouldn't have a mercantile marine because 
     <lb/>
     we would have to sell the ships three years from 
     <lb/>
     now for half of what we'd pay for them. Now, I 
     <lb/>
     am going to try and show Newfoundland why our 
  

            <cb/>
          

     very life depends on us getting a national mer<lb break="no"/>chant marine, and that as quickly as possible. The 
     <lb/>
     first time I put this belief forward, then the cry 
     <lb/>
     from the street was that we could not operate 
     <lb/>
     ships as cheaply as the Greeks, the Norwegians, 
     <lb/>
     the Swedes and the Danes. I guess the US would 
     <lb/>
     have been a sorry country if they had said we 
     <lb/>
     cannot make tools or machinery as cheap as the 
     <lb/>
     British or the Germans, and got the latter to make 
     <lb/>
     the tools and machinery for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me try and show you what the lack of a 
     <lb/>
     mercantile marine cost Newfoundland up to say 
     <lb/>
     1923. We did not feel it so much as in our local 
     <lb/>
     foreign-going fleet, we had a fairly good freight- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     carrying potentiality — but the picture after 1925, 
     <lb/>
     that's something else again. First I'll try to get to 
     <lb/>
     the root of the cry that we can't carry freight as 
     <lb/>
     cheaply as other maritime countries. Ignorance 
     <lb/>
     had a lot to do with it. Let's take the Railway ships 
     <lb/>
     and see where their dollars go up in the air. The 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Kyle</hi>, built around 1912, is a good example. That 
     <lb/>
     ship has cost the government of this country an 
     <lb/>
     average of $12 a ton for the 25 tons of coal she 
     <lb/>
     has burned daily. Give her 150 steaming days on 
     <lb/>
     average, every year of her 35 year lifetime, and 
     <lb/>
     the cost of coal is $1,575,000. Now had this ship 
     <lb/>
     been converted in 1930 her running cost would 
     <lb/>
     have been cut from $300 daily to $177, or a 
     <lb/>
     saving to the country in 17 years of $314,000. 
     <lb/>
     Then the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Northern Ranger</hi>, which consumes 18 
     <lb/>
     tons a day. This could have been cut in propor<lb break="no"/>tion. and so on with the other ships. And I'm sure 
     <lb/>
     that those that were sold could have been put 
     <lb/>
     under diesel propulsion with a stupendous 
     <lb/>
     saving. The logical thing for the government, 
     <lb/>
     when it took over the Railway, was to have 
     <lb/>
     secured a diesel electric engineer and started a 
     <lb/>
     school at the dock shops. Today we would have 
     <lb/>
     a trained staff and the most modern and efficient 
     <lb/>
     kind of transportation which in years would pay 
     <lb/>
     off. Instead of this, the only solution appears to 
     <lb/>
     be tojump up the fishermen's fares and freights. 
     <lb/>
     There wasn't any need to sell the ships that were 
     <lb/>
     sold. Otherinterests bought them and put them in 
     <lb/>
     the trade and made them pay. Take the little 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sagona</hi>. Foreign interests bought her, changed 
     <lb/>
     her to oil and the cost to them was $350,000. But 
     <lb/>
     she paid for herself in three trips in the banana 
     <lb/>
     trade, while all she had done here was lie up and 
     <lb/>
     rust for years. "We should not have a merchant 
     <lb/>
     marine," says the critic, while the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Brigus</hi> has

     gross earnings in ten months of $293,000. and a 
     <lb/>
     net profit of $107,000; the Random has a gross of 
     <lb/>
     $304,000 and a net of $145,000. Why, last year 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Baccalieu</hi> grossed $285,000, net $23,000; the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Burgeo</hi> grossed $328,000, net $72,000. The 
     <lb/>
     wages paid alone on those two latter ships went 
     <lb/>
     to $66,000 a year. The total wage bill paid to 
     <lb/>
     crews of the Railway ships last year was 
     <lb/>
     $625,000 and to the Splinter Fleet $150,000,<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> a 
     <lb/>
     total wage bill for both fleets of $775,000. One 
     <lb/>
     thing I can assure you, that this country, before 
     <lb/>
     she can begin to take her place in the world, needs 
     <lb/>
     two things. First a merchant marine, that's essen<lb break="no"/>tial... In the debate on the Fisheries Report I 
     <lb/>
     spoke about four ships, each about 3,000 tons 
     <lb/>
     gross and carrying about 5,000 tons of cargo with 
     <lb/>
     about 1,000 tons of refrigeration space for frozen 
     <lb/>
     and perishable cargoes. These ships could be 
     <lb/>
     built for the ice and should have their chill-rooms 
     <lb/>
     aft. They should have three decks for carrying 
     <lb/>
     barrelled goods and cutting down on lumber dun<lb break="no"/>nage. For in the future we are going to have a 
     <lb/>
     fishmeal and mackerel trade which, as 1 said 
     <lb/>
     before, with a flour and feed mill will give us a 
     <lb/>
     chance to barter in trade with the Argentine and 
     <lb/>
     Australia, so that in the years to come our people 
     <lb/>
     will be assured flour, and our cattle will feed from 
     <lb/>
     our fishmeals which is the most expensive part of 
     <lb/>
     those feeds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We can export too, there is nothing unsound 
     <lb/>
     in this. Also with woods operations, in carrying 
     <lb/>
     wood from the east coast to the west, we can find 
     <lb/>
     employment for ships like the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Brigus</hi>; also in the 
     <lb/>
     general trade carrying coal etc., we will never 
     <lb/>
     have to see those ships, we can extend that trade. 
     <lb/>
     There are today 20,000 quintals of fish waiting 
     <lb/>
     shipment to Portugal, waiting for a Portuguese 
     <lb/>
     ship to come for it. Half of that fish should be 
     <lb/>
     eaten by now, and instead we are waiting like a 
     <lb/>
     beleaguered city for the Portuguese to come and 
     <lb/>
     help us. Shades of Captain Thomas and Captain 
     <lb/>
     Dingle, to see this state of affairs in a country 
     <lb/>
     which produced men who could drive a two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     master schooner to Oporto and back home in 28 
     <lb/>
     or 30 days. Too long, Mr. Chairman, we've had 
     <lb/>
     journalists and lawyers in the seats of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It's time we got men with more practical 
     <lb/>
     vision. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     I picked up a paper the other day and saw that 
     <lb/>
     renders were being called for the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Thackeray</hi>,<ref target="#fn_03">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     now anchored in the harbour here. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment could buy her and next spring we would 
     <lb/>
     have a ship for less than $300,000 for the trade of 
     <lb/>
     the country that perhaps would net the Railway 
     <lb/>
     $100,000. I interviewed the government 
     <lb/>
     authorities on it. They said they investigated but 
     <lb/>
     were not interested. If they bought her they would 
     <lb/>
     have no deficit on the docks this winter as she 
     <lb/>
     would give work. The actual cost to the country 
     <lb/>
     would be little as the cash would be left in the 
     <lb/>
     country. No, the government cannot go into the 
     <lb/>
     business that pays, only the non-paying services 
     <lb/>
     come under their glance... If we are going to feed 
     <lb/>
     our people we must plan what is best for them 
     <lb/>
     and the country. The laissez-faire ways of the past 
     <lb/>
     must go as far back as the "Indian meal" days of 
     <lb/>
     our grandfathers' time. Now we must plan, and I 
     <lb/>
     believe the country has the resources. All we 
     <lb/>
     want is the brains, brawn and capital, and we have 
     <lb/>
     the last two. Is it possible that we haven't got the 
     <lb/>
     brains to plan? We have the resources. There's 
     <lb/>
     no doubt about that. We must awake to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we must combine scientific knowledge with 
     <lb/>
     skill and change from the worn-out ways of the 
     <lb/>
     past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are fishing the same way as in my grand<lb break="no"/>father's day when a horn lantern and a compass, 
     <lb/>
     an open galley on deck, a jigger and dabber was 
     <lb/>
     about the whole equipment. Most places fish now 
     <lb/>
     with nets known as traps for fish to swim into. If 
     <lb/>
     the fish don't swim in, all is lost. That era is past. 
     <lb/>
     The trap today must go. In my day, as a boy, the 
     <lb/>
     cod-seine was a part of the equipment of every 
     <lb/>
     second schooner. Today there is not a cod-seine 
     <lb/>
     around Newfoundland. If there is, I haven' t heard 
     <lb/>
     of it this last 30 years. The trap is going the same 
     <lb/>
     way, believe it or not. Take the increase of fish 
     <lb/>
     caught in Greenland. Fish are changing their 
     <lb/>
     habits, and this is where scientific knowledge and 
     <lb/>
     planning must go hand in hand, and we have to 
     <lb/>
     do it. Take our competitor, Iceland; 80% of her 
     <lb/>
     exports are from the sea. The money the govern<lb break="no"/>ment spent there paid off. And now they've had 
     <lb/>
     a bond issue of $40 million, which works out at 
     <lb/>
     $308 a head, for the population to subscribe. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder what would happen in Newfoundland if

     a government started to raise a bond issue of 
     <lb/>
     nearly $100 million. Yet what they've done in 
     <lb/>
     Iceland will have to be done here. In 1946 the 
     <lb/>
     exportation of Iceland fish and fish products 
     <lb/>
     amounted to 244 million kroner equal to 80% of 
     <lb/>
     its total exports... That's what they've done in 
     <lb/>
     Iceland, with one-third our population. I am criti<lb break="no"/>cal, but I hope it's constructive criticism I offer. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p>But now let me leave this, and pass to what in 
     <lb/>my opinion is one weak link in our economic 
     <lb/>chain, the lack of a merchant marine. No country, 
     <lb/>especially an island can do without one. Let's do 
     <lb/>a little figuring, and see what the country has to 
     <lb/>offer in the way of freight to keep us from selling 
     <lb/>our ships at half-price. I'll only take a few essen<lb break="no"/>tials, over roughly the life of a ship. First I'll say 
     <lb/>figures don't lie, but liars can figure. If you doubt 
     <lb/>them, you can check them. First I'll talk salt for 
     <lb/>the years 1925 to 1942, 16 years, not quite the life 
     <lb/>of a ship. We imported 762,503 tons at a freight 
     <lb/>rate of $2.80 per ton — that's peacetime freight 
     <lb/>rates — an annual freight bill on salt of $132,438. 
     <lb/>For 16 years that makes $2,119, 008. Now coal, 
     <lb/>for the same period we imported 5,792,191 tons 
     <lb/>of coal at a peacetime freight rate of $1 per tort, 
     <lb/>or an average of $321,788 annually. Next let's 
     <lb/>take flour. It can all come in by ships. Over a 21 
     <lb/>year period, still in the life of a ship, we imported 
     <lb/>8,249,000 barrels of flour at a freight rate of 60 
     <lb/>cents a barrel: $4,949,000 in freights on flour or 
     <lb/>$235,686 a year. The last of the four commodities 
     <lb/>I'll refer to is fish. And it won't be the least. From 
     <lb/>the period 1924-25 to 1944-45, we exported dried 
     <lb/>and pickled fish to a total of 24,532,550 quintals. 
     <lb/>At a freight rate of 70 cents per quintal, it cost us 
     <lb/>$17,172,785: an annual average of$817,751. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now this means that an annual freight bill 
     <lb/>went to outsiders totalling $1,507,563 on these 
     <lb/>four commodities alone. That money was lost to 
     <lb/>this country, wages were lost to our seamen, and 
     <lb/>wealth to our internal trade. In ordinary peace 
     <lb/>time that meant a loss to the country, a total loss, 
     <lb/>due to the lack of a merchant marine, of 
     <lb/>$31,033,384 over the period referred to. If the 
     <lb/>government had built those three ships of 2,000 
     <lb/>tons in 1925, what a different story. We can 
     <lb/>easily see how over that period this country paid 
     <lb/>out $80 million in freight, 99% of it going to 
     <lb/>outside interests. So that way too, did New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders help to bring this cod-vention into 
     <lb/>being, if it wasn't the main cause. How can 


            <cb/>
           

     300,000 people afford to take in $31 million from 
     <lb/>
     poor countries mostly, and then pass it out to 
     <lb/>
     outside interests, just on essentials? Can we af<lb break="no"/>ford to play Santa Claus to outside interests? 
     <lb/>
     Only the "B block" can do that, a red-blooded 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander can't. No! The figure is too 
     <lb/>
     heavy, $2-3 million annually for freight, gone 
     <lb/>
     clean. Not one cent left in the country, and that 
     <lb/>
     sometimes out of a total export of less than $25 
     <lb/>
     million in some years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is a sum we can't afford to lose, the trade 
     <lb/>
     loses, the government loses and worst of all the 
     <lb/>
     seaman loses, he has to eat the dole while in many 
     <lb/>
     cases govemment-owned or subsidised ships 
     <lb/>
     carry away his livelihood. And you have to have 
     <lb/>
     seamen in a national emergency, They are the 
     <lb/>
     first line of defence, and they must be trained. 
     <lb/>
     You cannot make an officer or an engineer over<lb break="no"/>night or a helmsman either. And a ship that is 
     <lb/>
     sunk because an officer doesn't know his job is 
     <lb/>
     just as much a casualty as if sunk by enemy 
     <lb/>
     action. I think I have shown without a shadow of 
     <lb/>
     a doubt that there is cargo to be had for a merchant 
     <lb/>
     marine, and we should have one. Our flag should 
     <lb/>
     never have gone from the seas. There is always 
     <lb/>
     work for ships to do. Besides the things I have 
     <lb/>
     mentioned, the freight potentialities have not 
     <lb/>
     been scratched. We have the brawn, and the 
     <lb/>
     capital; I say again, do we lack the brains? Can't 
     <lb/>
     we plan like the Icelandic parliament? Why the 
     <lb/>
     defeatist attitude? Only when we do plan like this 
     <lb/>
     will the man on the bill of Cape George and all 
     <lb/>
     the other bills get his three square meals, his suit 
     <lb/>
     of clothes and his tight roof. We can't get it out 
     <lb/>
     of baby bonuses and old age pensions. Let the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country demand that we get it. Let 
     <lb/>
     us learn by our mistakes of the past. We have the 
     <lb/>
     resources here. Let us at one blow lick what we 
     <lb/>
     have always been up against. Let us pledge her to 
     <lb/>
     the hilt. Men can do it, cowards can't. Men look<lb break="no"/>ing for fame and opportunity won't let us cut out 
     <lb/>
     the uneconomical. If a fishery doesn't pay, let's 
     <lb/>
     get rid of it. I heard my friend in the "B block" 
     <lb/>
     the other day speaking about the state of affairs 
     <lb/>
     in his part of the island, putting up a poor mouth 
     <lb/>
     because the Labrador fish are not to be caught, 
     <lb/>
     and is a drag on the market to sell when it is 
     <lb/>
     caught. 15 that any reason why this cannot be 
     <lb/>
     changed, when without going 100 miles from 
     <lb/>
     their homes they can come to the finest fishing 
     <lb/>
     grounds in the world? All the schooners that are 


            <pb n="702" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-10_Page_0702.jpg"/>

     seaworthy could go in the offshore fishery either 
     <lb/>
     as draggers or dory fishermen. It's balderdash 
     <lb/>
     that a man cannot change to another kind of 
     <lb/>
     fishing. What is there to learn about it? In two 
     <lb/>
     years any man who has his health and strength 
     <lb/>
     can change from an expert trap fisherman to a 
     <lb/>
     trawl fisherman, and I guess in a month to an 
     <lb/>
     expert drag ger fisherman. For he knows this time 
     <lb/>
     he has got to be helped, I know. But ifa man has 
     <lb/>
     a schooner of 60 tons and upward and is well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     found, there's no need for him today to put her 
     <lb/>
     on the auction block. If he has the will and is 
     <lb/>
     willing to learn, of course; then perhaps in a few 
     <lb/>
     years he can look back and say those three bad 
     <lb/>
     years were the best thing that ever happened to 
     <lb/>
     me, and to the country as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe in this report and can only say that in 
     <lb/>
     planning it is not bold enough. It smacks too 
     <lb/>
     much of the past, it holds too much to the old 
     <lb/>
     traditions. In fact it has the old ship of state 
     <lb/>
     dragging her chains behind her. She has broken 
     <lb/>
     out her anchors, but the Finance Committee for<lb break="no"/>got to heave them in. Let us stow the chain in the 
     <lb/>
     lockers and go ahead full speed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In referring to the merchant marine, the genial 
     <lb/>
     delegate from Bonavista Centre spoke about the 
     <lb/>
     difference of opinion between myself and the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Job about the powering of ships. I wish 
     <lb/>
     to congratulate Mr. Job and-his associates on the 
     <lb/>
     pioneer step they have taken, and I'm sure they 
     <lb/>
     are setting an example that will vindicate both 
     <lb/>
     myself and Mr. Crosbie in our opinions. I refer to 
     <lb/>
     the installing of diesel engines in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sable Is<lb break="no"/>land</hi>. I'll make a guess this innovation alone will 
     <lb/>
     mean a long step forward in the coming maritime 
     <lb/>
     age of this country, and it will mean that Water 
     <lb/>
     Street will once again be seen at its best, from a 
     <lb/>
     launch that is, and not from a taxi. The trade of 
     <lb/>
     this country will be carried in our own bottoms. 
     <lb/>
     The firms along the streets will once again be 
     <lb/>
     mercantile firms and not calico vendors. Had the 
     <lb/>
     government done what the firm of Job Brothers 
     <lb/>
     and Company is doing today, with the fleet of 
     <lb/>
     ships it had, with the services of a diesel electrical 
     <lb/>
     engineer, plus their new shipping, both the docks 
     <lb/>
     and the coastal services would be in the black 
     <lb/>
     now. This could have been done during the last 
     <lb/>
     25 years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion, in the light of the information 
  

   
          
            <cb/>
          

     before me, I can only come to the opinion that 
     <lb/>
     this country is not only self-supporting now, but 
     <lb/>
     was always self—supporting. The only reason for 
     <lb/>
     the hard straits we have been in has been the 
     <lb/>
     human element, which reflects on all of us from 
     <lb/>
     the government down to the last citizen. We've 
     <lb/>
     had the brawn, the capital and the resources, but 
     <lb/>
     seem to have been lacking in the brains or the 
     <lb/>
     vision. After my extensive study of the natural 
     <lb/>
     resources of our country, in my comparison with 
     <lb/>
     those of other lands, particularly Iceland and 
     <lb/>
     Norway, 1 can only come to the conclusion that 
     <lb/>
     in view of the way our affairs and resources have 
     <lb/>
     been mishandled so far, its a wonder to me not 
     <lb/>
     that she survived, but how she survived. As I said 
     <lb/>
     before, the Finance Committee has only broken 
     <lb/>
     the anchors from the ground. Let's haul in the 
     <lb/>
     chains and full speed ahead. 
     <lb/>
