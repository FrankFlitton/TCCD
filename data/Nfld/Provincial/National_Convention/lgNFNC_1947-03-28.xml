     other words they did not lose one single pound 
     <lb/>
     for bad quality. The fishermen looked after it all 
     <lb/>
     the way through. We did not need fishery inspec<lb break="no"/>tors — we had 250 inspectors and these were the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen themselves. But last year, 1946, they 
     <lb/>
     ran into their first snag — 16% of the total 
     <lb/>
     product was affected by spoilage, which does 
     <lb/>
     make some difference in the figures. The first 
     <lb/>
     four years were maximum figures; last year was 
     <lb/>
     a doubtful year.

            <p>
     Mr. Burry In rising to comment on this section 
     <lb/>
     of the report, it does not mean I was not impressed 
     <lb/>
     by the rest of it. I note that the Committee has 
     <lb/>
     recognised that our basic problem is our people 
     <lb/>
     scattered around our great coastline. They have 
     <lb/>
     made a very good attempt to solve some of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties of this problem. It has been suggested 
     <lb/>
     by other members that there is a gap — and we 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     all recognise it and are sensitive to it — between 
     <lb/>
     the primary producer and the exporter and the 
     <lb/>
     trade. The Committee has recognised this and 
     <lb/>
     have made some very good suggestions to solve 
     <lb/>
     the problem. That seems to be one of their aims. 
     <lb/>
     They made suggestions for the modernisation of 
     <lb/>
     our fisheries and I support this section of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee's report because this is also one of 
     <lb/>
     their suggestions — one way in which we can 
     <lb/>
     span the gap. I am pleased because it came from 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Committee with representatives on 
     <lb/>
     it of various sections of our country, and undoub<lb break="no"/>tedly the trade and exporters have played such a 
     <lb/>
     part in presenting this report, it is hopeful for the 
     <lb/>
     future....

   </div>

<div type="section">


            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The committee is now consider<lb break="no"/>ing that section headed "The Co-operative Move<lb break="no"/>ment".<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> Mr. Chairman, I suppose I was part<lb break="no"/>ly responsible for this section not passing yester<lb break="no"/>day afternoon. There are, a couple of 
     <lb/>
     observations I would like to make now, however, 
     <lb/>
     relative to the co-operative movement. When Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell was speaking yesterday he stated that 
     <lb/>
     there was no money put into the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement by the government. Mr. Keough how<lb break="no"/>ever did inform us that the government did have 
     <lb/>
     money in several of the co-operative movements, 
     <lb/>
     especially land settlements. Then aquestion from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett elicited an answer from Mr. Newell, 
     <lb/>
     that the government had advanced them $50,000 
     <lb/>
     annually for salaries and travelling expenses. I 
     <lb/>
     contend that any committee bringing in a report 
     <lb/>
     on any department or institution in which govern<lb break="no"/>ment monies are involved should show what that 
     <lb/>
     department is costing and is likely to cost in the 
     <lb/>
     future. I feel that in order to arrive at the cost of 
     <lb/>
     government these are the facts we must have. 
     <lb/>
     They are more important than the price of some 
     <lb/>
     fishery products ten years ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> Mr. Fowler seems to want to 
  

            <cb/>
           

     know how much is involved so far as the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is concerned. I might say that the land 
     <lb/>
     settlements (at the present time there are two or 
     <lb/>
     three) were started with money supplied by the 
     <lb/>
     government, and when they were wound up there 
     <lb/>
     was a certain amount of stock, buildings, etc. left 
     <lb/>
     over, and an inventory was taken. and in the case 
     <lb/>
     of Lourdes it amounted to $8,000. Some people 
     <lb/>
     think that $8,000 was passed over as a gift but 
     <lb/>
     that is not correct. We have not yet paid off the 
     <lb/>
     full amount, but we have it down to about $2,000 
     <lb/>
     and will pay it off practically at any time. It is not 
     <lb/>
     a matter of the government losing any money. 
     <lb/>
     This same situation applies to Midland and Point 
     <lb/>
     au Mal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What Mr. Fowler really wants to 
     <lb/>
     know is why the people should be taxed to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of $50,000 a year to maintain or sustain 
     <lb/>
     some particular ideology which some people 
     <lb/>
     wish to bring forward. I think that's your point is 
     <lb/>
     it not, Mr. Fowler? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> Yes, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would like to know that too. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if Mr. Job can tell us? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     education than anything else. I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     having an important effect among fishermen. I 
     <lb/>
     believe in the movement because it is making 
     <lb/>
     people think. It is costing the government 
     <lb/>
     $50,000, but you can't very well say it is costing 
     <lb/>
     that much as a co-operative movement, it is part 
     <lb/>
     of the education of the people, I think.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What is it doing for the fisheries? 
     <lb/>
       </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It has undoubtedly done quite a job — 
     <lb/>it has exported quite a lot of salmon and lobster. 
     <lb/>I don't see why they should not do it. Competing 
     <lb/>with merchants, Idon't suppose you object to that 
     <lb/>do you? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I am not objecting to anything, I just 
     <lb/>
     want to know what it is costing the country and 
     <lb/>
     what it is likely to cost in the future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> If it will clear it up any I have the 
     <lb/>
     estimates here for 1946-47.... That is a total of 22 
     <lb/>
     for the personnel, for which there is a budget of 
     <lb/>
     $31,400, and travelling expenses of $18,000, 
     <lb/>
     which makes a total of roughly $50,000. That is 
     <lb/>
     how it is laid out in the estimates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> A moment ago I asked Mr. Jones 
     <lb/>
     from Harbour Grace, who sits behind me, to work 
     <lb/>
     out a little mathematical table. I asked what per<lb break="no"/>centage $50,000 was of $30 million, and he 
     <lb/>
     handed it back — 1.75%. The government is 
     <lb/>
     spending 1.75% of the total expenditure on the 
     <lb/>
     encouragement of the co-operative movement. I 
     <lb/>
     don't like that, Mr. Chairman I think it is entirely 
     <lb/>
     wrong. I think that in the budget the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement ought to have spent out of public 
     <lb/>
     funds for the purpose of education and propagan<lb break="no"/>da three or four times that sum. I think there 
     <lb/>
     should be 50 field workers or more. I think the 
     <lb/>
     whole tendency of the government ought to be 
     <lb/>
     the encouragement of the co-operative move<lb break="no"/>ment. That's a lot better than communism, and if 
     <lb/>
     you don't have a co-operative movement in this 
     <lb/>
     world, that's what you are going to have. There 
     <lb/>
     is no iron curtain shutting Newfoundland off 
     <lb/>
     from ideas around the world, and if we don't do 
     <lb/>
     something to prevent it from happening, mind 
     <lb/>
     you don't wake up ten or 15 years from now and 
     <lb/>
     find in Newfoundland a communist ideology. 
     <lb/>
     There is one thing that can prevent that, and that's 
     <lb/>
     the co-operative movement. Mt. Hollett wanted 
     <lb/>
     to know if the co-operative movement competes 
     <lb/>
     with the fish merchants.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not ask any such question. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sorry, well someone was wor<lb break="no"/>
  

            <cb/>
          
     rying for fear the co-operative movement might 
     <lb/>
     compete with the merchants. Let's get this 
     <lb/>
     straight. In this country for the past 400 years 
     <lb/>
     there have been merchants ... in charge of our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. Up to now we have not been able to do 
     <lb/>
     without them. They collect the fish, pack and 
     <lb/>
     export it, but I don't suppose anyone thinks that 
     <lb/>
     when God created the world he ordained that the 
     <lb/>
     fish trade of Newfoundland had necessarily got 
     <lb/>
     to be in the hands of merchants. So long as there 
     <lb/>
     is no one to replace the merchants you have got 
     <lb/>
     to have them and be glad, but there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     to say that fishermen should not be their own 
     <lb/>
     merchants through organising co-operatively, 
     <lb/>
     and that movement, spreading as it is throughout 
     <lb/>
     the earth, should be encouraged here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and no government can do anything 
     <lb/>
     basically better than to encourage the coopera<lb break="no"/>tive movement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In reply to thatexcellent speech we 
     <lb/>
     have at least three co-operative men here — Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell, Mr. Keough and Mr. McCarthy. To you 
     <lb/>
     I would like to put this question, and I take it they 
     <lb/>
     have studied the co-operative movement much 
     <lb/>
     better than I have, is it consistent with the whole 
     <lb/>
     idea of the co-operative movement that the 
     <lb/>
     government should assist in any shape or form to 
     <lb/>
     enhance this movement? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> I am not here at the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention in particular to defend the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement. I don't see that it needs any particular 
     <lb/>
     defence. For instance, when ten people get 
     <lb/>
     together to do a certain piece of business it is 
     <lb/>
     called private enterprise, but when two or three 
     <lb/>
     or four hundred people get together to do the 
     <lb/>
     same piece of business it suddenly seems to have 
     <lb/>
     an ideology involved. As to whether it is consis<lb break="no"/>tent with co-operative ideology that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be involved, I would say not 
     <lb/>
     particularly. In this country the government hap<lb break="no"/>pened to get involved, but in the first instance it 
     <lb/>
     happened to get involved in the wrong way. It got 
     <lb/>
     involved in land settlements and suddenly one 
     <lb/>
     morning they woke up to find they had a co<lb break="no"/>operative society on their hands. Overnight they 
     <lb/>
     had a government store down there, and that's 
     <lb/>
     now called a co-operative society. It is possible 
     <lb/>
     that the government may have lost a few 
     <lb/>
     thousands in other government stores. If they did 
     <lb/>
     I have no particular sympathy for them, that's the 
     <lb/>
     price they had to pay to find out that co-operative 
   

            <pb n="413" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-28_Page_0413.jpg"/>

     stores should not have been run in that particular 
     <lb/>
     fashion. There is one other point, whether it is 
     <lb/>
     consistent for the government to have monies 
     <lb/>
     involved in the co-operative movement — I 
     <lb/>
     would say not particularly. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of the Co-operative Division, when 
     <lb/>
     a country spends money to educate its citizens 
     <lb/>
     nobody raises much objection, but apparently 
     <lb/>
     when they educate the people as to how to make 
     <lb/>
     their dollars go further people have a lot of objec<lb break="no"/>tion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I would say that the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement is open to constructive criticism, and 
     <lb/>
     the term ideology as applied to the movement is 
     <lb/>
     not one to create embarrassment. History is on 
     <lb/>
     the side of this movement, but I am at a loss to 
     <lb/>
     understand what particular ideology is being 
     <lb/>
     taught by these government- sponsored field 
     <lb/>
     workers. The word "ideology" is common cur<lb break="no"/>rency in die last few years, but I wish people 
     <lb/>
     would be careful in the use of it. You get the idea 
     <lb/>
     that there is something subversive going on, that 
     <lb/>
     you might wake up some morning and find a lot 
     <lb/>
     of anarchists on our hands. As far as I know, and 
     <lb/>
     I am open to correction, there is no ideology 
     <lb/>
     being taught. The money that the government is 
     <lb/>
     putting into the co-operative movement it is not 
     <lb/>
     putting into individual co-operative societies. A 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of money had been previously 
     <lb/>
     invested in land settlements' stores, but it is not 
     <lb/>
     the practice of the government today to put 
     <lb/>
     money into co-operative societies. Any money 
     <lb/>
     from now on will be on the same basis as they put 
     <lb/>
     it in cold storage companies — loaned as a deal 
     <lb/>
     with private business. This $50,000 that the 
     <lb/>
     government is spending on the enhancement of 
     <lb/>
     the co-operative movement is to organise adult 
     <lb/>
     study groups to see by what means they can help 
     <lb/>
     solve their problems and benefit themselves 
     <lb/>
     financially. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There should be no more criticism directed at 
     <lb/>
     that sort of investment than there is at primary 
     <lb/>
     schools or adult education, on which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has spent $3 million. It is purely an educa<lb break="no"/>tional expenditure. It does strike me as rather odd 
     <lb/>
     that this Convention, which has hitherto so warm<lb break="no"/>ly endorsed the investment of govemment money 
     <lb/>
     in research to develop the fisheries, etc., without 
     <lb/>
     any dissent whatever, should suddenly find itself 
     <lb/>
     balked because the government is investing 
     <lb/>
     $50,000 in the development of the most impor<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
      

     tant resource we have — the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country. That's what it amounts to. Actually at 
     <lb/>
     the moment, in the estimates of 1946-47, I don't 
     <lb/>
     believe there are quite as many people on the staff 
     <lb/>
     — not that it matters much, but we might have 
     <lb/>
     the records right. There are 16 workers and two 
     <lb/>
     stenographers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> That was only an estimate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> Perhaps if we had had more co<lb break="no"/>operative societies 50 years ago and right down 
     <lb/>
     through, certain things that happened in 1933 
     <lb/>
     might never have happened, and this Convention 
     <lb/>
     might not be meeting here today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I am quite in favour of this 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement. I believe that it is a 
     <lb/>
     world-wide movement and viewing its effect in 
     <lb/>
     other countries I believe it is in Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     stay. Whether or not the working out of these 
     <lb/>
     co-operative ideas will bring the utmost value to 
     <lb/>
     the greatest number remains to be seen, but I 
     <lb/>
     think it contains the seed of something which is 
     <lb/>
     very essential and valuable to the people. Now 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the amount spent, the way I figure 
     <lb/>
     it out it is less than 1%. Of course it looks large 
     <lb/>
     enough, $50,000, but I am of the opinion that we 
     <lb/>
     want more co-operation in this country all 
     <lb/>
     around. A year or two ago there was a firm here 
     <lb/>
     that wanted to invest about $1 million in the 
     <lb/>
     building of a powerful steamer to prosecute the 
     <lb/>
     seal fishery, and the government was asked to 
     <lb/>
     help in that matter by perhaps chartering this boat 
     <lb/>
     in the summer to go to the Labrador, quite a place 
     <lb/>
     for tourists and probably there would be a good 
     <lb/>
     many dollars come into the country if we had 
     <lb/>
     suitable boats to take people down around there. 
     <lb/>
     That proposition was turned down. Today we are 
     <lb/>
     told that around the Labrador there are probably 
     <lb/>
     200,000 seals, a very valuable asset and one of 
     <lb/>
     our natural resources. It is not easy to get to these 
     <lb/>
     seals by small auxiliary boats, they have not the 
     <lb/>
     power for one thing, except when the ice is break<lb break="no"/>ing up and they can get through it. There is a case 
     <lb/>
     where if the government had co-operated with 
     <lb/>
     that firm, and there are not many firms willing to 
     <lb/>
     put $1 million down, it would be a great benefit 
     <lb/>
     to the country. It might be possible, with co<lb break="no"/>operation in some other way, that plans like that 
     <lb/>
     could be worked out....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It appears to me that both Mr.

     movement, and I am in sympathy with it. I asked 
     <lb/>
     a direct question, and got a camouflaged answer. 
     <lb/>
     I asked whether it was consistent with the whole 
     <lb/>
     idea of the co-operative movement that it should 
     <lb/>
     obtain government assistance. 1 got no proper 
     <lb/>
     answer, and I am surprised, from two men who 
     <lb/>
     are so prominent in the co-operative movement. 
     <lb/>
     They should have said, "No, the government has 
     <lb/>
     nothing to do with it." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> What right have you got to get any 
     <lb/>
     such answer? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I asked for it. If you could not 
     <lb/>
     answerit you might have said, "I'm sorry I cannot 
     <lb/>
     answer it", but to give a camouflaged answer and 
     <lb/>
     use the word ideology, to try to cover up the 
     <lb/>
     question and not answer it properly, I don't give 
     <lb/>
     anybody much credit for that. The whole idea is 
     <lb/>
     not to get any assistance whatever from the 
     <lb/>
     government. It starts from a very small nucleus 
     <lb/>
     and builds up gradually. If you are going to get 
     <lb/>
     the government to come in and spend $50,000, 
     <lb/>
     where is it going to stop and when? If they are 
     <lb/>
     going to spend that much why should they not 
     <lb/>
     spend $500,000 or more to put it through? The 
     <lb/>
     co-operation Mr. Ashboume is speaking of is 
     <lb/>
     entirely different. We all believe in co-operation, 
     <lb/>
     but whether we all believe in the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement is another thing; but I do believe, 
     <lb/>
     according to Dr. Coacly, that it is not the way to 
     <lb/>
     get a co-operative movement going well in any 
     <lb/>
     country, to get assistance from the government or 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Grenfell or anyone else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I had thought that hitherto we made 
     <lb/>
     it plain that co-operative societies are business 
     <lb/>
     operations, and are not receiving assistance from 
     <lb/>
     the government. That is defnite, This $50,000 is 
     <lb/>
     being spent to finance adult education — those 
     <lb/>
     who go into a community and offer leadership in 
     <lb/>
     formulating study groups. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is it consistent? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> No co-operative society or anybody 
     <lb/>
     interested in the co-operative movement is ur<lb break="no"/>ging that they put any money into individual 
     <lb/>
     co-operative societies as a business venture, be<lb break="no"/>cause it is generally felt it would not be in the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of such societies. As to whether the 
     <lb/>
     government or the Grenfell Mission should 
     <lb/>
     spend money on a field service, which is educa<lb break="no"/>tion which may result in the formation of study 
     <lb/>
     clubs, that is a different question and the situation 
     <lb/>
     is this: if the government or somebody else did 
 

            <cb/>
    

     not sponsor such a movement, the probability is 
     <lb/>
     the movement would not get started. Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     referred to Dr. Coady; he is connected with the 
     <lb/>
     movement in Nova Scotia. St. Francis Xavier 
     <lb/>
     College, I understand, sent out men to organise 
     <lb/>
     study groups as part of the adult education move<lb break="no"/>ment. It was not financed by the government, but 
     <lb/>
     it was by somebody. He and all the other people 
     <lb/>
     had to eat, they had the elementary human needs, 
     <lb/>
     somebody had to pay them. The point is this: if 
     <lb/>
     in the beginning you had not had the government 
     <lb/>
     mooting the idea, then it possibly might not have 
     <lb/>
     been mooted. I agree that the sooner the co<lb break="no"/>operatives are strong enough to take over educa<lb break="no"/>tional work, the better — in some places they are 
     <lb/>
     strong enough. In the Flowers Cove area they saw 
     <lb/>
     fit to withdraw the field workers, so we are going 
     <lb/>
     to pay for it ourselves. The people dug into their 
     <lb/>
     pockets. That was only after they got a start. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever we feel ideally, we have to be practical 
     <lb/>
     and admit such assistance is necessary; but cer<lb break="no"/>tainly not when it applies to a business enterprise 
     <lb/>
     being carried on.

     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName> Up to about halfan hour ago I was 
     <lb/>
     doubtful if we were getting anywhere as far as the 
     <lb/>
     Convention is concerned; but when someone 
     <lb/>
     backs up the workingman, we are certainly on the 
     <lb/>
     road to responsibility especially when that is 
     <lb/>
     done by a Water Street merchant. I am not a 
     <lb/>
     co-operative worker, but I feel grateful to the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement for what it has done for 
     <lb/>
     Bell Island. We could not do it on our own. We 
     <lb/>
     were not educated in that manner and of course 
     <lb/>
     we had to depend on the field workers of the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative to put us on the right track. We 
     <lb/>
     instituted a credit union within our own union and 
     <lb/>
     we did it for the purpose of getting some of our 
     <lb/>
     men out of debt. and make them independent. I 
     <lb/>
     could quote a few cases of what I consider the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement did which benefited not 
     <lb/>
     only the working class but the employment class 
     <lb/>
     as well. We had a man who came to the credit 
     <lb/>
     Committee to know if it was possible to raise a 
     <lb/>
     loan. He was in debt to his merchant in the 
     <lb/>
     amount of $300. His merchant told him if he 
     <lb/>
     could pay off the amount he would give him 20% 
     <lb/>
     discount. We gave him the money and he 
     <lb/>
     received his 20% discount — $60 — and he has 
     <lb/>
     not been in debt since...

            <p>

     the co-operatives. They are not. They are spend<lb break="no"/>ing the money towards an educational movement 
     <lb/>
     which will put Newfoundland back on its feet....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I want to correct the record. A 
     <lb/>
     matter was brought out in yesterday aftemoon's 
     <lb/>
     debate on the co-operative section of the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Report. I understand the delegate from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre, a wizard on statistics, said that 
     <lb/>
     the co-operative movement began around ten 
     <lb/>
     years ago. I want to try and show that is incorrect. 
     <lb/>
     Some 15 or 16 years ago, a co-operative move<lb break="no"/>ment originated or was in operation in the town 
     <lb/>
     of Carbonear. It had a membership of some 40 
     <lb/>
     people, a cross-section of merchants, labour. 
     <lb/>
     politicians and everything in the town. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know of any member who favoured confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Was that the poultry association? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You were president? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I did not say that. Fifteen or 16 
     <lb/>
     years ago a co-operative was in operation in 
     <lb/>
     Carbonear, representing all denominations, 
     <lb/>
     labour and industry and all shades of political 
     <lb/>
     beliefs (except confederation); it operated until 
     <lb/>
     the younger members could not give it the time 
     <lb/>
     involved, when it was agreed to close up and 
     <lb/>
     distribute the assets to the people. During the time 
     <lb/>
     it was in operation members competed in public 
     <lb/>
     exhibitions in St. John's and won many cups and 
     <lb/>
     prizes. These souvenirs are still held in the homes 
     <lb/>
     of the winners. This co-operative society did not 
     <lb/>
     have the privilege of radio propaganda or special 
     <lb/>
     advice, yet it earned and paid dividends and gave 
     <lb/>
     the people a nest-egg until disbanded. I believe 
     <lb/>
     Canon Rusted will bear me out, and also Father 
     <lb/>
     Coady of Tors Cove, through whose efforts we 
     <lb/>
     were able to obtain a pedigreed Jersey bull, the 
     <lb/>
     offspring from which is around the settlement of 
     <lb/>
     Carbonear and until this day is producing butter<lb break="no"/>fat and milk of a quality second to none 
     <lb/>
     anywhere, and this was in keeping with the 
     <lb/>
     quality of fresh eggs known so well all over the 
     <lb/>
     place. From this you may believe that the co<lb break="no"/>operative movement was in being before the time 
     <lb/>
     of Commission government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> ....When we find the net price 
     <lb/>
     derived by the fishermen from sales to co-opera<lb break="no"/>tives is two to three times the price paid by the 


            <cb/>
         

     local buyers, that in itself proves the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement must be doing a wonderful job or else 
     <lb/>
     local buyers are falling down on the job.... I know 
     <lb/>
     the co-operatives on the west coast boosted the 
     <lb/>
     lobster fishery. Sweden is a 100% co-operative 
     <lb/>
     country; every phase of the industry in that 
     <lb/>
     country is co-operative, even the government. 
     <lb/>
     They get government assistance. Sweden is the 
     <lb/>
     most solvent and successful country in the world. 
     <lb/>
     If by spending government funds we can promote 
     <lb/>
     any such idea that might come near anything in 
     <lb/>
     Sweden we should do it by all means.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I am anxious not to create false 
     <lb/>
     impressions. I would like to refer again to the 
     <lb/>
     figures — I hope nobody will get the impression 
     <lb/>
     that, because there is such a discrepancy in prices 
     <lb/>
     paid by local buyers and by co-operatives, local 
     <lb/>
     buyers are deliberately holding down the prices. 
     <lb/>
     I think the local merchants were paying as big a 
     <lb/>
     price as they could pay. This is important in the 
     <lb/>
     point of view of the fisheries.... With reference to 
     <lb/>
     competition, I remarked there was one or two 
     <lb/>
     firms which paid as much as 26 cents or 27 cents 
     <lb/>
     this year. Ever since the co-operative movement 
     <lb/>
     has gotten strong enough to have fairly large 
     <lb/>
     quantities of salmon on the market, there have 
     <lb/>
     been chartered boats to do it. It has been common 
     <lb/>
     practice for local dealers collecting certain 
     <lb/>
     amounts of salmon to get space on boats 
     <lb/>
     chartered by the co-operative society, and to 
     <lb/>
     enable them to pay practically the same prices as 
     <lb/>
     co-operatives. Most of the businessmen say they 
     <lb/>
     feel it is a good thing if the earnings of the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen can be increased, then the business<lb break="no"/>man has a chance of getting his bills paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROBE2">Mr. Roberts</persName> I would like to say a word or two 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the co-operative movement on the 
     <lb/>
     northwest coast. with regard to the lobster 
     <lb/>
     fishery. I am not a co-operative man, neither am 
     <lb/>
     I a fisherman, but living in the midst of the 
     <lb/>
     co-operatives, we are all more or less connected 
     <lb/>
     with it. Mr. Ashbourne was wondering if exten<lb break="no"/>sive fishery would deplete fish. It can, especially 
     <lb/>
     in regard to lobsters. Fifty years ago lobsters were 
     <lb/>
     a nuisance, a pest, no one knew about canning 
     <lb/>
     lobsters. Their only use was for fish bait. Finally 
     <lb/>
     some Canadian who knew the northwest coast 
     <lb/>
     came down and packed those lobsters. The best 
     <lb/>
     price paid was 50 cents for 100 lobsters, regard<lb break="no"/>less of what size they were. Today they are paid 
     <lb/>
     practically 50 cents each. In 1920 the government 


            <pb n="416" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-28_Page_0416.jpg"/>

     had to put on a closed season to protect the 
     <lb/>
     fishery. After the season was opened they found, 
     <lb/>
     after four or five years, the same thing was hap<lb break="no"/>pening. They were tinning lobsters and some of 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen were not altogether honest. They 
     <lb/>
     packed small lobsters and female spawn lobsters, 
     <lb/>
     which should have been left there. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment were considering another closed season 
     <lb/>
     when another Canadian firm came on the coast 
     <lb/>
     buying these lobsters fresh. They were not a large 
     <lb/>
     concern. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Buying live lobsters? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROBE2">Mr. Roberts</persName> Yes. They paid pretty nearly what 
     <lb/>
     the people were getting for tinned. Then 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Packers came in, they opened branches 
     <lb/>
     at Lark Harbour and Bonne Bay and after a 
     <lb/>
     couple of years, the co-operative business was 
     <lb/>
     introduced by the government. The field workers 
     <lb/>
     showed the people where they could double their 
     <lb/>
     earnings by getting the lobster to market and 
     <lb/>
     cutting out the middle men. The first year the 
     <lb/>
     co-operatives sold lobsters, they got 20 cents; the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Packers paying 10 cents. They had a lot 
     <lb/>
     of expense. The co-operatives began to grow and 
     <lb/>
     in three years the whole coast had gone co-opera<lb break="no"/>tive. Maritime Packers still held their plant at 
     <lb/>
     Lark Harbour and were not a branch of the 
     <lb/>
     society. Last year they paid 14 cents to 17 cents; 
     <lb/>
     average 16 cents a pound. The co-operative 
     <lb/>
     society at Rocky Harbour and Bonne Bay 
     <lb/>
     averaged after all expenses paid, or loss to the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, 35 cents a pound. There is a great 
     <lb/>
     spread between 17 cents and 35 cents a pound. It 
     <lb/>
     means the fishermen are doubling their wages. It 
     <lb/>
     does not mean they are banking this money — 
     <lb/>
     they have more to spend and their standard of 
     <lb/>
     living is higher. Another good thing is this — it 
     <lb/>
     has centralised the industry. The co-operative 
     <lb/>
     officials or inspectors, when a boat comes in, go 
     <lb/>
     through the catch and the small lobsters and 
     <lb/>
     spawning lobsters are thrown overboard. They 
     <lb/>
     cannot be sold. Instead of the industry decreas<lb break="no"/>ing, it is increasing every year.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> ....I am quite in accord with the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement. I think it is a good thing, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not think it is a question of government. 
     <lb/>
     I am not very familiar with the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement, but I do happen to know a little about 
     <lb/>
     it and I am in accord with the fundamentals 
     <lb/>
     behind the movement. I know for a fact in some 
     <lb/>
     cases in this country what the co-operative move<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
           
ment has done. People have come into com<lb break="no"/>munities where there are three or four big mer<lb break="no"/>chants, with this idea — that they will close every 
     <lb/>
     business house in the community. I don't think 
     <lb/>
     that's co-operation.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, I believe in the co- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     operative movement, and l think it was in the 
     <lb/>
     north where the first co-operative movement 
     <lb/>
     started in this country. I am sure it was a good 
     <lb/>
     thing, but unfortunately transportation was one 
     <lb/>
     of the reasons that it was killed. I don't know 
     <lb/>
     whether Rev. Burry is conversant with the way 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador coast was, back in the years when 
     <lb/>
     even if you had money you could not buy any<lb break="no"/>thing. Everybody that came along with a pedlar's 
     <lb/>
     pack went out of it with the packjust as heavy as 
     <lb/>
     when they came in. There was no limit to what 
     <lb/>
     they had to sell and the people could not afford 
     <lb/>
     it. Dr. Grenfell put in ten stores. The people were 
     <lb/>
     up against it, but the stores carried on until 1928 
     <lb/>
     anyway, I don't know if they are still in operation 
     <lb/>
     now, but I believe if they had had the right system 
     <lb/>
     the people would have benefitted a lot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question was put here yesterday, "Was 
     <lb/>
     the government behind the co-operative move 
     <lb/>
     ment"? Absolutely, I am sure ofthat, but an awful 
     <lb/>
     long way behind. I don't know whether the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this Convention believe that 
     <lb/>
     the co—operative movement is a long time over<lb break="no"/>due in this country, but I certainly do. I don't see 
     <lb/>
     why we have to be at the beck and call of some<lb break="no"/>body else when we can get together and produce, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe the day will come when New<lb break="no"/>foundland is going to come to the top, and every 
     <lb/>
     man that is interested will be able to market what 
     <lb/>
     he produces. I came in here in 1939 from a district 
     <lb/>
     that was suffering, and on the way home I met a 
     <lb/>
     bunch of lads and lasses between Winterton and 
     <lb/>
     Ham's Harbour and l was wondering if I could 
     <lb/>
     get a lift home. I asked who they were and they 
     <lb/>
     said they were the co-operative workers. I said 
     <lb/>
     the government needed to get the people inter<lb break="no"/>ested in co-operation. I believe the government 
     <lb/>
     would have done a lot in those days with a clear, 
     <lb/>
     sane policy, when they had to give out the money 
     <lb/>
     to the people. There was not a village in New<lb break="no"/>foundland that did not have a percentage of 
     <lb/>
     people on the dole. They could have taken a truck 
     <lb/>
     and gone to some central place and bought the 
     <lb/>
     food and divided it among themselves instead of 
     <lb/>
     buying from the retailer. You would have had the

     germ of the whole co-operative movement, and I 
     <lb/>
     don't believe that you would have to spend 
     <lb/>
     $50,000 a year today on field workers. That's 
     <lb/>
     why I said the government was a long way behind 
     <lb/>
     co-operation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I don't need to rise to support the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative movement, it has a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     support throughout the country and in this Con<lb break="no"/>vention. I rise to support the idea that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should give some support to this movement 
     <lb/>
     as it has been doing in the past by educating the 
     <lb/>
     people to get into this thing as their own.... Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bailey spoke of the co-operative movement in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. As we all know Sir Wilfred Grenfell 
     <lb/>
     started it and it failed, and now it has been taken 
     <lb/>
     over by the co-operative movement and they are 
     <lb/>
     doing a great job of it. I hope that the government 
     <lb/>
     of the future will support this movement...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> I notice the number of cases that 
     <lb/>
     came from Notre Dame Bay — 3,648 cases, 
     <lb/>
     which averaged around $45 a case. Part of Notre 
     <lb/>
     Dame Bay happens to be in my district and I 
     <lb/>
     certainly would like to see the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement down there if they would bring in 32 
     <lb/>
     cents a pound to the fishermen for their lobster. 
     <lb/>
     If the lobster caught in Notre Dame Bay last year 
     <lb/>
     was sold for 32 cents a pound, that would have 
     <lb/>
     netted them $70,000 more than they got. I believe 
     <lb/>
     every member will agree that the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement is a benefit to the fishermen.

     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> Before we pass on I should like to 
     <lb/>
     say that I am simply amazed at the enthusiasm 
     <lb/>
     which the co-operative movement has been given 
     <lb/>
     by individual members of this Convention. One 
     <lb/>
     point I would like to clear up is about the govern<lb break="no"/>ment putting money into it. The best means of 
     <lb/>
     deciding whether or not the government was 
     <lb/>
     justified in conducting co-operative educational 
     <lb/>
     policy would be to examine the result which that 
     <lb/>
     policy has achieved. I feel that since the co-opera<lb break="no"/>tive division has been in existence only some ten 
     <lb/>
     years, and viewing the situation that we had to 
     <lb/>
     begin with, the individualistic attitude of the 
     <lb/>
     average Newfoundland fisherman, the suspicion 
     <lb/>
     of anything new which we all have, I think that 
     <lb/>
     the results achieved by this annual expenditure 
     <lb/>
     have been nothing short of amazing. I can say that 
     <lb/>
     because none of that money is being spent on my 
     <lb/>
     salary! What I intended to draw the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention to was another point in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the co-operative movement that has not 
    

            <cb/>
          

     been brought out. We have seen how the earnings 
     <lb/>
     of fishermen have been enhanced, and even in the 
     <lb/>
     St. Anthony area in one year the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     society paid out $45,000 in cold cash for salmon, 
     <lb/>
     plus whatever it paid out for boxes, etc. If that 
     <lb/>
     salmon had been sold locally it would have 
     <lb/>
     fetched $18,000. In other words there was a 
     <lb/>
     $27,000 increase over the local price. When you 
     <lb/>
     add up all these amounts it must seem obvious 
     <lb/>
     that purely on the dollar advantage the $50,000 
     <lb/>
     which the government is spending annually, and 
     <lb/>
     which seems to be causing some delegates con<lb break="no"/>cern, is money well spent. And then too I am 
     <lb/>
     interested in the educational value of a movement 
     <lb/>
     of this kind, in fact any movement that has an 
     <lb/>
     educational value. Two or three days ago when 
     <lb/>
     we were on another section of this report we read 
     <lb/>
     that the Fisheries Committee endorsed the idea 
     <lb/>
     that we should try to put the Newfoundland salt 
     <lb/>
     codfishery on a cash basis, and there was a good 
     <lb/>
     deal said on the advantage of cash trading over 
     <lb/>
     credit taking. I have before me the annual report 
     <lb/>
     of the Registrar of the Co-operative Societies, 
     <lb/>
     Dec. 31, 1945, and the co-operative credit 
     <lb/>
     societies, which are small community banks, 
     <lb/>
     have loaned to their members $834,667, and if 
     <lb/>
     you look at what has been done in l946 in loans, 
     <lb/>
     because the amount is increasing every year, 
     <lb/>
     among these 60 or 70 credit unions, the amount 
     <lb/>
     must be well over $1 million at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     loans that have been made by the people them<lb break="no"/>selves. I might also point out that the number of 
     <lb/>
     loans overdue is less than 1% of the total amount 
     <lb/>
     loaned. The point I am trying to make is this: we 
     <lb/>
     come in here and talk about the desirability of 
     <lb/>
     going on a cash trading basis, and here is a group 
     <lb/>
     of organisations that have a plan for putting that 
     <lb/>
     idea into effect. I don't mean to suggest that that 
     <lb/>
     million dollar loan business was all to fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     but a great proportion of it was loans to fisher<lb break="no"/>men, and I have myself seen fishermen borrow<lb break="no"/>ing cash from credit unions to buy motor engines, 
     <lb/>
     fisheries supplies, etc., and very often patronising 
     <lb/>
     the local merchant with that cash.... The total 
     <lb/>
     number of members in those societies in 1945 
     <lb/>
     was 4,640, which is only a small proportion ofthe 
     <lb/>
     people. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I am in favour of the co-operative 
     <lb/>
     movement, but we have spent one and a half 
     <lb/>
     hours discussing it, and I think it is time we went 
     <lb/>
     on to other things.

     regard to remarks of a general character on the

     <lb/>for Repairing...." I understood an arrangement 
     <lb/>was made some years ago about that. I wonder if 
     <lb/>the Committee could tell us, is that practice now 
     <lb/>discontinued? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think we shall ask Mr. Ashbourne if

     he could tell us that.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> It had been the practice of the 
     <lb/>
     government to pay a bounty for repairing vessels. 
     <lb/>
     It was discontinued. I am afraid I cannot read the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the Commission of Government as to 
     <lb/>
     why this should be discontinued. I do remember 
     <lb/>
     one enquiry was made as to whether a bounty was 
     <lb/>
     payable or not, and it was remarked that the 
     <lb/>
     bounty was not payable at the time. Coupled with 
     <lb/>
     that was some remark about the matter of inspec<lb break="no"/>tion, as to whether or not it might not be abused. 
     <lb/>
     That depends entirely upon the inspector himself, 
     <lb/>
     and I see no reason why, if the system could be 
     <lb/>
     abused by some who wanted to affect sham 
     <lb/>
     repairs, the person who wanted to effect any 
     <lb/>
     repairs should suffer. I am in accord with the 
  

            <cb/>
  

     suggestion and I believe there are vessels along 
     <lb/>
     the coast that could be repaired. It has been done 
     <lb/>
     in the past. With the exception of that excuse I do 
     <lb/>
     not know of any other reason why the matter was

     dropped.

            <p>
     While I am on my feet I would like to reply to 
     <lb/>
     a question asked by Mr. Hollett as to the quantity 
     <lb/>
     of Merchantable fish shipped out of this country 
     <lb/>
     last year, and if any of it was classed as such. I 
     <lb/>
     went to the Fisheries Board this morning and I 
     <lb/>
     give you the official figures:<ref target="#fn_07">*</ref>

     from calling at several ports and taking away 
     <lb/>
     cargo belonging to Newfoundland coastal boats 
     <lb/>
     or vessels. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Does that mean our own vessels?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> The answer I got was that we must 
     <lb/>
     "christen our own baby first." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> I am not quite clear on this. 
     <lb/>
     "....but the extremely heavy expense of managing 
     <lb/>
     steamers and vessels in Newfoundland as com<lb break="no"/>pared with other countries is a serious detriment." 
     <lb/>
     Where is the extremely heavy expense in operat<lb break="no"/>ing local ships? I do not mean ships running 
     <lb/>
     around the coast. I am talking about 10,000 ton 
     <lb/>
    ships. One reason why we should have our own ' 
     <lb/>ships is dial there is considerable money paid out 
     <lb/>to foreign ships which money goes out from this 
     <lb/>country and does not come back.... Is it not pos<lb break="no"/>sible to arrange some way to have our own ships 
     <lb/>carry that freight? They could handle some or a 
     <lb/>large percentage of it. It incurs a great deal of 
     <lb/>initial expense to build a ship, I know, and 
     <lb/>whether the extra amount of freight would cor<lb break="no"/>respond to the increased cost, I am not prepared 
     <lb/>to say.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> In reply to that, there is a very consid<lb break="no"/>erable portion of the outfits of ships that have to 
     <lb/>
     be purchased here and it is more costly here. 
     <lb/>
     Again, repairs cost very much more here than in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. One of the competitions we have had in 
     <lb/>
     the past has been Norweigan competition. These 
     <lb/>
     Norweigan ships have been getting cheaper 
     <lb/>
     provisions than us. I expect they also have been 
     <lb/>
     getting lower wages; also they are subsidised. We 
     <lb/>
     are up against all these. The only thing to do 
     <lb/>
     would be to make sure we got all our expenses 
     <lb/>
     down to the finest point. You will remember in 
     <lb/>
     the sealfishery report, in the case of coal, they 
     <lb/>
     charged duty on it although it never left the ship. 
     <lb/>
     They all count up in the expenses of running a 
     <lb/>
     ship. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> I am talking about ships to 
     <lb/>
     handle imports and exports, ships of from 5,000 
     <lb/>
     to 10,000 tons, ships to carry paper and iron ore. 
     <lb/>
     If these ships were owned in Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     employed on foreign trade, it is not necessary for 
     <lb/>
     them to buy their supplies in St. John's.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> ....I am speaking of something I 
     <lb/>
     know a little about. I was on a ship sailing out of 


            <cb/>
           

     here some years ago, and we bought very little. I 
     <lb/>
     was an engineer, and except when we were ab<lb break="no"/>solutely stuck we never got goods in St. John's. I 
     <lb/>
     don't suppose we get $20 worth of supplies here, 
     <lb/>
     because we were going to ports where there was 
     <lb/>
     no duty to pay. That is the point I am raising with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the heavy expenditures on materials 
     <lb/>
     bought here in St. John's. These ships don't need 
     <lb/>
     to buy here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> They have to buy some. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Very little unless they are stuck, 
     <lb/>
     and then they buy just enough to take them to 
     <lb/>
     Sydney. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think my own experience has been 
     <lb/>
     that we have to buy quite a large portion of our 
     <lb/>
     stuff in St. John's. I am speaking now of running 
     <lb/>
     a steamer like the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ungava</hi><ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref>. We have a very 
     <lb/>
     heavy expense here and pay quite a lot for duty, 
     <lb/>
     for such things as rope and all that sort of stuff. 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't know why we 
     <lb/>have no merchant marine.... I know if a country 
     <lb/>like Greece, which has practically no import or 
     <lb/>export trade, could become the fourth largest 
     <lb/>tramp tonnage in the world at the outbreak of this 
     <lb/>war, and whose only assets were the seamen they 
     <lb/>could put to work, we should be able to do the 
     <lb/>same, because I know what our seamen can do. I 
     <lb/>should not say this perhaps, but I am forced to. I 
     <lb/>was not satisfied with our Transportation Report, 
     <lb/>and I went back quietly to find what the trouble 
     <lb/>was. I found out that the little <hi rendition="simple:italic">Kyle</hi><ref target="#fn_09">[2]</ref> takes 25 tons 
     <lb/>of coal daily to operate it. The ship I was on, the 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Halcyon</hi> which was 26,000 tons, used to take 10 
     <lb/>tons daily, but I don't know the tonnage of the 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Kyle</hi>. Now I believe the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ungava</hi> is around 25,000 
     <lb/>tons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> No, from 18 to 22,000 tons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Now as regards the loss to this 
     <lb/>
     country in having other vessels coming in here 
     <lb/>
     and taking freight out of it, while good men are 
     <lb/>
     walking around on the dole, it is considerable. If 
     <lb/>
     you remember there was a time when there was 
     <lb/>
     hardly a Newfoundland seaman, master, mate or 
     <lb/>
     anything around because we had foreign owners 
     <lb/>
     down here getting men to man their ships. I can't 
     <lb/>
     see for the life of me why it costs ships more to 
     <lb/>
     operate in this country than anywhere else, be<lb break="no"/>cause I know that when you are sailing foreign 
     <lb/>
     you can buy in the cheapest markets in the world

     and put in your stores.... It seems to me there is 
     <lb/>
     something lacking. Our men get no more money 
     <lb/>
     than the Norwegians and the Greeks. They get 
     <lb/>
     $120 a month. lean assure you there is no place 
     <lb/>
     in the world where wages are so small as in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland today. We never got more than 
     <lb/>
     $50 a month and often $30. I never got $30 on a 
     <lb/>
     Norwegian ship and I am sure they are as good 
     <lb/>
     as ours are. I am not satisfied with the answer 
     <lb/>
     given as to why we have not got a merchant 
     <lb/>
     marine. I think it is because there is an easier way 
     <lb/>
     to get money than to worry about where your 
     <lb/>
     ships are, and what they are doing, and where 
     <lb/>
     they are going to find freights. That's the trouble 
     <lb/>
     today.... You take the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Prospero</hi> and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Portia</hi>,<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     they are still running, but they should have been 
     <lb/>
     diesel 25 years ago. These ships were repaired 
     <lb/>
     after they left here and I can't see why they could 
     <lb/>
     not have carried on to a ripe old age. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Kyle</hi> 
     <lb/>
     could have been turned to oil too, and when you 
     <lb/>
     look at the money that's spent every year in the 
     <lb/>
     coastal service of this country you can see that 
     <lb/>
     those ships are too costly to operate, and the same 
     <lb/>
     thing applies to everything. I would not be 
     <lb/>
     surprised that if Scandinavian or British owners 
     <lb/>
     came to Newfoundland they would make those 
     <lb/>
     ships pay, because in the first place you have got 
     <lb/>
     the men — 460 men today are under register up 
     <lb/>
     at the railway office waiting for jobs. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     it's a disgrace that our country has got into this 
     <lb/>
     place when you take the place we were in 60 or 
     <lb/>
     80 years ago. We could have operated in the bad 
     <lb/>
     times for $20 and $25 a month and a lot of men 
     <lb/>
     would have been glad to get jobs, in fact I know 
     <lb/>
     men who signed on for $15 a month to get jobs. 
     <lb/>
     I can't see why we pay more, and get more 
     <lb/>
     overtime. I believe something should be done in 
     <lb/>
     this line.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Speaking of the mercantile marine, 
     <lb/>
     it is no use to have a mercantile marine unless we 
     <lb/>
     have something to put in the bottom, so to speak. 
     <lb/>
     Those figures that Mr. Ashboume has been so 
     <lb/>
     kind as to produce show that in 1945 we could 
     <lb/>
     apparently ship less than 2% of our fish as mer<lb break="no"/>chantable. What has happened? Did the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee find out the cause? Is it possible that our 
     <lb/>
     people can't make Merchantable fish? I can 
     <lb/>
     believe now that the man who wrote that letter to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood was real and his figures were 
     <lb/>
     real. What happened? Did you, Mr. Job, and your 
    

            <cb/>
           

     Committee try to find out the trouble? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> We think the standard has no doubt 
     <lb/>
     been raised in recent years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You can't raise the standard of Mer<lb break="no"/>chantable fish, can you? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I will tell you an experiment we made. 
     <lb/>
     We got an amount of fish and had it successively 
     <lb/>
     culled by five different cullers and there was a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous difference each time. The difference 
     <lb/>
     between a Merchantable fish and a Madeira fish 
     <lb/>
     is very slight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I don't believe the figures. There is 
     <lb/>
     something wrong. I think the Committee should 
     <lb/>
     have taken pains to find out what is wrong with 
     <lb/>
    it. If nothing is wrong, let's cut it out altogether 
     <lb/>and sell Madeira only. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> In my opinion what is wrong is that 
     <lb/>
     years ago we always had our fish graded as 
     <lb/>
     merchantable, Madeira or West India. The 
     <lb/>
     people tried to get merchantable, which was the 
     <lb/>
     best price, but the past two years our fish has been 
     <lb/>
     graded as merchantable, Madeira, Thirds and 
     <lb/>
     West Indies. Thirds and West Indies are actually 
     <lb/>
     the same, but they have been receiving the same 
     <lb/>
     price for it as Madeira, Thirds and Madeira being 
     <lb/>
     the one price. They are not encouraged to make 
     <lb/>
     Madeira fish. If we had only three prices they 
     <lb/>
     would be encouraged to make good fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> They are encouraged to make mer<lb break="no"/>chantable by the difference in price, but they 
     <lb/>
     can't do it apparently. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I raised that matter in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, and I am wondering now about this 2% of 
     <lb/>
     all the codfish exported which is classified as 
     <lb/>
     merchantable. Is that the only word that is used? 
     <lb/>
     Is some merchantable fish exported from the 
     <lb/>
     country under some other name?.... Frankly I 
     <lb/>
     don't believe that only 2% of the fish exported is 
     <lb/>
     Merchantable. I don't believe it, and I am not 
     <lb/>
     going to believe the Fisheries Board or the Cus<lb break="no"/>toms or the Chairman of the Fisheries Committee 
     <lb/>
     or anyone else. I just don't believe it. There is a 
     <lb/>
     catch somewhere. Does it go out under some 
     <lb/>
     other name, and if so what is that name? For 
     <lb/>
     instance take shore fish, which is one quality of 
     <lb/>
     fish that I know something about, and that 
     <lb/>
     Spanish shore fish, I have seen it packed — 
     <lb/>
     hundreds upon hundreds of quintals, in Bonavis<lb break="no"/>ta, English Harbour, up the shore from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     in Elliston — beautiful fish, as they say in

     Bonavista, just like cheese. I know that is shipped 
     <lb/>
     out under many names, and I doubt if the word 
     <lb/>
     Merchantable is used. There is choice, prime and 
     <lb/>
     other grades, but I don't remember the word 
     <lb/>
     Merchantable being used, but a lot of it was 
     <lb/>
     Merchantable. Then again Madeira. Is it shipped 
     <lb/>
     out as Madeira? Under what names and grades is 
     <lb/>
     that fish shipped out? The mere fact that there is 
     <lb/>
     some technical classification of only 2% mer<lb break="no"/>chantable makes me believe that there is some 
     <lb/>
     other name. Now somebody knows we are going 
     <lb/>
     to get at the bottom of that and lift the lid off.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Mr. Smallwood makes some very 
     <lb/>bad statements at times. Apparently he does not 
     <lb/>want to believe anyone. It does not sound logical 
     <lb/>or responsible for a man not to believe in any<lb break="no"/>thing. With regard to Merchantable fish, the 
     <lb/>grades have changed in the past few years, and I 
     <lb/>believe the figures are possibly correct. Speaking 
     <lb/>for our own firm we have not exported a mer<lb break="no"/>chantable fish for five years, or bought one for 
     <lb/>that matter, for that period. The fish in this 
     <lb/>country is not as good as it was ten or 15 years 
     <lb/>ago. Whether it is the fault of the curing or what

            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I will take a crack at it. Merchant<lb break="no"/>able, Madeira, Thirds, tom cods, West India and

     <lb/>you can go down on my premises any time when

            <cb/>
       

     Madeira, West Indies and tom cods, not Thirds. 
     <lb/>
     Thirds is an export grade, which means that when 
     <lb/>
     the fish is culled at the exporting premises there 
     <lb/>
     are certain fish which are graded as Thirds. There

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> ....This report deals with what is in 
     <lb/>
     all probability the most important debate to be 
     <lb/>
     discussed in this chamber. I do not see the urgen<lb break="no"/>cy to railroad it through, it concerns more than 
     <lb/>
     60% of our people. On Tuesday, fishermen north, 
     <lb/>
     south, east and west listened with great interest 
     <lb/>
     to something that appeared to be in the nature of 
     <lb/>
     an accusation, a firm or firms receiving an overall 
     <lb/>
     commission on every quintal of saltfish shipped 
     <lb/>
     out of this country, Tonight they may have some 
     <lb/>
     misgivings when they hear of agents, commis<lb break="no"/>sion merchants, brokers, trade representatives, 
     <lb/>
     and sundry others, all getting some cut from what 
     <lb/>
     they, who go down to the sea in ships, can extract 
     <lb/>
     but a very poor living. I am not quite content with 
     <lb/>
     the chairman's explanation that in his opinion 
     <lb/>
     this is justified. The whole economy of our 
     <lb/>
     country revolves around our fisheries, and I am 
     <lb/>
     surprised that so many delegates have not shown 
     <lb/>
     a greater interest in this debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not know what phase of our fisheries 
     <lb/>
     should get top priority, I would say that one is so 
     <lb/>
     dependent on the other. Mr. Crosbie specialises 
     <lb/>
     in fresh codfish products, in this he is joined by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. lob, whose firm also figures largely in the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. But just for purposes of comparison, I 
     <lb/>
     would point out that in the last fishing season, 
     <lb/>
     1946, the value of the salt cod expert was more 
     <lb/>
     than three times the export value of fresh and 
     <lb/>
     frozen cod products. If, as Mr. Smallwood with 
     <lb/>
     his pessimistic outlook on this phase of the in<lb break="no"/>dustry suggests, or Mr. Crosbie with his "catch 
     <lb/>
     herring" policy points out, if this means curtains 
     <lb/>
     for everything but the fresh products and herring, 
     <lb/>
     then it devolves upon us to be up and doing 
     <lb/>
     something about the reconversion of the salt cod; 
     <lb/>
     and reconversion to the fresh and refrigeration

     means a very costly investment.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Bonavista North there are around 70 
     <lb/>
     schooners and some 1,500 inshore fishermen. 
     <lb/>
     Very little of the expensive Labrador outfits can 
     <lb/>
     be of any use for fresh fish. Schooners will have 
     <lb/>
     to be refrigerated, plants must be built and I 
     <lb/>
     would remind the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     here that in all Bonavista North and Centre there 
     <lb/>
     is no freezing plant. There is a bait depot at 
     <lb/>
     Greenspond, so when the salt cod goes, some<lb break="no"/>thing must be done at once to give those displaced 
     <lb/>
     fishermen a chance to cam a living. Their present 
     <lb/>
     fishing equipment for the greater part, I refer to 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador outfits, will be considered obsolete 
     <lb/>
     and scrapped.... I believe in our fisheries and I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to wager that in the future we will stand 
     <lb/>
     or fall not by farming, not by forestry, not by 
     <lb/>
     mining, but by our fisheries, and that only.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I entirely agree with Mr. Crosbie that the 
     <lb/>
     figure of $24 million is very conservative and I 
     <lb/>
     certainly do not visualise it falling below that for 
     <lb/>
     many years. Your Committee suggests a wider 
     <lb/>
     diversification of this important industry, with 
     <lb/>
     emphasis laid on the fresh and frozen fish 
     <lb/>
     markets; that there are tremendous possibilities 
     <lb/>
     in our herring fisheries no one doubts, and that it 
     <lb/>
     is fast becoming a major branch of the trade is 
     <lb/>
     certain. Yet can the herring fishery, centralised 
     <lb/>
     as it already is, and restricted to certain specific 
     <lb/>
     areas in the island, absorb a part of the many men, 
     <lb/>
     who when the salt cod markets go, will of neces<lb break="no"/>sity be seeking other sources of employment? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hanging over every phase of our fisheries 
     <lb/>
     must ever be factors beyond our control, such as 
     <lb/>
     our utter dependence on the economy of foreign 
     <lb/>
     countries to purchase our products, and our ab<lb break="no"/>solute lack of internal markets. Coupled with that 
     <lb/>
     are the uncertainties of our fisheries; even this 
     <lb/>
     year the failure of the Labrador schooners to 
     <lb/>
     secure the elusive cod may seriously affect the 
     <lb/>
     getting of good fishermen to follow that calling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With the subsidiary fisheries I shall deal but 
     <lb/>
     briefly. The once proud industry of our hardy 
     <lb/>
     sealers has dwindled to a shadow of its former 
     <lb/>
     self. Of the minor industries, salmon and lobster 
     <lb/>
     figure prominently, both seem to be firmly estab<lb break="no"/>lished in the continental market, and the future 
     <lb/>
     seems bright. The revival of the whaling industry 
     <lb/>
     and its impact upon the economy is something 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders must have greeted with much 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction. The liberal wages paid by the operat<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
      

     ing firms is very commendable.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Fisheries Board costs the fishermen of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland exactly $225,000. I agree that 
     <lb/>
     department has justified its existence. But noth<lb break="no"/>ing is altogether perfect and there is still much 
     <lb/>
     room for improvement. There are discrepancies 
     <lb/>
     in our culling system, in our inspection person<lb break="no"/>nel. This must be corrected; codfish, salmon. 
     <lb/>
     lobster, should be firmly rejected if it does not 
     <lb/>
     meet the requirements. Inspectors should be fair 
     <lb/>
     and fearless and ensure a good article for export 
     <lb/>
     which will automatically ensure our retention of 
     <lb/>
     good markets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The idea of the 25-ton powered boat for late 
     <lb/>
     inshore fishing is sound and. unlike carrying out 
     <lb/>
     ice in small boats in July and August, is prac<lb break="no"/>ticable. The best thing in this report is this 
     <lb/>
     centralisation idea, the objective for which we 
     <lb/>
     should constantly strive. This must come with the 
     <lb/>
     reconversion of our fisheries, and the opening up 
     <lb/>
     of our communications, so that when Mr. Crosbie 
     <lb/>
     starts his processing plant at Wesleyville or Hare 
     <lb/>
     Bay in my district, fast trucks will speed up from 
     <lb/>
     Musgrave Harbour and Lumsden with the fish 
     <lb/>
     fresh from the boat. A centralised curing and 
     <lb/>
     processing plant situated in Bonavista Bay could 
     <lb/>
     serve 50 miles of fishing coast if the plant could 
     <lb/>
     absorb all the catch.... Our fisheries are the vital 
     <lb/>
     life blood of our nation; we need more men of 
     <lb/>
     vision, men of a gambling spirit, men who will 
     <lb/>
     seek out and exploit every last chance to utilise 
     <lb/>
     to the last ounce our fishery products and by<lb break="no"/>products. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not want to be accused of self-serving 
     <lb/>
     localism but I cannot refrain from saying that if 
     <lb/>
     there are two districts where the opening up of 
     <lb/>
     communications is of vital importance to the 
     <lb/>
     future prosecution of the fisheries, they are the 
     <lb/>
     districts of Bonavista North and Centre. Every 
     <lb/>
     settlement from Hare Bay to Musgrave Harbour, 
     <lb/>
     a distance of 60 miles, is a fishing settlement, and 
     <lb/>
     with the advent of the mechanisation and moder<lb break="no"/>nising of the industry, and centralisation, roads 
     <lb/>
     must be built. Like Mr. Hollett, who yesterday 
     <lb/>
     fearlessly demonstrated that he was not a native 
     <lb/>
     of Burin, nor of Grand Falls, but of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, I am unable to endorse the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that there is sufficient justification for the expen<lb break="no"/>diture of $1.5 million in a certain specified area 
     <lb/>
     on the pretense that it is vitally necessary to the 
     <lb/>
     industry there, while 150 men, women, and

     children of fishing stock waddle through mud in 
     <lb/>
     another district, and have not the wherewithal to 
     <lb/>
     improve their methods of catching or curing the 
     <lb/>
     same product.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The social security scheme, so ably discussed 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Hillier yesterday, deserves more than 
     <lb/>
     passing comment. Our fishermen from now on 
     <lb/>
     will be watching with great eagerness the ac<lb break="no"/>tivities of our energetic Board of Trade now 
     <lb/>
     actually studying that question. Here's where the 
     <lb/>
     words of vital importance get their fullest mean<lb break="no"/>ing. Of the co-operatives I will say no more than 
     <lb/>
     to intimate to Messrs. Newell and Keough, that 
     <lb/>
     they can count Bonavista North as a sympathetic 
     <lb/>
     supporter of the club which threw the bouquets 
     <lb/>
     at their organisation yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I am wondering where that information 
     <lb/>
     came from that the road is going to cost $1.5 
     <lb/>
     million? I did not get on my feet to refer to that, 
     <lb/>
     but rather to a statement made by the member 
     <lb/>
     from Bonavista Centre who yesterday said that a 
     <lb/>
     little bird gave him some information. I want to 
     <lb/>
     make clear to the delegates that it was a very 
     <lb/>
     untruthful little bird. I got this direct from the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board: the cost of group marketing of 
     <lb/>
     all salt codfish exports from Newfoundland for 
     <lb/>
     the past several years has been below 1.5% of the 
     <lb/>
     export value. That includes the amounts paid to 
     <lb/>
     the organisations to which he refers.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to congratulate the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Committee upon what I consider to be 
     <lb/>
     one of the finest pieces of work in connection 
     <lb/>
     with a report on fisheries in Newfoundland ever 
     <lb/>
     compiled. I know of no other document on the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries so complete, and so accurate on the 
     <lb/>
     whole.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have absolute faith in the basic possibilities 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland fisheries. We must never 
     <lb/>
     forget that over half our entire economy consists 
     <lb/>
     of the fisheries and that half of the population is 
     <lb/>
     directly affected by the fisheries, and that the 
     <lb/>
     remainder who are not directly affected, are cer<lb break="no"/>tainly so in an indirect way. Everyone in New<lb break="no"/>foundland stands or falls in the long run by the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. We must not make the mistake of 
     <lb/>
     neglecting the fisheries. We must never forget 
     <lb/>
     that we cannot have a prosperous Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     without prosperous fisheries. So I would like to 
     <lb/>
     say I have great faith and great belief in the basic 
     <lb/>
     possibilities of the fisheries of this country, and 
   

            <cb/>
           

     any man who has not that kind of faith had better 
     <lb/>
     leave the country and forget it. Having said that, 
     <lb/>
     I think it is common fairness and common sense 
     <lb/>
     for us to take a realistic look at the fishery situa<lb break="no"/>tion, not so much as it is at the present moment, 
     <lb/>
     but as it is likely to be in the next two to four 
     <lb/>
     years, and then what it is likely to be eight, ten 
     <lb/>
     and 20 years after. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the past several years the fisheries of New<lb break="no"/>foundland have been going through what you 
     <lb/>
     might call a honeymoon. A lot of countries had 
     <lb/>
     stopped fishing almost completely. Only a 
     <lb/>
     limited number were fishing in the last few years. 
     <lb/>
     The result has been a world-wide shortage of fish 
     <lb/>
     and fish products, including oil and other 
     <lb/>
     products, and the consequence has been that the 
     <lb/>
     demand for fish has been great because at the time 
     <lb/>
     the supply was down, the demand was up and the 
     <lb/>
     ability to buy it also up. That is now coming to an 
     <lb/>
     end.... The shortage will soon be over. What we 
     <lb/>
     will have to face is perhaps ample supplies and 
     <lb/>
     more than enough to meet the demand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Smallwood surveyed fisheries developments<lb/>in other countries]</hi><lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     All that, while it is serious, is not as discourag<lb break="no"/>ing as it sounds. Nominally there appears to be in 
     <lb/>
     all the fish countries an elaborate and in some 
     <lb/>
     cases hasty programme of expansion in the 
     <lb/>
     means of taking, producing and processing fish. 
     <lb/>
     It means that immediately ahead there is going to 
     <lb/>
     be difficulty on the part of all the fish countries 
     <lb/>
     to market sufficient quantities. That is why I am 
     <lb/>
     so keen on three things: development of the fresh 
     <lb/>
     fish end of the fishery; of herring oil; and of meals 
     <lb/>
     and fertilisers from herring and other kinds of fish 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems we have reached a point that we never 
     <lb/>
     did reach before the war. We have to get down to 
     <lb/>
     brass tacks — keep up with the times; keep in the 
     <lb/>
     forefront in the development of fish trades. If we 
     <lb/>
     do not, we are going under. Clive Planta, 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of the Fisheries Council of Canada ... 
     <lb/>
     made this statement: "From discussions with the 
     <lb/>
     delegates at Copenhagen and later at Bergen, I 
     <lb/>
     gained the same impression of the trends of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. Without exception, every fish produc<lb break="no"/>ing country was gearing its economy to maxi<lb break="no"/>mum production with emphasis on quality. On all 
     <lb/>
     sides there was evidence of every country adopt<lb break="no"/>ing progressive steps to extend its fisheries and 
     <lb/>
     also of adopting all new and improved methods."

  <p>
     Iceland is expanding, so is Sweden. Norway is 
     <lb/>
     seeking maximum expansion. Great Britain will 
     <lb/>
     be back to pre-war strength within a year. Other 
     <lb/>
     countries are building new and improved vessels, 
     <lb/>
     including factory ships. The action of the fishery 
     <lb/>
     industry in shaking off traditional modes has 
     <lb/>
     brought about greater concentration. Private 
     <lb/>
     companies have joined large co-operatives; have 
     <lb/>
     federated and expanded; fisheries unions have 
     <lb/>
     developed and become a permanent part of the 
     <lb/>
     industry. It means we have to get on our toes or 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is going to be left far behind in the 
     <lb/>
     march of progress. She cannot afford to be left far 
     <lb/>
     behind with over half the economy of the whole 
     <lb/>
     country. What can we do about it? This Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, nothing What can the country do? It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me we have to reduce the cost of production in 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries and in other things as well. Like Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job, I never lose the chance to stress that.... The 
     <lb/>
     fisheries are burdened with costs that they do not 
     <lb/>
     have in other countries. If we are to compete we 
     <lb/>
     must bring down the cost of production. Second, 
     <lb/>
     scientific research; and third, new methods of 
     <lb/>
     production and of processing. I would say the 
     <lb/>
     fishery has to get off in new directions — herring, 
     <lb/>
     oils, meals, fertilisers, canning — I have great 
     <lb/>
     faith in canning. The Committee tells us that 
     <lb/>
     Senator MacLean appeared before them — he is 
     <lb/>
     one of the biggest fish men in Canada — and one 
     <lb/>
     of the members asked him, "Why is it you are not 
     <lb/>
     bothering the United States?" "I never even think 
     <lb/>
     of them, we are shipping to 100 different 
     <lb/>
     countries," he said. That is canned fish. His plant 
     <lb/>
     is costing $250,000. We have enough to put up 
     <lb/>
     five like that and not miss it. If Senator MacLean 
     <lb/>
     can have 11 or 12 in Canada, why not 10 or 12 
     <lb/>
     modern efficient plants in Newfoundland? We 
     <lb/>
     have to do it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In connection with new methods, it is only fair 
     <lb/>
     to say a word of praise of the Hon. Mr. Job who 
     <lb/>
     is one of its pioneers in the fish trade of the 
     <lb/>
     country. Every now and then his firm comes up 
     <lb/>
     with something of a pioneering experiment, and 
     <lb/>
     they are still at it. Then Mr. Crosbie in whose 
     <lb/>
     energy, in whose ability, courage and daring in 
     <lb/>
     the fish trade, I have the utmost respect, as I 
     <lb/>
     expect everyone else has.... Also Mr. Monroe, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hazen Russell and the Harveys, who have 
     <lb/>
     broken new trails, started new products. But it is 
     <lb/>
     not vast enough; it has to be done under tremen<lb break="no"/>dous pressure if the fisheries are going to provide 


            <cb/>
           

     a living for our people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Fourth is the question of a new tariff. I under<lb break="no"/>stand that there is a feeling among some that 
     <lb/>
     capital should not be brought in for our fisheries; 
     <lb/>
     that if we cannot produce the capital, we should 
     <lb/>
     do without it; any new development in the fish 
     <lb/>
     industry we cannot get with our own capital, we 
     <lb/>
     should not get it. This country has been running 
     <lb/>
     250 years. The amount of capital we have ac<lb break="no"/>cumulated is woefully below the amount we 
     <lb/>
     need. It is nothing to be ashamed of. The United 
     <lb/>
     States itself was built up with capital brought in 
     <lb/>
     from Great Britain. Canada was built up with 
     <lb/>
     capital brought in from Great Britain and the 
     <lb/>
     United States; New Zealand and South Africa, 
     <lb/>
     the big countries loaned it out, they became 
     <lb/>
     developed and loaned it to other countries. I am 
     <lb/>
     not an economist or a statistician, but I see the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries have to have new capital by thousands 
     <lb/>
     or millions. Why not become a greater country 
     <lb/>
     than Iceland with its 120,000 population? We 
     <lb/>
     have 318,000 population. Why not become one 
     <lb/>
     of the most modern? If we have not got the capital 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, let us go after it and bring it in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Fifthly, we can put tremendous emphasis on 
     <lb/>
     organisation. The Fisheries Board deserves a lot 
     <lb/>
     of credit. Let us bear one thought for William 
     <lb/>
     Coaker and for Mr. Justice Dunfreld who was a 
     <lb/>
     director of Job Brothers in 1919. They were 
     <lb/>
     pioneers; they were too early to have the idea of 
     <lb/>
     organisation. The Fish Exporters Group was born 
     <lb/>
     in 1919 and it has flowered and blossomed. Give 
     <lb/>
     them credit, but do not forget the men who 
     <lb/>
     preceded them, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sixth, the co-operative movement. That I 
     <lb/>
     regard as fundamentally one of the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant developments that has taken place in the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, and especially in regard to the cost of 
     <lb/>
     production. One way to reduce cost is by co<lb break="no"/>operation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Seven, a separate department of fisheries. I 
     <lb/>
     would not have fisheries linked up with land, 
     <lb/>
     forests. etc., I would have a completely separate 
     <lb/>
     department of fisheries. At least one of the 
     <lb/>
     departments of the government can specialise in 
     <lb/>
     one department of fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not going over the estimate of $25 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Whatever differences of opinion we may 
     <lb/>
     have at least we can agree on this. When it gets 
     <lb/>
     down to estimating the value of this country, it 
     <lb/>
     would be very poor criticism if I tried to paint the 


            <pb n="425" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-28_Page_0425.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">425</fw>
           

     picture glowing only for the sake of arguing 
     <lb/>
     against, say, responsible government.... Regard<lb break="no"/>less of the form of government we get in l948 
     <lb/>
     this country is due for a recession in the fish trade, 
     <lb/>
     that is likely to last three or four years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have absolute faith in the eventual uiumph 
     <lb/>
    of this country. She may go through hard times, 
     <lb/>but Newfoundlanders have in them what it takes. 
     <lb/>If only the country can get a decent chance, we 
     <lb/>will amount to something in the end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEN3">Mr. Spencer</persName> ....We are all agreed that the 
     <lb/>fishery is likely to remain for many years the 
     <lb/>main industry of this country, and in the past we 
     <lb/>have invariably thought of the salt codfish in<lb break="no"/>dustry. In this respect our thinking was wrong, 
     <lb/>but there is no need for me to enlarge on this as 
     <lb/>it has been dealt with very thoroughly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     My experience of the fishery has been that the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman who got most out of fishing, who made 
     <lb/>
     the most comfortable living, was without excep<lb break="no"/>tion the man who was equipped to go after and 
     <lb/>
     catch different types of fish. If a man was 
     <lb/>
     equipped to go after halibut, he went after them 
     <lb/>
     in the early spring, or one who had enough her<lb break="no"/>ring nets would go after them when they were 
     <lb/>
     plentiful, and in recent years he could sell them 
     <lb/>
     to the government bait depot or the local herring 
     <lb/>
     packets. Unfortunately, the bait depots have not 
     <lb/>
     the refrigeration or storage capacity to handle all 
     <lb/>
     the herring that can be caught. Then when the 
     <lb/>
     time of the year came for salmon he went after 
     <lb/>
     them; the same is true of lobster and mackerel, 
     <lb/>
     and if he had a harpoon aboard of his boat, and 
     <lb/>
     was lucky, he might add a swordfish to his catch; 
     <lb/>
     and he only went after cod when none of the other 
     <lb/>
     fish were available. In this way if the price was 
     <lb/>
     low for any one type of fish, he very likely made 
     <lb/>
     up for it on the other types. For this reason I 
     <lb/>
     cannot quite agree with the table in Appendix B, 
     <lb/>
     which draws a comparison between the catches 
     <lb/>
     of the inshore and deep-sea fisherman.<ref target="#fn_11">[1]</ref> I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt it is accurate as far as codfish is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     but it does not give the true picture, as many of 
     <lb/>
     those who are classed as inshore fishermen catch 
     <lb/>
     other fish besides cod. This may not apply to all 
     <lb/>
     parts of our coast, as there may be sections where 
     <lb/>
     they catch only cod. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would add my voice to that of Mr. Hillier and 
     <lb/>
     the Fishery Committee, when they advocate a 
     <lb/>
     scheme of social security for our deep-sea fisher<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
        
men. I consider it is the distinct duty of any 
     <lb/>
     country to provide protection and security for the 
     <lb/>
     families of our men who go down to the sea in 
     <lb/>
     ships. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the fresh frozen cod industry, 
     <lb/>
     our people are becoming more fresh fish con<lb break="no"/>scious and every effort should be made to find 
     <lb/>
     markets for our products. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel there is no need for me to more than 
     <lb/>
     mention the co-operative marketing and export 
     <lb/>
     of our fishery products. The results speak more 
     <lb/>
     eloquently than any words of mine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now to consider the value of the fisheries to 
     <lb/>
    the national income of this country for the years 
     <lb/>which lie immediately ahead. In my opinion the 
     <lb/>men who comprise the Fishery Committee have 
     <lb/>wide experience in matters pertaining to the 
     <lb/>fisheries, and the reasons they have given for 
     <lb/>expecting an annual income from the fisheries of 
     <lb/>approximately $25 million are sound, and unless 
     <lb/>something drastic happens to our markets, can be 
     <lb/>expected to materialise. We hear much of the 
     <lb/>need for new industries, but to me our greatest 
     <lb/>need is to develop to the full the industry that we 
     <lb/>have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> ....I hardly know where to begin to 
     <lb/>enumerate the ills and shortcomings that have 
     <lb/>befallen the backbone of our economic structure, 
     <lb/>the codfishery.... I firmly believe that every sane 
     <lb/>Newfoundlander — whether layman or fisher<lb break="no"/>man — should have a chance to study and closely 
     <lb/>follow this report. The government should put it 
     <lb/>out in pamphlet form and send a copy to every 
     <lb/>hamlet in Newfoundland. Its figures leave much 
     <lb/>room for thought, I was forcibly struck with the 
     <lb/>great differences in the export of our fish during 
     <lb/>the past and at present. We find, for example, in 
     <lb/>1908-09 the export of salt cod was 1,732,387 
     <lb/>quintals. Whilst I know that two of our markets 
     <lb/>— Italy and Greece — are in the doldrums today, 
     <lb/>yet we find that in 1945 the export of our saltfish 
     <lb/>was 1,058,933, a decrease of 673,454 quintals, or 
     <lb/>a loss of over $10 million at 1945 prices. Was 
     <lb/>there a market for that fish, and we did have the 
     <lb/>fish to supply it, or have we lost the markets 
     <lb/>where we marketed that extra 700,000 quintals of 
     <lb/>fish? I think the time for stocktaking in our 
     <lb/>primary industry was long overdue. Another 40 
     <lb/>years at the rate we are going will find us without 
     <lb/>any markets....

     I'll take the report of the Fisheries Post-War 
     <lb/>
     Planning Committee first. It says, "Foreign trade 
     <lb/>
     is the very life blood of Newfoundland and every 
     <lb/>
     effort should be made to co-operate with other 
     <lb/>
     producing countries in endeavouring to find solu<lb break="no"/>tions for the numerous problems which will face 
     <lb/>
     the saltfish trade in the post-war years."<ref target="#fn_12">[1]</ref> It goes 
     <lb/>
     on to say that Newfoundland has no bargaining 
     <lb/>
     power with most countries consuming her 
     <lb/>
     saltfish, and consequently it was to the British 
     <lb/>
     government that Newfoundland had to look for 
     <lb/>
     protection. We have had bargaining powers in the 
     <lb/>
     past. Did we use them? I cannot understand why 
     <lb/>
     we, a maritime race, had to look to Britain in the 
     <lb/>
     past; before steam at the end of World War I 
     <lb/>
     forced our sailing vessels from the sea we were 
     <lb/>
     in a more fortunate position then we are today. 
     <lb/>
     Now we have had two world wars; wealth, as we 
     <lb/>
     knew it in 1914, has been practically blasted from 
     <lb/>
     the earth. All nations have become creditor na<lb break="no"/>tions either to their own peoples or outsiders.... 
     <lb/>
     We today are a fortunate people if we face and 
     <lb/>
     plan for the future.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't think the saltfish business is dead, but 
     <lb/>
     I firmly believe the time has come for a rejuvena<lb break="no"/>tion, and a nation with a backbone instead of a 
     <lb/>
     wishbone can do just that. This country has the 
     <lb/>
     resources to feed its people and could feed, clothe 
     <lb/>
     and house ten times as many more in a manner 
     <lb/>
     comparable with any frontier people. This will 
     <lb/>
     mean very careful planning unless we are going 
     <lb/>
     to continue in the same old <hi rendition="simple:italic">lairrez-faire</hi> way. If 
     <lb/>
     so, then heaven help us. The time has definitely 
     <lb/>
     come to call a halt and we must get busy and 
     <lb/>
     seriously co-operate along entirely different and 
     <lb/>
     more progressive lines if we ever hope to become 
     <lb/>
     economically independent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is not one market that we had and lost 
     <lb/>
     that would have gone out of our keeping if we 
     <lb/>
     had shipped the proper quality fish, except those 
     <lb/>
     markets wherein the people have built their own 
     <lb/>
     ships and caught their own fish. Ever since I can 
     <lb/>
     remember I have heard it said that everything is 
     <lb/>
     OK if the quintal of fish buys the barrel of flour. 
     <lb/>
     It is when the price of flour is up and the fish 
     <lb/>
     down that the people worry. What steps have we 
     <lb/>
     taken to ensure our people that we can sell fish 
     <lb/>
     and buy flour? Not from 1931 to 1940, however. 
     <lb/>
     Look at our exports of fish in 1936-37, 965,699 
     <lb/>
     quintals — a drop of 766,688 quintals below the 
  
            <cb/>
            

     1908-09 score of 1,732,387 quintals. Now that 
     <lb/>
     should make one wonder how our people were 
     <lb/>
     fed. Bread from British mills, mostly from 
     <lb/>
     Spillers, bakers in Cardiff. Why did we get flour 
     <lb/>
     from there? Because Britain was supplying 
     <lb/>
     manufactured goods to Australia, Argentina and 
     <lb/>
     Canada and was getting wheat from them. Is it 
     <lb/>
     possible that with 150,000 square miles of this 
     <lb/>
     earth we could not find anything to trade with 
     <lb/>
     those countries to get wheat to feed 280,000 
     <lb/>
     people? What was wrong? Let us examine the 
     <lb/>
     situation closely. Just where were those superb 
     <lb/>
     young seamen that the British Admiralty called 
     <lb/>
     for in October 1939 for boarding boats' crews? 
     <lb/>
     On the crossroads of every village in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, their hands nearly worn off through 
     <lb/>
     keeping them in their pockets so long, because 
     <lb/>
     somebody could not operate a merchant marine 
     <lb/>
     as cheaply as other countries. We had no ships. 
     <lb/>
     Who, when we were borrowing money by the 
     <lb/>
     millions, would not allow five ships to be built 
     <lb/>
     for the trade of the colony, who was to blame? 
     <lb/>
     Who in a changing world expected to carry on in 
     <lb/>
     the same old way? But look what we got. Now. 
     <lb/>
     the path is ahead of us today, a thorny path if we 
     <lb/>
     take the wrong turning, but a path that will give 
     <lb/>
     our people freedom from fear and freedom from 
     <lb/>
     want if we do what can and should be done. We 
     <lb/>
     have it in our hands today, let us plan wisely. 
     <lb/>
     Today we have no deadwood and we have a 
     <lb/>
     backlog, if I may use those terms. By that I mean 
     <lb/>
     we have no fleet of sailing vessels, the deadwood, 
     <lb/>
     like we had after the last war, which high in<lb break="no"/>surance and low freight rates made obsolete in a 
     <lb/>
     few years. To enable us to enter the maritime field 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland, through the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, have nearly $40 million, that is what I 
     <lb/>
     meant by the backlog. We have no obsolete ships 
     <lb/>
     like Norway and Iceland. We can start from 
     <lb/>
     scratch with all modern improvements in the ship 
     <lb/>
     of today, and this is where this island home of 
     <lb/>
     ours can begin to live. In the past we had to sell 
     <lb/>
     our fish in cheap markets and buy our food in dear 
     <lb/>
     ones, we had no chance to barter. The lack of a 
     <lb/>
     merchant marine has done that to us, for no 
     <lb/>
     country today, no matter how willing they are to 
     <lb/>
     sell for cash, can sell to a country when they have 
     <lb/>
     no cash Formerly you could sell to one country 
     <lb/>
     for cash and take that cash to another country and 
     <lb/>
     buy goods, but that is impossible today. There<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_12">[1] Volume II:246. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection] </note>

     fore the country that is in a position to ship its 
     <lb/>
     products in its own bottoms to another country 
     <lb/>
     and take from that country the products of that 
     <lb/>
     country, is in a far better position to do business 
     <lb/>
     and create trade than is a country who has not the 
     <lb/>
     means to transport its own goods and return with 
     <lb/>
     other necessary cargoes. This is where we have 
     <lb/>
     to start today. We had in Australia, in 1908, a 
     <lb/>
     market for 65,000 quintals of fish. We lost that. 
     <lb/>
     The Norwegians and Icelanders were putting into 
     <lb/>
     the English market at that time their soft-cured 
     <lb/>
     fish, 18 hogsheads to the 100 quintals, we were 
     <lb/>
     putting in Labrador and Strait Shore cured fish, 
     <lb/>
     13 hogsheads to the 100 quintals, seven days sun. 
     <lb/>
     A fish that held up and sold itself wherever it 
     <lb/>
     went. That fish was the kind of fish that went to 
     <lb/>
     Australia, and every Australian who could get 
     <lb/>
     fish for tea Sunday evening had it. They called it 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland tea fish. Messrs. Munn, Baine 
     <lb/>
     Johnston and Job started that time what we called 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador slop. Ships came out from England 
     <lb/>
     with coal, discharged here, were not cleaned out, 
     <lb/>
     had no inspection, and went north and loaded at 
     <lb/>
     Grey Island and down the coast. The fish was 
     <lb/>
     stowed in bulk, no cask, I helped load them. This 
     <lb/>
     fish went across and was shipped to Australia, 
     <lb/>
     and by 1913 not one fish was eaten in Australia. 
     <lb/>
     First the fish was soft-cured and could not stand 
     <lb/>
     the handling, then it was stowed in bulk with sand 
     <lb/>
     from the men's shoes, coal dust from the stringers 
     <lb/>
     and other dirt and nobody would buy it. Brokers 
     <lb/>
     in towns in Australia took a beating of at least 
     <lb/>
     $4,000 on a single shipment. That is how we lost 
     <lb/>
     one market. 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

            <p>We had quite a market in the west of England. 
     <lb/>I believe Mr. Goodridge knows how we lost that 
     <lb/>market during the first world war. In the cities of 
     <lb/>Bristol, Exeter and Taunton, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>shore cod was on practically everybody's table 
     <lb/>for Sunday's tea. In October, 1917, the wholesale 
     <lb/>house on Broad Quay, Bristol, finished taking 
     <lb/>Newfoundland cod. It was Labrador slop, toe rag 
     <lb/>they called it. This grocer was 40 years in the 
     <lb/>business. I have shown you how markets were 
     <lb/>lost. I watched them go and talked with the men 
     <lb/>who imported the fish. Others I could speak about 
     <lb/>but it is water under the bridge and time forbids 
     <lb/>me, but don't forget we did not lose those markets 
     <lb/>because people did not want to buy New<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
          foundland fish, but because we would not send 
     <lb/>
     them the quality of fish they required. Speak to 
     <lb/>
     the average Newfoundlander today and he will 
     <lb/>
     tell you that the saltfish business is dying; sure it 
     <lb/>
     is, but handled right, shipped in the right type of 
     <lb/>
     ship, and stored in the right kind of stores in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and you would sell 4 million 
     <lb/>
     quintals. The market is unlimited if marketed the 
     <lb/>
     right way, and it is one of the most expensive 
     <lb/>
     foods in the world. In the south I have never paid 
     <lb/>
     less than 50 cents a pound for cod in my life — 
     <lb/>
     58 cents in Montevideo in 1911, 63 cents in 
     <lb/>
     Panama in 1935, 32 cents in Bristol in 1914. 
     <lb/>
     There was a profit somewhere and anybody 
     <lb/>
     living in a tropical or semi-tropical country wants 
     <lb/>
     saltfish. I referred to the market we lost in 
     <lb/>
     Australia. We can get that market back when 
     <lb/>
     things settle down and the world gets back to 
     <lb/>
     normal. Now we cannot sell fish to Australia for 
     <lb/>
     cash because the rate of exchange is against us, 
     <lb/>
     but this is the way we can turn that cheap money 
     <lb/>
     to our advantage.... First we have to find at least 
     <lb/>
     four ships to do three jobs, seal fishery, refrigera<lb break="no"/>tion for carrying perishable goods and other car<lb break="no"/>goes, built and owned by the country, operated 
     <lb/>
     by a shipping board like the Fisheries Board.... 
     <lb/>
     By building those four ships it would be possible 
     <lb/>
     to operate in the trade of the island all the year 
     <lb/>
     around, and, under the direction of the shipping 
     <lb/>
     and fisheries boards, all classes of exporters in<lb break="no"/>cluding the co-operatives would be able to avail 
     <lb/>
     of their services. They would be able to take any 
     <lb/>
     kind of a cargo, mixed or otherwise, anywhere in 
     <lb/>
     the world. They would not only be able to bring 
     <lb/>
     in the pelts from the ice but they would be able 
     <lb/>
     to bring in the meat as well. With cold storage 
     <lb/>
     facilities we could have seal meat all the year 
     <lb/>
     around. Perhaps we could find a market for this 
     <lb/>
     meat in the future.... I see nothing improbable in 
     <lb/>
     this idea. If the money that was put into the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Hotel had been put into ships of 
     <lb/>
     this type at the time the hotel was built, it is 
     <lb/>
     probable that the ships would not be showing a 
     <lb/>
     deficit such as the hotel is.<ref target="#fn_13">[1]</ref> If we had had the 
     <lb/>
     ships I have described, and a flour and feed mill, 
     <lb/>
     we could probably have created a market for 
     <lb/>
     about 100,000 quintals in Australia. They have 
     <lb/>
     nearly 6 million people and they have the wheat, 
     <lb/>
     wool, meat and dairy products that we need.... 
   

<note xml:id="fn_13">[1] The hotel opened in 1926, and went into receivership in 1931. It was then taken over and maintained by the 
     <lb/>
    Newfoundland government.</note>

     There is another market in the Argentine 
     <lb/>
     which we could get into, they have cold storage 
     <lb/>
     facilities there already. We can take from them 
     <lb/>
     wheat, corn and cheaper grains, also linseed and 
     <lb/>
     meat. So with a flour and feed mill we would be 
     <lb/>
     independent of the world in feeding our own 
     <lb/>
     people and our own cattle. The Argentine is a 
     <lb/>
     market for flaked and boneless fish, another in<lb break="no"/>dustry we can start here. I have put down on paper 
     <lb/>
     here an extensive programme, maybe an am<lb break="no"/>bitious one, but there is nothing that a progressive 
     <lb/>
     government cannot accomplish with less than 
     <lb/>
     $20 million and we have that money. Surely if 
     <lb/>
     the Iceland government is going to spend $40 
     <lb/>
     million on the reorganisation of their fishery, and 
     <lb/>
     they have only a population of 130,000, we can 
     <lb/>
     invest less than $20 million with our population 
     <lb/>
     of nearly three times that number. There is not a 
     <lb/>
     tree on leeland, whilst we are assured of at least 
     <lb/>
     $16 million in wages from our forests, and the 
     <lb/>
     market is here for flour and feed. We have a cloth 
     <lb/>
     mill which last year used 120,000 pounds of 
     <lb/>
     Australian wool, and that was getting it the dear 
     <lb/>
     way, carried past our doors to the United States 
     <lb/>
     and then hauled across Canada. If this wool was 
     <lb/>
     imported direct the mill would probably be able 
     <lb/>
     to use more.... Our butter factory can use the dairy 
     <lb/>
     products. We can bring them. I cannot see how it 
     <lb/>
     can fail. I see no reason why we could not be on 
     <lb/>
     the pig's back with the resources we have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We need men of vision who would not be 
     <lb/>
     afraid to step out of the rut we have been wallow<lb break="no"/>ing in too long. We have looked for leadership 
     <lb/>
     where it wasn't to be found. Too long we have 
     <lb/>
     thought that only certain men could do things — 
     <lb/>
     why not do it ourselves? The time has come for 
     <lb/>
     us to change. God helps those who help themsel<lb break="no"/>ves. We all belong to this island home of ours, 
     <lb/>
     everybody must work together, if the fisherman 
     <lb/>
     is getting a good living everybody is getting one. 
     <lb/>
     If I may quote the Cabot and Lodge couplet, "Too 
     <lb/>
     long have we been under / The towering South 
     <lb/>
     Side Hills, In the land of the sacred Cod / Where 
     <lb/>
     the Jobs spoke unto the Bowrings / Then the 
     <lb/>
     Bowrings spoke to God." I am not speaking 
     <lb/>
     disparagingly or irreverently of these gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     but that is the pedestal our folks have put them 
     <lb/>
     on, and then blamed them when things went 
     <lb/>
     wrong. Now we want leadership from all classes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't hold with the pessimistic view. I know 
     <lb/>
     there are hard times ahead for everybody and I 
   

            <cb/>
            
     consider we are the lucky ones. Sure, the fresh 
     <lb/>
     fish is going to have a hard time. A wholesaler 
     <lb/>
     asked me in Grimsby, "God, man. how do you 
     <lb/>
     get the fillets so fresh?" "Because", I said, "they 
     <lb/>
     are mostly caught within ten miles of the freezing 
     <lb/>
     plant, and a lot of it is not six hours out of water 
     <lb/>
     before it is frozen." Nothing in the world can take 
     <lb/>
     place of Newfoundland shore dried fish, espe<lb break="no"/>cially after three weeks of the caplin. When we 
     <lb/>
     get central curing stations with artificial drying, 
     <lb/>
     then we will hold our own with the world. Throw 
     <lb/>
     a Newfoundland fish down anywhere, after you 
     <lb/>
     have cleaned the blood, guts, and blubber off the 
     <lb/>
     napes, washed it with running water, dried it hard 
     <lb/>
     and made it white, and it will sell itself. If the 
     <lb/>
     regulations apply to the merchant they must 
     <lb/>
     apply to the fishermen as well. We have had 40 
     <lb/>
     years of propaganda trying to get fishermen to 
     <lb/>
     take the entrails off fish, and still this is not done, 
     <lb/>
     even though they know this is one of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     why our fish won't sell. Let the government put 
     <lb/>
     out an order that next fall fish with blood and guts 
     <lb/>
     and liver on it will not be permitted to be pur<lb break="no"/>chased by the merchant, and that fishermen 
     <lb/>
     producing that kind of fish must take it home 
     <lb/>
     again, and I'll venture to bet that you will get 
     <lb/>
     clean fish. Then we are suffering too much today 
     <lb/>
     from the saying, "It's good enough for the 
     <lb/>
     blacks." Fish from all other fish producing 
     <lb/>
     countries is white, why not Newfoundland fish? 
     <lb/>
     The custom of grinding fish into packages by the 
     <lb/>
     crew should be abolished, and boxes used. I 
     <lb/>
     noticed one box of fish from Norway and cask 
     <lb/>
     fish from Newfoundland in Montevideo; the cus<lb break="no"/>tomer tried the weight of the two fish and he 
     <lb/>
     eventually bought the Newfoundland fish be<lb break="no"/>cause it was fuller fleshed. The Norse fish was 
     <lb/>
     thin but he said it looked better. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     fish was good but it was crushed with the screw.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have already dealt at some length with the 
     <lb/>
     herring, and will leave that fishery with this ob<lb break="no"/>servation, that when the world gets settled down 
     <lb/>
     the wedge inserted by UNRRA in middle Europe 
     <lb/>
     should be followed up. The seal fishery is there 
     <lb/>
     and there is no if. The fishery is there, and we 
     <lb/>
     have $12 million in Britain, she has the men to 
     <lb/>
     build the ships and we have the men to man them. 
     <lb/>
     The world is starving for fats and seals are fat, so 
     <lb/>
     let us demand those ships and get busy before 
     <lb/>
     other nations deplete our seal herds. The time is 
     <lb/>
     right now. The whaling industry, while not spec<lb break="no"/>

     tacular, fits into our economy and will, if com<lb break="no"/>mon sense rules are carried out, go on for a long 
     <lb/>
     time. I believe our subsidiary fisheries can, in 
     <lb/>
     many cases, be enlarged.... The figure of 
     <lb/>
     $34,499,171 for last year was heartening, and 
     <lb/>
     although these are inflated values, yet our fishery 
     <lb/>
     is in a healthy condition and I believe a firm 
     <lb/>
     policy now, with an eye for new markets and also 
     <lb/>
     to barter where we can't get cash, will put us 
     <lb/>
     through. But it must be done by a combination of 
     <lb/>
     government, merchants, and fishermen. We are 
     <lb/>
     all tied up together. I believe the whole question 
     <lb/>
     of the Labrador cure is that we heavy-salt too 
     <lb/>
     much of it.... With regard to decked boats of 
     <lb/>
     20-25 tons, those vessels would be very econom<lb break="no"/>ical, especially on short hauls.... The time has 
     <lb/>
     come for the nations to get together to find out 
     <lb/>
     where fish spawn and to protect those regions, 
     <lb/>
     because the depletion of the Banks is caused by 
     <lb/>
     the heavy dories and nets ploughing up the bot<lb break="no"/>tom and destroying the food the fingerlings live 
     <lb/>
     on in their early life.... The depletion of the Banks 
     <lb/>
     also makes great inroads on the shore fishery. In 
     <lb/>
     the Straits of Belle Isle in 1880 it was usual for 
     <lb/>
     two men fishing from whale boats with hand lines 
     <lb/>
     to land from 360 to 460 quintals of shore fish 
     <lb/>
     from the 15th June to the 20th September. Today 
     <lb/>
     three men are doing well to land 160 quintals in 
     <lb/>
     the same time, fishing with motor boats. I believe 
     <lb/>
     the setting up of the Fisheries Board is a step in 
     <lb/>
     the right directionand more power to their elbow. 
     <lb/>
     The co-operative movement, especially in the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, should and must be of prime impor<lb break="no"/>tance to this country. It is only when the fisher<lb break="no"/>men show an interest in the fish from the time it 
     <lb/>
     spawns until it reaches the consumer that our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries will come into their own. Bounties 
     <lb/>
     should be given for the repair of schooners.... I 
     <lb/>
     am not in a position to speak from experience 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the frozen fish business. I know it 
     <lb/>
     has a future. I believe that if we had one strong 
     <lb/>
     central company with faith in the resources be<lb break="no"/>hind it, this would be the coming industry, with 
     <lb/>
     the ships I have spoken about in the first part of 
     <lb/>
     this address.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The land for the bases is a job for the Foreign 
     <lb/>
     Office in my estimation, and is outside our juris<lb break="no"/>diction, but I firmly believe we should get a 
     <lb/>
     government of our own people elected to present 
     <lb/>
     our case to those who made it, and to get the case 
     <lb/>
     adjusted. I believe we should get some adjust<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
           
ments in lieu of hire for our land, that would pay 
     <lb/>
     us better in the long run. I believe central curing 
     <lb/>
     stations are long overdue, also cold storage 
     <lb/>
     facilities for storing the fish we have to keep over 
     <lb/>
     a long time.... Depots for salt outside of St. John's 
     <lb/>
     are long overdue. Anything that makes the out<lb break="no"/>fitting of the fisherman less expensive should be 
     <lb/>
     of prime importance, first to the fisherman and 
     <lb/>
     then to the government. This should be done as 
     <lb/>
     quickly as possible. We should demand, while 
     <lb/>
     our present status exists, to have access to the 
     <lb/>
     British marketing agency in the same proportion 
     <lb/>
     as a regular citizen of the United Kingdom, and 
     <lb/>
     if we do get back dominion status we should be 
     <lb/>
     a pan of that agency either by negotiation with 
     <lb/>
     the UK government or by other means, even if it 
     <lb/>
     meant a cash contribution towards its upkeep. 
     <lb/>
     They have the greatest marketing agency in the 
     <lb/>
     world and I believe there is no reason why we 
     <lb/>
     should not have a liaison with them.... There is 
     <lb/>
     one more thing I want to speak about and it is the 
     <lb/>
     insurance; as Kipling puts it, "If blood be the 
     <lb/>
     price of Admiralty", we have paid it in full in the 
     <lb/>
     past. I believe not in an insurance but a pension 
     <lb/>
     scheme paid something like the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment paid to their seamen and fishermen during 
     <lb/>
     the war, where a widow would receive a pension 
     <lb/>
     until she remarried, and the children until they 
     <lb/>
     reached a certain age. This could be a tax on the 
     <lb/>
     industry with the government standing a part of 
     <lb/>
     it. The time has come for social service to come 
     <lb/>
     into the picture in this country. The government 
     <lb/>
     employee gets it, why not the primary producer's 
     <lb/>
     dependents, if he is drowned? If a loss of limbs 
     <lb/>
     occurs through hardship, sickness, stranding or 
     <lb/>
     suffering hardship on wrecks, then he should be 
     <lb/>
     looked after....

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I would like to thank Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Vincent for their kind words. I congratu<lb break="no"/>late Mr. Smallwood on his very fine speech. The 
     <lb/>
     only disappointing part of it was the absence of 
     <lb/>
     remarks about markets. It is all very well to talk 
     <lb/>
     about getting new capital and developing 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. We have developed it to saturation 
     <lb/>
     point at the moment, and unless you get markets 
     <lb/>
     what is the point? I am disappointed he made no 
     <lb/>
     reference to the point I stressed so much here — 
     <lb/>
     a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> from the USA for the concessions 
     <lb/>
     already given them. When the delegation goes to 
     <lb/>
     London, I hope someone will not forget to bring 
     <lb/>
     up that point in spite of the fact that the Commis<lb break="no"/>

     sion of Government has said they did not think it 
     <lb/>
     is a matter for discussion. I firmly believe if it is 
     <lb/>
     brought up, the matter will be discussed. I am still 
     <lb/>
     of the opinion that the most vital part of the whole 
     <lb/>
     report is where we stress the need for the US 
     <lb/>
     market. Unless we can get something of that sort, 
     <lb/>
     it will be a poor situation in the future. It is all 
     <lb/>
     very well to say America has a big fishery of its 
     <lb/>
     own, we can still get a small quantity and it would 
     <lb/>
     make all the difference in a decent living for our 
     <lb/>
     people and the reverse; if we do not take this 
     <lb/>
     opportunity, it will be a great mistake. I dis<lb break="no"/>tributed copies of a pamphlet on that question and 
     <lb/>
     received from outside the country, from people 
     <lb/>
     who are used to national questions, a very flatter<lb break="no"/>ing statement. They thought that we had put 
     <lb/>
     forward an extremely strong case for approach<lb break="no"/>ing the US.... Great Britain has already purchased 
     <lb/>
     considerable quantities of frozen fillets from 
     <lb/>
     Norway. Her readiness to buy from Norway was 
     <lb/>
     on account of exchange. We are up against that 
     <lb/>
     in the British market today. With the consent of 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury I hope something can be done in 
     <lb/>
     regard to Great Britain. The American market 
     <lb/>
     remains in its present position. You know what it 
     <lb/>
     would mean if we have to shut down the cold 
     <lb/>
     storage plants. I again stress that we must push 
     <lb/>
     that question of <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> from the United 
     <lb/>
     States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> ....I would like to refer to the deep- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     sea fishermen of the southwest coast, as I feel I 
     <lb/>
     know something of the hardships they encounter 
     <lb/>
     whilst pursuing their avocation. This type of fish<lb break="no"/>ing entails greater hardship than the shore fish<lb break="no"/>ing. The men leave their homes in the dead of 
     <lb/>
     winter, when storms are most severe, and the 
     <lb/>
     danger and hardships to which they are subjected 
     <lb/>
     earn for them a special place in our consideration 
     <lb/>
     and a special recognition by the government in 
     <lb/>
     any future plans for the development of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This past number of years many of our sea 
     <lb/>
     fishermen proceeded to Lunenburg to engage in 
     <lb/>
     the deep-sea fishery. The return they receive for 
     <lb/>
     fishing there is higher than for fishing the same 
     <lb/>
     length of time in Newfoundland. I believe if the 
     <lb/>
     cost of production in this industry was lowered, 
     <lb/>
     those men would earn as much in this country as 
     <lb/>
     they do in Lunenburg — thereby adding the 
     <lb/>
     wealth of their labour to their own country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Newfoundland fishermen have paid a 
    

            <cb/>
           

     heavy price down through the years — hardly a 
     <lb/>
     year passes without the loss of some fishermen. 
     <lb/>
     There have been occasions when entire crews 
     <lb/>
     failed to return. Many of the stories of heroism 
     <lb/>
     and suffering are never told. Although those men 
     <lb/>
     have insurance under the Bank Fishery Act, the 
     <lb/>
     amount paid to dependent widows and children 
     <lb/>
     is a mere pittance. Of course the PMD Fund gives 
     <lb/>
     great assistance to such bereaved families, but I 
     <lb/>
     urge the government to immediately devise plans 
     <lb/>
     for adequate insurance for those brave toilers of 
     <lb/>
     the deep. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This past year has witnessed the inauguration 
     <lb/>
     of a more modern way of fishing. A large fresh 
     <lb/>
     fish filleting plant has been completed at Burin, 
     <lb/>
     as well as a fishmeal plant considered equal to, if 
     <lb/>
     not surpassing, anything of its kind on the North 
     <lb/>
     American continent. Three fair size draggers are 
     <lb/>
     in operation at the plant, manned with local cap<lb break="no"/>tains and crews, which up to the present time has 
     <lb/>
     brought to the old and historic town of Burin, 
     <lb/>
     with its long and checkered history in the Bank 
     <lb/>
     fishery, an unprecedented era of prosperity that 
     <lb/>
     has penetrated many towns and villages on the 
     <lb/>
     whole Burin Peninsula. The undertaking has re<lb break="no"/>quired large capital expenditure — whether this 
     <lb/>
     is American or private capital I am not aware. I 
     <lb/>
     do know for the proper development of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries of this country we need capital to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of at least $50 million.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In common with many others I view with the 
     <lb/>
     utmost alarm the increased activity of European 
     <lb/>
     countries on the Grand Banks. Unless some in<lb break="no"/>ternational control is exercised, those famous 
     <lb/>
     fishing grounds will be depleted of fish, which in 
     <lb/>
     turn will have a serious effect on our shore 
     <lb/>
     fishery. I would suggest that die Fisheries Board 
     <lb/>
     take immediate steps that would lead to the 
     <lb/>
     protection of the fishing banks, the lifeline of our 
     <lb/>
     country's natural resources. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Referring to the Burin Peninsula road, to 
     <lb/>
     which some members here yesterday showed 
     <lb/>
     much disfavour, I entirely disagree. Mr. Monroe 
     <lb/>
     appeared before our Fisheries Committee and 
     <lb/>
     stated he was prepared to expand his plant at 
     <lb/>
     Burin by another million dollars if adequate com<lb break="no"/>munication could be provided. This road would 
     <lb/>
     serve four districts — Fortune Bay, Burin West, 
     <lb/>
     Burin East and Placentia West. The people in 
     <lb/>
     those districts realise that this road would bring 
     <lb/>
     them out of the isolation they have so long en<lb break="no"/>

     dured, and I am happy to say the government 
     <lb/>
     proposed to start this road this spring.

     for fresh fish in Norway, and the reason they 
     <lb/>
     could not place it in Newfoundland was because 
     <lb/>
     of exchange difficulties? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> How much was it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> About 20 million pounds at 15 cents a 
     <lb/>
     pound. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> To my mind that order should have 
     <lb/>
     been placed in Newfoundland. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     exchange, they have it right here. We pay them 
     <lb/>
     $3.25 million interest in sinking fund on our 
     <lb/>
     sterling debt. Consequently if they felt like giving 
     <lb/>
     us that order, it would not involve purchasing 
     <lb/>
     dollars in Great Britain; it would mean paying the 
     <lb/>
     interest and we in turn here would pay the dollars 
     <lb/>
     over to the fish exporters who supply the fish for 
     <lb/>
     that order. In my opinion that is a very flimsy 
     <lb/>
     excuse for not buying fresh fish in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. That was the only point I wanted to 
     <lb/>
     make, and I want to congratulate the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Committee on their excellent report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> During the past few years, we have 
     <lb/>
     been selling fish through the International Food 
     <lb/>
     Control Board; I understand that board is now to 
     <lb/>
     be discontinued as far as Newfoundland fish is 
     <lb/>
     concerned?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I understand that after the end of March 
     <lb/>
     there are no more sales through the Combined 
     <lb/>
     Food Board.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> If anyone got an order for 20,000 
     <lb/>
     quintals, would they ship it direct or through the

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think it would be through the Fisheries 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> In connection with small steamers, 
     <lb/>
     I understand there were a few men — returned 
     <lb/>
     soldiers from the US — who came here in a 
     <lb/>
     steamer to get supplies to go to the sealfishery. I 
     <lb/>
     am told the position is that before she could sail 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's or from Newfoundland, she had 
     <lb/>
     to pay $4,000 tax or get a clearance from the 
     <lb/>
     Customs to sail for Halifax. Their intention was 
     <lb/>
     to bring in the seals and manufacture them and 
     <lb/>
     give employment here. The position is today if a 
     <lb/>
     man took sick or the boat lost a propeller and had 
     <lb/>
     to make port, as soon as he entered port her first 
     <lb/>
     obligation is to pay $4,000 tax to the New<lb break="no"/>
            

            <cb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That is under the old Sealing Act.

     <lb/>relevant to the issues before this Convention; but 
     <lb/>as a matter of information, if any member of the 
     <lb/>Convention is in a position to answer, I will allow 
     <lb/>the answer.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I am not in a position to answer it. I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt they are sticking to the Sealing Act 
     <lb/>
     which was made for the protection of seals and 
     <lb/>
     men. What the actual position is, I do not know. 
     <lb/>
     I think six or seven years ago when Norwegians 
     <lb/>
     came out they were refused clearance — they 
     <lb/>
     wanted to discourage foreign vessels. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> The Fisheries Report has now 
     <lb/>
     been debated for 22 hours and I do not propose 
     <lb/>
     to keep it on the carpet much longer. There were 
     <lb/>
     a couple of points which struck me. On page 39 
     <lb/>
     — referring to the local consumption of fish in 
     <lb/>
     1946, 68,760 quintals worth almost $1 million. 
     <lb/>
     The average family is given as 4.5, that makes 25 
     <lb/>
     pounds of fish per person per year, less than a half 
     <lb/>
     pound a week. We are a great race of fishermen 
     <lb/>
     but we do not each much of it. There is an 
     <lb/>
     argument there for a strong campaign of "Eat 
     <lb/>
     more fish" or a "National Fish Week". If the local 
     <lb/>
     consumption amounts to $1 million in 1946, I see 
     <lb/>
     no reason why we would not be persuaded to 
     <lb/>
     treble that or double it, which would mean some<lb break="no"/>thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On page 44 — this matter of centralisation. If 
     <lb/>
     this country has a problem, this is it. We have 
     <lb/>
     heard a lot of talk about it, most of the delegates 
     <lb/>
     know about it at first hand. I am representing St. 
     <lb/>
     John's but I have travelled a great deal of the 
     <lb/>
     coast — I have been on most of it. I have seen 
     <lb/>
     some of the places where our people live; I tell 
     <lb/>
     you it goes to your heart sometimes, it does to 
     <lb/>
     mine, what they have to do without, living in 
     <lb/>
     those places! There is a big argument there for 
     <lb/>
     this business of roads (which caused a lot of 
     <lb/>
     controversy). I am not taking sides; if it is a case 
     <lb/>
     of removing isolation, then by all means we 
     <lb/>
     should see what we can do about it. But I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe in this business of roads alone, just to link 
     <lb/>
     up all settlements. No government can possibly 
     <lb/>
     do that or attempt to do it. Mr. Vincent has 
     <lb/>
     referred to centralisation several times. I strongly 
     <lb/>
     support the idea. We have to get our people 
     <lb/>
     together into large communities or we are not 
     <lb/>
     going to get anywhere under any form of govern<lb break="no"/>

     ment. We cannot afford it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I note the small amount the government has 
     <lb/>
     spent or is going to spend on research. It is a great 
     <lb/>
     pity. The fisheries have been and will continue to 
     <lb/>
     be the mainstay — surely we should invest a little 
     <lb/>
     money in that vital aspect of it. I have not much 
     <lb/>
     to say about co-operation. I think it is a 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile movement and is contributing a great 
     <lb/>
     deal to a better economic setup and outlook and 
     <lb/>
     I wish it all success. Another last point, the matter 
     <lb/>
     of insurance for fishermen, some sort of guaran<lb break="no"/>tee or safeguard for families. I think it is a terrible 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs in 1947 that the primary producers 
     <lb/>
     are in such a precarious position. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     go on record as being in accord with any scheme 
     <lb/>
     which can be formulated to assist fishermen and 
     <lb/>
     their dependents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mercantile marine — I agree with Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>Donald and Mr. Bailey. It is basic and the people 
     <lb/>
     wish a return of some shape or form of our old 
     <lb/>
     mercantile marine. We had a tremendous fleet in 
     <lb/>
     the old days. Sometimes Newfoundlanders went 
     <lb/>
     off on a barque or brigantine to the ends of the 
     <lb/>
     earth... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Harrington has reminded 
     <lb/>
     me of a pointI forgot to raise. I was asked to raise 
     <lb/>
     it by persons engaged in the fresh fish trade. 
     <lb/>
     There are in St. John's something like 1,000 
     <lb/>
     shops, maybe more. Quite a few of them are 
     <lb/>
     beginning to sell fresh fish.... The point is this: 
     <lb/>
     in Canada and the United States, and I imagine 
     <lb/>
     in Great Britain, shops selling fresh fish are re<lb break="no"/>quired by law to have the proper cold storage 
     <lb/>
     facilities.... I am wondering if there are any 
     <lb/>
     regulations on it. Is anything being done to 
     <lb/>
     protect the quality of fish after it leaves cold 
     <lb/>
     storage? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Until quite recently all or most of it was 
     <lb/>
     sold to one or two fish shops. Recently they are 
     <lb/>
     selling more to grocery stores, but they deliver 
     <lb/>
     only a small quantity each time. It is all wrapped. 
     <lb/>
     They have no cold storage facilities in those 
     <lb/>
     shops. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise again to congratulate the 
     <lb/>
     Committee on the excellence of the report. I can 
     <lb/>
     quite see what a tremendous amount of work was 
     <lb/>
     put in on it. In doing that I am reminded of the 
     <lb/>
     remark Mr. Harrington made when he said there 
     <lb/>
     was a controversy about a road. There was no 
     <lb/>
     controversy whatsoever. A remark was made that 
     <lb/>
     the word "vital" be taken from the record. That 
  

            <cb/>
          

     was all there was to it. This Convention has gone 
     <lb/>
     on record as believing that the building of the 
     <lb/>
     road atacost of $1.25 - $2 million was not of vital 
     <lb/>
     concern as far as the fisheries is concerned. But 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Reddy from Burin has chosen to take the 
     <lb/>
     matter up again. I still maintain that the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion was right when they adopted that. It is an 
     <lb/>
     accomplished fact. The government has decided 
     <lb/>
     they are going to put the road through. It was most 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate that the name of the man who has 
     <lb/>
     established a plant there should have been intro<lb break="no"/>duced. I am sure that gentleman would be the last 
     <lb/>
     to think there was a move on his part to get the 
     <lb/>
     road through. I do not think that even that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman thinks that because he wants to extend 
     <lb/>
     his plant in Burin, the government should extend 
     <lb/>
     the road. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I would like to thank Mr. Hollett and 
     <lb/>
     others. I hope you will all bear in mind that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Keough has been largely responsible and that he 
     <lb/>
     has worked very hard. As regards Mr. Hollett's 
     <lb/>
     objection to the use of a certain gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     name, that gentleman is on record before our 
     <lb/>
     Committee as advocating that road.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I do not want to be like the speaker 
     <lb/>
     who said he did not want to delay the House and 
     <lb/>
     then got up and made a second speech. There are 
     <lb/>
     two questions — what are the fisheries worth to 
     <lb/>
     the country, and what are they worth to the 
     <lb/>
     people? Can they provide a decent living for the 
     <lb/>
     people engaged in it? I think the first has been 
     <lb/>
     covered by the Committee. I am not going into 
     <lb/>
     that $25.25 or $24.75 millions. We take that with 
     <lb/>
     the knowledge there is an element of guesswork 
     <lb/>
     in any such estimate, and the Committee has done 
     <lb/>
     a good job in making that estimate. I also feel we 
     <lb/>
     have the right idea in being enthusiastic about 
     <lb/>
     branching out into newer forms of fishery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the second question — how 
     <lb/>
     much will the fisheries be worth to the people 
     <lb/>
     engaged in it? That depends to a greater extent 
     <lb/>
     upon ourselves. I would like to say that even at 
     <lb/>
     high prices, even when conditions are at their 
     <lb/>
     best, in many parts of this country the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     have not been providing a decent standard of 
     <lb/>
     living for the people engaged in them. There are 
     <lb/>
     several reasons for this. The high cost of credit 
     <lb/>
     that was stressed here. There are methods of 
     <lb/>
     handling and the attitude many people have 
     <lb/>
     towards the articles which they themselves 
     <lb/>
     produce. Five years ago the situation came up in 


            <pb n="433" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-28_Page_0433.jpg"/>

     connection with the salmon fishery. The English 
     <lb/>
     market had been lost; none of the people who had 
     <lb/>
     been marketing salmon had made any arrange<lb break="no"/>ments with the American market; where I hap<lb break="no"/>pened to live the people had been salmon fishing 
     <lb/>
     for years and then found there was no way to 
     <lb/>
     dispose of the salmon. No one wanted them, so 
     <lb/>
     they thought. These people learned their lesson 
     <lb/>
     the hard way. I want to assure the Convention that 
     <lb/>
     they will never be caught in that position again. 
     <lb/>
     They have an organisation that will put it on the 
     <lb/>
     market for them. It seems to me that while it is 
     <lb/>
     not quite self-evident, while we ought to have a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of faith in the produce of the 
     <lb/>
     country and in the fisheries, I, at any rate, do not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate in going so far out on a limb as to say that 
     <lb/>
     barring absolute blank catches, the fisheries can 
     <lb/>
     be so organised as to give a decent living to the 
     <lb/>
     people engaged in it.... If I did not think that, I 
     <lb/>
     would clear out of this country. We have to have 
     <lb/>
     a different approach from anything in the past.... 
     <lb/>
     While I concur with the government's putting 
     <lb/>
     more money into research; while I have nothing 
     <lb/>
     but the highest esteem for people who have faith 
     <lb/>
     enough to build cold storage industries and try to 
     <lb/>
     develop new markets; I feel there is one essential 
     <lb/>
     factor in the long or perhaps in the short run, the 
     <lb/>
     success or failure of our Newfoundland fisheries 
     <lb/>
     will depend to a very great extent on the people 
     <lb/>
     who are engaged in the primary production. 
     <lb/>
     There are two ways we can get their interest 
  

            <cb/>
        

     in their own welfare more than they have shown 
     <lb/>
     in the past: one is through educational methods, 
     <lb/>
     educating the people in the fishing boats to a 
     <lb/>
     better standard of values with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     produce they have to market, in the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     new methods of handling. Even that is not 
     <lb/>
     enough. The normal average individual will only 
     <lb/>
     have the biggest interest in anything when his 
     <lb/>
     own financial returns are tied up with that inter<lb break="no"/>est, and in the past we have suffered much be<lb break="no"/>cause there was never discrimination between the 
     <lb/>
     man who made a good product and the man who 
     <lb/>
     made an inferior one. The fisheries will only be 
     <lb/>
     successful when the fishermen are shareholders 
     <lb/>
     of the enterprise and when their income depends 
     <lb/>
     as much on the successful marketing operation as 
     <lb/>
     on the catch. The average fisherman feels his job 
     <lb/>
     is done when he has salted it, dried it and passed 
     <lb/>
     it over to the merchants. That is why I deplore 
     <lb/>
     any niggardliness with regard to the investment 
     <lb/>
     of public monies on such things as co-operative 
     <lb/>
     education.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, the Report of 
     <lb/>
     the Public Health and Welfare Committee has 
     <lb/>
     been distributed. It is not my intention to make a 
     <lb/>
     very long speech. We hope that members will 
     <lb/>
     find considerable food for thought in the report, 
     <lb/>
     and that in completing the final picture of New<lb break="no"/>foundland the information herein will assist in 
     <lb/>
     our deliberations. It is not in one or two reports 
     <lb/>
     that we can expect to find the real answer we are 
     <lb/>
     seeking, but in studying all of the various reports 
     <lb/>
     as they are tabled and reviewing the future in the 
     <lb/>
     light of the present and of the past, come to some 
     <lb/>
     definite conclusions. I would like to make a few 
     <lb/>
     observations before I begin the piloting of this 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     report through the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As convenor of the Committee. I would like 
     <lb/>
     to record my sincere thanks to each member of 
     <lb/>
     our Committee for the contribution he has made. 
     <lb/>
     It was hoped we would have been able to have 
     <lb/>
     had a second interview with the Commissioner of 
     <lb/>
     Public Health and Welfare, Sir John C. Pud- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     dester, but on account of his serious illness this 
     <lb/>
     has not been possible. I hope he will be able to 
     <lb/>
     appear before the whole Convention before its 
     <lb/>
     sittings are concluded. Any commissioner who 
     <lb/>
     has seen the whole life of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, on the inside as well as on the 
     <lb/>
     outside, should be able to make a distinct con<lb break="no"/>
