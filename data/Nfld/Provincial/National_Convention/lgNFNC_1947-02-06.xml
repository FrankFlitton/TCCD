<!--<p>
     going down and talking to the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government in the next three months, but I want 
     <lb/>
     them to go down somewhat sensibly; to ask them 
     <lb/>
     what can be done is a lot of foolishness. As a 
     <lb/>
     former minister of the Crown I have to state that 
     <lb/>
     that looks silly to me.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would like to point out to the 
     <lb/>
     Convention before the debate goes any further, 
     <lb/>
     that this amendment can only be put with the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the whole House, because it is, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, contrary to the rules. Is there any further 
     <lb/>
     discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Holiett Mr.' Chairman, may I ask under 
     <lb/>
     what particular rule the amendment is a con<lb break="no"/>tradiction? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, Mr. Hollett. Rule 42 says,

            <p>
     "The Chairman of the Convention shall appoint

     all committees." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Did not that refer to committees in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the working of this Convention? 
     <lb/>
     It should not apply to the idea of appointing a 
     <lb/>
     committee to go elsewhere.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The rule says "all committees". 
     <lb/>
     Nevertheless, that can be overridden by the Con<lb break="no"/>vention.

            <p>[After some debate, and with the consent of the<lb/>Convention, the Chairman pm Mr. Fogwill's<lb/>amendment to the vote. It was carried.

            <p>
     Pursuant to adjournment of the public session at 
     <lb/>
     430 pm the Convention assembled in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council Chamber to consider the im<lb break="no"/>plementing of the motion of Hon. R.B. Job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fogwill asked that the committee referred 
     <lb/>
     to in Hon. Mr. Job's motion be elected in open 
     <lb/>
     session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Higgins, K.C. moved and Mr. Newell 
     <lb/>
     seconded that a nominating committee be elected 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of recommending and nominating 
     <lb/>
     a committee to interview the Governor in Com<lb break="no"/>mission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Ater some discussion Mr. Higgins, K.C,, with

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the consent of Mr. Newell and the Convention 
     <lb/>
     withdrew his motion and moved that the electing 
     <lb/>
     of that committee be effected forthwith by secret 
     <lb/>
     ballot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The motion was seconded by Rev. Mr. Burry 
     <lb/>
     and carried, whereupon the following were 
     <lb/>
     elected members of the committee with the 
     <lb/>

     the other afternoon I suggested to you that we had

     The Committee has recently received 
     <lb/>
     numerous representations from certain sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the country requesting that certain 
     <lb/>
     timber areas now held by private corpora<lb break="no"/>tions either under lease or free simply should 
     <lb/>
     revert to the Crown. These particular areas

     carry the only available timber in these ter<lb break="no"/>

       ritories that could be of benefit to the people 
     <lb/>
     generally, either for fuel or the manufacture 
     <lb/>
     of lumber for local consumption. The

     Forestry Committee feels that the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government might make an effort to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate with the companies concerned for 
     <lb/>
     an exchange of properties by mutual en<lb break="no"/>couragment and if possible try and effect a

     settlement that would be equitably fair. A

     other afternoon, and it is now open for discussion 
     <lb/>
     or question.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I wonder if Major Cashin would 
     <lb/>
     tell us how the amount of $25 million is com<lb break="no"/>puted? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> If you will remember that time we 
     <lb/>
     brought the original Forestry Report before this 
     <lb/>
     House, we estimated that the total earning power 
     <lb/>
     from the pulp and paper industry would be in the 
     <lb/>
     vicinity of $16 million. Since that time, we have 
     <lb/>
     had Mr. Lewin, General Manager of the Bowater 
     <lb/>
     Pulp and Paper Company before the Committee, 
     <lb/>
     and I think he stated in his address that the in<lb break="no"/>dustry would be earning around $20 million in a 
     <lb/>
     very short period. He said that the development 
     <lb/>
     of timber for export or pulp and paper on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador could be very reasonably expected to 
     <lb/>
     produce another $5 million a year. Consequently 
     <lb/>
     with the price of newsprint as it is today and the 
     <lb/>
     future prospects for it in the next two or three 
     <lb/>
     years at $83 a ton, and figuring $35 or $40 a ton 
     <lb/>
     labour, and some 500,000 tons of newsprint an<lb break="no"/>nually, you will find that it will go over $20 
     <lb/>
     million annually. It is well known that newsprint 
     <lb/>
     gives an earning power of half the price obtained 
     <lb/>
     for it. That is general. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why I asked this is not idle 
     <lb/>
     curiosity In the end of the year issue of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily 
     <lb/>
     News</hi> Mr. Lewin wrote an article, and in that he 
     <lb/>
     said: "When it is also realised that the total 
     <lb/>
     payroll of the Corner Brook company will have 
     <lb/>
     increased nearly fourfold in the last ten years and 
     <lb/>
     will reach close to $12 million in 1948, it will 
     <lb/>
     readily be seen what this means to the west coast 
     <lb/>
     in particular and the country as a whole." I as<lb break="no"/>sume his position was that Comer Brook would 
     <lb/>
     contribute $12 million, and I presume he meant 
     <lb/>
     that Grand Falls would make up the other $8 
     <lb/>
     million.

     <lb/>
     country.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> When Mr. Lewin estimates the 
     <lb/>
     wage bill of Bowaters reaching around $12 mil<lb break="no"/>lion in 1948, does that include the amount of 
     <lb/>
     wages that they are paying out on construction of 
     <lb/>
     the new extension to the mill, or is it for per<lb break="no"/>manent labour in and around the mill and in the 
     <lb/>
     woods, or does it include the short-time construc<lb break="no"/>tion period? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, in 1948 the constmction period 
 
            <cb/>
          

     will be over, and the mill will be running in full

     capacity and will have around a $12 million

     earning power....

     construction or extension? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Extension. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Have you any idea what the 
     <lb/>
     AND Co. are paying out now and next year and 
     <lb/>
     the year after in regular wages? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> $78 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> So that if Bowaters pay out $12 
     <lb/>
     million in regular wages, and the AND Co. pay 
     <lb/>
     out $7-8 million, it is $19-20 million a year? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I notice that Mr. Lewin's es<lb break="no"/>timate is based on present operating conditions. 
     <lb/>
     Your report goes on to say, "This means that our 
     <lb/>
     total prospective earning power from forest in<lb break="no"/>dustry would be approximately $25 million an<lb break="no"/>nually." I take it you mean $12 million from 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters, $7-8 million from the AND Company, 
     <lb/>
     and $5 million from perhaps Labrador? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, Labrador and the local in<lb break="no"/>dustry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would you give the local in<lb break="no"/>dustry as $1.75 million? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is there any real reason for 
     <lb/>
     supposing there might be $3-4 million spent in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> There is no official reason, but 
     <lb/>
     when Mr. Lewin came before the Committee he 
     <lb/>
     indicated that there might be people who were 
     <lb/>
     seriously interested in the timber resources of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador — sulphite mills in Hamilton Inlet and 
     <lb/>
     the Bay D'Espoir area. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Did he by any chance say that 
     <lb/>
     his firm... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, they are interested at present. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't want Major Cashin to 
     <lb/>use any names he is not supposed to use, but may

     people somewhere who are actively interested in 
     <lb/>
     developing Labrador? 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would they be Canadian or 
     <lb/>
     American? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Both. Outside interests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     would tell us a little more about this statement 
     <lb/>
     here — the third last paragraph of your sup<lb break="no"/>plementary report, page 2: "We understand that 
     <lb/>
     recently 320 square miles of timber area have 
     <lb/>
     been granted to the Three Rapids Estate...." 
     <lb/>
     That's the survey containing 20-odd million 
     <lb/>
     cords of wood. Do you know the terms on which 
     <lb/>
     they were granted this? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We did not get the terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Do you suppose that would be 
     <lb/>
     the normal $2 per square mile? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, and possibly a special 
     <lb/>
     stumpage. I am just figuring on what some people 
     <lb/>
     who were negotiating some years ago did get, and 
     <lb/>
     I don't see why the government would give them 
     <lb/>
     anything less than 75 cents a cord under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would Major Cashin tell us 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">who</hi> the Three Rapids Estate are? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Grieve, and some English capi<lb break="no"/>tal I believe it is Pierce and Price, timber dealers 
     <lb/>
     in Great Britain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have no wish to delay any<lb break="no"/>thing or talk too long, but this is really important, 
     <lb/>
     and I don't feel like being rushed in the matter. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Lewin appeared before the Forestry Commit<lb break="no"/>tee and gave an estimate of what they have been 
     <lb/>
     paying out in wages, and what they will be paying 
     <lb/>
     out say in 1948 and maybe 1949, which is very 
     <lb/>
     encouraging. He also makes the statement in your 
     <lb/>
     original report here, that they had sold their 
     <lb/>
     newsprint output for the next ten years in ad<lb break="no"/>vance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I suppose the same thing ap<lb break="no"/>plies to Grand Falls? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I think so. I think they sell it one to 
     <lb/>
     the other at market price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Therefore the question we have 
     <lb/>
     to ask ourselves in trying to look ahead is what is 
     <lb/>
     the newsprint and woods industry generally 
     <lb/>
     going to be worth to us in the next eight or ten 
     <lb/>
     years. It is all sold, and is there any indication of 
     <lb/>
     the terms on which it has been sold? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> At the present time, as far as I know, 
     <lb/>
     the rates or prices paid for newsprint are based on 
     <lb/>
     a price fob New York, and that is at present $84 
     <lb/>
     a ton. If they send it to South America they pay 
     <lb/>
     more for it, but the basic price is $84 per ton fob 
     <lb/>
     New York, and the prospects for the next few 
     <lb/>
     years are that it will not go below that price. I 
     <lb/>
     don't know what the Bowaters contract calls for, 
     <lb/>
     but the price is the usual market price. Sometimes 
     <lb/>
     they get more than market price and sometimes 
     <lb/>
     less. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I understand that the output is 
     <lb/>
     sold for the next ten years to come, but at market 
     <lb/>
     price. In other words it will be at the 1947 market 
     <lb/>
     price, and sometimes if they want to bootleg a bit, 
     <lb/>
     they might get a bit more? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think it is only fair to touch on 
     <lb/>
     that for a moment. I have here a copy of <hi rendition="simple:italic">World 
     <lb/>
     Reporter</hi> which is a very well known publication, 
     <lb/>
     for November 5, and there is an article here called 
     <lb/>
     "Newsprint still fails to meet the world's need." 
     <lb/>
     They are running short in the world at the rate of 
     <lb/>
     1,200,000 tons a year. Canada will turn out 
     <lb/>
     4,200,000 tons this year, setting a new record. 
     <lb/>
     Three quarters of that goes to the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and the Canadian plants have reached their 
     <lb/>
     capacity. Perhaps 250,000 tons could be 
     <lb/>
     squeezed out of the Canadian mills by speeding 
     <lb/>
     up their machines, but it says "widespread expan<lb break="no"/>sion is not planned because the industry regards 
     <lb/>
     the present market as a passing phase." This 
     <lb/>
     present world wide shortage, and the high price 
     <lb/>
     based on that shortage, is, they think, a passing 
     <lb/>
     phase. Newfoundland produces 350,000 tons a 
     <lb/>
     year, but most of it goes to the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain. Expansion of capacity by 75,000 
     <lb/>
     tons will be completed by 1948. That's the 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters expansion is it not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, that will be by 1948. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It speaks of Finland, Scan<lb break="no"/>dinavia, Germany, Poland, etc., and it winds up 
     <lb/>
     by saying, "Regardless of price, however, there 
     <lb/>
     is ample evidence that the current shortage of 
     <lb/>
     newsprint on a worldwide basis will carry 
     <lb/>
     through 1947 and may reach 1948." The indica<lb break="no"/>tion is that the worldwide shortage will be over<lb break="no"/>taken in 1947 or 1948, they will catch up with the 
     <lb/>
     need. Bearing on that also, the January 25 issue 
     <lb/>
     ofthe <hi rendition="simple:italic">Financial Post</hi> has this on newsprint: "pulp 
     <lb/>
     and fine paper price up", did you read that?

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, that type of paper is not made

     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It does not mean our newsprint. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> ....Thank God we have got two 
     <lb/>good mills in Newfoundland. They are on the 
     <lb/>upward trend, and running at full capacity. One 
     <lb/>is definitely going to increase its capacity 70,000- 
     <lb break="yes"/>odd tons a year, and it seems pretty sure that in 
     <lb/>the next two or three years the price is going to 
     <lb/>look pretty good, but I don't want to delude 
     <lb/>myself into the belief that for the next eight or ten 
     <lb/>years the price is going to hold at anything like 
     <lb/>the $83 or $84 a ton that it is today. I wonder if 
     <lb/>Major Cashin can tell us what the price has been 
     <lb/>in the last four or five months? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> During the last 40 years it has 
     <lb/>
     averaged about $60 a ton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What has it been in the last four 
     <lb/>
     or five months? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well it's $84 a ton now, from about 
     <lb/>
     $40 in 1939. During the war we had difficulty 
     <lb/>
     owing to lack ofshipping, the paper was rationed, 
     <lb/>
     papers were smaller, but now everything is open 
     <lb/>
     wide and Canada is producing over four million 
     <lb/>
     tons a year. If the price goes down in New<lb break="no"/>foundland it will go down everywhere, so that it 
     <lb/>
     will affect all the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's the point I am trying to 
     <lb/>
     get at. The sale of all this paper is at market price, 
     <lb/>
     and that is what we will get. The price may go up 
     <lb/>
     or down. These are the only questions I want to 
     <lb/>
     ask Major Cashin, but I do want to say a word on 
     <lb/>
     this little supplementary report brought in today. 
     <lb/>
     This concerns the district I come from more than 
     <lb/>
     anywhere else in the country — it deals with the 
     <lb/>
     three-mile limit. I remember a speech given by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ewbank when he was Commissioner, he 
     <lb/>
     deals with this three-mile limit....<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> Do I under<lb break="no"/>stand that there is no three-mile limit left in White 
     <lb/>
     Bay? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It looks like that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He says that the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     east side of White Bay is private property. You 
     <lb/>
     have parts of this island, and I speak with per<lb break="no"/>sonal knowledge of one part of Bonavista Bay, 
     <lb/>
     where there is not a scrap of timber left on the 
     <lb/>
     three-mile limit, and yet on that stretch of coast 
     <lb/>
     you have quite a number of saw mills, and you 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     have the utterly maddening situation that the 
     <lb/>
     people are without timber on the three-mile limit. 
     <lb/>
     Yet flanking that three-mile limit, is fine first- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     class timber owned by private companies, which 
     <lb/>
     they got into their hands by grant or purchase or 
     <lb/>
     some other way. I notice that the Committee say 
     <lb/>
     that they have received numerous representations 
     <lb/>
     from certain sections of the country about this 
     <lb/>
     matter. I have no doubt that many of these were 
     <lb/>
     from Bonavista North, Gambo and other places 
     <lb/>
     around there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> The Humber as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's a sad story, but we won't 
     <lb/>
     go into that just now. i know that I am only 
     <lb/>
     wasting breath, because we are not the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the country and can't do anything about 
     <lb/>
     it. But the people who are suffering from this 
     <lb/>
     would not think very much of us if we skimped 
     <lb/>
     it over withjust a passing word. Some of us here 
     <lb/>
     may be in the next government of the country, I 
     <lb/>
     know Major Cashin hopes he will be, and I know 
     <lb/>
     I hope I am. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Glad to hear that you are converted! 
     <lb/>
     </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, I am not convened, l al<lb break="no"/>ways wanted our own government back. Some<lb break="no"/>thing has to be done. Out of that $34 million 
     <lb/>accumulated surplus that the government has we 
     <lb/>are going to have to lash out $1 million in the next 
     <lb/>year or two, to buy back from Bowaters and AND 
     <lb/>and other private owners, that timber, and make 
     <lb/>it available to the small saw mills in various parts 
     <lb/>of this island. I think when Major Cashin brings 
     <lb/>in his Finance Report he had better put that down 
     <lb/>in his budget. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Does that mean that Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood is admitting that we are going to have 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, the kind of government I 
     <lb/>
     want includes responsible government. The 
     <lb/>
     people have to have timber as much as we need 
     <lb/>
     breath, and we had better get alive to that fact. I 
     <lb/>
     am sure the people who sent these letters to you 
     <lb/>
     and me, Major Cashin, don't expect that we can 
     <lb/>
     do anything about it, and they won't blame us or 
     <lb/>
     this Convention. But so long as they know that 
     <lb/>
     we have it in the front of our mind that it has got 
     <lb/>
     to be taken care of, that's all we can do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We will put that in our first manifes<lb break="no"/>to!

<p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I would like to express my satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion about this supplementary report dealing with 
     <lb/>Labrador area. When the report came in first I 
     <lb/>was very reluctant to accept the figures of 50 to 
     <lb/>100 million cords in Labrador, but now that we 
     <lb/>have the result of this survey made by the 
     <lb/>Bowater Pulp and Paper Co., which is reliable, I 
     <lb/>am satisfied that we do have a very fine bulk of 
     <lb/>timber in Labrador.... On this 6,000 square miles 
     <lb/>there is 25 million cords of wood, and that ter<lb break="no"/>ritory is drained by the great rivers of Labrador, 
     <lb/>Hamilton, Nascopie, Goose, etc. It is a wide area 
     <lb/>and takes in the lower waters of these rivers. I was 
     <lb/>pleased that Mr. Lewin says that it is possible to 
     <lb/>put in a sulphite mill in that area. The supplemen<lb break="no"/>tary report speaks of a paper mill going up on the 
     <lb/>southwest coast. Labrador will be pleased to be 
     <lb/>able to feed that mill. I always had doubts of that 
     <lb/>but Mr. Lewin knows what he is talking about, 
     <lb/>and he says it is possible. Of course that will be 
     <lb/>one of the conditions under which any conces<lb break="no"/>sions are given for this timber. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have been tempted to ask for roads, etc. for 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, but I don't think we should take up the 
     <lb/>
     time for that. I do ask your indulgence for a few 
     <lb/>
     minutes about the possibilities of the sulphite 
     <lb/>
     mill. We have 130 - 140 families in this area that 
     <lb/>
     are going to be robbed almost completely of their 
     <lb/>
     means of livelihood down through the ages. They 
     <lb/>
     are trappers, and go far afield, and when this 
     <lb/>
     wood cutting project starts in these rivers, 
     <lb/>
     naturally it is going to destroy the trapping 
     <lb/>
     grounds, not only in the immediate vicinity but it 
     <lb/>
     will bring in other outside people who will not 
     <lb/>
     observe the customs and unwritten laws of these 
     <lb/>
     people under which they have been trapping all 
     <lb/>
     these years. These have been observed religious<lb break="no"/>ly among the people. Their trapping grounds 200 
     <lb/>
     miles away are going to be destroyed and their 
     <lb/>
     work spoilt. It will take a long time for them to 
     <lb/>
     change from that to wood cutting, and they are 
     <lb/>
     very much afraid of it. I think it is of great 
     <lb/>
     importance that whatever government is in power 
     <lb/>
     in the future Labrador is going to be represented 
     <lb/>
     on it, and this will be a point brought out at that 
     <lb/>
     time. I want the members to bear this in mind, 
     <lb/>
     when they do become members of the next 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland....

     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> ....The outlook as far as forestry is 
     <lb/>
     concerned appears for the year just opened to be 
     <lb/>
     one of continued and reasonably profitable ac<lb break="no"/>tivity. The records for l945-46 show a total ex<lb break="no"/>port value of our forest industries that exceeded 
     <lb/>
     $20 million, and at present the demand for 
     <lb/>
     woodsmen far exceeds the available supply. The 
     <lb/>
     overall picture is fairly optimistic. Mr. H.M. 
     <lb/>
     Spencer Lewin, General Manager of Bowaters 
     <lb/>
     voiced opinions which amply justify our op<lb break="no"/>timism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The forest industries have progressed to such 
     <lb/>
     a degree that today they occupy the position of 
     <lb/>
     the major asset in terms of comparative values; 
     <lb/>
     and the fact that they are not subject to the ex<lb break="no"/>tremes of booms and depressions which so char<lb break="no"/>acterise our fisheries, makes them figure still 
     <lb/>
     more prominently in the economic life of our 
     <lb/>
     country. Worthy of special notice is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the output of our mills have been sold ten years 
     <lb/>
     in advance. This bespeaks sound markets and a 
     <lb/>
     healthy demand for our products, and while it 
     <lb/>
     must be clearly understood that the ten year con<lb break="no"/>tract is naturally at the then market price, it never<lb break="no"/>theless portrays a very flourishing condition for 
     <lb/>
     our newsprint industry.

            <p>
     The tragic fire at Glovertown recalls to us the 
     <lb/>
     value of reafforestation and the importance of a 
     <lb/>
     competent forest tire patrol. It would be criminal 
     <lb/>
     negligence on the part of corporations and people 
     <lb/>
     not to do everything to prevent a repetition of 
     <lb/>
     such wanton destruction of our God-given 
     <lb/>
     wealth. Reafforestation is of great importance, 
     <lb/>
     and if our forests are not to be depleted, the 
     <lb/>
     government should replace the present passive 
     <lb/>
     policy of awaiting natural regrowth by a vigorous 
     <lb/>
     well-planned programme of reafforestation. 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, a vast potential of unknown wealth, 
     <lb/>
     may in the near future contribute in substantial 
     <lb/>
     measure to the stability and growth of our 
     <lb/>
     economy... But are the men who have to live 
     <lb/>
     from our forest resources just one big, happy and 
     <lb/>
     prosperous family? After such a pleasant 
     <lb/>
     prospect it is tragic to introduce a negative note, 
     <lb/>
     but I have a letter here from a constituent of the 
     <lb/>
     District of Bonavista Centre, and many such let<lb break="no"/>ters came to me last week.

            <p>
     I have said that I am not greatly interested in

     forms of government; as far as I am concerned,

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Dear Sir: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With the opening of the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, I wish to draw your attention for a few 
     <lb/>
     moments — knowing you are appointed one 
     <lb/>
     of the Forestry Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What I wish for you to do, is to put before 
     <lb/>
     your committee the circumstances of the 
     <lb/>
     sawmill owners and the general public of the 
     <lb/>
     east coast of Bonavista Bay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this district there are quite a number of 
     <lb/>
     sawmills which support quite a number of 
     <lb/>
     families and do a lot of good. Without these 
     <lb/>
     mills, the people of the east coast would be 
     <lb/>
     in a very awkward position for building pur<lb break="no"/>poses. In the very near future — if something 
     <lb/>
     is not done — if we need say one hundred 
     <lb/>
     feet of lumber, we will have to import it from 
     <lb/>
     Canada, which to my idea should not be 
     <lb/>
     necessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it time we should get busy and 
     <lb/>
     demand a certain cutting plan, not that I want 
     <lb/>
     to interfere with the operations of any of the 
     <lb/>
     companies; I will say there is sufficient tim<lb break="no"/>ber if laid out in the proper way, so will you 
     <lb/>
     kindly do your best to get something done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To my mind the forestry situation is 
     <lb/>
     similar to the road building in this country; a 
     <lb/>
     few places get all the roads leaving the others 
     <lb/>
     with nothing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hoping to hear from you in the near fu<lb break="no"/>ture.

            <p>
     We may be forced to import lumber for our 
     <lb/>
     people. The fishing industry cannot exist without 
     <lb/>
     timber resources. My friends down in 
     <lb/>
     Greenspond must have material to build boats. 
     <lb/>
     They must cut wood to erect stages, and they 
     <lb/>
     must have fuel. Obviously none of today's tem<lb break="no"/>porary political administrators in this country 
     <lb/>
     care two hoots as to what happens to the fisher<lb break="no"/>men, planter, or the small mill owner. Their very 
     <lb/>
     existence is dependent on the forests of our is<lb break="no"/>land. Have these men a case? Their fathers 
     <lb/>
     pioneered and blazed the trails. Now this 
     <lb/>
     birthright is gone; they may not operate their 
     <lb/>
     mills; they may not erect a shipbuilding yard. 
     <lb/>
     This deplorable situation cannot be laid at the 
     <lb/>
     doors of the large newsprint corporations — 
     <lb/>
     rather it is to be placed squarely on the shoulders 
    

            <cb/>
           
     of the government which permitted such a thing 
     <lb/>
     to happen.

            <p>
     The two paper companies play a big role in the 
     <lb/>
     economic life of Newfoundland. Both are 
     <lb/>
     progressively managed and contribute in a large 
     <lb/>
     way to the welfare of our people. But I affirm that 
     <lb/>
    the two past governments have blundered in per<lb break="no"/>mitting the leasing of the timber limits around the 
     <lb/>coastal belt of our island; but sympathy is not 
     <lb/>enough.... These men have a case. They have to 
     <lb/>protest....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Mr. Chairman, before the com<lb break="no"/>mittee rises, I would like to make a few observa<lb break="no"/>tions. What I would like to see is a statement 
     <lb/>
     showing how much money from the products of 
     <lb/>
     the forests remains in Newfoundland. We know 
     <lb/>
     some money goes out, but we are mostly inter<lb break="no"/>ested in what remains. The people in our section 
     <lb/>
     were greatly disappointed when we realized that 
     <lb/>
     there would not be a mill on the Gander River, 
     <lb/>
     because we hoped to have a great deal of employ<lb break="no"/>ment for the people of Notre Dame Bay and it 
     <lb/>
     was also hoped that mill would be able to utilise 
     <lb/>
     a considerable quantity of the timber on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't want it to be thought that I have any 
     <lb/>
     fantastic ideas on the value of Labrador, yet I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that we have an asset of great potential 
     <lb/>
     value, and that this territory should be safe<lb break="no"/>guarded for generations to come, and not be 
     <lb/>
     bartered away. We have minerals, tremendous 
     <lb/>
     water-power, the Hamilton River, and ten main 
     <lb/>
     rivers in Labrador, a territory almost three times 
     <lb/>
     as large as Newfoundland, and twice as large as 
     <lb/>
     England. I hope and trust that these assets and 
     <lb/>
     natural resources will be so utilised that they will 
     <lb/>
     be an increasing earning power for our people. 
     <lb/>
     The matter ofa sulphite mill (I presume to be run 
     <lb/>
     by waterpower) is an admirable suggestion.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I see that the government are making plans for 
     <lb/>
     a complete survey of Labrador timber, and I trust 
     <lb/>
     the people who make this survey will be com<lb break="no"/>petent to do it by an aerial survey and also a 
     <lb/>
     survey by land. It would be a good idea for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to put up a paper mill to 
     <lb/>
     be run on a co-operative basis, but unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     we are a small country. While we have many 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars in the banks yet, unfortunate<lb break="no"/>

     ly, we have to look to outside interests, these big 
     <lb/>
     companies to come here and start these in<lb break="no"/>dustries. We are glad to have them here, but we 
     <lb/>
     want to be very careful when we are making 
     <lb/>
     arrangements with these big companies. I think 
     <lb/>
     one of these companies is protected, as far as the 
     <lb/>
     tax they have to pay is concerned, up to 1973.... 
     <lb/>
     All these resources that can be manufactured in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland mean much more to us than if we 
     <lb/>
     export raw wood. We know the coal mines in 
     <lb/>
     England need the pit props, and that there is a 
     <lb/>
     demand for wood for export, but the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland will be served by manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing into finished products as much of the assets 
     <lb/>
     of our country as we can possibly do.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Speaking of forms of government, 
     <lb/>
     and remembering the old adage "politics makes 
     <lb/>
     strange bed-fellows", and referring to the state<lb break="no"/>ment by Mr. Smallwood that he hoped that he and 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin would be in the same government, 
     <lb/>
     I was wondering just what form of government 
     <lb/>
     that would be. But what I really meant to say was 
     <lb/>
     that I was very impressed by the addition to the 
     <lb/>
     supplementary report, and I think that particular 
     <lb/>
     aspects should be stressed very highly — the 
     <lb/>
     three-mile limit has practically nothing left on it. 
     <lb/>
     I think, if possible, the recommendations of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee should be carried out in some form, 
     <lb/>
     and possibly if we tacked a little more on it the 
     <lb/>
     powers that be may be impressed, otherwise all 
     <lb/>
     that will be left for these people will be "small 
     <lb/>
     wood".... With reference to the sulphite mill in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, is it a fact that sulphite pulp cannot be 
     <lb/>
     kept very long as it goes sour, and that is why 
     <lb/>
     there is no sulphite mill there at the present time? 
     <lb/>
     The other question is, can you split up that $5 
     <lb/>
     million extra over the $20 million for New<lb break="no"/>foundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> ....I understand there is now some 
     <lb/>
     process whereby they can store sulphite for a

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That was not so in the past was it? 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, not years ago. With regard to 
     <lb/>splitting up that $5 million, I would like to have 
     <lb/>it here to divide between us! But the labour from 
     <lb/>that sulphite mill, that is the manufacturing, 
     <lb/>would average $40 a ton. You would want a 
     <lb/>capital of roughly $5 million to build town sites, 
     <lb/>wharves, etc., to produce 100,000 tons of wood 
    

            <cb/>
        
     or more a year, and that would give from $1.5 —

     $2 million earning power. Is that satisfactory?

     In 1939 Mr. Ewbank said this: "We have not 
     <lb/>
     yet made a complete survey of the timber on 
     <lb/>
     Crown lands, but the Forestry Officer, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Turner, has been collecting data for some years 
     <lb/>
     and now reports that he has enough information 
     <lb/>
     on which to make a rough estimate. He calculates 
     <lb/>
     that the total value of soft wood on Crown lands 
     <lb/>
     is not more than six million cords. In addition 
     <lb/>
     there is a good deal of acreage where young trees 
     <lb/>
     are growing up after burning. He calculates that 
     <lb/>
     there would be two million cords of growing 
     <lb/>
     stock." That gives us eight million cords of soft 
     <lb/>
     wood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I come to the Report, page 12, paragraph 
     <lb/>
     10: "From information given us we find that, the 
     <lb/>
     total amount of wood available on Crown lands 
     <lb/>
     is roughly five million cords (excluding birch) 
     <lb/>
     and the total amount on leased lands is 60 million 
     <lb/>
     cords." The point I want to make is that in 1914 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Newfoundland estimated that 
     <lb/>
     the Crown had in this island 10,000 square miles 
     <lb/>
     of timber. In 1939 the government estimated 
     <lb/>
     eight million cords of soft wood, that is counting 
     <lb/>
     two million cords of young stuff that was just

     growing where it had been burnt over. Now the 
     <lb/>
     government estimates a total of roughly five mil<lb break="no"/>lion cords, not counting birch. What I am getting 
     <lb/>
     at is this: does anyone know how much timber 
     <lb/>
     we have in Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The companies know what they

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But does anyone know how 
     <lb/>
     much timber we have belonging to the Crown?

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, I don't believe so.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if the Convention 
     <lb/>
     realises what a damning reply that is. Not damn<lb break="no"/>ing to the Forestry Committee now, but to the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, particularly damn<lb break="no"/>ing to them, but damning to every government 
     <lb/>
     we have ever had. For 13 years they have been in 
     <lb/>
     this country and surely within the first six months 
     <lb/>
     they would have taken immediate steps not mere<lb break="no"/>ly to find out how much timber we had in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but how much minerals, and how 
     <lb/>
     much waterpower. Today they still don't know 
     <lb/>
     how much timber the Crown owns in this 
     <lb/>
     country; or how much waterpower is here. The 
     <lb/>
     other day the government decided to get a 
     <lb/>
     hydroelectric engineer to come and make a sur<lb break="no"/>vey of the waterpower — after 13 years! And 
     <lb/>
     here we are trying to make an appraisal of the 
     <lb/>
     value of the resources of the country, and we 
     <lb/>
     don't know yet (a) how much timber we have, (b) 
     <lb/>
     how much waterpower we have, (c) how much 
     <lb/>
     minerals. Major Cashin is looking very pleased, 
     <lb/>
     but I am not saying it for his benefit, that is the 
     <lb/>
     position. Would Major Cashin tell us frankly that 
     <lb/>
     he does not know and the Committee does not 
     <lb/>
     know?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The only information is what we 
     <lb/>
     have got from the Department of Natural Resour<lb break="no"/>ces — about five million cords.

     he did not do it. I am rather disappointed.

     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> Hitherto I have taken very

     little part in debate on the different reports. For

     this reason, and also because of the fact that you

     have patiently tolerated irrelevancy in the past, I 
     <lb/>
     now tmst that you will allow me some latitude if 
     <lb/>
     I too am a bit irrelevant. I did not take part in 
     <lb/>
     debates for various reasons, chief of which was 
     <lb/>
     that I always felt, and still do, that we should 
     <lb/>
     never have had public sessions and that we would 
     <lb/>
     have done our work much more efficiently and 
     <lb/>
     with less politics if we had had a summary of our 
     <lb/>
     proceedings given weekly to the press and broad<lb break="no"/>casting stations. lt is a rather late date to be 
     <lb/>
     expressing such opinions — I give them now 
     <lb/>
     only because some of the people in my district 
     <lb/>
     listening to the various speakers talking of roads, 
     <lb/>
     etc., in their districts seem to think that those 
     <lb/>
     districts are going to have a lot of public funds 
     <lb/>
     expended there, and are afraid that history will 
     <lb/>
     repeat itself as in the old days of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government when it was said, "All gone and none 
     <lb/>
     for St. Mary's". This phrase originated pre<lb break="no"/>sumably because of the fact that St. Mary's dis<lb break="no"/>trict never seemed to be able to get anything done 
     <lb/>
     from the Public Works Department. I wish to 
     <lb/>
     assure them that were it a matter of voicing our 
     <lb/>
     needs at this Convention, I would be on my feet 
     <lb/>
     as readily as any of the delegates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> this supplement to the Report 
     <lb/>
     of the Forestry Committee is very encouraging 
     <lb/>
     and the co-operation of Mr. Lewin in giving us 
     <lb/>
     the results of his company's private surveys is to 
     <lb/>
     be appreciated. I am not over-enthused over these 
     <lb/>
     companies getting so much control over so much 
     <lb/>
     of our territory. The different governments in the 
     <lb/>
     past have made a rather thorough job of giving 
     <lb/>
     away our assets — waterpower and forests. The 
     <lb/>
     paper companies have virtually closed towns 
     <lb/>
     with the corporations controlling everything and 
     <lb/>
     we, the owners, even leave it to them to carry out 
     <lb/>
     a scientific reafforestation policy. It is quite true 
     <lb/>
     that these industries leave considerable money in 
     <lb/>
     the country but it is only sufficient to operate their 
     <lb/>
     work and the profits go outside the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we are to judge by the different committee 
   

            <pb n="293" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-02-06_Page_0293.jpg"/>

     reports received to date which recommend an 
     <lb/>
     additional expenditure in every department of 
     <lb/>
     government, it would seem that we cannot look 
     <lb/>
     forward with any degree of optimism to being 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting, when we consider the enormous 
     <lb/>
     expenditure at present. However, this may not be 
     <lb/>
     a true picture. We have been told that our 
     <lb/>
     economy is affected by things outside our con<lb break="no"/>trol. This is only partly true and might be partially 
     <lb/>
     overcome by a revised policy with a progressive 
     <lb/>
     programme to lessen these outside influences. 
     <lb/>
     Also we should produce in this country as much 
     <lb/>
     of our necessities which can economically be 
     <lb/>
     produced. We have plenty fish, and I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced and I believe the report of the Agriculture 
     <lb/>
     Committee will convince you that we can 
     <lb/>
     economically produce beef, pork, veal, lamb, 
     <lb/>
     chicken, potatoes, cabbage and turnips — besides 
     <lb/>
     other vegetables — as also milk and butter. If we 
     <lb/>
     can do this we should be able to export fish 
     <lb/>
     enough to give us a good surplus for luxuries, 
     <lb/>
     after buying the essential foods, clothing, etc., 
     <lb/>
     which we cannot produce ourselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It should be obvious that the salvation of this 
     <lb/>
     country is primarily the fisheries from which the 
     <lb/>
     bulk of the profits are ploughed back into the 
     <lb/>
     industry. Fresh frozen fish in particular should be 
     <lb/>
     encouraged and exploited to the full with an 
     <lb/>
     advertising campaign to secure more markets, 
     <lb/>
     and which is very important, marketing in local 
     <lb/>
     bottoms. Most important if we are to encourage 
     <lb/>
     young men to go back to the fisheries is that we 
     <lb/>
     re-organise the whole set-up for a more equitable 
     <lb/>
     distribution of the profits so that the primary 
     <lb/>
     producer, the fisherman, gets returns capable of 
     <lb/>
     giving his family the ordinary amenities of life. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As pointed out we should expect some assis<lb break="no"/>tance in securing markets, by reason of the lease 
     <lb/>
     of bases to the United States of America and 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Most Newfoundlanders feel that we got 
     <lb/>
     a rotten deal as we got only the labour value of 
     <lb/>
     construction, and even this was considerably 
     <lb/>
     reduced due to our own government limiting the 
     <lb/>
     rate which Newfoundlanders should be paid. 
     <lb/>
     These bases were necessary for the joint defence 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom, the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America and Canada; therefore we should get 
     <lb/>
     special consideration by all three countries, 
     <lb/>
     whether by tariff concessions or otherwise in the 
     <lb/>
     development of markets. I will not now deal with 
     <lb/>
     the absurdity of a little country without planes of 
     

            <cb/>
           
     its own operating an airport, the facilities of 
     <lb/>
     which are enjoyed by the international transport 
     <lb/>
     system. Personally I don't think we are losing any 
     <lb/>
     money by it but do feel that we could use it to 
     <lb/>
     better advantage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In addition we have imports, the importance 
     <lb/>
     of which is often overlooked — banking, in<lb break="no"/>surance, and ocean freights as examples. These 
     <lb/>
     are a drain on our economy even though they do 
     <lb/>
     leave a certain amount of money in the country 
     <lb/>
     in salaries, commissions, etc. We pay high rates 
     <lb/>
     with the money going to foreign concerns, whilst 
     <lb/>
     our own people are investing their money outside 
     <lb/>
     this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Should our future government take steps to 
     <lb/>
     remedy some if not all of these conditions, we 
     <lb/>
     could then indeed look forward with optimism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Most delegates have spoken of conditions in 
     <lb/>
     their districts, particularly road conditions. If you 
     <lb/>
     will permit me, I would make a few observations 
     <lb/>
     on my district. Road conditions in general are far 
     <lb/>
     below the level of secondary highroads with 
     <lb/>
     many sections without any roads. The people of 
     <lb/>
     Colinet Island, where there are two settlements 
     <lb/>
     of about 50 families who make a comfortable 
     <lb/>
     living from the fisheries, have been seeking for 
     <lb/>
     years assistance in the building of six miles of 
     <lb/>
     road. Colinet island is about one-half mile from 
     <lb/>
     Admiral's Beach, a settlement on the mainland, 
     <lb/>
     six miles from O'Donnell's, which at the present 
     <lb/>
     time is the end of the road connecting through to 
     <lb/>
     St. John's and other points on the Avalon. It is 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary for me to elaborate on the con<lb break="no"/>venience and necessity of this road to these 
     <lb/>
     people. Another instance of neglect is the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of North Harbour, one of the best harbours 
     <lb/>
     on the Newfoundland coast, where they have no 
     <lb/>
     road nor even telephone communication. Five 
     <lb/>
     miles of road would connect North Harbour with 
     <lb/>
     the Argentia highroad at a point near Colinet. The 
     <lb/>
     lack of it necessitates a motorboat journey of 20 
     <lb/>
     miles, and in the case of medical attention or 
     <lb/>
     hospitalisation, this is not only very unpleasant 
     <lb/>
     and dangerous, but sometimes impossible. Both 
     <lb/>
     these settlements get a weekly mail service, 
     <lb/>
     where the courier who carries the mail on his 
     <lb/>
     shoulders gets around $7 per round trip. Mal Bay, 
     <lb/>
     where there are about 40 families, has no post 
     <lb/>
     office or mail service. I could go on picturing the 
     <lb/>
     utter disregard towards the people of Trepassey, 
     <lb/>
     where they are cut off all winter without medical

     services of any kind. However, I see no point in 
     <lb/>
     enumerating the various needs of our districts and 
     <lb/>
     I feel sure that the people in St. Mary's district 
     <lb/>
     realise just what the Convention was appointed 
     <lb/>
     to do. I wish to assure them that I have great 
     <lb/>
     optimism for the future of this country and feel

     confident that never again shall it be said, "All

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think it is off the line, but as the 
     <lb/>
     communication came to me I passed it to him and 
     <lb/>
     I feel he should give it to the people. Perhaps he 
     <lb/>
     might for a moment tell what his constituents 
     <lb/>
     want. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> I think I made it very clear 
     <lb/>
     that I believe the people of St. Mary's realise 
     <lb/>
     what the Convention was appointed to do here, 
     <lb/>
     and, as I said at the beginning of my talk, we are 
     <lb/>
     not here to talk of the needs of our different 
     <lb/>
     settlements. If most of the delegates had realised 
     <lb/>
     that from the beginning we would probably have 
     <lb/>
     finished up our work by this time. As I told Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins, if this gentleman wants to have anything 
     <lb/>
     spoken of about his district he will communicate 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. McCormack and not Mr. Higgins. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In rising to ask Major Cashin a 
     <lb/>
     question I congratulate him on the complete 
     <lb/>
     report his Committee has brought in, and I would 
     <lb/>
     also like to congratulate both him and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood on the affability with which they 
     <lb/>
     carried on their conversation today. I would like 
     <lb/>
     to ask if your Committee had any discussion with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Lewin relative to the matter of either reaf<lb break="no"/>forestation or afforestation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, there was. I just give it to you 
     <lb/>
     from memory. We covered reafforestation in this 
 

            <cb/>
           
     Report, I think you were there, and he told us that 
     <lb/>
     an expert who came here about a year and a half 
     <lb/>
     ago, went into the matter and made certain 
     <lb/>
     recommendations, and the two companies 
     <lb/>
     together were prepared to pay two-thirds of this 
     <lb/>
     reafforestation, the total cost being around 
     <lb/>
     $19,000. They were prepared to put up two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thirds, but the government refused to put up the 
     <lb/>
     other one-third, feeling that it would be an awful 
     <lb/>
     thing for the government to put up $6 - 7,000. 
     <lb/>
     That is the matter this gentleman was down here 
     <lb/>
     to discuss.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Where were they to reafforest, 
     <lb/>
     was it company grounds? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh no, it was general. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> While you are on your feet, is 
     <lb/>
     that this Avalon Peninsula scheme that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lewin spoke of? We know that the Avalon is 
     <lb/>
     nearly barren now, is that the scheme? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, and Bonavista and other 
     <lb/>
     places. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The companies were willing to 
     <lb/>
     pay two-thirds? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I understood it was also on the 
     <lb/>
     three-mile limit, and it would take ten years to 
     <lb/>
     develop. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. It would cost $19,000 I think.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How much land would that

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I could not tell you that.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to ask Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin one final question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Good.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All this information you have 
     <lb/>
     here in your supplementary report about the tim<lb break="no"/>ber in Labrador, is information apparently that 
     <lb/>
     you got from Mr. Lewin. Right?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, I don't think so, it was 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters private property which they paid for in

     Report of the Local Industries Committee:¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, before the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary reads the report I would like to say that 
     <lb/>
     I do not intend to introduce it with a long talk, 
     <lb/>
     because after it has been read it will be only a 
     <lb/>
     matter of duplication. I would like to point out 
     <lb/>
     that, with respect to local industries, pulp and 
     <lb/>
     paper, mining, fisheries and forestry have their 
     <lb/>
     own committees, so consequently we could not 
     <lb/>
     touch on those and had to confine ourselves to the 
     <lb/>
     smaller or secondary industries. We did not have 
     <lb/>
     any statistics or sources of information whatever. 
     <lb/>
     We tried several channels but could not get any<lb break="no"/>thing on which to base our report. That presented 
     <lb/>
     quite a difficulty with the result that the report is 
     <lb/>
     not as complete as if there had been a statistical 
     <lb/>
     department of the government which had kept 
     <lb/>
     these figures over a number of years, and which 
     <lb/>
     could have given us comparative figures. This is 
     <lb/>
     a disappointment to the Committee, and perhaps 
     <lb/>
     to you too. The Committee worked very hard, and 
     <lb/>
     everything possible was done. You will see now 
     <lb/>
     that we have had a job in collecting a lot of that. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>[The Secretary read part of the report] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin May I ask Mr. Hickman to turn back 
     <lb/>
     to page 3. I notice here that tobacco and cordage 
     <lb/>
     are grouped as one. Was it not possible to have 
     <lb/>
     them separate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman No. The questionnaire was sent 
     <lb/>
     out separately and we received one reply from the 
     <lb/>
     industries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin They came together and ganged up? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hickman Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin I appreciate there are many mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this Convention who may not understand 
     <lb/>
     protective tariffs, and that is why I asked Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hickman why these three things were put 
     <lb/>
     together. You will probably remember 22 years 
     <lb/>
     ago I made my House of Assembly debut on 
     <lb/>
     protective tariffs, and one of these industries was 
     <lb/>
     tobacco. That's one particular fault I find with 
     <lb/>
     this report; it does not show the protective tariff 
     <lb/>
     these industries have. I agree in principle they 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     should have a certain amount of protection, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly when they are local, but here is one now 
     <lb/>
     that says it will not give full particulars, the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Tobacco Co. Over 60% of the stock of 
     <lb/>
     that company is held outside the country, ap<lb break="no"/>proximately 60% on watered stock, and they 
     <lb/>
     have a protection of.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Would you explain watering 
     <lb/>
     stock? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin When the company started we will 
     <lb/>
     assume that they have so many shares, I am 
     <lb/>
     bringing my mind back 20 years, and at that time 
     <lb/>
     they had watered their stock several times. That 
     <lb/>
     means that if they put in $100 and they were 
     <lb/>
     getting 15% on it, then the next year, if they 
     <lb/>
     watered it and made those shares worth $200, that 
     <lb/>
     would mean that they were getting 30% on their 
     <lb/>
     original investment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood What is "watering"? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin If they have a good year, and they 
     <lb/>
     pay a 20% dividend on their common stock, they 
     <lb/>
     would "water" that and give two shares for one. 
     <lb/>
     I am not particularly opposed to protective tariffs, 
     <lb/>
     but this company has $550,000 a year in protec<lb break="no"/>tive tariffs, and I think the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     should know, and also the members of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention. What is the use of this Convention if we 
     <lb/>
     can't get these facts? Here we have it borne out 
     <lb/>
     — three companies gang up and say, "We won't 
     <lb/>
     give the facts". I did not intend to speak on this, 
     <lb/>
     but I saw here that they had 218 employees 
     <lb/>
     between the three of them, and they pay $400,000 
     <lb/>
     wages that is about $1,700 on average. Now some 
     <lb/>
     of our other industries that belong to New<lb break="no"/>foundland and have protection, pay much more 
     <lb/>
     on an average than these people do to their 
     <lb/>
     employees. They are also paying 45% dividends 
     <lb/>
     on theirstock. This is fact and it should be known. 
     <lb/>
     The protection has been increased by the Com<lb break="no"/>mission govemment. I am sorry that we have not 
     <lb/>
     got a copy of the tariff here, so that we could work 
     <lb/>
     it out. I think I gave some statistics to some 
     <lb/>
