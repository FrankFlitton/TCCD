     coming from? Certainly not from Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in any numbers, so where will we get any revenue 
     <lb/>
     from the work that will be supplied there? Under 
     <lb/>
     the old act we would get 10 cents per ton, and I 
     <lb/>
     have yet to see who could advise that that 10 cents 
     <lb/>
     per ton be taken off.... Can anybody here tell me 
     <lb/>
     how iron ore mines in Michigan in 1944, when 
     <lb/>
     the war was at its height, how these mines could 
     <lb/>
     operate at a loss and continue operating? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The same as our fish merchants 
     <lb/>
     do. They always operate at a loss. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Where do they get the capital?

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They had a lot when they 
     <lb/>started. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, I know all about that. I know a 
     <lb/>
     good many fish merchants who had nothing when 
     <lb/>
     they started and have a lot now. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     remind some of my friends here that in Quebec 
     <lb/>
     the royalty paid is per horsepower. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Installed horsepower. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Yes, $1 per horsepower in Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     and why in Newfoundland should we say that 15 
     <lb/>
     cents is a very good figure? I can't understand it. 
     <lb/>
     Application has been made for the export of 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     water-power, and I am of the opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     country, or the government, should not, or rather 
     <lb/>
     that before any such license is granted, the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter of royalties, both on ore and on water<lb break="no"/>power should be again raised. I would almost be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to make a motion to this effect. I can see 
     <lb/>
     that the revenue of this country cannot be en<lb break="no"/>hanced in the next 25 years, either by income, 
     <lb/>
     royalties or labour, through the 1944 act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Newell ....We are a country with certain 
     <lb/>
     minerals, and we require employment for a cer<lb break="no"/>tain number of men, and we think that's a 
     <lb/>
     desirable end. On the other hand there is a com<lb break="no"/>pany which has capital which it wishes to invest, 
     <lb/>
     solely that it may make profits. The two meet and 
     <lb/>
     do a bit of bargaining. The country is not con<lb break="no"/>cerned about the interests of the company, and 
     <lb/>
     neither is the company concerned about the 
     <lb/>
     country. They are both out to make the hardest 
     <lb/>
    bargain. It looks to me as if we have been driven 
     <lb/>the hardest bargain...

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr Chairman, I move the following 
     <lb/>
     resolution: that the members of this National 
     <lb/>
    Convention desire to record their profound sor<lb break="no"/>row at the passing of Sir John C. Puddester, Com<lb break="no"/>missioner for Public Health and Welfare, and to 
     <lb/>convey to his family the hope that the Almighty 
     <lb/>Father will be present with them in their bereave<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, this morning Sir John Pud<lb break="no"/>dester passed away. I have known Sir John Pud<lb break="no"/>dester, both in public and private life for a period 
     <lb/>
     of over a quarter of a century. In the year 1920-21 
     <lb/>
     and on to 1924 he was prominently identified 
     <lb/>
     with the political party in Newfoundland which 
     <lb/>
     was led by my father. In 1924 he was elected to 
     <lb/>
     the district of Bay de Verde in the Monroe 
     <lb/>
     government, and in 1932 he became Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary in the Alderdice government, follow<lb break="no"/>ing which, Puddester was appointed Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner for Public Health and Welfare, which 
     <lb/>
     office he has filled since the inception of Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Personally, Sir John and I have differed on 
     <lb/>
     many occasions on political matters, but now that 
     <lb/>
     he has passed to his eternal reward, I pay him 
  

            <cb/>
            

     tribute in this respect, that ever since he assumed 
     <lb/>
     office in 1934 he has devoted all his efforts, to the 
     <lb/>
     best of his ability, to build up the social services 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, and today we have many 
     <lb/>
     memorials to his credit in the form of cottage 
     <lb/>
     hospitals in various sections of the country, 
     <lb/>
     sanatoriums in other sections, and a large exten<lb break="no"/>sion to the St. John's General Hospital, as well as 
     <lb/>
     further extensions to the sanatorium on Topsail 
     <lb/>
     Road. I feel sure that Sir John was prominently 
     <lb/>
     identified with the building and acquisition of 
     <lb/>
     these various institutions, which are essential to 
     <lb/>
     the public health of our people; therefore I feel 
     <lb/>
     that this afternoon it is my sad duty to move this 
     <lb/>
     resolution and to ask that it be sent to the family 
     <lb/>
     of the deceased. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think perhaps this 
     <lb/>
     resolution might have better been seconded by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Starkes, who was connected with the House 
     <lb/>
     of Assembly. I did not ever come in close contact 
     <lb/>
     with Sir John, as a member of the upper house, 
     <lb/>
     but I always had a respect for him, especially for 
     <lb/>
     his convictions, and also, more especially I think 
     <lb/>
     than anything else, for his capacity for work. He 
     <lb/>
     certainly worked hard in the interest of the

     country, as he believed in the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     country, whatever other people may think. He 
     <lb/>
     was a conscientious worker and a firm believer 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, and I don't think I can add 
  

            <cb/>
         

     much now to what our friend Major Cashin has 
     <lb/>
     so eloquently expressed. I have much pleasure in 
     <lb/>
     seconding that resolution.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, before we go into

     the discussion of the report proper I want to draw 
     <lb/>
     your attention to a report I only received a short 
     <lb/>
     time ago, with respect to the Hamilton River, and 
     <lb/>
     in particular to the Muskrat Falls. This is a report 
     <lb/>
     which was made by a qualified engineer in 
     <lb/>
     1909.... That falls, which this report says is able 
     <lb/>
     to develop 1,100,000 horsepower, is now con<lb break="no"/>trolled by the Royal Bank of Canada at a rental 
     <lb/>
     of $30 per year. The Muskrat is below the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> on the same river, is that right Mr. Burry? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> That is right, I know it very, very 
     <lb/>well.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Has the company the right to 
     <lb/>
     apply for water-power from that falls as well as 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Falls? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, they might make a dicker 
     <lb/>
     with the Royal Bank of Canada, because they 
     <lb/>
     have the use of it for $30 per year. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> How come they have it?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The concession to the Muskrat 
     <lb/>
     Falls was originally held by the Dickie Co., 
     <lb/>
     which was a lumber company, and they owed 
     <lb/>
     money to the Royal Bank, and when they went 
     <lb/>
     into liquidation the bank took it over. I think 
     <lb/>
     that's correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is correct.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Do you happen to know the 
     <lb/>
     terms and conditions of the Dickie lease which 
     <lb/>
     the Royal Bank now owns?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> 99 years from 1901, according to this.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, that's practically as good as 
     <lb/>the Americans in Fort Pepperell.<ref target="#fn_03">[3]</ref>

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, the only difference would be

     that if the company required extra power, other

     revealed insofar as they affect the economy of 
     <lb/>
     this country. I have no intention of getting bogged 
     <lb/>
     down again in sections and sub-sections of legis<lb break="no"/>lation enacted by the present and past govern<lb break="no"/>ments, the wisdom of which have been 
     <lb/>
     questioned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is primarily a fishing country and the 
     <lb/>
     majority of our people is dependent on that in<lb break="no"/>dustry. For years it was our only industry. But it 
     <lb/>
     is a fact, gentlemen, that the more diversified a 
     <lb/>
     country's economy, the greater is its chance of 
     <lb/>
     survival and if this report is instrumental in 
     <lb/>
     making our people more mineral conscious, then 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion it will have accomplished one 
     <lb/>
     important thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is interesting to note that the Geological 
     <lb/>
     Survey has to date investigated some 27 different 
     <lb/>
     metals and/or minerals, and have published some 
     <lb/>
     25 bulletins, maps and circulars on these inves<lb break="no"/>tigations, some of which have been supplied you 
     <lb/>
     by the Committee. It has been shown that mining 
     <lb/>
     is the most highly paid industry in the country as 
     <lb/>
     far as the average wage is concerned Over 3,000 
     <lb/>
     men find employment, about 2,800 of these in the 
     <lb/>
     two major operations at Bell Island and Buchans, 
     <lb/>
     the remainder at St. Lawrence and Aguathuna. 
     <lb/>
     Last year these 3,000 men earned approximatley 
     <lb/>
     $6 million. It is therefore evident how important 
     <lb/>
     it is that no efort be spared in developing our 
     <lb/>
     known mineral assets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is encouraging to note that the LaManche 
     <lb/>
     mines may again go into production after lying 
     <lb/>
     dormant for some 23 years, and the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     a townsite near the asbestos desposit on the west 
     <lb/>
     coast, where another 1,000 men will be gainfully 
     <lb/>
     employed. This augurs well for the future and I 
     <lb/>
     feel that if we had more holes in the ground like 
     <lb/>
     those at Buchans and Bell Island, we need have 
     <lb/>
     no fear about being self-supporting. We have in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador one of the greatest known mineral 
     <lb/>
     deposits of its kind in the world, and as far as we 
     <lb/>
     can see at the present time, there is every 
     <lb/>
     likelihood that it will be in operation in two or 
     <lb/>
     three years' time. It is difficult for us to realise 
     <lb/>
     the magnitude of this proposed operation. We 
     <lb/>
     have never had anything approaching it before in 
     <lb/>
     all our long history. Imagine, gentlemen, in the 
     <lb/>
     unknown interior of the vast expanse of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, a self-contained modern mining town 
     <lb/>
     five times as great as Bell Island, insofar as 
 

            <cb/>
            

     production and population is concerned. A 
     <lb/>
     townsite served by an electrified railway over 
     <lb/>
     which will pass daily ten trains of 60 cars each, 
     <lb/>
     carrying some 40,000 tons of ore, in addition to 
     <lb/>
     the traffic necessary for the normal needs of the 
     <lb/>
     population. It is, gentlemen, as Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     expressed it yesterday, "a monumental scheme". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of all that has been said here these last 
     <lb/>
     few days, it is evident that there is some dif<lb break="no"/>ference of opinion regarding the amount by 
     <lb/>
     which the treasury of this country is to benefit 
     <lb/>
     directly. As our chairman has pointed out to you, 
     <lb/>
     the information regarding the Quebec agreement 
     <lb/>
     came into the possession of the Committee since 
     <lb/>
     our report was presented, therefore we have not 
     <lb/>
     given you our considered opinions, but instead 
     <lb/>
     have presented you with all the facts at our dis<lb break="no"/>posal. Anything I may say is not necessarily the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the Mining Committee. I am still in<lb break="no"/>clined to believe that the 1938 act contained more 
     <lb/>
     advantages than does the 1944 act, insofar as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is concerned. But then that is only 
     <lb/>
     a personal opinion, and personal opinions are apt 
     <lb/>
     to be prejudiced, and in fact we have had legal 
     <lb/>
     and expert advice on the subject and all tend to 
     <lb/>
     discredit that belief. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is quite possible, that conscious of past 
     <lb/>
     experiences, we may be loath to believe the true 
     <lb/>
     facts when we are confronted with them. How<lb break="no"/>ever, those who are supposed to know, and in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion should have the best interest of this 
     <lb/>
     country at heart, state emphatically that our 
     <lb/>
     agreement of 1944 compares favourably with the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec agreement, and that under the l938 
     <lb/>
     agreement the company could not operate. If we 
     <lb/>
     were to have this major development in our ter<lb break="no"/>ritory it could only under the terms of the 1944 
     <lb/>
     act, and if we can believe this we would be 
     <lb/>
     justified in accepting this agreement in the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of the country as a whole. I fear that any 
     <lb/>
     arguments l have heard expressed in this assemb<lb break="no"/>ly would be very ineffective as compared with 
     <lb/>
     those advanced by mining experts whose in<lb break="no"/>tegrity has, we are told, been long established. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, there is one point I would like to 
     <lb/>
     make; I find no equivalent in our act to compare 
     <lb/>
     with sections A and B, clause 3 of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     act<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> which would on the basis of licensed areas 
     <lb/>
     have netted this country $350,000 to date. We did 
     <lb/>
     not get that $350,000. True we have the benefits

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Chairman, there seems to be 
     <lb/>
     little doubt left in the minds of the delegates here 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland has been again handed a raw 
     <lb/>
     deal in respect to the agreement made by the 
     <lb/>
     government with the Labrador Mining and Ex<lb break="no"/>ploration Co., Ltd. The very fact that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, on request from the company, changed the 
     <lb/>
     original agreement from a 10 cents per ton royal<lb break="no"/>ty to 5% on the net profits has tended to create 
     <lb/>
     suspicion. It appears to be an established practice 
     <lb/>
     for such companies to be associated with sub<lb break="no"/>sidiary companies, and it usually turns out that 
     <lb/>
     the original company shows little or no profit on 
     <lb/>
     its operations. Therefore the 5% on profits could 
     <lb/>
     mean nothing if there is no profit shown.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must disagree with the remarks of Mr. Butt 
     <lb/>
     yesterday that we should look upon such a 
     <lb/>
     development from a labour point of view. I am 
     <lb/>
     fully aware that we must encourage labour for our 
     <lb/>
     own people from every available source. But, 
     <lb/>
   
    Mr. Chairman, for the past 50 years, 
     <lb/>Newfoundland's most valuable assets have been 
     <lb/>sacrificed to labour. In every big development in 
     <lb/>this country, the ship hand of resulting employ<lb break="no"/>ment has been held over the heads of past govern<lb break="no"/>ments to extract concessions unheard of in other 
     <lb/>lands. I feel it is time for us to demand something 
     <lb/>more than labour in return for parting with the 
     <lb/>assets of this country. Today the world supplies 
     <lb/>of iron ore are being depleted, and the eyes of the 
     <lb/>mining world have turned to Labrador, where 
     <lb/>there apparently exists an unlimited quantity of 
     <lb/>this much sought after metal, which I hope can 
     <lb/>yet be mined for the benefit of our land.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Nothing can be done about the 
     <lb/>
     agreement if the application is made for power to 
     <lb/>
     export, which we understand it has. It might be 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile if this house took a stand in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter, our idea being an increase in royalty to $1 and 
     <lb/>
     an understanding that the town he in New<lb break="no"/><cb/>foundland.

            <p>
     It seems that the chief architect responsible for 
     <lb/>
     the compiling of this report and his worthy as<lb break="no"/>sociates did not entirely agree on the question as 
     <lb/>
     to whether the legislation incorporating this 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining and Exploration Company was 
     <lb/>
     the best that might have been enacted at the time 
     <lb/>
     or not, but all were agreed that if a few vexing 
     <lb/>
     matters could be cleared up, it would be grand 
     <lb/>
     indeed. If, for instance, that Grand Falls water<lb break="no"/>power agreement had read $1 per installed horse<lb break="no"/>power, if only we had demanded that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Timmins keep to the letter of his 1938 agree<lb break="no"/>ment, yes, if these matters were cleared away, the 
     <lb/>
     Committee said it would be grand. Of course, it's 
     <lb/>
     just talking in platitudes to say if it were thus. or 
     <lb/>
     if we had gotten that, all would be well, and it's 
     <lb/>
     not helping matters when we set up a whine and 
     <lb/>
     assert, "Oh well, it's just what we expected, our 
     <lb/>
     country was never much more than a fertile field 
     <lb/>
     of speculators, in every deal with big corpora<lb break="no"/>tions and companies we have always been at the 
     <lb/>
     wrong end of the stick." I cannot agree with this 
     <lb/>
     school of thought, and like my friend Mr. Butt, I 
     <lb/>
     would have the temerity to say that with no inside 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the technicalities of mining or 
     <lb/>
     geology, and taking the report so ably explained 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Higgins, I would assert that the deal with 
     <lb/>
     the Hollinger interests is not nearly as bad as 
     <lb/>
     some would have us believe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us recapitulate a few salient points, and 
     <lb/>
     just to satisfy the critics we' ll prefix them all with 
     <lb/>
     a big IF. If the mines are worked, and remember 
     <lb/>
     if they are not worked we don't get fleeced, if the 
     <lb/>
     mines are worked it means employment for 2,500

     miners. Consequent upon this a townsite will be 
     <lb/>
     built of more than 25,000 souls. To compare this 
     <lb/>
     with any other undertaking in this country would 
     <lb/>
     be like trying to explain a costly modem motor 
     <lb/>
     car by talking about, or describing a wheelbar<lb break="no"/>row. If the mines are worked some $125 million 
     <lb/>
     must be expended, and that is a lot of money. To 
     <lb/>
     use Mr. Smallwood's superlative, "a monumen<lb break="no"/>tal sum". I take it we all need money, we would 
     <lb/>
     like to have more money, even my good friend 
     <lb/>
     and fellow Bonavistonian, Rev. Burry. Can you 
     <lb/>
     assume then that a corporation which puts in 
     <lb/>
     distribution in this country hundreds of millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars isn't a nice thing to have around? Now, 
     <lb/>
     I am going to base my next statement on the 
     <lb/>
     predication that this Labrador Mining corpora<lb break="no"/>tion will make some profits. Assuming that they 
     <lb/>
     do, 40% of such profits will accrue to the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland treasury. Of course we 
     <lb/>
     might be pessimistic, as some implied yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     and darkly hint that some very astute chartered 
     <lb/>
     accountants could doctor those ledgers so that 
     <lb/>
     there won't be any net profits to collect that 5% 
     <lb/>
     on. This, we must not forget, would be rather 
     <lb/>
     regrettable for our local shareholders. Their ob<lb break="no"/>jective like yours and mine, is to make profits. No 
     <lb/>
     corporation, no company, can long operate if it 
     <lb/>
     had to operate at a loss, and I cannot subscribe to 
     <lb/>
     the opinion that the Labrador Mining and Ex<lb break="no"/>ploration, with a proposed expenditure in the 
     <lb/>hundreds of millions, predicts an annual operat<lb break="no"/>ing deficit. It is perhaps a little strange that none 
     <lb/>of us seems to have thought of this vast mine, this 
     <lb/>almost inexhaustable source of mineral wealth, 
     <lb/>as something that has been lying dormant for 
     <lb/>ages. Not one cent ever came out of it prior to 
     <lb/>1938, but now that men of vision are willing to 
     <lb/>gamble millions to explore and develop it, and to 
     <lb/>set the wheels of industry in motion to wrest from 
     <lb/>the vastness of the Labrador continent this great 
     <lb/>wealth, we set up a howl, we shout, "Watch those 
     <lb/>wolves fleece us, watch them steal our birthright, 
     <lb/>watch them engage wily accountancy experts to 
     <lb/>diddle the profits." Some of our criticism, even if 
     <lb/>it appears logical, is, to say the least, unfair, for 
     <lb/>we must appreciate that in exploratory work of a 
     <lb/>highly speculative nature big corporations do 
     <lb/>expect some reasonable concessions, and in 
     <lb/>every highly industrialised country in the world, 
   

            <cb/>
      

     particularly in the United States, concessions 
     <lb/>
     have been the order of the day. Perhaps we have 
     <lb/>
     been a bit too cautious, and thus have overlooked 
     <lb/>
     the mighty impact that the future development of 
     <lb/>
     this Labrador potential will have upon the 
     <lb/>
     economy of our country. Maybe my friend 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett is right, that under the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     we might have done a little better; but let's be 
     <lb/>
     honest, it's going to mean more to us than the 
     <lb/>
     value of a peppercorn, and if only a part of the 
     <lb/>
     huge possibilities are realised, most of us here 
     <lb/>
     will agree that the Labrador Mining company's 
     <lb/>
     agreement was not so bad after all. Yes, let's call 
     <lb/>
     the play as we find it, and with the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander's natural aversion to appreciate 
     <lb/>
     the good intentions of any big corporation,<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> let us 
     <lb/>
     face the facts squarely and admit that if this huge 
     <lb/>
     proposed development materialises it augurs well 
     <lb/>
     indeed for the future of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, before I close I would pay a 
     <lb/>
     tribute to Mr. Claude Howse. His name has been 
     <lb/>
     used quite frequently in this debate. Mr. Howse 
     <lb/>
     is doing a big job aiding the development of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. If I may be personal for a mo» 
     <lb/>
     ment, I might add that right in my home town 
     <lb/>
     today, there are five diamond drill runners, young 
     <lb/>
     men, expert in their line, all trained under Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howse, and five of them are now awaiting orders 
     <lb/>
     to go up to Labrador as part of a field staff to do 
     <lb/>
     the exploratory work. They're paid $1.30 per 
     <lb/>
     hour. Newfoundland looks to men like Claude 
     <lb/>
     Howse, well might Mr. Higgins say we owe him 
     <lb/>
     much. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The mining report in general is a good one.... 
     <lb/>
     It embodies a bulk of information on mineral 
     <lb/>
     resources that some of us never even heard of 
     <lb/>
     before. A lot of this may be speculative but the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of future mineral development walks 
     <lb/>
     like a brightening ghost. I sincerely compliment 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins, and all the members of this Com<lb break="no"/>mittee.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> l'm not so sure the concessions 
     <lb/>
     are so fine. This is where the shoe pinches. It's 
     <lb/>
     been give, give, give and no get all down through 
     <lb/>
     the ages as far as I'm concerned, and as far as all 
     <lb/>
     past governments are concerned. You'll remem<lb break="no"/>ber some two months ago in <hi rendition="simple:italic">Magazine Digest</hi> 
     <lb/>
     there was an article in connection with the iron 
     <lb/>
     ore in Labrador and how important it was. 
    <lb/>

   
<ref target="#fn_08">[1] The following section was taken from the recording of the proceedings.</ref> 
   

            <pb n="522" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-04-22_Page_0522.jpg"/>

     Regardless of costs, it had to be used in the next 
     <lb/>
     eight or ten years. If that is so,¹ I fail to see how 
     <lb/>
     any company is not prepared to pay 10 cents a ton 
     <lb/>
     on all iron ore mined in Labrador. I am sure if the 
     <lb/>
     government had said, "You must definitely pay 
     <lb/>
     10 cents a ton on the iron ore you take out of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador", it would have happened, and the deal 
     <lb/>
     would have gone through. The western world 
     <lb/>
     needs the iron ore. If they had to pay $1 they 
     <lb/>
     would have paid it to get the iron ore. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The same thing applies all down through the 
     <lb/>
     years. You will notice the various companies 
     <lb/>
     who came in here — some gave a peppercom, 
     <lb/>
     some 10 cents a horsepower, some nothing. Now 
     <lb/>
     this is a similar agreement — it is a little better, 
     <lb/>
     we are getting 15 cents a horsepower. I am not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with a one-sided agreement. The 
     <lb/>
     government will get very little royalty; any com<lb break="no"/>pany going to spend $100 million knows what it 
     <lb/>
     is going to do. They know they are going to make 
     <lb/>
     money. There are so many ways to diddle the 
     <lb/>
     accounts. There is a lot of skullduggery going on, 
     <lb/>
     and in nine cases out of ten the people coming in 
     <lb/>
     here get the best of the bargain....

            <p>
     That is their comment. One big thing that has 
     <lb/>
     arisen out of that correspondence is that the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government must have been fully 
     <lb/>
     informed of the possibilities in Labrador at that 
     <lb/>
     time.... It would appear the government did have 
     <lb/>
     full knowledge in 1936, when they made that 
     <lb/>
     agreement. The Mining Committee has now 
     <lb/>
     evidence of prospecting in the area at that time. 
     <lb/>
     A group had made application for concessions in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador under the Small Concessions Act, 
     <lb/>
     whereby no person could get more than 100 
     <lb/>
     square miles. The amended act had to be passed. 
     <lb/>
     Prior to that, we are informed, an agreement had 
     <lb/>
     been made by letter with Sir John Hope Simpson, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1938 that act was passed. The war inter<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
           vened, with the result the government agreed to 
     <lb/>
     grant the extension to 1953. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The concession from the Quebec government 
     <lb/>
     was in 1942; the Quebec act was passed in 1946; 
     <lb/>
     and as we have explained, as a result of cor<lb break="no"/>respondence and interviews the amended act of 
     <lb/>
     1944 was passed — 10 cents a ton was changed 
     <lb/>
     to 5% of the net profits. To the Mining Commit<lb break="no"/>tee it was obvious that the Quebec government 
     <lb/>
     made a better deal than we did; but as the acts are 
     <lb/>
     binding it is impossible for all practical purposes 
     <lb/>
     to change them except by the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are extremely doubtful whether any great 
     <lb/>
     amount will accrue to the country from royalties. 
     <lb/>
     We point out that if the company takes up 
     <lb/>
     100,000 square miles, they pay $120,000 a year, 
     <lb/>
     they have 35% corporation tax, and water-power 
     <lb/>
     at 15 cents. The greatest return to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would be the employment the company would 
     <lb/>
     give. The main reason for going into so much 
     <lb/>
     detail is because we believe whatever value this 
     <lb/>
     body may have is in publicising the facts of the 
     <lb/>
     agreement, and we may make recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions, as you may properly do today, whereby in 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the new application that has 
     <lb/>
     been made by the company for the export of 
     <lb/>
     water-power, it might be conditional upon the 
     <lb/>
     power tax being put up to $1 to equal Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     and chiefly that the town be in Newfoundland- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador; because with the different methods of 
     <lb/>
     earning money, apart from mining, it would be of 
     <lb/>
     great benefit to whatever country the town is in. 
     <lb/>
     For that reason we feel we have not overstressed 
     <lb/>
     it and we feel it is only fitting and proper that it 
     <lb/>
     should be brought through us to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country.

     while we have been criticising strongly the

     to the Labrador Mining and Exploration Com<lb break="no"/>pany. I have come to the conclusion, and I think

     their speed for getting concessions by the old 
     <lb/>
     acts, because as far as I can see they have conces<lb break="no"/>sions here which are equally as good to the cor<lb break="no"/>poration, if not better, than any in the days gone 
     <lb/>
     by.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is evident to me the government never saw 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec act. There was no copy of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     act in this country until a few days ago.... Our 
     <lb/>
     government never took the trouble to find out 
     <lb/>
     what had been done in Quebec with the as<lb break="no"/>sociated company; never got copies of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec act; there was not one in the country; we 
     <lb/>
     could not get one from the Canadian High Com<lb break="no"/>missioner.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I can't understand some of those who get up 
     <lb/>
     in an elder statesman style, and suggest that this 
     <lb/>
     act will redound to the benefit of this country. We 
     <lb/>
     have got to think not of the benefits we will get 
     <lb/>
     in the next ten years, but of the benefits of that 
     <lb/>
     iron ore deposit 50 years hence. Mr. Higgins has 
     <lb/>
     drawn to your attention they way in which the 
     <lb/>
     iron ore deposits in the States have been depleted. 
     <lb/>
     We have a deposit in the Labrador and we don't 
     <lb/>
     know the extent of it, but we are told they are sure 
     <lb/>
     of 260 million tons of ore, and they have only 
     <lb/>
     scratched the surface. We have a deposit which, 
     <lb/>
     if properly handled by the government, could 
     <lb/>
     insure to the present population of this country 
     <lb/>
     something which will certainly redound to their 
     <lb/>
     benefit in the future. I therefore can't agree with 
     <lb/>
     the people who get up, and more or less 
     <lb/>
     sanctimoniously say, "We can't do anything, the 
     <lb/>
     act is made and we will have to put up with it. We 
     <lb/>
     hope they will make a profit, and if they do we 
     <lb/>
     shall get 5%." If we don't get 5%, we will get 
     <lb/>
     nothing. Some say, "Yes, you will have a town 
     <lb/>
     down there and you will get the profits that way." 
     <lb/>
     I can't see that. It will take a good many years 
     <lb/>
     before we get a few thousand Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     working down there in Labrador. We have not got 
     <lb/>
     2,500 Newfoundlanders to go down there and 
     <lb/>
     mine for a good many years to come. They want 
     <lb/>
     to mine, and they will get men from Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Poland, Czechoslovakia and other places. They 
     <lb/>
     want the ore, and they can't wait until we get the 
     <lb/>
     miners to send there. I can't see that it will mean 
     <lb/>
     much to Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is my opinion that we should go on record 
     <lb/>
     as a Convention elected by the people as being 
     <lb/>
     opposed to it. Let it not be said of us 25 or 50 
     <lb/>
     years hence, "That Convention knew about this, 


            <cb/>
       

     and did they make no move whatsoever?" I tell 
     <lb/>
     you, gentlemen, it is up to us to bring it to the 
     <lb/>
     notice of the Commission of Government and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office, what we as a Mining Commit<lb break="no"/>tee think, and I think the majority of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion will agree.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> ....Although we agree that profits are 
     <lb/>
     very limited on iron ore, yet I cannot believe that 
     <lb/>
     10 cents per ton is an unreasonable charge to 
     <lb/>
     make for royalty. It is so insignificant that I 
     <lb/>
     cannot believe that any company would attempt 
     <lb/>
     to go there if they did not have a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     assurance they would make a greater profit than 
     <lb/>
     that. I realise we are not miners or great indus<lb break="no"/>trialists, but our concern over these matters has, 
     <lb/>
     I am sure, been motivated by a keen sense of our 
     <lb/>
     responsibility to the people who sent us here, in 
     <lb/>
     which matters the Commission of Government is 
     <lb/>
     apparently very little concerned. I can assure the 
     <lb/>
     Convention and the people that the changes made 
     <lb/>
     in 1944 have caused us many headaches, and we 
     <lb/>
     can only hope that some good will come to this 
     <lb/>
     country as a result of the changes. We have the 
     <lb/>
     railway and water-power acts to be drafted, and 
     <lb/>
     I hope that the government responsible will see 
     <lb/>
     to it that we get a deal more conducive to the best

     intended to make in introducing this resolution I 
     <lb/>
     have already made, and I just want to make one 
     <lb/>
     further remark, that this resolution is introduced 
     <lb/>
     merely for the purpose of drawing the 1944 act, 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador Mining and Exploration Company 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1944, to the attention fo the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government, and also drawing it to the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Dominions Office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas in the Labrador Mining and Ex<lb break="no"/>ploration Company Ltd. Act of 1944 the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government amended the 
     <lb/>
     said Labrador Mining and Exploration Com<lb break="no"/>pany, Ltd. Act of 1938, and thereby can<lb break="no"/>celled the provision under which in the said 
     <lb/>
     1938 act the Company would pay a tax of 10 
     <lb/>
     cents per ton of iron ore exported from 
     <lb/>
     Labrador and substituted therefore a 
     <lb/>
     provision that 5% of the net profits of the said 
     <lb/>
     company should be paid to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government as a royalty; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas under both acts the company 
     <lb/>
     may apply to the Newfoundland government

     for a grant to use the Grand Falls water<lb break="no"/>power paying only in the neighbourhood of

     <lb/>
     permitting such exploitation of power, the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government should provide 
     <lb/>
     for a tax of $1 per horsepower installed, and 
     <lb/>
     should further make provision that any town 
     <lb/>
     erected in connection with the exploitation of 
     <lb/>
     iron ore in Newfoundland-Labrador should

     be built on Newfoundland soil;

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would suggest that for purposes 
     <lb/>
     of being sure that we say the act no. 47 of 1944, 
     <lb/>
     and no. 41 of 1938. That distinctly clarifies the 
     <lb/>
     wording.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I do move that motion, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> It gives me a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     pleasure to second this resolution. I had some 
     <lb/>
     comments to make on that section of the Mining 
     <lb/>
     Report while it was in committee, but when I 
     <lb/>
     learned that a resolution of this nature was com<lb break="no"/>ing up for discussion I resolved to keep what I 
     <lb/>
     had to say for the debate on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems to be generally agreed that it is the 
     <lb/>
     same old story, we have come off on the wrong 
     <lb/>
     end. I don't understand myself why the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should have taken the attitude that it was a 
     <lb/>
     question of "or else" — either we gave the con<lb break="no"/>cessions to the Labrador Mining Co. the way they 
     <lb/>
     wanted them, or they would go elsewhere. Surely 
     <lb/>
     they must have known, as we know, and as has 
     <lb/>
     been pointed out here, that the world's iron ore 
     <lb/>
     supplies are almost exhausted in certain areas, 
     <lb/>
     and that the companies concerned would certain<lb break="no"/>ly be looking for other deposits. Another point 
     <lb/>
     which has not been brought out a great deal in 
     <lb/>
     this debate is the amount of land in the concession 
     <lb/>
     area which has been given this company. In 
     <lb/>
     Quebec it is something like 4,000 square miles, 
     <lb/>
     but in Newfoundland it is something like 20,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles. which is almost one-fifth of the 
     <lb/>
     entire area, and we have no idea what other 
     <lb/>
     mineral resources may be tucked away in that 
     <lb/>
     great parcel of land. I don't see why it should be 
     <lb/>
     so sweeping. Surely an area proportionate with 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec area would have been in order. Then

     again, their concession seems to have been given 
     <lb/>
     for an indefinite period, and it brings to my mind 
     <lb/>
     the bases agreement — a 99 year lease. when it 
     <lb/>
     should have been for the duration and probably 
     <lb/>
     six months afterwards. The concessions seem to 
     <lb/>
     have been too sweeping. They always are, and 
     <lb/>
     this is no exception. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one other point I want to make, and 
     <lb/>
     that's in the Labrador report of the Mining Com<lb break="no"/>mittee, page 12. It was referred to by Mr. Fudge 
     <lb/>
     the other day, and it says: "Negotiations over the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland-Canada boundary between 
     <lb/>
     Labrador and Quebec have begun between the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian and Newfoundland governments and it 
     <lb/>
     is possible that the actual delimiting of the bound<lb break="no"/>ary on the ground may begin in 1947." I always 
     <lb/>
     had the impression that the boundary was set. Of 
     <lb/>
     course, it was pointed out the other day that the 
     <lb/>
     exact lines might not be known, it was the water<lb break="no"/>shed generally, but I am suspicious, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, and I think we all have a right to be, and we 
     <lb/>
     might wake up to find we don't own as much of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador as we thought we did. Mr. Crosbie 
     <lb/>
     made a motion here last fall in connection with 
     <lb/>
     our assets, and it is that I had in mind. I hope that 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government, when it goes into 
     <lb/>
     that matter, will see that Newfoundland keeps 
     <lb/>
     what she has, and does not end up with less than 
     <lb/>
     she thought she had. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I am not going to say much about 
     <lb/>
     this. I was struck by this clause, and I think this 
     <lb/>
     is where the government failed more than any<lb break="no"/>thing else.... It seems like other countries are wide 
     <lb/>
     awake to those things, while we always come out 
     <lb/>
     on the end in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think I was the 
     <lb/>
     one who brought out the fact here that the rate of 
     <lb/>
     tax paid in the Province of Quebec on water<lb break="no"/>power is $1 per horsepower. Since then there has 
     <lb/>
     been quite a bit of discussion in the Convention 
     <lb/>
     about that question of the l5 cents per horse<lb break="no"/>power that the government has agreed to accept, 
     <lb/>
     as against the dollar that we think they ought to 
     <lb/>
     get, in line with the rate that the Quebec govern<lb break="no"/>ment gets. I think also I am the one who brought 
     <lb/>
     out that there is some doubt as to where the town 
     <lb/>
     will be built, whether in the Newfoundland or the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec part of Labrador. These are the two 
     <lb/>
     points dealt with in the resolution. I could not 
     <lb/>
     possibly do anything other than agree with a 
     <lb/>
     resolution that seeks to point to the two observa<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     tions I was instrumental in bringing to the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is only one point left, but I am a little in 
     <lb/>
     doubt at the moment. The committee of the whole 
     <lb/>
     has risen chiefly for the purpose of moving this 
     <lb/>
     resolution. If we adopt the resolution, we have 
     <lb/>
     not completed the report of the Mining Commit<lb break="no"/>tee — there is still the final section to be read and 
     <lb/>
     debated. It is true these two pages concern only 
     <lb/>
    the general conclusions and observations, but 
     <lb/>they are important. Tomorrow is St. George's 
     <lb/>Day and then you, Mr. Chairman, and the other 
     <lb/>delegates are leaving for London; that would 
     <lb/>leave only tonight for the purpose of concluding 
     <lb/>the debate on the Mining Report. It seems 
     <lb/>desirable to complete the debate. There is one 
     <lb/>other point, in addition to the two in the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and that is the question of precious metals 
     <lb/>in there.... The question occurs to me, what would 
     <lb/>be the position with regard to the company if it 
     <lb/>should discover valuable mines of some charan 
     <lb/>ter other than iron — if they should discover 
     <lb/>gold? For all we know they may at this very 
     <lb/>moment know of the presence of much more 
     <lb/>valuable minerals than iron ore. Suppose they do, 
     <lb/>or suppose they get to know of gold or some other 
     <lb/>valuable mineral, are they to be taxed only the 
     <lb/>same 5% of the net profits. or would that call for 
     <lb/>a separate act, giving some future government a 
     <lb/>chance, of making a better deal? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I strongly support the resolution. I wish the 
     <lb/>
     chairman of the Mining Committee would indi<lb break="no"/>cate what he proposes doing in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     concluding of this repon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> First of all I want to say, naturally, 
     <lb/>
     that I support the resolution. The resolution 
     <lb/>
     speaks the feelings of the Mining Committee in 
     <lb/>
     this respect. I want to point out to you, however, 
     <lb/>
     thatl have been informed by Mr. Howse since the 
     <lb/>
     resolution was introduced that the main known 
     <lb/>
     deposits in the area — Quebec area and New<lb break="no"/>foundland-Labrador — are 30 miles apart, and 
     <lb/>
     the greatest distance between all deposits, up to 
     <lb/>
     now, is 100 miles. Mr. Howse is of the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that there will not be one main town, but several 
     <lb/>
     small towns. As far as the Mining Committee is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, we are prepared to sit at any time the 
     <lb/>
     Convention desires.

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> On the eve of your departure for 
     <lb/>
     England, I am going to express the hope once 
     <lb/>
     more that that very important matter of our rela<lb break="no"/>tions with the United States of America be not 
     <lb/>
     forgotten. I may be a little persistent with this, but 
     <lb/>
     I feel if it is forgotten it would be a rather serious 
     <lb/>
     matter. The Commission of Government seem to 
     <lb/>
     be inclined to discard what I think is a very vital 
     <lb/>
     question, and I fear we are already being faced 
     <lb/>
     with the results of that inaction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When we met the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     as a delegation, one of the things we discussed 
     <lb/>
     with them was the question of trade and tariffs. 
     <lb/>
     They pushed it aside. I think they were wrong in 
     <lb/>
     the stand they took. I hope when this delegation 
     <lb/>
     gets to England they will bear that question in 
     <lb/>
     mind and will not allow it to be pushed aside. It 
     <lb/>
     is a vital question for Newfoundland I feel if they 
     <lb/>
     press the point it will be discussed. I am of the 


            <cb/>
        

     opinion, as l have always been, that there should 
     <lb/>
     be a conference to talk this matter over, between 
     <lb/>
     representatives of Newfoundland, Canada, 
     <lb/>
     England and the United States. I believe at a 
     <lb/>
     round table conference something could come 
     <lb/>
     out of it. It will be the duty of this delegation to 
     <lb/>
     try and impress upon the British government the 
     <lb/>
     very strong desirability of assisting us in getting 
     <lb/>
     that meeting. There is a rather extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     situation today in connection with fresh fish fil<lb break="no"/>lets. They have purchased from our competitors 
     <lb/>
     quite a large quantity of fillets and we, her ward, 
     <lb/>
     have been neglected. The reason is exchange 
     <lb/>
     rates. They pay for the Norwegian fillets in 
     <lb/>
     pounds, shillings, and pence, but would have to 
     <lb/>
     pay us in dollars. They have purchased a large 
     <lb/>
     quantity from our competitors, we are still 
     <lb/>
     without orders from them, and we are unable to 
     <lb/>
     sell at the present time in the United States at a 
     <lb/>
     price which will enable us to give the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     of this country a fair price. I hope that this vital 
     <lb/>
     question will not be forgotten on the trip to 
     <lb/>
     England. I hope the delegation will have a very 
     <lb/>
     pleasant trip, and I wish them the best of luck.
