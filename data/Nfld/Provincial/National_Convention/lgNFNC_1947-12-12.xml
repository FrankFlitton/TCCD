     — will not be so stupid as to allow that, because 
     <lb/>
     by that time they will have employed some or all 
     <lb/>
     of their multitudinous forms of taxation now 
     <lb/>
     known in Canada, such as taxes for your lands....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Oh yes, on your cod traps — I 
     <lb/>
     would not think you would tax Labrador cod 
     <lb/>
     traps, at any rate — taxes on your trees if you like, 
     <lb/>
     or in other words stumpage rates, sales tax, tax on 
     <lb/>
     amusements, education tax, poll tax or head tax, 
     <lb/>
     a poor tax and dozens of others. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     if anybody in this House says you are not going 
     <lb/>
     to have a land tax, a county rate and a school rate 
     <lb/>
     and a poor rate, they don't know what they are 
     <lb/>
     talking about. I hold here in my hand a tax notice 
     <lb/>
     issued by the municipality of Cape Breton Coun<lb break="no"/>ty to a poor man who is deceased, and the tax 
     <lb/>
     notice has come to the trustee or administrator of 
     <lb/>
     the estate. He had a piece of land when he died in 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton County, valued at $100 — no house 
     <lb/>
     or anything on it. His assessment on that $100 
     <lb/>
     piece of land: county rate $4.12, school rate 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
<p>
     $2.75, poor rate 30 cents, total $7.17. The man, 
     <lb/>
     being sick and dying, did not pay it from 1944 to 
     <lb/>
     1946, when this final notice was received, and the 
     <lb/>
     administrator of the estate received this bill for 
     <lb/>
     $28.62 for four years, taxes on a piece of land 
     <lb/>
     valued at $ 100 in Cape Breton County — over a 
     <lb/>
     quarter of the value of the land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Figary Taxed by the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It was the municipality of Cape 
     <lb/>
     Breton, under the Province of Nova Scotia. So 
     <lb/>
     don't anybody dispute the fact that you will be 
     <lb/>
     taxed. You have to be, you have to get the money 
     <lb/>
     from somewhere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Chairman, I understand that as far as 
     <lb/>
     the Broadcasting Company are concerned we 
     <lb/>
     can't carry on any further, so I move that the 
     <lb/>
     committee rise and report progess and ask leave 
     <lb/>
     to sit again tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I am sure we have 
     <lb/>all learned with deep regret the tragedy which has 
     <lb/>recently happened at Goose Bay, and touches 
     <lb/>every person in Newfoundland. I refer of course 
     <lb/>to the tragic loss of life of 23 American neigh<lb break="no"/>bours of ours here. In this connection, sir, I wish

            <p>
     Whereas this house and the people of

     <lb/>

     country;

            <p>
     And whereas many of these men of the 23 
     <lb/>
     who have lost their lives in this heartbreaking 
     <lb/>
     disaster were neighbours of ours living at 
     <lb/>
     Fort Pepperrell with their families; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore be it resolved that we of this 
     <lb/>
     house do tender our heartfelt sympathy to the 
     

            <cb/>
            
     Commanding General of Fort Pepperrell and 
     <lb/>
     through him to the bereaved families of the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, that is a little

     irregular. I propose to comment on Mr. Hollett's 
  

            <pb n="1018"

     remarks, and as he had not finished when we 
     <lb/>
     completed yesterday, I was expecting too that he 
     <lb/>
     would complete his speech this afternoon, and 
     <lb/>
     that I would then reply to him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will not make a ruling on that 
     <lb/>
     point. I will simply rule that Mr. Hollett has the 
     <lb/>
     floor. First things first. If you are ready to proceed 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett, I am ready to listen to you.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I 
     <lb/>
     am not trying to take the floor from Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     but it's been customary in debate in this House 
     <lb/>
     for any gentleman bringing in a report, or at least 
     <lb/>
     legislation, not to reply to every individual per<lb break="no"/>sonally; he waits until the debate is finished and 
     <lb/>
     he has the privilege of replying then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except if there are questions put 
     <lb/>
     or implied, he has the right at the moment to reply 
     <lb/>
     to them, but he has to confine himself to that and 
     <lb/>
     that alone. I am not prepared, Major Cashin, at 
     <lb/>
     this time to rule on what Mr. Small-wood has to 
     <lb/>
     say until I first hear what he has to say. All I 
     <lb/>
     would say is that he has the final word, and the 
     <lb/>
     summing up. It is true, in the interim, he has the 
     <lb/>
     right to reply to any questions which may be 
     <lb/>
     addressed to him. As a matter of fact that is his 
     <lb/>
     responsibility and part of his duties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood has 
     <lb/>
     intimated that he wishes to reply to what I have 
     <lb/>
     said yesterday and what I will say today. I have 
     <lb/>
     not yet asked Mr. Smallwood any questions, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore I don't anticipate any reply from him 
     <lb/>
     on the point at all. If he wishes to, of course, that's 
     <lb/>
     another matter, but what I am trying to tell this 
     <lb/>
     House is a set of facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yesterday I think I ended on a certain tax 
     <lb/>
     notice which I have in my hand, with reference 
     <lb/>
     to an amount of some $28.62, levied on the estate 
     <lb/>
     of a deceased person in Cape Breton. The estate 
     <lb/>
     was valued at $100, and the amount of taxes 
     <lb/>
     collected up to that time, at least the amount of 
     <lb/>
     taxes accrued in four years was $28.62, and that 
     <lb/>
     consisted of the county rate, school rate and poll 
     <lb/>
     rate of $7.13 per year. It has been intimated to me 
     <lb/>
     outside this House, that that is not the case all 
     <lb/>
     over Canada. I have also a notice which appeared 
     <lb/>
     in the Port Arthur <hi rendition="simple:italic">News Chronicle</hi> on Thursday, 
     <lb/>
     November 6, dealing with the public sale of land 
     <lb/>
     because taxes and costs had not been paid.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I read that to show that in the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, as in Newfoundland when we are a 
     <lb/>
     province, monies have to be raised in order to pay 
 

            <cb/>
    

     for social services and the servicing of the debt, 
     <lb/>
     and all other things pertaining to government in 
     <lb/>
     any province or country. These monies have to 
     <lb/>
     be raised, and the point I am trying to make, 
     <lb/>
     which I think nobody in this House can deny, is 
     <lb/>
     that if we give away our revenue-producing taxes 
     <lb/>
     now, if we give up our customs duties, if we give 
     <lb/>
     up the monies which the Assessor collects from 
     <lb/>
     our people, we lose about $30 million in this 
     <lb/>
     country; and we still have to carry on the services 
     <lb/>
     for forestry, and various other things — justice 
     <lb/>
     incidentally has to be taken care of. So in order 
     <lb/>
     to raise the money we must tax. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     left to tax except our land, homes, personal 
     <lb/>
     property, in other words real and personal proper<lb break="no"/>ty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think I have got almost as far as to say that, 
     <lb/>
     for the first three years of confederation, the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Newfoundland will have a revenue 
     <lb/>
     of $11,462,128. You remember I accepted the 
     <lb/>
     irreducible minimum, and not the $6,820,000, 
     <lb/>
     because, as I pointed out, your irreducible mini<lb break="no"/>mum is the only thing on which you can bank. 
     <lb/>
     The only guarantee from the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment is that that will be paid and I showed you 
     <lb/>
     how, in one province in Canada, the irreducible 
     <lb/>
     minimum was last year all that could be paid, 
     <lb/>
     because the GNP and the population had altered 
     <lb/>
     to such an extent that it could not be increased. 
     <lb/>
     And so we go back to the beginning of union with 
     <lb/>
     a revenue of $11,462,128, or, for purposes of 
     <lb/>
     reckoning, let us add another $500,000 for the 
     <lb/>
     possible purpose of interest from our so-called 
     <lb/>
     surplus. Right here I must say that we are banking 
     <lb/>
     an awful lot on the surplus, $28 million apparent<lb break="no"/>ly. £9 million of that is in Great Britain, in sterl<lb break="no"/>ing. That is $15 million subtracted from $28 
     <lb/>
     million. That leaves $13 million, if I am correct. 
     <lb/>
     There is no gainsaying that we may not have to 
     <lb/>
     do the same thing next year to market our fish or 
     <lb/>
     our iron ore. But let us say we have about $12 
     <lb/>
     million in this country in dollar funds. One-third 
     <lb/>
     of that will go to Canada to be placed at interest 
     <lb/>
     there, which we cannot use for current expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, which will leave us only about $8 million. 
     <lb/>
     So don't let us bank on that $28 million too much, 
     <lb/>
     a surplus is of no value to this country unless it is 
     <lb/>
     liquid, unless you can obtain it. If it is in sterling 
     <lb/>
     funds in Great Britain it might just as well be in 
     <lb/>
     the bottom of a mine. It is of no value to us unless 
     <lb/>
     it is liquid, if you like to pay for our fish or iron 
    

            <pb n="1019"

     ore and what not. These are troubled times, and 
     <lb/>
     if we have any surplus we ought to try and hold 
     <lb/>
     on to it for just such an emergency as happened 
     <lb/>
     this fall, when we could not sell our fish if we had 
     <lb/>
     not had this surplus. We should not use our 
     <lb/>
     surplus for current expenditure, which apparently 
     <lb/>
     is the intention of some of the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation. Well, let us say we have $12 
     <lb/>
     million revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let's look at the other side of the picture. 
     <lb/>
     What will be our expenditure? See page 62 of the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book... Let us assume for a moment that 
     <lb/>
     these figures are correct. It would be a fair ques<lb break="no"/>tion to ask, but I am not going to ask it, where do 
     <lb/>
     they hope to place the taxes in this country in 
     <lb/>
     order to raise that $2.5 million? You can have no 
     <lb/>
     indirect taxes, you can no longer have taxes on 
     <lb/>
     the incomes of the individual and the corpora<lb break="no"/>tions. Ottawa will be busy bleeding the resources. 
     <lb/>
     Where then will they get the $2.5 million? 1 have 
     <lb/>
     hinted where you are going to get it, and where 
     <lb/>
     you are going to place you taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us take a look at the estimates of an 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $14.5 million. Take a look at their 
     <lb/>
     proposed expenditure for Education. The es<lb break="no"/>timates for Education this year in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     are $3,622,300. Now what has the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation done? Mind you, I suppose the people 
     <lb/>
     in Canada believe that they acted in good faith 
     <lb/>
     when they took this figure. What <hi rendition="simple:italic">have</hi> they done? 
     <lb/>
     They have lopped off $5 14,000, and reduced the 
     <lb/>
     estimate to $3,107,700. Again it has been stated 
     <lb/>
     that the surplus will take care of the construction 
     <lb/>
     of these figures and education. In other words, 
     <lb/>
     they say, "We won't build these new schools, we 
     <lb/>
     shall stop all new reconstruction on account of 
     <lb/>
     education." Let education remain stagnant for the 
     <lb/>
     next three years, and indeed for the next 12 years 
     <lb/>
     if need be. Our whole education plans for the 
     <lb/>
     future are out. After all, are not our teachers 
     <lb/>
     already receiving much more than they are in 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island? Gentlemen, as you know, 
     <lb/>
     our educational authorities were budgeting for $4 
     <lb/>
     million next year in order to bring our teacher 
     <lb/>
     salary scale on a par with that in Nova Scotia. So 
     <lb/>
     if we are honest as to the needs of the education 
     <lb/>
     of our children, rather than take off $514,000 we 
     <lb/>
     must add on; and I submit a further $900,000 
     <lb/>
     must be added to the $3.1 million suggested by 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation, and no doubt accepted in 
     <lb/>
     good faith by the Canadians to whom they talked. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Now take a look at what they have estimated 
     <lb/>
     for Natural Resources. You will note that the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation here again has cut reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion to the tune of $1,629,428. Do they mean to 
     <lb/>
     tell us that under confederation there will be no 
     <lb/>
     need of reconstruction with regard to fisheries, 
     <lb/>
     forestry, rural development, etc? Are we to 
     <lb/>
     remain stagnant in this field? I have studied this 
     <lb/>
     thing as much as I am capable of; I am sure that 
     <lb/>
     we, as a province, in making an estimate, must 
     <lb/>
     leave in the following amounts, that is to say: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Which, I feel, must be added on to the estimates 
     <lb/>
     made by the Ottawa delegation if we are to exist 
     <lb/>
     at all as a province. But let us assume that under 
     <lb/>
     sub—section 8 of clause 5 of the proposed agree<lb break="no"/>ment, Canada will take care of fisheries. Canada 
     <lb/>
     will lop off the reconstruction of our fisheries. I 
     <lb/>
     put it to you, gentlemen, that is not generally done 
     <lb/>
     in the provinces of Canada today. but let us 
     <lb/>
     assume that, under this Grey Book, Canada is 
     <lb/>
     going to take care of our fisheries, let us lop off 
     <lb/>
     that $514,000, and we still have left $801,400 to 
     <lb/>
     take care of the most necessary reconstruction. 
     <lb/>
     Let us pass quickly over Public Works, but in 
     <lb/>
     passing I ask you to note that they have cut out 
     <lb/>
     $4 million of reconstruction, $3.5 million of 
     <lb/>
     which consists of the construction of roads, 
     <lb/>
     bridges and buildings These things are our 
     <lb/>
     responsibility as a province. Must we, for this 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada, forego all hopes of further 
     <lb/>
     extending our roads? 1 have pointed out the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the surplus. I wonder how many people in 
     <lb/>
     this country today earn good money on road 
     <lb/>
     building and repairing? That would have to stop. 
     <lb/>
     Our confederate friends will deny them that. If it 
     <lb/>
     is right to build roads and bridges at this stage in 
     <lb/>
     our history to open up our country, then it is 
     <lb/>
     wrong for us, as individuals sent in here by our 
     <lb/>
     people, to consider these matters. It is wrong for 
     <lb/>
     us even to think of confederation at this time, for 
     <lb/>
     we shall not be able to get the money to do this 
     <lb/>
     work, to build the roads and other things. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose for a moment we listen to our finan<lb break="no"/>cial wizards here and at Ottawa, and cease all 


            <pb n="1020"

     further new road building to the extent of $3.5 
     <lb/>
     million a year for years to come, a lot of which 
     <lb/>
     goes in for labour. Let us forget all that, and go 
     <lb/>
     on to Public Health and Welfare, and this too is 
     <lb/>
     our obligation as a province. One would have 
     <lb/>
     thought that since the Ottawa delegation had cut 
     <lb/>
     out $3.5 million road and building construction, 
     <lb/>
     they would have budgeted for an increase in the 
     <lb/>
     estimate for Health and Welfare. That, to me, 
     <lb/>
     would have been the obvious thing to do. But no, 
     <lb/>
     this is what they do: they cut out $235,000 on 
     <lb/>
     account of reconstruction, and $828,000 on account 
     <lb/>
     of assistance to the poor and allowance to 
     <lb/>
     widows and orphans, maintenance of hospitals 
     <lb/>
     and general public health services and reduce the 
     <lb/>
     estimate from $5,830,239 to $4,767,239 as the 
     <lb/>
     amount required. For the moment let us turn to 
     <lb/>
     page 60, book 2. They cut out assistance to in<lb break="no"/>digents, $250,000; general public health service, 
     <lb/>
     $50,000. If I remember correctly it was intimated 
     <lb/>
     to us that $278,000 maintenance to hospitals was 
     <lb/>
     cut out by the delegation to Ottawa because under 
     <lb/>
     confederation supplies coming in for hospitals 
     <lb/>
     would cost less, and we would be able to reduce 
     <lb/>
     the amount by cutting off $278,000. They have 
     <lb/>
     intimated that. I see nothing in the estimates for 
     <lb/>
     the maintenance of servicing of the Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     hospital. You cannot see where they cut out 
     <lb/>
     $50,000 except for nutrition for schools and child 
     <lb/>
     welfare. Why must we give up the proper servic<lb break="no"/>ing of our hospitals simply for the honour of 
     <lb/>
     being a province of Canada? I have the greatest 
     <lb/>
     respect for the Dominion of Canada for what she 
     <lb/>
     did in the last war. You may respect a person or 
     <lb/>
     a country, but that does not justify your cutting 
     <lb/>
     out services to your own people and reducing 
     <lb/>
     them to paup-erism. This is something we cannot 
     <lb/>
     pass over lightly, and so we must add to this 
     <lb/>
     estimate of theirs $1,068,000, even if we allow 
     <lb/>
     for no further improvements and allow no in<lb break="no"/>crease whatever by way of relief. That brings to 
     <lb/>
     my mind that they also cut out $10,000 for relief 
     <lb/>
     on Labrador. The minimum on account of 
     <lb/>
     expenditures with Newfoundland as a province 
     <lb/>
     would be:<ref target="#fn_01">*</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You cannot do it for less. I defy any man to prove 
   

            <cb/>
  

     to me he can. People have to be taken care of in 
     <lb/>
     this day and generation, and in every day and 
     <lb/>
     generation, I hope. Against this expenditure we 
     <lb/>
     shall have as revenue, as already pointed out, for 
     <lb/>
     the next three years, $12 million. Thus the 
     <lb/>
     balance sheet for Newfoundland for the next 
     <lb/>
     three years will look like this:

            <p>
     Thus by cutting out the following on reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion plans already envisaged on the following

     accounts, that is to say:

            <p>
     Cutting out all that, we shall still have a deficit of 
     <lb/>
     $5,269,000 per year for the first three years as a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. But were we to try to carry 
     <lb/>
     out the programme for fisheries and for public 
     <lb/>
     works, we should have a deficit of $9,383,500. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Figures do not lie; rather do they give us the 
     <lb/>
     lie if we do not heed them. Surely we, as a body 
     <lb/>
     of 45 men who should have the best interests of 
     <lb/>
     our people at heart, need no further evidence to 
     <lb/>
     prove that this so-called fair and equitable basis 
     <lb/>
     of union with Canada is nothing more than a 
     <lb/>
     financial and economic mirage, leading us on to 
     <lb/>
     the desert of economic stagnation and financial 
     <lb/>
     ruin from which we should never recover and 
     <lb/>
     from which we can never as a country return. 
     <lb/>
     Underneath a thick spread of oleo-margarine we 
     <lb/>
     find nothing but a crust of black bread in which 
     <lb/>
     rot and mould have already set in. What attempts 
     <lb/>
     have the Ottawa delegation and their wizard 
     <lb/>
     financial friends in Canada's capital made to 
     <lb/>
     make up this deficit of $5,269,000, not to say 
     <lb/>
     anything of our plans for reconstruction? Taking 
     <lb/>
     a leap in the dark they pounced on gasoline and 
     <lb/>
     stuck on a tax which they say will yield $750,000; 
     <lb/>
     and having got thus far they merely hinted at 
     <lb/>
     possible additional provincial taxation of$l mil<lb break="no"/>lion. What this taxation which will bring in $l 
     <lb/>
     million is, they do not tell us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is a plain fact, gentlemen. Under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa will collect from our people

     That is our hope. That is the basis of our hope

     and truths that are indisputable by even the most 
     <lb/>
     ardent confederate. I do not remember any con<lb break="no"/>federates yet having gone out of their way to 
     <lb/>
     mention any of these things. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> and gentlemen, for the glories 
     <lb/>
     of confederation are we to abandon that position 
     <lb/>
     of governmental prosperity which we have en<lb break="no"/>joyed since 1940; that enviable peak from which 
     <lb/>
     we have been budgeting for surpluses and still 
     <lb/>
     more surpluses, even though there has been a 
     <lb/>
     gradual lessening of taxation? Are we, I say, to 
     <lb/>
     freely and of our own volition abandon this posi<lb break="no"/>tion, enter into union with Canada and budget for 
     <lb/>
     a deficit of $5 million and thereby have to tax still 
     <lb/>
     more? Are we mad? There can be no other 
     <lb/>
     answer, otherwise we would not waste the time 
     <lb/>
     we have on this thing. Of what use a baby bonus 
     <lb/>
     if we are to be taxed still more? Taxes on our land, 
     <lb/>
     our homes, our cattle, our boats, our nets, our 
     <lb/>
     everything, possibly your fur coat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The delegation to Ottawa was asked to find 
     <lb/>
     out if there existed a fair and equitable basis of 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada at the present time. Thank 
     <lb/>
     God that at least two members of that delegation 
 

            <cb/>
        

     have been able to look at the whole question in 
     <lb/>
     its true perspective and have said openly that no 
     <lb/>
     such fair and equitable basis of union exists. As 
     <lb/>
     for myself, Mr. Chairman, I have never believed 
     <lb/>
     there was a basis at all at this time. But heretofore 
     <lb/>
     I looked at it only from the economic viewpoint, 
     <lb/>
     from the point of view of our exports of fish and 
     <lb/>
     fish products, our ore and the products of our 
     <lb/>
     forests. Looking at it thus. I am compelled to say 
     <lb/>
     that the closer we can get to the USA the better 
     <lb/>
     will it be for the welfare ofour people. Last year 
     <lb/>
     Canada took from us $7 million worth of 
     <lb/>
     products - but how much fish? How much 
     <lb/>
     paper? The United States took $20 million worth 
     <lb/>
     of fish, of ore from Buchans, and of paper. I say 
     <lb/>
     therefore, and I repeat, that the closer we can get 
     <lb/>
     to the USA the better will it be for the welfare of 
     <lb/>
     our people, and I advocate such a policy. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What point of order? Don't fash 
     <lb/>
     yourself, laddie. May I finish, Mr. Chairman?

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Certainly.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What shall I say. Mr. Chairman? 
     <lb/>
     What shall I say now when I look at it from the 
     <lb/>
     financial angle? What must we all. as responsible 
     <lb/>
     men say, I ask you? Only this, that there is not 
     <lb/>
     now, and l doubt if there ever can be, having 
     <lb/>
     regard to what we live on, our fish, our ore, our 
     <lb/>
     paper, our natural resources, a fair and equitable 
     <lb/>
     basis for union with the Dominion of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     unless she can buy more of our goods. Never 
     <lb/>
     mind your baby bonuses, tell them the truth. How 
     <lb/>
     do they live? By the sweat of their brow, by 
     <lb/>
     digging out the ore and catching fish in all kinds 
     <lb/>
     of weather, and cutting down the trees. Those 
     <lb/>
     countries which take our products will make it 
     <lb/>
     possible for them to live and support their babies 
     <lb/>
     without any handouts from anyone else. I am not 
     <lb/>
     talking about baby bonuses at the moment. Yes, 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I call upon each and every one of you 
     <lb/>
     to tell our people the truth, the whole truth, and 
     <lb/>
     nothing but the truth, and then, Mr. Chairman, we 
     <lb/>
     need have no fear whatsoever. Thank you, sir.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like to

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There seems to be a marked

     competition for the floor this afternoon, and I am 
     <lb/>
     compelled at this time to speak. so that members

     tee, and the object of committee is to relax the 
     <lb/>
     rules of debate, in particular the rule which 
     <lb/>
     restricts any member when in Convention to 
     <lb/>
     speak more than once, and then for not more than 
     <lb/>
     one hour, unless extended for a further 15 
     <lb/>
     minutes by the indulgence of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under standing order 45 it is specifically 
     <lb/>
     provided, "In committee members may speak 
     <lb/>
     more than once to the same question." Now as to 
     <lb/>
     the number of times he may speak, how long he 
     <lb/>
     may speak, there is no restriction. That is in the 
     <lb/>
     discretion of the Chairman in committee and 
     <lb/>
     there is no appeal.... Under standing order 54 it is 
     <lb/>
     provided, "Whenever any matter arises which, 
     <lb/>
     in the opinion of the Chairman is not covered by 
     <lb/>
     the standing orders, reference shall be made to 
     <lb/>
     the rules and regulations of the House of Assemb<lb break="no"/>ly of Newfoundland, and the matter decided in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with those rules, save that where the 
     <lb/>
     said rules are silent upon the matter, the question 
     <lb/>
     shall be decided in accordance with the rules of 
     <lb/>
     British parliamentary procedure" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is nothing in the rules of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly covering this course. I have to take 
     <lb/>
     recourse to established parliamentary procedure, 
     <lb/>
     and in May, 14th edition, pages 570-571, the 
     <lb/>
     author says that "Order in debate and in commit<lb break="no"/>tee is enforced by the Chairman, as he is respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the conduct of business therein, and from 
     <lb/>
     his decision no appeal can be made to the Speaker 
     <lb/>
     or the House." On page 571 it says, "The Chair<lb break="no"/>man is permitted to check irrelevant or tedious 
     <lb/>
     repetition." Now in this particular instance, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, I am not permitted to prescribe 
     <lb/>
     a time limit as such.... I cannot abridge your right, 
     <lb/>
     or the right of any member to speak more than 
     <lb/>
     once ... but I will have to ask you to confine 
     <lb/>
     yourself to strictly relevant matters, and to mat<lb break="no"/>ters of a novel origin which may have been raised 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Hollett; I don't want any repetition of 
     <lb/>
     matters to which you have already referred.... I 
     <lb/>
     will have to ask you, if you don't mind 
     <lb/>
     
     
    Mr. Smallwood, to make your remarks as brief as 
     <lb/>you possibly can, please.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, I will certainly do that, 
     <lb/>
     as I always do.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Point of order. I might point out that 
     <lb/>
     in summing up this matter I asked the person who

     is supposed to be piloting this thing through no 
     <lb/>
     questions whatsoever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not the point. He is per<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
         
mitted to speak more than once. There does not 
     <lb/>
     have to be any question at all.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, I will attempt to cover 
     <lb/>
     all or nearly all the points raised by Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     in his speech. I made a number of notes as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett went along, and I intend to refer to 
     <lb/>
     those notes.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> paid a tribute to the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada for the very great part that Canada had 
     <lb/>
     played in this war, and he made use of this phrase: 
     <lb/>
     "Canada, united in war, divided in peace." Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada is a federal union of nine 
     <lb/>
     self-governing provinces, just as the United 
     <lb/>
     States of America is a federal union of 48 self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     governing states, just as the Commonwealth of 
     <lb/>
     Australia is a federal union of, I think, six self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     governing states, and in every case in this world 
     <lb/>
     today that I happen to know about, where you 
     <lb/>
     have a federal union, what you find is difference 
     <lb/>
     of opinion, of conception, little grievances, little 
     <lb/>
     quarrels between one state or province and 
     <lb/>
     another. or between a number of states or provin<lb break="no"/>ces and the federal government on the other side. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> My attention has been called to 
     <lb/>the fact that at the moment I have not a quorum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I may inform you, sir, if it is of 
     <lb/>any interest to you, that the idea was that I was

     <lb/>there is no quorum at the present time, but if there 
     <lb/>is a quorum I will speak.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> (to Secretary) I will have to ask

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, sir, we are adjourning 
     <lb/>
     today and they want the last word to the country 
     <lb/>
     to consist of a lot of poison that can't be 
     <lb/>
     answered, but I am going to answer this. I know 
     <lb/>
     all about it. I have known it for a week. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Fifteen members of the com<lb break="no"/>mittee constitute a quorum. We are sitting in

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, sir, I will proceed. It has 
     <lb/>
     been said by Mr. Hollett that Canada is a nation 
     <lb/>
     united in war but divided in peace, and the refer<lb break="no"/>ence came while he was describing the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion-provincial conference that was held a 
     <lb/>
     couple of years ago.... At that conference they 
     <lb/>
     had their differences of opinion, the various 
     <lb/>
     premiers stating their viewpoints and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada stating theirs, and he 
   

            <pb n="1023"

     gave that as an illustration as to how divided 
     <lb/>
     Canada was. It is only fair to point out that while 
     <lb/>
     it is perfectly true that in many matters these nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces have their disagreements between 
     <lb/>
     themselves on the one hand, and sometimes be<lb break="no"/>tween a group of them and the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the other hand, that the same thing 
     <lb/>
     happens in other federal unions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am sorry, Mr. Smallwood, but 
     <lb/>
     we have not a quorum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Cat and mouse, so that it will 
     <lb/>
     be kept just below a quorum Well, the country 
     <lb/>
     will know all about it. The plot that misfired. 
     <lb/>
     Well, the country will know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[At this point there was a wait of several minutes]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All right, we have a quorum again. Now, I will 
     <lb/>
     give you an example of how a country that is a 
     <lb/>
     federal union rather than a unitary state can have 
     <lb/>
     its serious disagreements. its squabbles, its weak<lb break="no"/>nesses, and yet be a great country. Let us take 
     <lb/>
     United States as an example. There you have had, 
     <lb/>
     since the days of Thomas Jefferson, a continuing 
     <lb/>
     dispute over the question of states' rights.... That 
     <lb/>
     has rent the United States on more than one 
     <lb/>
     occasion. Then again, you have the great question 
     <lb/>
     of child labour. They have not got a federal law 
     <lb/>
     in the United States forbidding child labour, and 
     <lb/>
     you get young children working in mills and 
     <lb/>
     factories, because there is no American law for 
     <lb/>
     the whole nation that forbids it. In the individual 
     <lb/>
     states they do have their own state law, but be<lb break="no"/>cause of this dispute they still can't get a federal 
     <lb/>
     law to forbid child labour generally. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then again in the United States you have the 
     <lb/>
     racial question, the negro question. You know, 
     <lb/>
     the whole world knows. and has been shocked by 
     <lb/>
     the trouble caused in the United States by this 
     <lb/>
     question of the negro. We know the stories of 
     <lb/>
     lynchings, and miscarriages of justice, of the Jim 
     <lb/>
     Crow policy, of the way the negro is treated. And 
     <lb/>
     you have anti-semitism in the United States. The 
     <lb/>
     country is made up of all kinds of nationalities, 
     <lb/>
     and again you always have trouble coming for 
     <lb/>
     that cause. We know the story of the Ku Klux 
     <lb/>
     Klan, and we know that all these and similar 
     <lb/>
     troubles ended in the United States with a civil 
     <lb/>
     war, and yet... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of order. I see noth<lb break="no"/>ing in order about a Ku Klux Klan or anything 
     <lb/>
     else... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What is your point, Mr. Hollett? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> My point is that the remarks are 
     <lb/>
     irrelevant... 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except insofar as he intends to 
     <lb/>show that arising out of your statement that the 
     <lb/>Dominion of Canada is united in war but dis<lb break="no"/>united in peace, disunity on questions of national 
     <lb/>importance is not confined to Canada alone. But 
     <lb/>I quite agree with you, I think, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>that you are getting a little bit far afield, and I 
     <lb/>would like you to come back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, sir, I was just about to 
     <lb/>clew up on that one point.... To reply thoroughly 
     <lb/>and adequately to Mr. Hollett it would be neces<lb break="no"/>sary to speak for about two or three days, which 
     <lb/>I have not got time to do, and in fact the House is 
     <lb/>adjourning this afternoon. So to sum up that one 
     <lb/>point, while it is perfectly true that there are 
     <lb/>differences of opinion in Canada between one 
     <lb/>province and another province, or between two 
     <lb/>or more provinces on the one hand and the federal 
     <lb/>government on the other, so you have it in the 
     <lb/>United States, Australia, South Africa, and 
     <lb/>wherever you have a federal union. Nothing 
     <lb/>surprising about it. You might only describe it as 
     <lb/>the growing pains of a great nation, and Canada

            <p>Yesterday Mr. Hollett made this remark. I 
     <lb/>jotted it down. I don't guarantee that it's the 
     <lb/>identical words he used because I don't write 
     <lb/>shorthand, but he said that if we become a 
     <lb/>province of Canada, everything we import into 
     <lb/>Newfoundland which is not imported from 
     <lb/>Canada, we will have to pay duty on. Well, I don't 
     <lb/>know if Mr. Hollett has taken the trouble to look 
     <lb/>through the tariff of the Government of Canada... 
     <lb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well if he has, sir, I say that a 
     <lb/>lie is something said intending to deceive, know<lb break="no"/>ing that it is a lie and untrue, and if a man knows 
     <lb/>it is untrue and then says it, it becomes a lie. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of order. Is that man 
     <lb/>insinuating that I am a liar? If so I want him to 
     <lb/>take it back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was hinting that.

     cally opposite as to be impossible of reconcilia<lb break="no"/>tion, that has nothing whatever to do with it. You

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Hollett made the statement 
     <lb/>yesterday that whatever we import from Canada, 
     <lb/>whatever else we would import we would pay 
     <lb/>duty on. I say that is not so, that about half of all 
     <lb/>the things that Canada imports come into Canada 
     <lb/>duty free; and if we become a province of Canada 
     <lb/>and we import goods from countries other than 
     <lb/>Canada, whatever came in from Canada would 
     <lb/>be duty free (that would be the bulk of it); but if 
     <lb/>we still imported things from other countries 
     <lb/>we would pay the customs duty according to the 
     <lb/>Canadian customs tariff.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Everybody understands that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, if everybody under<lb break="no"/>stands it, why did Mr. Hollett make the remark 
     <lb/>
     yesterday that if we become a province, except 
     <lb/>
     for the things we would import from Canada 
     <lb/>
     itself, we would pay duty on the rest? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is Mr. Hollett's opinion. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> On dutiable goods, yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But I am trying to show that his 
     <lb/>
     opinion is wrong.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That I am a <hi rendition="simple:italic">liar</hi>!

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In matters of opinion a man may 
     <lb/>
     reasonably differ. Mr. Hollett is entitled to his 
     <lb/>
     opinion for the same reason that you are entitled 
     <lb/>
     to yours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He expressed his opinion and I 
     <lb/>
     am expressing mine. My opinion is based on the 
     <lb/>
     fact that about half the imports that come into 
     <lb/>
     Canada come in duty free. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....I am trying to preserve to 
     <lb/>
     members the dignity and respect to which they 
     <lb/>
     are entitled. No member can afford to disregard 
     <lb/>
     what each needs for his own protection.... Now I 
     <lb/>
     suggest to you Mr. Smallwood, I think it is in the 
     <lb/>
     best interest, if you would please refrain from 
     <lb/>
     personalities. If you want to discuss the merits of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett's speech and to express yourself in 
     <lb/>
     agreement or disagreement that is your in<lb break="no"/>alienable right, but please, in so doing, do not 
  

            <cb/>
         

     identify your observations with personal dis<lb break="no"/>crimination, and if you do that I am sure we will 
     <lb/>
     get along very well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, I will certainly attempt 
     <lb/>
     not to do so. I have a note here which I wrote 
     <lb/>
     yesterday while Mr. Hollett was speaking, and 
     <lb/>
     the note I have made was that he said such and 
     <lb/>
     such, and that is his right to express that opinion. 
     <lb/>
     Now I am now offering my opinion, which is the 
     <lb/>
     exact opposite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Which can be offered offen<lb break="no"/>sively or inoffensively, depending on the manner 
     <lb/>
     and language employed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well now, since I withdrew the 
     <lb/>
     thing I did withdraw have I been offensive, sir? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are on very thin ice, but 
     <lb/>however, Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, I say if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada everything that we import 
     <lb/>
     from Canada would come in duty free — every<lb break="no"/>thing. If we import anything from other countries 
     <lb/>
     then we will pay duty, if there is a Canadian duty 
     <lb/>
     on it.... Half the value of all they import into 
     <lb/>
     Canada comes in duty free, and the rest of it 
     <lb/>
     comes in at a lower rate of duty than our own 
     <lb/>
     present customs duty.... We know if we become 
     <lb/>
     a province of Canada, anything we do import into 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland not from Canada would come in 
     <lb/>
     at much lower rates of duty on an average than 
     <lb/>
     we are paying now in our own customs tariff. 
     <lb/>
     Now that's that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have another note here. Mr. Hollett said that, 
     <lb/>
     "If Newfoundland goes into confederation 
     <lb/>
     Canada will man the American bases, probably 
     <lb/>
     with skeleton crews, and in that case 3,500 New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders will lose their jobs." I presume he 
     <lb/>
     means the 3,500 Newfoundlanders that he as<lb break="no"/>sumes are now working on these American bases. 
     <lb/>
     That is a remarkable statement for a man to make. 
     <lb/>
     No one has brought any evidence, still less 
     <lb/>
     brought any proof. It is just a statement of a 
     <lb/>
     personal opinion, that if we become a province 
     <lb/>
     the Americans will be forced out of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, out of these bases that they occupy 
     <lb/>
     now, and that therefore the Newfoundlanders that 
     <lb/>
     are working on the bases will lose their jobs 
     <lb/>
     because Canada would occupy those bases with 
     <lb/>
     her own soldiers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not strictly correct. The 
     <lb/>
     conclusion arrived at by Mr. Hollett was based 
     <lb/>
     upon a communication received from the 


            <pb n="1025"

     Secretary of the Commission.... 
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, but a conclusion, I hold, 
     <lb/>utterly without foundation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is another matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We had a reply here which 
     <lb/>Mr. Hollett read yesterday, a reply from the New<lb break="no"/>foundland govemment...that in case we became 
     <lb/>a province, the principals in the bases' treaty 
     <lb/>would be the Government of Canada and the 
     <lb/>Government of the United States. That of course 
     <lb/>is true, because defence is a federal matter. There 
     <lb/>is a Joint Defence Board of the United States and 
     <lb/>Canada, and all defence matters relating to 
     <lb/>Canada and the United States come under that 
     <lb/>Board — they are acting together as partners in 
     <lb/>western hemispheric defence. But from that can 
     <lb/>it be inferred, can it be presumed that Canada 
     <lb/>would request the United States to withdraw from 
     <lb/>these 99-year bases? Can it be argued that they 
     <lb/>would order the United States people to leave 
     <lb/>Newfoundland so that Canada could place her 
     <lb/>own troops on that base? And above all can it be 
     <lb/>presumed that Newfoundlanders working on the 
     <lb/>bases would lose their jobs? I have a little some<lb break="no"/>thing here to back up that. If Mr. Higgins or any 
     <lb/>of the members of the delegation are in the House 
     <lb/>they will either affirm or deny it. I raised that very 
     <lb/>question in Canada and we were assured by the 
     <lb/>Government of Canada that no such thing would 
     <lb/>happen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is it in the Books? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It will be better than in the 
     <lb/>Books within a matter of weeks. Every New<lb break="no"/>foundlander will be assured definitely and finally 
     <lb/>that under confederation they will go on being 
     <lb/>employed on the bases as if confederation had 
     <lb/>never come at all. That will come out.... I have 
     <lb/>down here a note I made while Mr. Hollett was 
     <lb/>speaking. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not bound to take notice of 
     <lb/>your notes; please refer to remarks made by

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right, Mr. Hollett in the

     <lb/>

            <cb/>
           

     spoken here this afternoon along the same line. 
     <lb/>
     He read from the municipal tax act of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. He might have gone a step further and sent 
     <lb/>
     to the various other provinces and found out what 
     <lb/>
     powers the provincial legislatures have given the 
     <lb/>
     town councils.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> He might have found out what 
     <lb/>
     powers the town councils act of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     gives the town councils. He might have gone still 
     <lb/>
     further and found out what powers are given 
     <lb/>
     under the municipal charter of St. John's — what 
     <lb/>
     authority the municipal council has in St. John's 
     <lb/>
     — the taxes on houses, homes, land, shops, goods 
     <lb/>
     in the shops and taxes on property generally in 
     <lb/>
     the City of St. John's. No, not a word about that. 
     <lb/>
     Not a word about the taxes on property in the 
     <lb/>
     Windsor area, although he must have known 
     <lb/>
     quite a bit about it. He might have found out what

     the town council in Corner Brook West is per<lb break="no"/>mitted to collect. We have 20 town councils — 
     <lb/>
     not all functioning yet....

            <p>
     And there are ten others in various stages of 
     <lb/>
     preparation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If Newfoundland becomes a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Newfoundland will be subject to three 
     <lb/>
     governments — some will be subject to two 
     <lb/>
     governments. All Newfoundland will be govern<lb break="no"/>ed in some things by the Government of Canada; 
     <lb/>
     in other things it will be the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland; and they will also be governed 
     <lb/>
     by the town councils. When has the federal 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada ever collected a dollar or 
     <lb/>
     a cent on any kind of property? Never has it 
     <lb/>
     collected any taxes on land, houses, property or

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I know you did not say it. You
