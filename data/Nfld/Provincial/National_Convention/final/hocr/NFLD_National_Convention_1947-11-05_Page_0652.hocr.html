</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin That’s right. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett “Also our people carry life <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin Those ﬁgures regarding the
total <br />

obtained from an ofﬁcial source... <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett Turn to page 7, in regard to
the <br />
matter of conversion. “When a delegation from <br />
this Convention met representatives of the <br />
British government in London several months <br />
ago, we were advised by the Dominions Ofﬁce <br />
that, beginning January 1, 1948, the conversion <br />
of our 3% guaranteed stock, which amounts to <br />
£17,790,000, or in dollar currency approximately <br />
$72 million, which is at present bearing interest <br />
at 3%, would be made, and that new stock would <br />
be issued bearing interest at 2 1/2%.” I know that <br />
is correct. Did your Committee make any in- <br />
quiries as to why that conversion will not be <br />
carried out? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin Mr. Hollett will know that
when <br />
Lord Addison made that statement he said that <br />
three months’ notice had to be given, that is on <br />
October 1, but three or four days prior to that date <br />
an announcement was made here by the govem- <br />
ment that conditions would not permit this ster- <br />
ling debt to be converted at this time. In looking <br />
up the financial papers since that time, the Lon- <br />
don papers, and looking up the prices paid for <br />
bonds, I ﬁnd that the Newfoundland 3% stock <br />
was selling on the London Stock Exchange at that <br />
time at 102 point something. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett Did your Committee endeavour
to <br />
find out why conditions would not permit? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin No, we did not, I will be
quite frank <br />
about that. It was done and that’s all there is to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> <br />
We hold that it should have been done, and we <br />
feel it could have been done, but the point is this <br />
—I know why it was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done...</span>
It was because <br />
it would mean an extra $500,000 saving to the <br />
country, and it would mean an extra $500,000 <br />
that Great Britain would not get, and which she <br />
is now anxious to get in dollar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exchange.</span>
That’s <br />
my personal opinion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett You did not enquire from any
offi- <br />
cial source? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin No, it was an official
announce- <br />
ment. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_12" title="bbox 932 185 1469 1878">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett Will you turn to page l0? You
say <br />
there: “For purposes therefore of explanation we <br />
give herewith proposed expenditures under the <br />
various departmental <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">headings..."</span>
Could you tell <br />
me on what you based these ﬁgures? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin <big>I</big> can, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hollett. We have first of <br />
all Consolidated Fund service, that means the <br />
servicing of our public debt. That means today <br />
the totals are $3,374,000, but the conversion on <br />
that sterling debt, and by the application of the <br />
interest-free loans we have given Great Britain, <br />
and by the application of the sinking fund, and, <br />
as I said the conversion of the balance of our <br />
sterling debt to 2 1/2%, we would save ap- <br />
proximately $1 million. Now if we take $1 mil- <br />
lion off $3,374,000, which is the Consolidated <br />
Fund service, we ﬁnd that it would amount to <br />
$2,374,000, but for the purposes of more ac- <br />
curacy, and to create more discussion, I made it <br />
a round ﬁgure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2.5</span> million...
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett Now with regard to Finance...
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin I will explain them as you go
along, <br />
Mr. Hollett. With regard to Finance, if you take <br />
the estimate of expenditure for the present fiscal <br />
year, 1947 - 48, there is an amount of $2 million <br />
voted for the Railway, and there is a remark <br />
which says: “Provision is made there for a <br />
general subsidy of $100,000, which is included <br />
in the $ l.2 million." That subsidy is paid annually <br />
anyhow, therefore the deﬁcit is $2 million. Now <br />
the General Manager of the Railway stated that <br />
once those capital expenditures were finished, <br />
the deﬁcit on the Railway would not be more than <br />
$750,000; and so we deducted this $750,000 <br />
from the $2 million, and it leaves us $1.25 million <br />
paid in this respect. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett Thank you, and Customs? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cashin They are all present estimates
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-</span> <br />
cept with the Education Department when <br />
there is an increased vote under this proposed <br />
plan of $650,000 a year, which would be used no <br />
doubt for giving school teachers more money, or <br />
in a general way. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Hollett I have elicited from the
chairman of <br />
the Committee with regard to these ﬁgures of <br />
$500 million and $496 million, that these are <br />
deﬁnite facts taken from the Financial Report <br />
which was presented and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed...</span>
An insinua- <br />
tion was made here yesterday that these ﬁgures <br />
were poppycock, pure nonsense, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tomt‘oolery.</span>
