     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Neither have I, but say you 
     <lb/>
     loaned me $1,000 and I agreed to pay you 3% 
     <lb/>
     interest on that $1,000 every year, so the first year 
     <lb/>
     comes around and I pay you the interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> $30. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Besides that, I am supposed to 
     <lb/>
     put aside so much in the bank to meet that prin<lb break="no"/>cipal of$1,000 in say ten years, so that is $100 a 
     <lb/>
     year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The first year rolls around and 
     <lb/>
     I put in $100 for sinking fund, and I pay you the 
     <lb/>
     interest of $30. Is this what you mean, that at the 
     <lb/>
     end of the second year I have put another amount 
     <lb/>
     into the sinking fund, which reduces it by what? 
     <lb/>
     Say the sinking fund is another $100, all right that 
     <lb/>
     reduces it to $800, but I am still paying you 
     <lb/>
     interest on the $1,000? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Oh no, you are not, you don't owe 
     <lb/>
     me $1,000 now, you only owe me $800. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Exactly, well where have I lost 
     <lb/>
     money? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You have not, but the country has.

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, you are not the country.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, in this illustration 1 am 
     <lb/>
     the country, and you are the bondholders in 
     <lb/>
     England. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, the bondholders don't get the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I owe you $1,000.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You don't understand it, and your 
     <lb/>
     talk is driving me crazy. You don't understand it, 
     <lb/>
     and it is impossible to drive it into your head. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am very thick-headed and

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     very dumb, but I am trying to get this straightened 
     <lb/>
     out. Where has Newfoundland lost it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> She has lot it in interest I tell you, 
     <lb/>
     by the trustees of the sinking fund not investing 
     <lb/>
     it when it went over there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They did not invest it in our 
     <lb/>
     bonds? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They did not invest it at all, and we 
     <lb/>
     have lost interest on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And they lost interest on it? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Sure. When they bought it in the 
     <lb/>interest was £177,950. The next year when we 
     <lb/>sent over interest, the interest was paid into the 
     <lb/>sinking fund. The next year they sent over 
     <lb/>another £177,950, and they might not have been 
     <lb/>able to buy it in, and consequently they got on 
     <lb/>interest on it, but you are sending interest over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We are sending interest over, 
     <lb/>not on the sinking fund, but on the portion of the 
     <lb/>debt that they did not buy in. Is that because they 
     <lb/>could not buy it in? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I don't know, because here's the 
     <lb/>
     position. We have asked for a statement of ac<lb break="no"/>count, and the sinking fund, and all you can get 
     <lb/>
     is two lines in the Auditor' General's report. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hickman I don't think the reporter can go

     question.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Is it intended to be two separate

     motions or what? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr Chairman It could be two separate motions, 
     <lb/>
     but by that change it is immaterial.... One is just 
     <lb/>
     that you do now receive, and the other is that on 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow the motion will be made to resolve the 
     <lb/>
     Convention into a committee of the whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I suggest that it might be better to 
     <lb/>
     have two separate motions in the matter, rather 
     <lb/>
     than have this in the double-barrelled form that it 
     <lb/>
     is now.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Frankly I am at a loss myself to 
     <lb/>
     see why it needs two motions to accomplish what 
     <lb/>
     may be embodied into one item.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, the moving into the commit<lb break="no"/>tee of the whole, Mr. Chairman, follows on the

     receiving of this report, does it not?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Oh yes, quite.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> This does both together?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Oh no, no. It says that it is a 
     <lb/>
     motion that the report be received, but that on the 
     <lb/>
     following day a motion will be made. It presup<lb break="no"/>poses two acts, one the motion to resolve the

     time by 24 hours to the motion to receive the

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Does that not automatically mean 
     <lb/>
     that we go into committee of the whole?

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I can probably clear the matter up. 
     <lb/>
     A motion to receive, of course, is one which we 
     <lb/>
     must pass, if for no other reason than as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of courtesy, not only to a friendly nation, but a 
     <lb/>
     member of our own Commonwealth. The motion 
     <lb/>
     to refer to a committee tomorrow merely puts it 
 
            <cb/>
           

     on the order paper for tomorrow. But I want it to 
     <lb/>
     be clearly understood by any member of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention who does not so understand it, that it 
     <lb/>
     is not my intention to continue or to begin any 
     <lb/>
     debate upon these terms which have come down 
     <lb/>
     from Canada until we have finished the debate on 
     <lb/>
     the report which we are now considering, and in 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary course of parliamentary procedure 
     <lb/>
     on each day I shall move in the proper time that 
     <lb/>
     the order for referring this matter to a committee 
     <lb/>
     of the whole house be deferred from day to day. 
     <lb/>
     I shall do that until this Economic Report has 
     <lb/>
     been completed.

            </p>

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I have no objection to the report

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> In speaking to the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report, I will say at the outset that I am by nature 
     <lb/>
     somewhat of a pessimist.... However, I have 
     <lb/>
     never descended to such depths of despair as 
     <lb/>
     certain delegates of this Convention have in 
     <lb/>
     recent days, notably the delegates from Bonavis<lb break="no"/>ta. I'm sure too that there are a great many people 
     <lb/>
     in their districts who have much more hope for 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow than their representatives here would 
     <lb/>
     tend to suggest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But enough of that. At last we have before us 
     <lb/>
     the report on the economic position of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. It is a good report, completed in a 
     <lb/>
     comparatively short time — two weeks — and it 
     <lb/>
     is also a satisfying report, in the conclusions that 
     <lb/>
     it draws and the evidence that it supplies to sup<lb break="no"/>port these conclusions. As was to be expected, 
     <lb/>
     the Jeremiahs and the Doubting Thomases have 
     <lb/>
     been having their say, searching its pages to find 
     <lb/>
     loopholes through which to shoot the arrows of 
     <lb/>
     their pessimism and scorn, which tend to dis<lb break="no"/>credit the reasonably favourable forecast which 


            <cb/>
          

     the compilers of the report have made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I say "reasonably favourable", for that's what 
     <lb/>
     it is. I think too it is a realistic canvas they have 
     <lb/>
     painted, I don't think it is over-optimistic. I don't 
     <lb/>
     think it deserves such sweeping denunciations as 
     <lb/>
     came from one delegate, who went to the extreme 
     <lb/>
     point of stating the report was not worth the paper 
     <lb/>
     it was printed on. Iexpect by now, however, most 
     <lb/>
     of the country realises that the delegate from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre is merely keeping in character. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. I would like Mr. 
     <lb/>Harrington to explain exactly what he means by 
     <lb/>that, or withdraw the remark. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> I mean that you have, since this

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, I don't think it will do. 
     <lb/>
     Personalities are not going to be permitted. it is 
     <lb/>
     not right and proper for one person to engage in 
     <lb/>
     debate by indulging in discriminations, and 
     <lb/>
     members will please refrain hereafter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> There were a few remarks 
     <lb/>
     made by the member from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     which were very interesting. He said that past 
     <lb/>
     governments had to borrow year after year to pay, 
     <lb/>
     amongst other things, the operating losses of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway. Later on he declared, again I think with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the Railway, that it has cost the 
     <lb/>
     people millions in taxes, and then, almost in the 
     <lb/>
     next breath observed that the government never 
     <lb/>
     did take in enough money in taxes to pay their 
     <lb/>
     bills — the government's bills. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps unwittingly, that delegate struck at the 
     <lb/>
     very root of Newfoundland's trouble in the past. 
     <lb/>
     Governments are run, are financed from the taxes 
     <lb/>
     that are collected from the people. If these taxes 
     <lb/>
     are inadequate, the government must borrow. 
     <lb/>
     That is what happened in Newfoundland. People 
     <lb/>
     do not like to pay taxes in any country. It is said 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundlanders are traditionally opposed 
     <lb/>
     to taxation, even in St. John's — which has had 
     <lb/>
     local government for nearly 60 years. But espe<lb break="no"/>cially outside St. John's, in the thousands of 
     <lb/>
     communities where nearly every man is inde<lb break="no"/>pendent, owns his own house, his own boat, his 
     <lb/>
     own bit of ground, and where, until recent times, 
     <lb/>
     there was and still is no local government, and 
     <lb/>
     where taxes of any kind, that is direct taxes, are 
     <lb/>
     almost unknown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hence, these past governments, whose 
     <lb/>
     finance ministers were mentioned by the delegate 
     <lb/>
     from Bonavista Centre — the last thing they 
     <lb/>
     dared think of was increased taxation. He knows 
     <lb/>
     as well as I do that the manifestos of each party 
     <lb/>
     that strived for election always promised reduced 
     <lb/>
     taxation. That was the vote-getter in New<lb break="no"/>foundland; it still gets a few votes in other 
     <lb/>
     countries too. Cut down the taxes. But they 
     <lb/>
     couldn't cut them all down. So they had to get as 
     <lb/>
     much as they could in a way that the people 
     <lb/>
     wouldn't feel too much. And that is one of the 
     <lb/>
     main reasons why we have a customs tariff that 
     <lb/>
     people say is too high. Local industries may have 
     <lb/>
     caused some of it by excessive protection, but no 
     <lb/>
     one will deny that the attempt by former govern<lb break="no"/>ments to extract taxes the painless way, the in<lb break="no"/>direct way, had more to do with it than people 
  

            <cb/>
           

     admit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there was a limit to what revenue could be 
     <lb/>
     raised from the customs. And so there were 
     <lb/>
     deficits and the government had to borrow. And 
     <lb/>
     this happened time and again. And apart from the 
     <lb/>
     few instances of local government now in exist<lb break="no"/>ence, the same antipathy to taxation of a direct 
     <lb/>
     kind exists. I don't think I'm a bit off the subject 
     <lb/>
     when I Speak in this strain. For we cannot keep 
     <lb/>
     our heads in the sand forever. In this world the 
     <lb/>
     people only get what they pay for, and that ap<lb break="no"/>plies to governments, and the things that govern<lb break="no"/>ments nowadays are expected to provide — 
     <lb/>
     social services, social security and so on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Governments will give the people what they 
     <lb/>
     demand; but they will charge them extra for each 
     <lb/>
     extra benefit. In this respect, and while taxation 
     <lb/>
     is the topic, I want to refer to the breakdown of 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report's statement of revenue — 
     <lb/>
     that $30 million. We see that the customs returns 
     <lb/>
     almost double the income tax figures — and that 
     <lb/>
     is a far cry from the budget of 1923, when cus<lb break="no"/>toms returns were about 15 times as much. So we 
     <lb/>
     can see the burden is being shifted, and I hope 
     <lb/>
     there will be a gradual decrease in the indirect 
     <lb/>
     figures and a gradual increase in the direct tax 
     <lb/>
     figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there again, how far can we go? That point 
     <lb/>
     interested me so much that when we had a meet<lb break="no"/>ing with Commissioner for Finance Wild, I asked 
     <lb/>
     him a plain question on it. I asked Mr. Wild, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the gradual shifting of the tax burden 
     <lb/>
     from indirect to direct, if it was his opinion that 
     <lb/>
     the great part of our revenue would or could soon 
     <lb/>
     be raised from direct taxation. His reply was a 
     <lb/>
     decided "No." And every man here knows why, 
     <lb/>
     even if Mr. Wild hadn't outlined why. Direct 
     <lb/>
     taxation can be successfully collected from 
     <lb/>
     people with fixed incomes, week by week, month 
     <lb/>
     by month. A large proportion of our people do 
     <lb/>
     not have such incomes. The fishermen are 
     <lb/>
     capitalists on a small scale. They are inde<lb break="no"/>pendent, individualistic. It is hard to assess their 
     <lb/>
     earnings. They know very little of direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland is synonymous with fish. That 
     <lb/>
     shouldn't offend us. But knowing that it is, we 
     <lb/>
     should be curious to note that of the $90 million 
     <lb/>
     which the Committee estimates for our total earn<lb break="no"/>ing power, only one-third is expected to accrue 
     <lb/>
     from the fishery. And that notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>
     fact that there are almost twice as many people 


            <pb n="674"

     engaged in the fishing as in the pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     industry, which page 32 gives as 25,000 people 
     <lb/>
     with earning power of $50 million. There is 
     <lb/>
     something wrong there; not in the report, but in 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances which have produced these 
     <lb/>
     figures. The answer is, I suppose, in the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the countries buying our newsprint are wealthy 
     <lb/>
     countries, and those buying our fish are poor and 
     <lb/>
     from all accounts will get poorer. The answer is 
     <lb/>
     obvious. We must get fish markets in rich 
     <lb/>
     countries, and that can only mean the United 
     <lb/>
     States, by some kind of reciprocity, a trade agree<lb break="no"/>ment which the Committee stresses and to which 
     <lb/>
     I will return later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In connection with the use of the estimated 
     <lb/>
     surplus for succeeding years, I find myself in 
     <lb/>
     agreement with the delegate from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre on one point only, namely the matter of 
     <lb/>
     old age pensions. I don't think we should fall into 
     <lb/>
     that state of thinking which suggests we must 
     <lb/>
     have surpluses before we can increase the old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions and lower the age qualification, and the 
     <lb/>
     widows and orphans allowances too. We must 
     <lb/>
     write that into our budgets as something we must 
     <lb/>
     finance.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Like other speakers, I cannot subscribe to the 
     <lb/>
     theory that our continually increasing revenues 
     <lb/>
     are due to the war. Anyone who heard Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett's capable discussion on that point will 
     <lb/>
     agree. And for that matter, even if they were 
     <lb/>
     partly caused by that fact, isn't it oppositely true 
     <lb/>
     that our expenditures are also high for the same 
     <lb/>
     reason, and that a decrease in one will mean a 
     <lb/>
     decrease in the other? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't think either that this report tries to 
     <lb/>
     claim that all is right with the world. But it does 
     <lb/>
     show, as well as it can be shown, that things look 
     <lb/>
     pretty good for Newfoundland. I grant you that 
     <lb/>
     there are genuine cases of hardship in the 
     <lb/>
     country. There are lots of men unemployed in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's today, besides fishermen in our bays who 
     <lb/>
     may not have made a good season. But am I to 
     <lb/>
     say Newfoundland is not financially sound and 
     <lb/>
     has good prospects because of these facts? It is 
     <lb/>
     the job of government to provide avenues of 
     <lb/>
     employment for its people, and if there are more 
     <lb/>
     hands in St. John's than work to go around, or if 
     <lb/>
     the Labrador fishery is failing, then it is up to the 
     <lb/>
     government to give the necessary leadership for 
     <lb/>
     people affected by these conditions to turn to 
     <lb/>
     other sources of industry, or other areas. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Perhaps in connection with the development 
     <lb/>
     of the fisheries, some thought might again be 
     <lb/>
     given to a scheme successfully tried in Trinity 
     <lb/>
     Bay in the 1890s, the Dildo fish hatchery. Who 
     <lb/>
     knows but that something along these lines on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador coast might inject new life in the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador fishery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am no financier, and can offer very little 
     <lb/>
     comment on such complicated matters as the 
     <lb/>
     servicing of the public debt and sinking funds and 
     <lb/>
     so on. But even a blind man can see the wisdom 
     <lb/>
     of saving a million dollars, which appears can be 
     <lb/>
     easily done by the conversion of the interest-free 
     <lb/>
     loan from 3% to 2%. If that is so, and I can take 
     <lb/>
     the Committee's word for it, with the evidence 
     <lb/>
     given, then it is criminal if advantage is not taken 
     <lb/>
     of such a move. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like now to refer to the conclusions 
     <lb/>
     of the Committee. They state that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     is a self-supporting country, based on sound 
     <lb/>
     economic factors; and that all the evidence avail<lb break="no"/>able to us indicates that this position of self-sup<lb break="no"/>port will continue in the foreseeable future. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion the Committee's second conclusion is of 
     <lb/>
     far more importance than their first. As the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee hinted in the winding-up section of the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report, this was a foregone con<lb break="no"/>clusion. Here is their evidence:

            <p>
     To discuss this first conclusion of the report is 
     <lb/>
     merely to labour the obvious. I think it safe to say 
     <lb/>
     that the majority of delegates when they came to 
     <lb/>
     this Convention had a closed mind on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject. They believed, I know I did, that the country 
     <lb/>
     was then self-supporting, and I feel sure that a 
     <lb/>
     great many of the people of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador believed it also. However, while I did 
     <lb/>
     not exactly have doubts, I did have a lack of 
     <lb/>
     understanding as to just how far this condition of 
     <lb/>
     self-support was due to wartime conditions. I 
     <lb/>
     confess I was eager for enlightenment on this 
     <lb/>
     score, so that even the financial bugbear might be 
     <lb/>
     removed from the minds of our people and enable 
     <lb/>
     them to make up their minds on the wisdom and

     desirability of resuming control of their own 
     <lb/>
     country and its affairs. And while on the few 
     <lb/>
     occasions when I spoke my piece I made it quite 
     <lb/>
     clear as to what I stood for, self-government for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders, I did so with a mental reserva<lb break="no"/>tion that my stand in the final hours of this unique 
     <lb/>
     assembly would be governed by and was depend<lb break="no"/>ent on the final and unquestionable conclusions 
     <lb/>
     of the Economic Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Which brings me to the second conclusion, 
     <lb/>
     "that all the evidence available to us indicates that 
     <lb/>
     this position of self-support will continue in the 
     <lb/>
     foreseeable future". They have defined the 
     <lb/>
     "foreseeable future" as a three-year period, from 
     <lb/>
     now to 1950, and have thus gone far beyond the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary requirements of any finance minister in 
     <lb/>
     the presentation of a budget. But that is as it 
     <lb/>
     should be, for our task is somewhat different, and 
     <lb/>
     it is as much to instill courage and hope in the 
     <lb/>
     many faint hearts in our midst, as to prove to the 
     <lb/>
     country and the world in dollars and cents that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland can afford democracy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is this insistence in our terms of reference 
     <lb/>
     on the question of self-support that has pilloried 
     <lb/>
     us in the eyes of the world as a nation of paupers 
     <lb/>
     casting about on all sides for the inevitable hand<lb break="no"/>out. The figures listed on page 3 of this report 
     <lb/>
     should certainly give the lie to that assertion 
     <lb/>
     made so continuously by outsiders as well as the 
     <lb/>
     Cassandras in our midst. A people with $80 mil<lb break="no"/>lion in savings, and $100 million worth of life 
     <lb/>
     insurance protection, can hardly be considered 
     <lb/>
     paupers. And I don't believe for a moment that 
     <lb/>
     the merchants own all those savings and life 
     <lb/>
     insurance policies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Committee's opinion that the mercantile 
     <lb/>
     marine branch of the Railway should be 
     <lb/>
     separated from the Railway system generally, 
     <lb/>
     seems to be a sound one. I am not enough of an 
     <lb/>
     authority on shipping to go into this point at 
     <lb/>
     length, and will expect to hear more on it from 
     <lb/>
     someone like Captain Bailey. I have always felt 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland should have a mercantile 
     <lb/>
     marine. She did have one of the finest, and at one 
     <lb/>
     time, I believe, one of the largest for a country of 
     <lb/>
     her size and population in the world. There 
     <lb/>
     wasn't a port in the civilised world where the 
     <lb/>
     White sails and the house flags of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     vessels did not flash against the blue, year-in and 
     <lb/>
     year-out. It could be done again.

     The section on Gander airport calls for com<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
         
ment. I agree with the Committee's observation 
     <lb/>
     that, "It is the foreign airlines that profit through 
     <lb/>
     the operation of Gander airport, and it is these 
     <lb/>
     same airlines which should be made responsible 
     <lb/>
     for any deficits that may accrue in operation." 
     <lb/>
     Please let no one stand up and rave about the fact 
     <lb/>
     that so many Newfoundlanders are getting work 
     <lb/>
     at Gander. We are all aware of that. It is a good 
     <lb/>
     thing. But the airport cannot run itself. And it 
     <lb/>
     costs a lot less for the foreign airlines to run it 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland help than by importing their 
     <lb/>
     own, which would never be allowed anyway. 
     <lb/>
     Incidentally, while speaking of Gander, I should 
     <lb/>
     like to refer to a statement I made 12 months ago 
     <lb/>
     — I can hardly believe it — when the Gander 
     <lb/>
     airport section of Transportation Committee's 
     <lb/>
     report was being debated. In stressing the point 
     <lb/>
     now made again by the Economic Committee, 
     <lb/>
     the use of Gander at the expense of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, I said in the heat of debate that Gander 
     <lb/>
     should have been closed down, if that was the 
     <lb/>
     best deal die government could make. That was 
     <lb/>
     not to be taken literally, but the intention was to 
     <lb/>
     convey my belief that a far better deal could have 
     <lb/>
     been made out of which Newfoundlanders would 
     <lb/>
     still have received employment, and that in addi<lb break="no"/>tion, the country would not have to stand the 
     <lb/>
     expense of running the airport for the con<lb break="no"/>venience of foreign airlines. The threat of closing 
     <lb/>
     down this vast airport would have brought the 
     <lb/>
     airlines to our way of thinking soon enough. The 
     <lb/>
     implication is, therefore, that no attempt was 
     <lb/>
     made to strike a better bargain and the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     reached by me is the same as that of the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Committee, that the airport was used by the 
     <lb/>
     British government for the furtherance of ends in 
     <lb/>
     the international field. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The revenues of the country are now ap<lb break="no"/>proaching the staggering sum of nearly $40 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Yet for purposes of planning the shape of 
     <lb/>
     the foreseeable future, the Economic Committee 
     <lb/>
     has chopped that figure ruthlessly down to $30 
     <lb/>
     million. They have estimated that the expendi<lb break="no"/>tures can be kept within $25 million, which is $2 
     <lb/>
     million above the figure that Finance Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner Wild, who should know, gave this Con<lb break="no"/>vention as the irreducible minimum — that is, the 
     <lb/>
     figure below which expenditures cannot drop in 
     <lb/>
     order to keep up the services now in existence. 
     <lb/>
     The Committee estimates an annual surplus of $5 
     <lb/>
     million, out of which various reconstruction and 
   

            <pb n="676"

     other projects can be financed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Newfoundland of the foreseeable future 
     <lb/>
     is far different from the Newfoundland of recent 
     <lb/>
     memory, such as in the years before the sad 
     <lb/>
     accident of war changed us from a relatively 
     <lb/>
     obscure island to a country of immense strategic 
     <lb/>
     importance to three friendly nations, and possibly 
     <lb/>
     to a fourth unfriendly one. As the Committee 
     <lb/>
     states, the war is over two years and our revenues 
     <lb/>
     continue to rise. Some of this may be due to the 
     <lb/>
     momentum of war expenditures, but allowing for 
     <lb/>
     a gradual recession, it is safe to conclude that it 
     <lb/>
     will be some time before the revenue sinks as low 
     <lb/>
     as the $30 million provided in the Committee's 
     <lb/>
     estimates. Military and air bases are held by the 
     <lb/>
     richest and most powerful nation in the modern 
     <lb/>
     world, the USA; great airports in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Labrador are under our sovereignty; in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, there is revealed mineral wealth for 
     <lb/>
     which the world is clamouring, so that the 
     <lb/>
     imagination is staggered by the fabulous prospect 
     <lb/>
     of industrial development that is in the offing for 
     <lb/>
     our northern dependency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This then is the Newfoundland that faces the 
     <lb/>
     future, be it foreseeable or veiled. I have made no 
     <lb/>
     mention of surpluses, or low per capita debts. 
     <lb/>
     Neither haveI made any mention of the splendid 
     <lb/>
     type of men and women who go to make up this 
     <lb/>
     country of Newfoundlanders, or of the forbears 
     <lb/>
     from whom they sprang. In 1855 this country was 
     <lb/>
     a wilderness, and when those same forbears took 
     <lb/>
     over the running of this primitive land, I don't 
     <lb/>
     believe for a moment they bit off more than they 
     <lb/>
     could chew. In fact, I think it was a great pity that 
     <lb/>
     circumstances prevented them from taking a big<lb break="no"/>ger bite, a bite which is in the capacity of their 
     <lb/>
     descendants to take, the bite that includes the 
     <lb/>
     passing of the Statute of Westminster, by which 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland could for the first time in its his<lb break="no"/>tory be really independent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I make this point to underscore the observa<lb break="no"/>tions made by the Committee on page 27 which 
     <lb/>
     refer to the "importance of steps being taken as 
     <lb/>
     soon as possible to negotiate with the authorities 
     <lb/>
     of the USA, with a view to bringing about a trade 
     <lb/>
     agreement which would solve for all time our 
     <lb/>
     whole fishery situation". That is the best argu<lb break="no"/>ment I know for the attainment of the three square 
     <lb/>
     meals a day that some delegates have been prone 
     <lb/>
     to harp on, no doubt with the sincerest of motives. 
     <lb/>
     We had a chance to make such a trade agreement 


            <cb/>
          

     many years ago. It was blocked by outsiders, only 
     <lb/>
     because Newfoundland was not completely inde<lb break="no"/>pendent, as she would be today if she could pass 
     <lb/>
     the Statute of Westminister. That is what the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Committee means when it says, "We 
     <lb/>
     are of the definite view that if proper repre<lb break="no"/>sentations were now made, by a properly con<lb break="no"/>stituted Government of Newfoundland, that the 
     <lb/>
     American government as well as the American 
     <lb/>
     people whom we consider fair and just, would 
     <lb/>
     certainly seriously consider giving New<lb break="no"/>foundland some favourable tariff concessions for 
     <lb/>
     our fishery products".... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot close without referring to the final 
     <lb/>
    phrases of the report, in which they emphasise the 
     <lb/>need for faith in ourselves and in our country. 
     <lb/>Without this faith, this confidence in our ability 
     <lb/>to work and produce and strive for ourselves and 
     <lb/>our children, it will go hard with us under any 
     <lb/>form of government, but hardest of all under a 
     <lb/>form where the state becomes more and more 
     <lb/>supreme, and the citizen is left to suffer at its 
     <lb/>hands any and all the petty tyrannies and vicis<lb break="no"/>situdes that popular representation, no matter 
     <lb/>how inadequate, can always endeavour to thwart 
     <lb/>and to correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Chairman, I wish to add my 
     <lb/>word of praise and thanks to the gentlemen who 
     <lb/>prepared this excellent Economic Report... 
     <lb/>Briefly, they tell me that at present we owe for 
     <lb/>loans approximately $60 million. Against this we 
     <lb/>have our savings, a total of $74 million. Insurance 
     <lb/>companies owe our policy holders $22 million, 
     <lb/>in addition to this there are another $3-4 million 
     <lb/>that people have in their homes, in the sock so to 
     <lb/>speak, so that our total cash is about $100 million, 
     <lb/>and then of course we have our other assets.... A 
     <lb/>businessman who could present such a compara<lb break="no"/>tive showing would be considered very well off 
     <lb/>indeed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     We are asked to try and determine to what 
     <lb/>
     extent the war has caused our prosperity. We 
     <lb/>
     know that wars bring on scarcity and high prices, 
     <lb/>
     and we have been affected like all countries, but 
     <lb/>
     it would take an economist of the highest order 
     <lb/>
     to go further than this. One expert will say that 
     <lb/>
     wars bring prosperity, and another expert will say 
     <lb/>
     that prosperity brings on wars, so which is the 
     <lb/>
     cause, and which is the effect? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the early 1930s we had a severe depression, 
     <lb/>
     and I know that the depression was worldwide. 
   

            <pb n="677"

     In the USA conditions were very bad. In Canada 
     <lb/>
     soup kitchens and bread lines (I know personally) 
     <lb/>
     were a very common sight, so that we fared about 
     <lb/>
     the same as other countries — and our depression 
     <lb/>
     was brought about by economics rather than 
     <lb/>
     politics.

            </p>

            <p>
     The member from Bonavista Centre said a few 
     <lb/>
     days ago that if Grand Falls did not start when it 
     <lb/>
     did; if the first world war did not happen, and if 
     <lb/>
     Buchans and Comer Brook did not start, we 
     <lb/>
     would be in a more or less chronic depression. 
     <lb/>
     This, by use of the word "if", attempts to 
     <lb/>
     demolish all the prosperity that we may have 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed in the last 40 years.... No complete solu<lb break="no"/>tion has been yet found to the problem of ups and 
     <lb/>
     downs in business, and a man can be just as 
     <lb/>
     hungry in other countries as in Newfoundland. A 
     <lb/>
     few people think that our economic security can 
     <lb/>
     be found by us ceasing to be Newfoundlanders, 
     <lb/>
     but I am told that only once in all time was there 
     <lb/>
     a place designed to satisfy man's need. That was 
     <lb/>
     the Garden of Eden — and we all know what 
     <lb/>
     happened to the Garden of Eden. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reviewing our economic situation, there are 
     <lb/>
     a few fundamentals that I think we should never 
     <lb/>
     forget. First, I believe there is no Santa Claus; 
     <lb/>
     second, I believe that since the Garden of Eden, 
     <lb/>
     man has had to earn his bread by the sweat of his 
     <lb/>
     brow; third, I believe you get nothing for nothing, 
     <lb/>
     not even baby bonuses.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I rise to a point of order. 
     <lb/>
     This sounds to me perilously like an attack on 
     <lb/>
     confederation, which has not come up for debate 
     <lb/>
     yet. If we are going to debate it I am prepared, but 
     <lb/>
     let's debate it, baby bonuses and all the rest. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I can't see the possible connec<lb break="no"/>tion between baby bonuses and the debate here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of order. I object 
     <lb/>very strongly to interrupting a speaker when he 
     <lb/>is speaking. I do think baby bonuses have a lot to 
     <lb/>do with the economics of the householder, and 
     <lb/>therefore of the country. If anyone wants to refer 
     <lb/>to baby bonuses during his discussion I see no 
     <lb/>reason why any member should be refused. It 
     <lb/>certainly is an economic question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He has no right to read into that 
     <lb/>
     report anything that is not there. He is discussing 
     <lb/>
     this report before the Chair, and I ask him to 
     <lb/>
     confine his remarks to that, and none of us can go 
     <lb/>
     wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Fourth, I believe we have to work 
     

            <cb/>
            

     out our own salvation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some gentlemen say that the solution to our 
     <lb/>
     problems is in politics. I think our problems are 
     <lb/>
     economic, not political; and our economic future 
     <lb/>
     depends on our producing more, and finding 
     <lb/>
     markets for what we produce. Last year Canada 
     <lb/>
     sold us $37 million worth of goods, but bought 
     <lb/>
     very little from us. If a businessman were faced 
     <lb/>
     with a similar situation he would arrange to 
     <lb/>
     change this. He would seek another source for his 
     <lb/>
     purchases, and would patronise the man or firm 
     <lb/>
     who bought from him. And if some of the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in this House were as truly sincere to 
     <lb/>
     try and improve the economic state of New<lb break="no"/>foundland as they say they are, they might during 
     <lb/>
     the past six or seven months have directed some 
     <lb/>
     of their speeches to this angle of our problems 
     <lb/>
     rather than offering their own pet political 
     <lb/>
     theories as a solution. That is fundamentally a 
     <lb/>
     matter of buying and selling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The USA is the greatest outlet actually and 
     <lb/>
     potentially for our products. Last year I believe 
     <lb/>
     she bought $19 million worth of our goods. She 
     <lb/>
     is the market for our cod fillets, lobster, salmon, 
     <lb/>
     herring, seal skins, cod oil, newsprint, berries, 
     <lb/>
     and anything we mind to produce. Is it foolish for 
     <lb/>
     me to think or say that our economic welfare lies 
     <lb/>
     in the direction of reducing our buying from 
     <lb/>
     Canada, who buys practically nothing from us, 
     <lb/>
     and spending these dollars in the USA, who will 
     <lb/>
     take more from us as we buy more from them? 
     <lb/>
     As I said before, it is our economic relations that 
     <lb/>
     have to be improved, and with the USA, and by 
     <lb/>
     that I don't mean political relations. We are all 
     <lb/>
     right as we are, and to me at least, what we want 
     <lb/>
     is a closer economic union with the USA, and not 
     <lb/>
     a political union with any other country.... What 
     <lb/>
     we want is a trade agreement with the USA, 
     <lb/>
     which a real patriot, Sir Robert Bond, almost 
     <lb/>
     negotiated years ago — only to be blocked and 
     <lb/>
     defeated because Canadian business interest suf<lb break="no"/>fered. Another truly great Newfoundlander who 
     <lb/>
     is in this house today, Hon. R. B. Job, has raised 
     <lb/>
     his voice along similar lines only to be drowned 
     <lb/>
     out by those who have the answers to all our 
     <lb/>
     problems in their own pet political theories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I see it, we work or starve. Manna ceased 
     <lb/>
     to fall from Heaven thousands of years ago. One 
     <lb/>
     gentleman said we have a chronic need of being 
     <lb/>
     subsidised, but I don't want or need to be sub<lb break="no"/>sidised, and I think the people resent the insinua<lb break="no"/>

     tion that they are paupers. I know that any country 
     <lb/>
     with rich soil is a rich country, and our soil is not 
     <lb/>
     rich, and it is a handicap. But to compensate, we 
     <lb/>
     have the rich seas at our doors, and there we have 
     <lb/>
     to look for our needs. As I see it, we have to 
     <lb/>
     produce more fish. We think we are a fish 
     <lb/>
     country, but for each pound per capita we 
     <lb/>
     produce, Iceland produces 30 pounds, so we are 
     <lb/>
     not doing nearly as much as we should. Except 
     <lb/>
     for the Bank fishery, our shore and Labrador 
     <lb/>
     fisheries are carried on about four months in 12, 
     <lb/>
     and people just cannot live for 12 months on what 
     <lb/>
     they produce in four. Fishing time has to be 
     <lb/>
     lengthened. Fishermen have to be equipped so 
     <lb/>
     that winter fishing can be carried on, the way it 
     <lb/>
     is down now in the Burgeo district. This has to 
     <lb/>
     pioneered by great Newfoundlanders like Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job, Mr. Crosbie and Mr. Monroe, the latter 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who is already with his fleet of drag<lb break="no"/>gers operating all year round on the south coast, 
     <lb/>
     and revolutionising the fishery there, making a 
     <lb/>
     large area of the Burin Peninsula prosperous. I 
     <lb/>
     suggest that in Placentia Bay alone,' the long 
     <lb/>
     reach running from Flat Islands almost the whole 
     <lb/>
     way down to Sound Island can be fished in the 
     <lb/>
     winter by 500 boats of about 15 tons, like those 
     <lb/>
     which are used in the winter fishery on the 
     <lb/>
     western shore. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may sound strange to some, but to my mind, 
     <lb/>
     in order to make a proper beginning towards 
     <lb/>
     making our people more industry conscious, we 
     <lb/>
     have to begin in the schools. We need a course in 
     <lb/>
     economies with particular regard to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, to be taught in every school and in 
     <lb/>
     every grade. The course can tell the story and 
     <lb/>
     point out the causes of our past reverses It can 
     <lb/>
     suggest the remedies, or at least indicate the 
     <lb/>
     course along which the solution lies. Scholar<lb break="no"/>ships can be set up to encourage the study of this 
     <lb/>
     subject, and everything should be done to make 
     <lb/>
     our children economics conscious. Our schools 
     <lb/>
     should have boys' and girls' brigades, such as 
     <lb/>
     Boy Scouts and Girl Guides — even if the 
     <lb/>
     government contributed something toward the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the little uniforms for the children. I think 
     <lb/>
     navigation should be compulsory in all CHE 
     <lb/>
     exams, and that an increase in the educational 
     <lb/>
     grant to carry this into effect should be made, 
     <lb/>
     because it will be an investment that will pay 
     <lb/>
     better dividends to Newfoundland than all the 
     <lb/>
     rosy pictures that come from the pipedreams of 


            <cb/>
          

     the would-be senators to Ottawa.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, a point of order. 
     <lb/>If this House wants a debate on confederation I

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not prepared. Please take

     <lb/>of this Convention." I want to make it clear that 
     <lb/>any words of this nature will be ruled out of order.

            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Thank you Mr. Chairman, I am not 
     <lb/>referring to any member.... I believe the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government started a good thing with the 
     <lb/>town councils; the only thing wrong with them is 
     <lb/>that they are far too few. We need more and more 
     <lb/>of them, because from them will come the men 
     <lb/>and women legislators of tomorrow.... Yes, more 
     <lb/>education is essential, and from it will come a 
     <lb/>consciousness and understanding for the need of 
     <lb/>great individual effort, and I believe that we are 
     <lb/>capable and worthy of such a programme, and if 
     <lb/>we carry out this programme we will be able to 
     <lb/>deal with our economic problems, so that we will 
     <lb/>make Newfoundland not only better known to 
     <lb/>Newfoundlanders but better known the world 
     <lb/>over. No doubt these thoughts do not appeal to 
     <lb/>our local Pied Piper who day-in and day-out plays 
     <lb/>his luring tune. But we are not hypnotized, and 
     <lb/>will not be lured into the waters of the Cabot 
     <lb/>Strait because we are not mice, but men.

            <p>
     In viewing the report I think our economic 
     <lb/>
     condition is both actually and comparatively very 
     <lb/>
     fair, and I fully approve and endorse it. The old 
     <lb/>
     saying says, "God helps those who help themsel<lb break="no"/>ves", and may God help those foolish enough to 
     <lb/>
     think that, if we don't help ourselves, Canada or 
     <lb/>
     any other country will do it for us.

     was no connection whatever between Canada

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> ....Mr. Chairman, I wonder how 
     <lb/>
     some of our large mercantile firms on Water 
     <lb/>
     Street look at the report. I ask members in their 
     <lb/>
     own minds to pick out one of the largest firms on 
     <lb/>
     Water Street today. Before the war that firm was 
     <lb/>
     selling so many goods and making so much 
     <lb/>
     profit. Suddenly the war comes along and that 
     <lb/>
     firm's sales start to jump, and they keep on in<lb break="no"/>creasing. That firm sells more goods and there<lb break="no"/>fore becomes more prosperous. They pay their 
     <lb/>
     clerks and other employees more wages; they do 
     <lb/>
     twice as much business as they did before the 
     <lb/>
     war, and are therefore two or three times as 
     <lb/>
     prosperous. Now if you went to the principals of 
     <lb/>
     that firm and asked them one simple question — 
     <lb/>
     what has caused this great prosperity that they are 
     <lb/>
     now enjoying? — would those principals say that 
     <lb/>
     it had nothing to do with the war? Would they say 
     <lb/>
     that it all came about from the normal growth of 
     <lb/>
     the business? If you go to any of our large fish 
     <lb/>
     firms, or to either of our paper mills or mining 
     <lb/>
     companies and ask them the same question, what 
     <lb/>
     would their answer be? Would any of them say 
     <lb/>
     that their present prosperity is not due to the war? 
     <lb/>
     Of course they wouldn't. Ask the people who 
     <lb/>
     have extra money in the bank, or the people who 
     <lb/>
     have taken out extra life insurance in the past few 
     <lb/>
     years, won't they tell you right away that they 
     <lb/>
     thank the war for it? The commonest saying you 
     <lb/>
     hear in Newfoundland when people mention the 
     <lb/>
     prosperity we have had, is that the man to thank 
     <lb/>
     for it all is Hitler. But when we turn to this 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report what do we find? Do we find 
     <lb/>
     this report admitting frankly and honestly the 
     <lb/>
     present improved conditions of the country are 
     <lb/>
     due to the war? No, it does not. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     If you turn to page 43, in the second paragraph

     you will find: "It is yet an obvious fact that our

     <lb/>up to the day the war broke out. Tens of thousands 
     <lb/>of our people were on the dole all the years from 
     <lb/>1930 to 1940. Then the war came and prosperity 
     <lb/>with it. Now the war is gradually passing away

     very careful and govern ourselves accordingly. 
     <lb/>
     Let us look at the revenue.... I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     every member, in their opinion do they think this 
     <lb/>
     extremely high revenue was brought about by the 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into this 
     <lb/>
     country during the war period from America, 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United Kingdom, or was it 
     <lb/>
     brought about by new industries started during 
     <lb/>
     the same period? If it was brought about by the 
     <lb/>
     influx of foreign money into the country on ac<lb break="no"/>count of war, I think I feel justified in estimating 
     <lb/>
     our revenue under normal conditions, that would 
     <lb/>
     be 1939-40, 1938-39 and farther back. The 
     <lb/>
     highest revenue then was $12.5 million At the 
     <lb/>
     present time we are receiving a revenue of around 
     <lb/>
     $10 million coming into the Assessor's Depart<lb break="no"/>ment. I can well remember the time when the 
     <lb/>
     earning power of this country under normal con<lb break="no"/>ditions would not bring in near this figure. In this 
     <lb/>
     report, on page 33, this Committee estimates the 
     <lb/>
     revenue as $9 million per year from the 
     <lb/>
     Assessor's Department for the next three years. 
     <lb/>
     In my opinion it might average half that amount, 
     <lb/>
     and I say this because the people who are the 
     <lb/>
     producers, the fishermen and the loggers, with 
     <lb/>
     others, find their earning power reduced, and in 
     <lb/>
     lots of cases to a minimum I can't agree with this 
     <lb/>
     estimated revenue for the next three years. There 
     <lb/>
     was a time during the war when fishermen, with 
     <lb/>
     their representatives, could sit around a table with 
     <lb/>
     the fish exporters, talk over and mutually agree 
     <lb/>
     on a reasonable price of fish to be paid to the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, before the fishermen would think of 
     <lb/>
     catching a quintal from the water. That privilege 
     <lb/>
     we enjoyed during the war years. In my opinion 
     <lb/>
     it has lately disappeared.... I am also given to 
     <lb/>
     understand that there are considerable quantities 
     <lb/>
     of fish to which nobody can give a correct es<lb break="no"/>timate of value. There are quantities of fish sent 
     <lb/>
     in here to be stored pending prospects of selling 
     <lb/>
     it sometime and at a price which nobody 
     <lb/>
     knows.... It not only applies to codfish. Last year 
     <lb/>
     lobster sold for as high as $58, and in some cases 
     <lb/>
     $60 per case What do we find this year? Why, it 
     <lb/>
     is being retailed right here in St. John's for less 
     <lb/>
     than 60 cents per pound tin, while last year it was 
     <lb/>
     retailed for as high as $1.20 per tin. In other words 
     <lb/>
     the value is less than half. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wonder, can the chairman tell this House the 
     <lb/>
     amount of war savings certificates cashed in 
     <lb/>
     during the past six months, the amount of money 
   

            <cb/>
         

     drawn from savings in the banks during the past 
     <lb/>
     six months? These are not mere estimates, they 
     <lb/>
     are the facts, and let us be like men and face the 
     <lb/>
     situation. This position, I am sure, can be better 
     <lb/>
     judged by the fishermen who are at a loss to know 
     <lb/>
     what their fish is going to realise, as well as by 
     <lb/>
     the merchant who supplies them, and who is 
     <lb/>
     taking in the fish as payment against their ac<lb break="no"/>count. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The paper industry and the forest products. 
     <lb/>
     The Committee has taken into account the as<lb break="no"/>surance of increased value. I am at a loss to see 
     <lb/>
     how this can be done when we all feel sure that 
     <lb/>
     there is very little hope. It is true that at the present 
     <lb/>
     time a large programme of expansion involving 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure of $10 million or more is being 
     <lb/>
     pushed forward at Corner Brook, but we want to 
     <lb/>
     remember the conditions and world affairs at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, and that almost anything can hap<lb break="no"/>pen overnight. Look at the lumber situation 
     <lb/>
     today. Six months ago one could sell rough lum<lb break="no"/>ber for as high as $60, and in some cases $70 per 
     <lb/>
     thousand What is it today? Go along Water 
     <lb/>
     Street, and they will tell you today's price, and in 
     <lb/>
     some cases you can't even get a buyer at any 
     <lb/>
     price.... We notice that the company at Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls had under serious consideration the further 
     <lb/>
     expansion of their industry in the Exploits River 
     <lb/>
     valley. However, this expansion has been 
     <lb/>
     postponed. The fact that at least some evidence 
     <lb/>
     of doubt exists in the minds of the AND Co. 
     <lb/>
     should make us think. Last year there was a 
     <lb/>
     shortage of wood. What caused that shortage to 
     <lb/>
     some extent was the scarcity of men. The scarcity 
     <lb/>
     of men for the woods was due to the fish last year 
     <lb/>
     being a fair price, but this year there is a different 
     <lb/>
     side to the picture, and I understand that practi<lb break="no"/>cally all the camps are filled. But very soon quite 
     <lb/>
     a few of the camps will have their quota of wood 
     <lb/>
     for the season, and the men will be returning to 
     <lb/>
     their homes with very little work to do. In view 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that last year we paid out over $1 
     <lb/>
     million in relief, this year I am afraid there will 
     <lb/>
     be considerably more needed to supply the 
     <lb/>
     demand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the producers, the fishermen and the log<lb break="no"/>gers, cannot get reasonable returns for their work, 
     <lb/>
     how can we expect this country to prosper? We 
     <lb/>
     must admit that we have to export to live, and to 
     <lb/>
     export we must produce, and if our men cannot 
     <lb/>
     produce at a reasonable profit I cannot see for the

     life of me how the people in this country, who are 
     <lb/>
     not actual producers, can expect anywhere near 
     <lb/>
     the returns which were coming in during the 
     <lb/>
     prosperous years of war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it was the member for Grand Falls, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hollett, who made the remark that one person on 
     <lb/>
     relief received $11 per month in St. John's, and 
     <lb/>
     two persons received $20.80 per month. I am 
     <lb/>
     repeating this to remind this House and the 
     <lb/>
     country at large what is being paid as relief in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's, so that they in turn who have to seek 
     <lb/>
     relief, through no cause of their own, in the 
     <lb/>
     outports, will have an idea of what to expect 
     <lb/>
     themselves. I wonder, did the Committee get a 
     <lb/>
     scale of relief that is to be paid out this winter?

     today which give us cause for satisfaction, and

            <p>
     Is that a wartime boom? I think not. Now I 
     <lb/>
     refer you to the fisheries. Salt cod, the much 
     <lb/>
     despised salt cod — I grant you that any man who 
     <lb/>
     has to live by catching and selling salt cod is 
     <lb/>
     bound to have a rough time going through this 
     <lb/>
     life. We are Newfoundlanders, and most of us got 
     <lb/>
     raised on salt cod but I do realise, especially 
     <lb/>
     after hearing Mr. Vincent' remarks yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the northeast coast at this 
     <lb/>
     particular time are going through a good bit of 
     <lb/>
     hardship, a strenuous time — not because they 
     <lb/>
     could not catch the fish. If they had gotten it they 
     <lb/>
     would have got good money. The fish did not 
     <lb/>
     come in. If there is no fish there, or it does not 
     <lb/>
     come in, and there is no ore there, and no 
     <lb/>
     newsprint there we will have to leave the 
     <lb/>
     country.<ref target="#fn_05">**</ref>

            </p>
            <p>Now how any man can get to his feet and try to 
     <lb/>prove to you that the economy upon which the 
     <lb/>Finance Committee based their report is a war<lb break="no"/>time boom, I fail to see how he arrived at that 
     <lb/>conclusion. These are facts, and I want to draw 
     <lb/>them to the attention of this House. I am not 
     <lb/>talking to the people outside. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, these facts that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett has stated are indeed facts. The ex<lb break="no"/>planation of them is the war — that and nothing 
     <lb/>
     else. The position is this: base metals, all primary 
     <lb/>
     products, including wheat and all cereals, fish 
     <lb/>
     and all materials entering into industry, and par<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
          
ticularly into building and construction, have 
     <lb/>
     shot Skyward in price and in demand. During the 
     <lb/>
     war no constmction went on - all construction 
     <lb/>
     stopped, I mean all dwelling houses and commer<lb break="no"/>cial structures stopped. In Britain and Europe it 
     <lb/>
     was true indeed very spectacularly... In addition 
     <lb/>
     to that price ceilings kept all prices down 
     <lb/>
     throughout North America — except New<lb break="no"/>foundland, here we are the suckers, and prices 
     <lb/>
     mount sky high here As Mr. Keough said, the 
     <lb/>
     cost of living enquiry was $30 million and two 
     <lb/>
     years too late. But on the North American con<lb break="no"/>tinent they put ceilings on, in addition to which 
     <lb/>
     there were tremendous shortages of everything, 
     <lb/>
     and all their activity went into war production. 
     <lb/>
     The result was that millions of people saved up 
     <lb/>
     money out of their wages that they could not 
     <lb/>
     spend — nothing to spend it on, shortages of 
     <lb/>
     everything. Even here in Newfoundland we felt 
     <lb/>
     something of the shortages, but nothing like on 
     <lb/>
     the continent. The result was that many billions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars were accumulated in the pockets of the 
     <lb/>
     people. And now there is a great backlog of 
     <lb/>
     purchasing power, and as fast as industry can turn 
     <lb/>
     out washing machines, vacuum cleaners, motor 
     <lb/>
     cars, trucks, locomotives, steamships — every<lb break="no"/>thing that is based on steam, which is based on 
     <lb/>
     iron ore — it is bought. They can't turn it out fast 
     <lb/>
     enough. Why? Because this great backlog of 
     <lb/>
     earning created by the war is now being spent. So 
     <lb/>
     therefore we sell our iron ore, and we sell our

     newsprint. There is a world shortage of newsprint 
     <lb/>
     that is going to last two or three years. Beyond 
     <lb/>
     that no one can prophesy. There is a shortage of 
     <lb/>
     everything, and a tremendous demand for it, and 
     <lb/>
     the price has gone up, all due to the war, not due 
     <lb/>
     to the normal growth of our industries. Let's face 
     <lb/>
     the truth for once. This boom, which is still on in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, begins to have some holes ap<lb break="no"/>pearing in it just now, but it is still on... It will 
     <lb/>
     last another two or three years. No one knows. 
     <lb/>
     This boom is directly and entirely and exclusive<lb break="no"/>ly the result of the war, and who is foolish enough 
     <lb/>
     not to believe it? Of course Bell Island is as 
     <lb/>
     prosperous as she is today because of the war. 
     <lb/>
     Our fisheries are commanding the price they do 
     <lb/>
     because of the war.... Our paper is commanding 
     <lb/>
     the price it does because of the war. Are we blind, 
     <lb/>
     or are we trying to kid ourselves? Any fisherman 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, in Bonavista Bay knows it. 
     <lb/>
     Any common, ordinary man in the island knows 
     <lb/>
     it is all because of the war. The same thing applies 
     <lb/>
     to the United States and to Canada. Europe can't 
     <lb/>
     buy because she has not the money to buy. 
     <lb/>
     Canada is paying it into Europe, and USA is 
     <lb/>
     paying it into Europe, and Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     paying it into Europe (or would be if they had the 
     <lb/>
     dollars to pay for it). Europe has been levelled off 
     <lb/>
     by the bombs, and the demand is there and is 
     <lb/>
     insatiable, and will continue for the next two or 
     <lb/>
     three years. That's why, and who is going to tell 
     <lb/>
     me that is not the result of the war? What kind of 
     <lb/>
     trash and nonsense is that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I wonder if Mr. Smallwood will 
     <lb/>
     agree that the present high revenue of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will continue then for at least three 
     <lb/>
     more years? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> My answer to that is that it may 
     <lb/>
     continue for six years, it may continue for one 
     <lb/>
     year. Mr. Higgins did not know, Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     does not know, I don't know, when all the 
     <lb/>
     economists of the world are wondering just this. 
     <lb/>
     Let me tell you something. During the war install<lb break="no"/>ment buying came practically to an end... Why? 
     <lb/>
     So much cash. Already in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     already in Canada installment buying is back 
     <lb/>
     again... What does that mean? It means that great 
     <lb/>
     backlog of money saved up during the war is 
     <lb/>
     beginning to peter out, and what the economists 
     <lb/>
     are wondering is, are we due for another 1929 in 
     <lb/>
     the States? Every statesman in Great Britain is 
     <lb/>
     worried about it. Prices are gone mad in the 
  

            <cb/>
          

     States. All controls are off, no more ceilings on 
     <lb/>
     prices. They are soaring to new heights every 
     <lb/>
     day. How long can it last before the bottom drops 
     <lb/>
     out of it? My answer to Mr. Higgins is: how can 
     <lb/>
     we expect to make these swollen wartime 
     <lb/>
     revenues, which are very high, give the govern<lb break="no"/>ment nearly $40 million? We are wondering if we 
     <lb/>
     are awake or asleep. $40 million! I remember 
     <lb/>
     when the whole revenue of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was only $7 million for the whole 
     <lb/>
     year, and $5 million of that was to pay the interest 
     <lb/>
     of the debt. That left $2 million for everything. 
     <lb/>
     How long ago was that? 1932. So this year it is 
     <lb/>
     $40 million, and maybe next year it will be $100 
     <lb/>
     million. Some miracle may happen. But on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand next year it may be only $30 million, 
     <lb/>
     and the next year $20 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Eight years ago Labrador fish was only worth 
     <lb/>
     $3 a quintal. I don't say it will come down to $3 
     <lb/>
     again — it is $10 or $11 now, but it may be 
     <lb/>
     anywhere between $3 and $11. If that happens 
     <lb/>
     where will you get your $8 or $9 million from the 
     <lb/>
     Assessor's Depanment?.... Where will you get 
     <lb/>
     your $30 million then?.... In reply to Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     however we may differ in what we think and the 
     <lb/>
     forms of government we desire, let us not, in this 
     <lb/>
     hard-headed practical matter, fool ourselves into 
     <lb/>
     trying to blink it out of sight that these revenues 
     <lb/>
     we have today are not caused by the war boom. 
     <lb/>
     Trash and nonsense.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Trash and nonsense. Does the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Bonavista Centre think that he is giving

     <lb/>
     thunder and roar for 15 or 20 minutes to answer 
     <lb/>
     a simple little question. I am not so stupid that I 
     <lb/>
     don't want all that, you know, and I am sure the 
     <lb/>
     people of this Convention are not so stupid that

     they don't want all this bawling and roaring, 
     <lb/>
     causing them a lot more pain and misery than the 
     <lb/>
     honourable member from Bonavista Centre. I 
     <lb/>
     hope that when he gets up again to answer a 
     <lb/>
     simple question he will not think that we are all 
     <lb/>
     fools, and that everything else except that which 
     <lb/>
     the member from Bonavista says is all tommyrot. 
     <lb/>
     I know all about the war; I was in one, and sent 
     <lb/>
     1,000 men to this one. A lot of them did not come 
     <lb/>
     back to this country which they loved. And they, 
     <lb/>
     and those that came back, what would they say to 
     <lb/>
     me if I got up here every five or ten minutes of 
     <lb/>
     the day and damned this country which gave 
     <lb/>
     them birth, for which they fought and for which 
     <lb/>
     they died, and in which today their mothers and 
     <lb/>
     fathers are weeping? What would they say if I got 
     <lb/>
     up there today and damned their native land 
     <lb/>
     simply to answer a question? Thank you, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have no desire in the 
     <lb/>
     world to play on words in an honest effort to find 
     <lb/>
     out the truth of Newfoundland's position. One or 
     <lb/>
     two things did arise out of the last speech but one, 
     <lb/>
     to which I would like to refer. I entirely agree 
     <lb/>
     with what the member from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     said if he is basing everything on a monied 
     <lb/>
     economy. There is, however, another side to the 
     <lb/>
     picture; that we ought to look for real wealth in 
     <lb/>
     the community as distinguished from mere 
     <lb/>
     money wealth. We know that because of the war 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of the real wealth of the neighbouring 
     <lb/>
     continent has been torn up and destroyed, thereby 
     <lb/>
     creating in other parts of the world real wealth 
     <lb/>
     which was not real wealth until it was begun to 
     <lb/>
     be exploited and used. For example the Labrador 
     <lb/>
     iron. Just because the world has used its resources 
     <lb/>
     in certain parts of the world, its iron ore, the value 
     <lb/>
     of the Labrador increases because it represents 
     <lb/>
     real wealth. Money is only a measure of real 
     <lb/>
     wealth, and I have no doubt that after we get over 
     <lb/>
     this crazy spending brought about by the backing 
     <lb/>
     up of surpluses in private hands and government 
     <lb/>
     hands, or whoever it may be, that we will come 
     <lb/>
     back to a more normal position, but just because 
     <lb/>
     America and Canada and other parts of the world 
     <lb/>
     have turned up some of their real wealth in the 
     <lb/>
     form of their natural resources, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has become that much richer if we exploit it. For 
     <lb/>
     example, iron ore. Everything has been brought 
     <lb/>
     out here to show that the United States' position 
     <lb/>
     is entirely different from what it was some years 
     <lb/>
     ago, and that makes the Labrador position and our 
  

            <cb/>
          

     wealth in the future that much better. The same 
     <lb/>
     is true in our timber resources. The same may or 
     <lb/>
     may not be true in the distant future in our fish 
     <lb/>
     resources, and of course, as far as agriculture is 
     <lb/>
     concerned that depends entirely upon how we use 
     <lb/>
     the land which God has given us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to interject just one other word. When 
     <lb/>
     we were discussing this war economy and our 
     <lb/>
     peacetime industries we ought to draw a distinc<lb break="no"/>tion which is drawn by every economist. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever causes this prosperity, and I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt and I agree entirely with Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     that it was caused by the war, that it was due to 
     <lb/>
     the war, and after the war is over there is set up a 
     <lb/>
     peace economy, and that peace economy depends 
     <lb/>
     to a large extent upon what has happened because 
     <lb/>
     of the war. Nevertheless, it is and cannot be 
     <lb/>
     anything else but a peace economy. Now I have 
     <lb/>
     no desire to bring other countries into this picture, 
     <lb/>
     but I think that the Canadian industrial position 
     <lb/>
     after the last war, because of the last war, got a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous boom. Part of that industrial boom is 
     <lb/>
     carried on to peacetime. That is the position I 
     <lb/>
     think that Newfoundland is in at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     So therefore there is not much point in seeing 
     <lb/>
     what actually happened, whether we are now in 
     <lb/>
     a wartime economy or not. The point is that 
     <lb/>
     arising out of the war we have a much better 
     <lb/>
     peacetime economy than we have ever had in the 
     <lb/>
     past.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would prefer it if you would

     divide your motion into two parts, one that the

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I second that motion.

     but that is not actually the motion we have. We 
     <lb/>
     have a complete motion. If Mr. Bradley wants to 
     <lb/>
     change it now he should do it by giving notice of

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In fairness to the House and to 
     <lb/>Mr. Bradley, my interpretation of this motion 
     <lb/>when my attention was first drawn to it, rightly 
     <lb/>or wrongly, was that the motion was of a double- 
     <lb break="yes"/>barrelled nature. That is to say that the House 
     <lb/>would be asked to receive the report this after<lb break="no"/>noon, and then on the following session, whether 
     <lb/>it is tomorrow or on any subsequent day, that the 
     <lb/>motion to resolve the House into a committee of 
     <lb/>the whole would be made. What I understood, the 
     <lb/>inference I drew, was that there would be two

     motions, and that the second motion would be 
     <lb/>
     subsequent in point of time to the motion that the 
     <lb/>
     report be received, and it was upon that under<lb break="no"/>standing, or misunderstanding as the case may 
     <lb/>
     be, that I was induced to give the opinions I did 
     <lb/>
     earlier in the afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Well, Mr. Chairman, any proce<lb break="no"/>dure that you choose to select will be satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to me. My motion as it stands is in the nature of 
     <lb/>
     a double motion. If it is adopted as it stands then 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow afternoon my motion will be to defer 
     <lb/>
     the other, because I don't propose to introduce 
     <lb/>
     the question of that communication from Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     until the Economic Report has been dealt with. I 
     <lb/>
     don' t know why there should be so much difficul<lb break="no"/>ty in getting this thing straightened out. Is there 
     <lb/>
     any object, any adequate object, in dealing with 
     <lb/>
     tiny meticulous technicalities on a question of 
     <lb/>
     this kind? I can't see it. One would think we were 
     <lb/>
     discussing an intricate point of law upon which 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars depended. All we want is to 
     <lb/>
     get this matter before the Convention at the 
     <lb/>
     proper time. Definitely we ought to receive it at 
     <lb/>
     the earliest possible moment, and if the two mo<lb break="no"/>tions are taken together, as the order stands, it 
     <lb/>
     simply means that tomorrow afternoon, when the 
     <lb/>
     order is read, I shall move that it be deferred, and 
     <lb/>
     the same thing on the next day, if the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report has not been finalised, and on the next 
     <lb/>
     day, and until we have finished the Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report. It does not make any difference as far as 
     <lb/>
     I can see — any method of doing it so long as we 
     <lb/>
     get there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are definitely going to do 
     <lb/>
     that, so that I won't misunderstand you. The 
     <lb/>
     motion in its present form is calculated merely to 
     <lb/>
     have the report received at this time? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Yes, and it will be received and 
     <lb/>
     will be on the order paper tomorrow. When it is 
     <lb/>
     read tomorrow, instead of moving the House into 
     <lb/>
     a committee of the whole I will move that the 
     <lb/>
     order be deferred. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You undertake to do that?

     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Yes, of course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I still must object, and contend that 
     <lb/>
     it has got to be two separate motions as far as I 
     <lb/>
     am concerned. It has to be a motion to receive, 
     <lb/>
     and a separate motion to resolve into a committee 
     <lb/>
     of the whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would Mr. Higgins state his 
     <lb/>
     reasons for doing that?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> My reasons are my own business. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I don't want to be meticulous over 
     <lb/>this matter at all, but there seems to be a dif<lb break="no"/>ference of opinion about it. With Mr. Bradley's 
     <lb/>consent, he could delete all words after 
     <lb/>"received" in this motion, and if Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>would consent, then tomorrow he would bring in 
     <lb/>notice of motion covering the second part of that, 
     <lb/>because undoubtedly the Economic Report will 
     <lb/>not be finished tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> No sir, I will not, and my reason is 
     <lb/>
     this, that it is apparent that there is room for 
     <lb/>
     suspicion. There is an effort being made to 
     <lb/>
     deprive that motion of priority, and I don't 
     <lb/>
     propose to allow that to happen.

     that. I am not trying to oppose the motion from

     the report. I did not say that notice of motion to 
     <lb/>
     resolve the House into a committee of the whole 
     <lb/>
     would not arrive at the order paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I think, to avoid all difficulty, if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley would make two separate motions, there 
     <lb/>
     would be no objections to that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> In view of what has happened I 
     <lb/>
     will not. I will let the motion stand as it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, we might have an amend<lb break="no"/>ment in that case, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> You can do as you please. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I can assure you that nothing was 
     <lb/>
     ever further from my mind tha anything as sug<lb break="no"/>gested by Mr. Higgins — to have any ulterior 
     <lb/>
     motive whatsoever. I take it this way, that certain<lb break="no"/>ly, out of courtesy to His Excellency the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor, and out of courtesy to the Prime Minister of 
     <lb/>
     a neighbouring country, the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, we ought to pass this afternoon a motion 
     <lb/>
     to receive this document; but when it comes to 
 

            <pb n="688"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-07_Page_0688.jpg"/>

     the other part, of putting it on the order paper, the 
     <lb/>
     point that I had in mind was that there may be 
     <lb/>
     some little discussion as to what particular time 
     <lb/>
     it should come before the House. I am not speak<lb break="no"/>ing for myself. This matter, which is a very 
     <lb/>
     important one.... but in my mind there is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether or not the discussion on that 
     <lb/>
     document should come immediately after the 
     <lb/>
     discussion on the Economic Report, or whether 
     <lb/>
     it should come up when we go into the matter of 
     <lb/>
     forms of government. Now that's the only 
     <lb/>
     thought that I had in mind. There is absolutely no 
     <lb/>
     question whatever of any ulterior motive what<lb break="no"/>soever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Thank you very much, but what 
     <lb/>
     the House does on any of these motions is some<lb break="no"/>thing, of course, I have yet to ascertain; but in 
     <lb/>
     fairness to Mr. Bradley I have to point out that if 
     <lb/>
     the suggestion made by Mr. Higgins were taken 
     <lb/>
     it obviously follows that his motion loses the 
     <lb/>
     priority it now has. It was designed by him to 
     <lb/>
     follow on the conclusion and termination of the 
     <lb/>
     debate on the Economic Report. Now what you 
     <lb/>
     do about it of course when it comes before you is 
     <lb/>
     something I make no comment on. I am in the 
     <lb/>
     position now where I cannot, at this time, permit 
     <lb/>
     the motion which is presently on the order paper 
     <lb/>
     to be side-tracked by some other business which 
     <lb/>
     is not yet before the House. It is open to the 
     <lb/>
     interpretation, Mr. Higgins, although I am quite 
     <lb/>
     sure that that's the last thing you had in mind. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I can give you my assurance that I 
     <lb/>will not insist on precedence over Mr. Bradley's 
     <lb/>motion. He definitely can have precedence as far 
     <lb/>as I am concerned in debating the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Can't you have the thing set<lb break="yes"/>tled? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> No, sir. I will move an amendment 
     <lb/>
     in that case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Very well, we will have a show<lb break="no"/>down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would like to move that the mo<lb break="no"/>tion be amended. I would like to move that all 
     <lb/>
     words following "be received" in the second line 
     <lb/>
     be deleted, and the amendment is then that we 
     <lb/>
     move that the communication from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada be received. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I will second that amendment. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Mr. Chairman, we will see just 
     <lb/>where we are on this matter now. I have made a 
     <lb/>motion which is double-barrelled in its nature. It 
  

            <cb/>
          

     is a motion to receive this communication, and to 
     <lb/>
     make provision for its discussion. The motion is 
     <lb/>
     obviously one that is clearly in order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The motion is clearly in order. 
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I don't know whether there is a 
     <lb/>suspicion in the minds of any of those gentlemen 
     <lb/>who object to it in its present form that it is my 
     <lb/>intention to attempt to slide the discussion of this 
     <lb/>communication from the Canadian government 
     <lb/>in the middle, as it were, of the discussion upon 
     <lb/>the Economic Report. I have been accused of 
     <lb/>dishonesty in this House before, and I am 
     <lb/>prepared to contemplate the possibility of a 
     <lb/>similar charge again. I gave a distinct under<lb break="no"/>standing this afternoon that I had no intention 
     <lb/>whatever of trying to supersede the discussion fo 
     <lb/>the Economic Report. My resolution was to 
     <lb/>receive this communication and to move the 
     <lb/>House into a committee of the whole on tomor<lb break="no"/>row. If that motion had carried, and maybe it will, 
     <lb/>I don't know, the position would be that we 
     <lb/>would have received the communication, and 
     <lb/>there would appear on tomorrow's order paper an 
     <lb/>order to the effect that I would move the House 
     <lb/>into a committee of the whole.... If that motion is 
     <lb/>not carried in its present form, then I have to give 
     <lb/>notice of another motion, which clearly will bring 
     <lb/>my motion behind the motion of Mr. Higgins in 
     <lb/>point of time. He immediately acquires 
     <lb/>precedence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, that's clear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I said I would give it precedence. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> These are the rules of the House, 
     <lb/>and I cannot see any reason in the world why you 
     <lb/>should take that position unless you have some 
     <lb/>ulterior motive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I rise to a point of order. I have no 
     <lb/>
     ulterior motive.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I don't know whether you have or 
     <lb/>
     not.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Any suggestion made by you is 
     <lb/>
     entirely out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I have not made any suggestion at 
     <lb/>
     all. I said I can see no reason. Maybe I am too 
     <lb/>
     thick-headed to see it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We should at least confine oursel<lb break="no"/>ves to this motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, no. The amendment is 
     <lb/>
     proposed by you, and it is Mr. Bradley's right to 
     <lb/>
     speak to the amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> There has been no explanation

     given this House, no adequate reason, why my 
     <lb/>
     motion should be split in two and part of it 
     <lb/>
     deducted. There is every reason why it should 
     <lb/>
     stand as it is. In the ordinary course of events it 
     <lb/>
     is now suggested that it should be split. For what 
     <lb/>
     purpose? What valuable object can be obtained 
     <lb/>
     by splitting it? If I can be shown that I will agree, 
     <lb/>
     but not if there has been no effort to show that 
     <lb/>
     there is adequate reason for it, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to allow it to be pushed aside in that 
     <lb/>
     manner. If that sort of thing is going to be done, 
     <lb/>
     and in view of happenings in this House and out 
     <lb/>
     of it, and around it, during the past few days, we 
     <lb/>
     are justified in suspecting pretty near anything. If 
     <lb/>
     there is going to be anything of that sort done here 
     <lb/>
     the cards are coming out on the table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I rise to a point of order. If my 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. Bradley is making any happenings in 
     <lb/>
     this House or out of it in the past few days into 
     <lb/>
     the form of a motion he has put up, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know about it. I think it is entirely out of order. 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> I am not making any personal 
     <lb/>reflections upon you or upon anyone else, but I 
     <lb/>am saying there is no reason in the world why this 
     <lb/>motion cannot come before this House, or why 
     <lb/>that motion should be split. None. And yet we are 
     <lb/>asked to split it. What for? Incidentally there is 
     <lb/>another motion coming in here which, if it is split, 
     <lb/>would give precedence over a portion of my 
     <lb/>motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Except that in fairness to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins he has undertaken to give your notice 
     <lb/>
     precedence. I would take and give your notice of 
     <lb/>
     motion priority to his. He has definitely stated 


            <cb/>
          

     that he would not want to go ahead of you in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Mr. Chairman, a majority of this 
     <lb/>
     House can supersede this House or the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee, and I don't know what a majority of 
     <lb/>
     this House is going to do, but I am going to find 
     <lb/>
     out now. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Hear, hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The original motion is: "To 
     <lb/>
     move that the communication from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment be received, and that the Convention 
     <lb/>
     resolve itself into a committee of the whole on 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow to consider the said communication." 
     <lb/>
     To this an amendment has been moved and 
     <lb/>
     seconded, that all the words following the word 
     <lb/>
     "received" should be deleted. 50 that the amend<lb break="no"/>ment means to move that the communication 
     <lb/>
     from the Government of Canada be received. Are 
     <lb/>
     you ready for the amendment?.... Will all the 
     <lb/>
     members in favour of the amendment please rise 
     <lb/>
     — 21. Will all those against the amendment 
     <lb/>
     please rise — 15. The amendment is carried on a 
     <lb/>
     vote of 21 — 15.... Now I have to put the motion 
     <lb/>
     in its amended form, so that if there is any other 
     <lb/>
     member who desires to address himself on it he 
     <lb/>
     can do it. The motion in its amended from now 
     <lb/>
     is: "To move that the communication from the 
     <lb/>
     Government be received." That is the motion as 
     <lb/>
     amended. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
     <lb/>
     the motion as amended? Are you ready for the 
     <lb/>
     question? Carried.
