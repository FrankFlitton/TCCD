<!-- GL, 2017-06-13, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
 <!--<p>
     the minds and policies of the people looking after 
     <lb/>
     the agricultural industry in so far as the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is concerned. Where you find quotation 
     <lb/>
     marks in the report, they are nearly always from 
     <lb/>
     that memorandum. Before we start to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     report, I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Gillis for 
     <lb/>
     I know he wished, at times, that the Dickens had 
     <lb/>
     us. Having examined this document we 
     <lb/>
     proceeded to get certain facts about imports and 
     <lb/>
     local production. We then got government ex<lb break="no"/>penditure figures, and when we thought we had 
     <lb/>
     a rough picture of agriculture in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     we then got from government officials and out<lb break="no"/>side sources, evidence; and this evidence we used 
     <lb/>
     for checking and cross-checking our own 
     <lb/>
     opinion. The result you will find in the report 
     <lb/>
     before you. The Committee was careful not to 
     <lb/>
     make the value of agriculture either too much or 
     <lb/>
     too little. It would be fair to say we viewed the 
     <lb/>
     prospects in agriculture in the future with much 
     <lb/>
     greater enthusiasm than would appear from the 
     <lb/>
     report itself. There is one section on the 
     <lb/>
     demonstration farm which may suggest that the 
     <lb/>
     Committee did not put much value on the farm. 
     <lb/>
     That would be incorrect. All we wished to convey 
     <lb/>
     was the fact that for one reason or another, the 
     <lb/>
     farm did not appear to us to be used as much as 
     <lb/>
     it should, in the interests of agriculture as a 
     <lb/>
     whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is all I have to say. except that the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee will answer all the questions we possibly 
     <lb/>
     can; we will be happy to go back and find out 
     <lb/>
     anything that will help the members make up 
     <lb/>
     their minds as to whether Newfoundland is self<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>supporting.

     <lb/>
     then rose and reported progress]

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I beg to give 
     <lb/>
     notice that I will on tomorrow move the follow<lb break="no"/>ing resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolved that the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     desires to send a delegation consisting of the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman and six other of its members to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa to ascertain from the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada what fair and equitable basis may 
     <lb/>
     exist for federal union of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canada; and 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolved that the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     requests His Excellency the Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Commission to ascertain whether the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada will receive such a 
     <lb/>
     delegation for the purpose stated; and 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolved that should the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada be willing to receive such a delega<lb break="no"/>tion, then the said delegation shall be elected 
     <lb/>
     forthwith by secret ballot, and shall proceed 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa as soon as possible after the Con<lb break="no"/>vention shall have received from His 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     but not before.

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Mr. Chairman, I skipped one small 
     <lb/>
     detail yesterday. We have the recapitulation of 
     <lb/>
     imports in detail, so if anyone wants any par<lb break="no"/>ticular item you can have it. Further, you will find 
     <lb/>
     on your desks a memo on the feed pool situation. 
     <lb/>
     We did not look upon this as part of our report, 
     <lb/>
     because it was more or less an emergency 
     <lb/>
     measure about the distribution of feeds. I 
    

            <cb/>
           

     apologise because we only got it on February 25, 
     <lb/>
     and I barely read it myself, and some of you have 
     <lb/>
     not even seen it.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if Mr. Crosbie would 
     <lb/>
     tell us, how serious is it to take 5,000 sacks of fish 
     <lb/>
     meal and export it? Does it leave enough to meet 
     <lb/>
     local needs? There is a shortage of high protein

     fish meals. Have our local dairy and pig men

     enough protein concentrates to bring up the 
     <lb/>
     protein content of their other feeds? Does this 
     <lb/>
     mean that our local demand will be curtailed? 
     <lb/>
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> No, the government has kept 
     <lb/>enough in the country for our own use with the 
     <lb/>other feeds that come in. We were not allowed to 
     <lb/>export that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is there a shortage? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> No, there is not now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think there is, but it is only 
     <lb/>
     now beginning to show; we are in the dead of 
     <lb/>
     winter and it is now that they need it. That 5,000 
     <lb/>
     sacks, is that a big proportion of last year's 
     <lb/>
     production? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Only about one-tenth of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well the rest of it, what hap<lb break="no"/>pened to that, apart from what was held here? 
     <lb/>
      </p>
            
<p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> As far as I know the government 
     <lb/>purchased the 5,000 sacks for Canada because 
     <lb/>the Canadian price is much higher than ours. To 
     <lb/>get the fish meal they had to give us a certain 
     <lb/>amount of other feed and our government ab<lb break="no"/>sorbed the extra loss. We are only allowed to 
     <lb/>export sufficient fish meal so that there would be 
     <lb/>enough left for the country. As far as the shortage 
     <lb/>now is concerned, I don't think it can be serious 
     <lb/>because there is a firm in Burin (the Monroe 
     <lb/>plant) making a lot every day 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is rather serious. I was on a 
     <lb/>
     farm Sunday night where they have 50 head of 
     <lb/>
     cattle and they are definitely short of protein. If 
     <lb/>
     it's being made daily now in Burin, could not the 
     <lb/>
     feed pool or the government bring it into town 
     <lb/>
     where it is so badly needed? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> You may find isolated cases, but I 
     <lb/>
     don't think it is serious. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I may be wrong, but I understand 
     <lb/>
     that if they had not exported those 5,000 bags of 
     <lb/>
     meal we would not have been able to obtain our 
     <lb/>
     allocation from the Canadian Feed Control. 
     <lb/>
     There is a lot of meal in Halifax, about 80,000 
     <lb/>
     sacks but the transportation is at fault.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> There was one time when the

     decided upon. I do not know of any specific

     <lb/>
     the Committee endeavour to find out to what

     extent these families are actually rehabilitated? 
     <lb/>
     How many families in the nine settlements are

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What are the actual bona fide results 
     <lb/>
     accrued to the country by reason of these nine 
     <lb/>
     settlements? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> There are 251 people with homes. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> How many are there now? Have not

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> They do leave and come back. I under<lb break="no"/>stand that practically all those 251 would be in 
     <lb/>
     the various settlements now 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Has their condition been improved 
     <lb/>
     by reason of that expenditure? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Definitely, yes, in many, many instan<lb break="no"/>ces. The original settlers were people who found 
     <lb/>
     it difficult, if not impossible, to make a living in 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances in which they lived at the time. 
     <lb/>
     As to whether the government was justified in 
     <lb/>
     spending the amount of money to give them the 
     <lb/>
     standard of living they now have — in many 
     <lb/>
     instances, yes, their condition has been im<lb break="no"/>proved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> I refer to the question asked by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Northcott regarding payments having been 
     <lb/>
     made. I understand that when the grants were 
     <lb/>
     issued to these people, they would pay about $50 
     <lb/>
     for them; that would include holdings of land, 
     <lb/>
     buildings and barns — just a nominal charge. 
     <lb/>
     These grants are all made out now for members 
     <lb/>
     of the settlements; there are some negotiations 
     <lb/>
     going on as far as land is concerned with 
     <lb/>
     Bowaters and some other company. The number 
     <lb/>
     of acres, 1,534, that has been cleared by 251 
     <lb/>
     families, this has been increased — I know it has 
     <lb/>
     been doubled in some settlements at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
          


<cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Since the 1,500 were cleared, 
     <lb/>
     there might be more now? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You said something about the 
     <lb/>
     upper Humber, settling 300 ex-servicemen at a 
     <lb/>
     cost of $6,000 each.To what extent is that $6,000 
     <lb/>
     made possible by the experience gained in open<lb break="no"/>ing up the other land settlements? I have been 
     <lb/>
     through Sandringham — it was quite a job to 
     <lb/>
     clear that place, build homes and get the men 
     <lb/>
     settled — that gave them a certain amount of 
     <lb/>
     experience that now I suppose is useful to them 
     <lb/>
     in opening up the settlements in the Humber 
     <lb/>
     Valley for the ex-servicemen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I would say yes. In the first place the 
     <lb/>
     Director of Rural Development is a man who 
     <lb/>
     went from Markland to Midland. His deputy is 
     <lb/>
     also a man who went through Markland. He 
     <lb/>
     afterwards graduated from an agricultural col<lb break="no"/>lege. There are a number of people like that. The 
     <lb/>
     experience gained by these people makes a lot of 
     <lb/>
     difference in other settlements. They are new 
     <lb/>
     building schools out of land settlement funds; 
     <lb/>
     they have a better method of getting original land 
     <lb/>
     cleared. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I would like to refer to the point 
     <lb/>
     made by someone who was wondering about the 
     <lb/>
     returns we got by settling people on the land. The 
     <lb/>
     convenor made a classical understatement when 
     <lb/>
     he said the situation of some of those people was

     such that they found it difficult to earn a living. I 
     <lb/>
     happened to be on the south coast, where some 
     <lb/>
     of those people came from in 1938 — you 
     <lb/>
     remember the tidal wave of 1929 destroyed the 
     <lb/>
     fishing grounds there — and the average catch of 
     <lb/>
     fish had been estimated by the government to be 
     <lb/>
     ten quintals per man. I went around with one of 
     <lb/>
     the clergymen who was trying to do something 
     <lb/>
     about the economic condition of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     I can assure you that Mr. Butt's statement is very 
     <lb/>
     much an understatement. I would not wish to 
     <lb/>
     interfere with the digestion of your dinner this 
     <lb/>
     evening by giving a description of the graphic 
     <lb/>
     details of the conditions of those people who had 
     <lb/>
     been taken off the barren rocks; had not even soil 
     <lb/>
     in which to grow vegetables; and I wish to go on 
     <lb/>
     record that every $5,000 spent on these people 
     <lb/>
     out of any fund, they are welcome to it. I would

     like to make one query. I note two settlements 
     <lb/>
     were started in 1934, Markland and Lourdes; 
     <lb/>
     Markland had 73 holdings at a cost of $644,000 
     <lb/>
     which was $8,000 plus; and Lourdes had 27 
     <lb/>
     holdings at a cost of $86,000 which was $3,000 
     <lb/>
     plus. Since both started in the same year, I was 
     <lb/>
     wondering if the Committee had anything to say 
     <lb/>
     on that point? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> I might be able to clear that up. 
     <lb/>
     In the $644,000 spent in Markland we included 
     <lb/>
     equipment which was afterwards transferred to 
     <lb/>
     other land settlements. When Lourdes started 
     <lb/>
     there was no equipment except two old horses. 
     <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> As Mr. McCarthy has said, they 
     <lb/>had considerable equipment at Markland, 
     <lb/>whereas at Lourdes the stumps were pushed out 
     <lb/>with cattle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Your figures, even with all the 
     <lb/>
     experience of these land settlements, come to 
     <lb/>
     $5,400 per family; and this new settlement is 
     <lb/>
     going to cost $6,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That is at today's prices. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> While on the subject of the upper 
     <lb/>
     Humber — possibly Mr. Keough could revert to 
     <lb/>
     this more because it is his district and he is pretty 
     <lb/>
     well aware of the situation. It strikes me that 
     <lb/>
     instead of having the land settlement in the upper 
     <lb/>
     Humber, breaking new ground, bringing new 
     <lb/>
     people together where there are no experienced 
     <lb/>
     farmers located, it would have been infinitely 
     <lb/>
     better to have settled them on the numerous acres 
     <lb/>
     in Codroy Valley not being farmed by anybody. 
     <lb/>
     It is true that these acres, though not used, are 
     <lb/>
     owned usually by the people around there; great 
     <lb/>
     quantities are also owned there by people in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's and it has never been used. You will agree 
     <lb/>
     that some of the best soil is situated in that valley, 
     <lb/>
     Would it not have been better and cheaper to have 
     <lb/>
     that new settlement in the Codroy Valley? Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job and I had a talk with Mr. James Tompkins of 
     <lb/>
     Tompkins; he is a practical farmer and he was 
     <lb/>
     strong on the idea that the settlement would have 
     <lb/>
     been much more profitable to the settlers them<lb break="no"/>selves had the land in the Codroy Valley been 
     <lb/>
     used. He said he and a number of his neighbours 
     <lb/>
     would have been prepared to advise these set<lb break="no"/>tlers, not only with local knowledge, but to give 
     <lb/>
     them if necessary actual help in developing their 
     <lb/>
     holdings. It is right on the railway line and has 
     <lb/>
     everything to make a perfect land settlement. Did 
     <lb/>
     the government make a mistake in that matter? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<cb/>

            <p>
     Would it not have been better to have bought up 
     <lb/>
     private, unoccupied, untilled land in the Codroy 
     <lb/>
     and put those men there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> I am not prepared to say on what 
     <lb/>
     grounds the government decided on the upper 
     <lb/>
     Humber. It is a matter the Committee did not go 
     <lb/>
     into. I imagine they did have some specific 
     <lb/>
     reason for putting them there.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> What is your own personal view? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> That is rather a question!

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Are there actually enough un<lb break="no"/>occupied grounds in the Codroy Valley? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> I am not prepared to say. I doubt if 
     <lb/>
     there is.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I do not doubt it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I walked from Port-aux- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Basques to Corner Brook and counted the num<lb break="no"/>ber of farms vacant. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> When? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> A few years ago. There are a 
     <lb/>
     large number of farms vacant, but they are scat<lb break="no"/>tered here and there. If you have a bunch of 
     <lb/>
     ex-servicemen, it may be easier if you settle them 
     <lb/>
     together. All have certain adventures in common; 
     <lb/>
     have roughly the same outlook. If you settle them 
     <lb/>
     as a community so that they can get their clubs, 
     <lb/>
     societies, churches and their schools all there 
     <lb/>
     together, I imagine you would have a better 
     <lb/>
     chance of success than if you merely scattered 
     <lb/>
     them throughout an area of 100 miles. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is not anything like that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would not me Codroy Valley 
     <lb/>
     itself be from Cape Ray to Black Duck and up to 
     <lb/>
     Stephenville? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You could settle them right in the 
     <lb/>
     valley. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Come to think of it, the thing en<lb break="no"/>visages the settling of 300 families on the soil 
     <lb/>
     with a minimum of 50 acres per family; I do not 
     <lb/>
     think there is that much acreage in the Codroy. 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That was where they found the most

     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The point is you have to break the

     years from now. We want to make them indepen<lb break="no"/>dent. A few years ago we had 8,000 on the dole, 
     <lb/>
     today they are not, thank God. The same thing 
     <lb/>
     applies. If these people were given $10,000 to 
     <lb/>
     build a place they should pay something back 
     <lb/>
     when they can, It makes a man independent. You 
     <lb/>
     can go on with this forever.... We have farmers 
     <lb/>
     working all their lives and never got five cents 
     <lb/>
     from anyone. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> This matter of land settlement was 
     <lb/>
     started in the first place as a measure of relief. 
     <lb/>
     People were taken from the seaport towns where 
     <lb/>
     they could not get fish, and if they did they could 
     <lb/>
     not sell it or get any price for it. It was not a case 
     <lb/>
     of putting a man on the land and expecting him 
     <lb/>
     to pay the whole amount back. The real complaint 
     <lb/>
     is that they took the fisherman, who was not a 
     <lb/>
     farmer, and cleared some land and gave him some 
     <lb/>
     seed and he grew some vegetables. Then they 
     <lb/>
     said to him, "Now you are established", and cast 
     <lb/>
     him out on the open market to dispose of his own 
     <lb/>
     produce without any assistance whatever, and 
     <lb/>
     consequently he had no means of improving his 
     <lb/>
     existence. I am inclined to think that this agricul<lb break="no"/>tural business, as far as Newfoundland is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, is as much a local industry as a factory. 
     <lb/>
     To that end I want to quote some figures which 
     <lb/>
     were not included in this report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under the heading of plug tobacco, cut tobac<lb break="no"/>co and cigarettes, we find that the cost of the 
     <lb/>
     material imported to manufacture these articles 
     <lb/>
     last year was $1,109,571. The excise paid by the 
     <lb/>
     people who manufacture this amounted to 
     <lb/>
     $1,057,567. If that manufactured article had paid 
     <lb/>
     the regular rate of duty the government could 
     <lb/>
     have received $1,818,000, whereas they only 
     <lb/>
     received $1,807,000 in excise. You may call that 
     <lb/>
     a loss to the government of $11,000. There were 
     <lb/>
     engaged in the manufacture about 131 people, 
     <lb/>
     and the average wage paid was $2,250.29, which 
     <lb/>
     means of course that that is $533,323.60 gross 
     <lb/>
     coming in to the directors after all wages are paid. 
     <lb/>
     I grant there are other overheads which were not 
     <lb/>
     taken care of, but this means that the industry was 
     <lb/>
     protected to that extent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Come with me to Brown's Arm in l940. I 
     <lb/>
     went through the settlement and talked to the 
     <lb/>
     people, and at least three men had from 100 to 
     <lb/>
     200 barrels of potatoes in the cellar, and I asked 
     <lb/>
     why they were keeping them and what they were 
     

            <cb/>
         
     asking for them. They said if they got $1.50 a 
     <lb/>
     barrel for these potatoes they would be glad to 
     <lb/>
     take it, but they could not get that much. It was 
     <lb/>
     easy for me to understand why some of these 
     <lb/>
     people were in distress, here they were with all 
     <lb/>
     those potatoes in the cellar and they could not sell 
     <lb/>
     them. In the meantime potatoes were coming into 
     <lb/>
     this country and being consumed. Here you have 
     <lb/>
     two local industries, one controlled by a very few 
     <lb/>
     people who employed 131 men and women and 
     <lb/>
     they are able to pay good wages, comparatively 
     <lb/>
     good at least as far as this country is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     and can make $533,000 in profits. Here we have 
     <lb/>
     a settlement Brown's Arm, I don't know how 
     <lb/>
     many are there (yes, 24 men) and the government 
     <lb/>
     had spent $133,000 to put them there. Don't you 
     <lb/>
     think if they are going to talk protective tariffs 
     <lb/>
     that these men, on whom the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country had to spend $1,370,000 to rehabilitate, 
     <lb/>
     don't you think they should be protected to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of making it possible for them to sell their 
     <lb/>
     products at a reasonable rate?.... We protect local 
     <lb/>
     industries which are handled by a very small 
     <lb/>
     number of people and we are sure that their 
     <lb/>
     employees shall be paid reasonable wages, and 
     <lb/>
     apparently we are sure that the shareholders will 
     <lb/>
     make a fair dividend. I have no objection to that 
     <lb/>
     but I do have objection to the government spend<lb break="no"/>ing $1,370,000 to rehabilitate men and then 
     <lb/>
     saying, "Here's your land, and if you can sell your 
     <lb/>
     produce OK, ifnot we can't do anything for you." 
     <lb/>
     They should do something to make it possible for 
     <lb/>
     these people to make a fair living. Of course, as 
     <lb/>
     soon as the war came they went on the bases, and 
     <lb/>
     in some of the land settlements today the men are 
     <lb/>
     no more farmers now than they were when they 
     <lb/>
     fished out of Lamaline or elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIGA1">Mr. Figary</persName> Take the case of Midland<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> where 25 
     <lb/>
     families had been settled and 231 acres cleared at 
     <lb/>
     a cost of $120,735.67, which is approximately 
     <lb/>
     $13,000 less than Brown's Arm where 24 
     <lb/>
     families were settled and only 123 acres cleared 
     <lb/>
     at a cost of $133,090.78. What caused the dif<lb break="no"/>ference of $13,000 there?

     <lb/>
     with the difference in the cost of land clearing. I

     don't know much about Brown's Arm, but it is 
     <lb/>
     easier to clear 20 acres of land in Lourdes than 
     <lb/>
     one acre where I am in Trinity South.

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Going into one settlement you take 20 
     <lb/>
     men, five of whom will break up a field in a short

     time; and in another place you take the same

     number of men and it will take much longer. I 
     <lb/>
     don't know the answer, but there are a lot of 
     <lb/>
     factors to be taken into consideration. This land 
     <lb/>
     settlement scheme originally was started, not by 
     <lb/>
     the government, but by private individuals who 
     <lb/>
     said, "If we would take ten families and you give 
     <lb/>
     us what they would normally receive in relief we

     could they.

     say that the Committee did not feel that the farm 
     <lb/>
     was properly constituted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> "Constituted to attract farmers". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You must have had a reason for 
     <lb/>
     feeling that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Because farmers do not go there as 
     <lb/>
     they should. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You don't necessarily infer 
     <lb/>
     that. In fact the farmers don't visit, therefore you 
     <lb/>
     infer that there must be something wrong with the 
     <lb/>
     farm. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I think if you added something to the 
     <lb/>
     farm, maybe a radio program, or moving pictures 
     <lb/>
     — in other words, something was missing. That' s 
     <lb/>
     all we intended to say, I drew attention to that in 
     <lb/>
     a short note in the introduction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> In connection with these homes and 
     <lb/>
     the land, I was wondering if these people had any 
     <lb/>
     legal claims to their homes. An outport man 
     <lb/>
     especially is very keen on being able to claim 
     <lb/>
     ownership of the property on which he works. A 
     <lb/>
     few years ago the settlers at Midland were not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied because they had no guarantee that they 
     <lb/>
     had any legal right to their homes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I think that question was answered by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. McCarthy. He says the papers are going out 
  

            <cb/>
         

     now. Up to this year they did not give them. 
     <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> With regard to the lack of success of 
     <lb/>some of these land settlement schemes, might it 
     <lb/>not be that most of these men were chiefly fisher<lb break="no"/>men, and fishermen do not take very kindly to 
     <lb/>farming? Sometimes they leave these settlements 
     <lb/>when other work offers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Mr. Smallwood asked a ques<lb break="no"/>tion regarding the farm being properly con<lb break="no"/>stituted. If he reads down a little further the 
     <lb/>
     reason was given by the Committee. it says: "To 
     <lb/>
     have it so constituted would undoubtedly call for 
     <lb/>
     more expenditure than is apparently being 
     <lb/>
     made." That is the reason, but may I ask, expen<lb break="no"/>diture on what? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> We intended to convey that there was 
     <lb/>
     something wrong in the whole farm set-up, in that 
     <lb/>
     it did not attract the farmers as it should. There 
     <lb/>
     may be certain expenditures necessary to add 
     <lb/>
     something else to it for the special purpose of 
     <lb/>
     attracting farmers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Why do you want to attract them? 
     <lb/>
  
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> People go there to learn new ways of 
     <lb/>doing things, to see the results of some new kind 
     <lb/>of seed, how to use DDT, etc. On the professional 
     <lb/>work we did not comment, as far as we could find 
     <lb/>it was pretty good.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Just one question, it is at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     report: "The gross annual value at present of 
     <lb/>
     agriculture to the country is roughly estimated at 
     <lb/>
     $12 million. It is probable that this value will 
     <lb/>
     relatively increase as people get back to their 
     <lb/>
     normal pursuits. The Committee hesitates to in<lb break="no"/>dicate what the increased revenue may be as any 
     <lb/>
     figure is not likely to be more than mere 
     <lb/>
     guesswork."<ref target="#fn_12">[2]</ref> That $12 million is made up at 
     <lb/>
     today's high figures, and you cannot expect the 
     <lb/>
     future to keep up to that $12 million, let alone 
     <lb/>
     increase. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That's why we put in "relatively". The 
     <lb/>
     actual dollars and cents value, as of today's price, 
     <lb/>
     may go down, I think it was $6 million if I 
     <lb/>
     remember correctly, and it may go back to that. 
     <lb/>
     What we are trying to convey is that people who 
     <lb/>
     were away on bases or overseas, and other people 
     <lb/>
     from outside, are now going back to the land, so 
     <lb/>
     that in the near future it might go up a little

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> ....I would like to refer to a remark made 
     <lb/>
     by my friend from the same district. He was 
     <lb/>
     referring to the settlements on the west coast, 
     <lb/>
     which I know very well, and I have had many 
     <lb/>
     talks with people from there. I am sorry to see that 
     <lb/>
     the Committee had not been able to contact very 
     <lb/>
     closely these west coast farmers. I talked with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Tompkins, who has one of the ideal farms in the 
     <lb/>
     country.... He could do much more if he could get 
     <lb/>
     help. The reason is possibly that there is not 
     <lb/>
     enough attraction to the place itself.... They also 
     <lb/>
     stressed the fact that roads, <hi rendition="simple:italic">roads</hi>, is what they 
     <lb/>
     want to make their farming a success. They have 
     <lb/>
     increased enormously their cleared land in that 
     <lb/>
     vicinity, and they have actual value there, but 
     <lb/>
     they don't get a very big thing out of it from a 
     <lb/>
     living point of view. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was interested in the appendix 
     <lb/>
     that the Committee brought in on the feed pool. 
     <lb/>
     You say the Dairymen's Association pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that the costs of production were high because of 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of importing so much feed, hay, 
     <lb/>
     animals, etc.;<ref target="#fn_13">[1]</ref> as one man put it, what we are 
     <lb/>
     doing now is selling Canadian milk. He meant 
     <lb/>
     they imported the cow, the hay, the feed, etc., put 
     <lb/>
     them all together and got milk, but it all came 
     <lb/>
     from Canada. Iwonder if the Committee has gone 
     <lb/>
     into the question of a feed mill in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     If you look at the figures<ref target="#fn_14">[2]</ref> it is very discouraging 
     <lb/>
     as you look back over the years. Look what you 
     <lb/>
     find. In 1945 we had, according to the census, 
     <lb/>
     14,000 cows. You go back ten years earlier, in 
     <lb/>
     1935, and again it has 14,000 cows. You go back 
     <lb/>
     to 1921 and it is 18,000 cows, and in 1901 we had 
     <lb/>
     14,000. The population has gone up from less 
     <lb/>
     than $250,000 in 1911 to 318,000, and still we 
     <lb/>
     have 14,000 cows. We are going backward very 
     <lb/>
     badly. Now you take pigs. In 1945 we had 11,400 
     <lb/>
     pigs, but in 1921 we had 14,500, and in 1901, 
     <lb/>
     34,000 — 50% more population almost, and only 
     <lb/>
     one third as many pigs. Now it is true that in 
     <lb/>
     poultry there is a big increase.... The number of 
     <lb/>
     sheep has increased also, but it is down as against 
     <lb/>
     1935 and 1945. These are not very romantic, 
     <lb/>
     cows, pigs, hens, sheep, not very romantic at all. 
     <lb/>
     Some people don't like the smell of them, but it 
     <lb/>
     is by these things that we live, and we are going 
  

            <cb/>
           

     backward. We have not got as many pigs, or 
     <lb/>
     cows, or sheep as we used to have compared with 
     <lb/>
     our population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know a lot of the troubles back of it, but one 
     <lb/>
     of them is right here — we have to import our 
     <lb/>
     feeds, we have to import our hay, and the cows 
     <lb/>
     and the sheep and the pigs to begin with and the 
     <lb/>
     equipment used in the farm. They are duty free 
     <lb/>
     and it is a good thing, but are we importing feed 
     <lb/>
     in the most economical way we can?.... Why 
     <lb/>
     cannot we have a feed mill?.... Why cannot we 
     <lb/>
     import the grains separately and mill them here? 
     <lb/>
     We would need only a little hammer mill.... You 
     <lb/>
     could run a schooner to Montreal or Fort William, 
     <lb/>
     load up at the elevators, bring them down here 
     <lb/>
     and mix them here and cut the cost of feed. Why 
     <lb/>
     some businessmen are not doing it, I do not know. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe there are too many firms on Water Street 
     <lb/>
     who are agents for the balanced feed. Why has 
     <lb/>
     not the Committee gone into this question — it is 
     <lb/>
     the crux of the whole business; that, plus the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we did not have any hay in Newfoundland. I 
     <lb/>
     know dairymen in the suburbs who imported 
     <lb/>
     from 60% to 90% of their hay. Just picture that! 
     <lb/>
     And all their feed.... Importing that hay and sell<lb break="no"/>ing it in the form of milk at 80 cents and 90 cents 
     <lb/>
     a gallon. That is not a square deal to the farmer, 
     <lb/>
     nor to the consumer of milk. If we are going to 
     <lb/>
     raise our own milk and livestock, there are two 
     <lb/>
     things we have to do. First, we must grow our 
     <lb/>
     own hay. It is a good climate to grow hay. Look 
     <lb/>
     at the figures,<ref target="#fn_15">[3]</ref> the amount of land cleared, and 
     <lb/>
     then we call ourselves farmers. In 1901 there 
     <lb/>
     were 215,000 acres cleared-roughly speaking an 
     <lb/>
     acre per person. In 1945 you are back to 124,000 
     <lb/>
     acres, with a population of 318,000. You expect 
     <lb/>
     to make a living out of that?.... In the course of 
     <lb/>
     three generations in Newfoundland we managed 
     <lb/>
     to get 15 acres of land cleared and cultivated, 
     <lb/>
     which has to support an entire family. It cannot 
     <lb/>
     be done. It could, if the price we get for the 
     <lb/>
     produce is way up high. Then who pays it? The 
     <lb/>
     consumer. Then up goes the cost of living. Ido 
     <lb/>
     not want to say one word against the farmer. I am 
     <lb/>
     one-eighth farmer myself —- at least, I have had 
     <lb/>
     ten acres under cultivation and worked like a dog 
     <lb/>
     until I knew the movement of every worm and 
     <lb/>
     insect; and I raised pigs and poultry. Clear more

     land.... The second thing is to bring down the cost 
     <lb/>
     of feeds through a feed mill.... You can produce 
     <lb/>
     fertiliser out of fish offal. They do it in the United 
     <lb/>
     States and Canada; we can do it in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> The evidence we got was that you 
     <lb/>
     must import 90% of the ingredients. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I find it hard to believe. You 
     <lb/>
     have the raw material here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> It is more profitable to turn it into 
     <lb/>
     fish meal than fertiliser. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> We have clear evidence from the In<lb break="no"/>dustrial Board, which went into it. They told us 
     <lb/>
     there was a possibility of looking into a fertiliser 
     <lb/>
     plant, but 90% of the ingredients would have to 
     <lb/>
     be imported; it may bring the cost down by $5 a 
     <lb/>
     ton, and in addition Newfoundland would have 
     <lb/>
     the labour. They are looking into the question of 
     <lb/>
     milling feeds here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Talking about fertiliser, I went 
     <lb/>
     into a firm in Toronto to find out about double 
     <lb/>
     super-phosphate. The price was $25 a ton, and 
     <lb/>
     the man said that no double super-phosphate was 
     <lb/>
     manufactured in Canada now. It is manufactured 
     <lb/>
     in the United States.... He gave me the names of 
     <lb/>
     three firms in Philadelphia and I wrote them; 
     <lb/>
     what do you think the price was? $12 a ton. How 
     <lb/>
     much is it on Water Street today? $48 a ton.... 
     <lb/>
     What chance has a farmer got in this country if 
     <lb/>
     the farmer in Canada can buy double super-phos<lb break="no"/>phate for $23 a ton or less? What chance has he 
     <lb/>
     got to grow hay or anything else? And in the 
     <lb/>
     outports, God knows how much it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I support Mr. Northcott. In looking 
     <lb/>
     over the land settlement business, it is a pretty 
     <lb/>
     dark picture. If money had been spent in en<lb break="no"/>couraging local farmers by giving them a good 
     <lb/>
     bonus for clearing land, this country would have 
     <lb/>
     had better results. I refer to page 21:<ref target="#fn_16">[1]</ref> "It en<lb break="no"/>visages the settlement in the Upper Humber area 
     <lb/>
     of 300 full-time holdings by ex-servicemen by 
     <lb/>
     the end of 1948. The total estimated cost is 
     <lb/>
     $1,800,000 or an average cost of $6,000 per 
     <lb/>
     holding." In connection with the Public Health 
     <lb/>
     and Welfare Report, I had occasion to go to the 
     <lb/>
     Civil Re-establishment Committee and they gave 
     <lb/>
     me the figures as being $5,000 per holding. Fur<lb break="no"/>ther down on that page<ref target="#fn_17">[2]</ref> — part-time holdings, 
     <lb/>
     300 ex-servicemen, grants $724, total cost 
    

            <cb/>
            
     $757,200. That works out at $2,524 per applicant. 
     <lb/>
     The figures they gave me in Civil Re-estab<lb break="no"/>lishment work out at $900. I hope someone down 
     <lb/>
     there is listening to me, because these figures 
     <lb/>
     were given me as correct. It shows what is hap<lb break="no"/>pening with the work covering the same project, 
     <lb/>
     the same group of ex«servicemen, and one 
     <lb/>
     department does not know what is happening in 
     <lb/>
     the other. I am not blaming the Committee, they 
     <lb/>
     have done a good job; like ourselves, they have 
     <lb/>
     to accept the figures given. But if you check the 
     <lb/>
     figures you will find they do not work out right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> The part-time holdings are not covered 
     <lb/>
     in the summary at all.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I agree with Mr. Smallwood on 
     <lb/>
     the feed business. If the government wanted to 
     <lb/>
     help the farmer, the farmer should be in a position 
     <lb/>
     to import his feeds direct. If a farmer wants 100 
     <lb/>
     sacks of fertiliser he should be able to get a permit 
     <lb/>
     from the government to have that landed at his 
     <lb/>
     own place, instead of having it come to St. John's 
     <lb/>
     first and brought back again. The same thing 
     <lb/>
     applies to feeds. The farmer pays $1.50 per sack 
     <lb/>
     more than he should, by reason of the fact that it

     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I visited Midland a number of times 
     <lb/>
     and I know quite a number of men there. They 
     <lb/>
     find it very hard to get their living; they have to 
     <lb/>
     go into the woods and so on. I regret that we have 
     <lb/>
     no report from some of our independent farmers 
     <lb/>
     on the west coast—such as Mr. Earle, the Whites 
     <lb/>
     and others.... In connection with assistance to 
     <lb/>
     farmers to grow potatoes, cabbage and so forth, I 
     <lb/>
     fail to see the use of encouraging those men and 
     <lb/>
     spending a lot of money, without giving them 
     <lb/>
     protection in connection with marketing. We see 
     <lb/>
     ads in the papers advertising local potatoes. Sure<lb break="no"/>ly those men should be able to sell their 
     <lb/>
     vegetables. I regret that we get potatoes from 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, and that's the reason why 
     <lb/>
     some of our small farmers are unable to sell. I 
     <lb/>
     believe the government should see that their 
     <lb/>
     vegetables are sold before any are brought in 
     <lb/>
     from outside. Someone is going to say, "We can 
     <lb/>
     buy them cheaper". I believe it, but I want to 
     <lb/>
     show you something. I have before me the

     <lb/>
     $45 a month. I wonder what our people would say 
     <lb/>
     if they were asked by the government to work for 
     <lb/>
     that rate. Some of our farmers are paying their 
     <lb/>
     hired men 50 cents an hour. Surely if our potatoes 
     <lb/>
     are a bit higher we should patronise them 
     <lb/>
     anyhow. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> I find this debate on this report very 
     <lb/>helpful and interesting. I am bound to point out, 
     <lb/>however, that there is no reference made to 
     <lb/>Labrador. The members can very well be excused 
     <lb/>for that, because no one would think that 
     <lb/>Labrador is an agricultural country. I bring it up, 
     <lb/>because I think the agricultural prospects of 
     <lb/>Labrador are based on the future welfare of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Labrador.... I foresee that a lot of 
     <lb/>Newfoundlanders will be called upon to go to 
     <lb/>Labrador to take part in the mineral and timber 
     <lb/>operations there, and I think that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>should know something of the agricultural 
     <lb/>prospects of Labrador. When families are asked 
     <lb/>to uproot themselves from our fishing villages 
     <lb/>they will want to know the possibilities of grow<lb break="no"/>ing some vegetables. It would not have been a bad 
     <lb/>idea if the Committee had brought in something 
     <lb/>along that line. Because they have not, I want to 
     <lb/>tell you that there are possibilities for agriculture 
     <lb/>in a small way, for gardening, in Labrador. 
     <lb/>Anyone should not have any fear about the 
     <lb/>climate or the weather.... It is better than the 
     <lb/>Avalon Peninsula, Mr. Higgins.

            <p>
     A professor from Nova Scotia did a scientific 
     <lb/>
     test of the soil in Labrador, and it is very interest<lb break="no"/>ing. Along the coast nothing much can be done, 
     <lb/>but when you go inland 20 or 30 miles vegetables 
     <lb/>can be grown, and at Lake Melville, 150 miles in, 
     <lb/>lots can be done. The Hudson's Bay Co. at North 
     <lb/>West River and all the families around there, can 
     <lb/>grow all the vegetables they need if they put the 
     <lb/>time on it. The Grenfell Mission grows from 75 
     <lb/>to 100 barrels of potatoes, and cabbage by the 
     <lb/>hundreds of tons, and all the ordinary vegetables. 
     <lb/>I have grown celery and bleached it, and 
     <lb/>tomatoes, although the season is rather short, but 
     <lb/>all the ordinary vegetables can be grown in these 
     <lb/>bays.... In 1938 Dr. Paddon,<ref target="#fn_18">[1]</ref> a great doctor, 
     <lb/>encouraged gardening in Labrador, said in the 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> that gardening in Labrador was three 
 

            <cb/>
           

     weeks ahead of Newfoundland. That does not 
     <lb/>
     mean we are three weeks ahead in setting out 
     <lb/>
     gardens, but around the middle of the summer the 
     <lb/>
     result is about three weeks ahead of the east coast 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. I left my own home on the 
     <lb/>
     north side of Bonavista Bay when the potatoes in 
     <lb/>
     our garden were just peeping through the ground. 
     <lb/>
     I went to North West River, it took me about a 
     <lb/>
     week to get there, and when I saw my own garden 
     <lb/>
     there our potatoes were out in flower. The ex<lb break="no"/>planation is the long sunny days that we get in the 
     <lb/>
     great dependency, I suppose....

     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> I must agree in part with the member 
     <lb/>
     from White Bay in speaking of his experience on 
     <lb/>
     the southwest coast. I am very familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     activities at Winterland. The people there are in 
     <lb/>
     a fairly comfortable condition, selling their 
     <lb/>
     produce and getting a high price for it, and there 
     <lb/>
     is no question they have bettered themselves 
     <lb/>
     considerably. The settlement at Marystown is not 
     <lb/>
     nearly so successful. I don't know why, but it is 
     <lb/>
     a fact. I would like to know the cost of these field 
     <lb/>
     workers, and how many there are.

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> There are only three at the present

     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, Professor R. A. MacKay<ref target="#fn_19">[2]</ref> has this 
     <lb/>
     to say: "Agriculture's claim to recognition in this 
     <lb/>
     country is as a handmaid to other industries rather 
     <lb/>
     than as an industry in its own right." I believe the 
     <lb/>
     report bears out the truth of this statement and 
     <lb/>
     refer you to page 1, when the Government 
     <lb/>
     Analyst states that about 3% of our soil (some 
     <lb/>
     700,000 acres) is first-class agricultural land, and 
     <lb/>
     30% is second-class soil. Of the 3% comprising 
     <lb/>
     700,000 acres, the 1945 census shows total hold<lb break="no"/>ings of 124,953 acres, which still leaves some 
     <lb/>
     600,000 acres for those who believe in the back- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     to-the-land movement. It may be an accident of 
     <lb/>
     birth that some of us grew up in districts where a 
     <lb/>
     normal size potato, or a turnip with an attractive 
     <lb/>
     figure, was as rare as a $100 bank note, but the 
     <lb/>
     fact remains that in a large part of our island the 
     <lb/>
     development of agriculture is severely limited by 
     <lb/>
     the availability of the soil, by soil fertility, and the 
     <lb/>
     preoccupation of the people at the fisheries and

     other major industries You just can't foster 
     <lb/>
     agriculture on parts of the northeast coast — 
     <lb/>
     unless you first import the soil. On page 2,<ref target="#fn_20">[1]</ref> he 
     <lb/>
     report says, "It seemed to us and still does that 
     <lb/>
     our fisheries are of prime importance." Coming 
     <lb/>
     from a fishing district where the word "farmer" 
     <lb/>
     humorously applies only to a sea-sick, third-rate 
     <lb/>
     fisherman who is usually also a bungler, I can 
     <lb/>
     appreciate the truth of that statement; but isn't 
     <lb/>
     there something in this centralisation idea? Isn t 
     <lb/>
     it possible for the fisherman to fish from sheltered 
     <lb/>
     inland harbours where he could produce enough 
     <lb/>
     vegetables for his own family? Are there to be 
     <lb/>
     found around our bays and inlets, sites where 
     <lb/>
     towns could be built for fishermen-farmers? The 
     <lb/>
     big problem is the centralising of our fisheries in 
     <lb/>
     selected communities where men can till the soil 
     <lb/>
     and reap the harvest of the sea as well. Some will 
     <lb/>
     say this is but a vision, but it is a vision that we 
     <lb/>
     must keep before us, and while large scale com<lb break="no"/>mercial farming can never be carried on on the 
     <lb/>
     coastal belt, there is a lot which can be done. We 
     <lb/>
     must in the future have men big enough to put the 
     <lb/>
     centralisation idea into effect, and I can only 
     <lb/>
     visualise success through the fisherman-farmer 
     <lb/>
     method. I am not suggesting a Markland land 
     <lb/>
     settlement idea, rather places where the cod- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fishery can be profitably prosecuted, for example 
     <lb/>
     Glovertown and Eastport — Glovertown in par<lb break="no"/>ticular, built on a good harbour, up to last year 
     <lb/>
     (when that disastrous fire occurred) possessing 
     <lb/>
     lots of available timber and very fertile soil. Here 
     <lb/>
     a fisherman could prosecute the Labrador fishery 
     <lb/>
     and grow enough vegetables for himself and 
     <lb/>
     some to sell, thus being able to produce fish at a 
     <lb/>
     much lower cost than his fellow Labrador fisher<lb break="no"/>man at Wesleyville, who buys every spring and 
     <lb/>
     fall the agricultural produce of Glovertown and 
     <lb/>
     Eastport. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the matter of expenditure the government 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction scheme proposes to spend in the 
     <lb/>
     next nine years $3,892,000 on land development, 
     <lb/>
     $8,000 for soil survey, and a further $691,000 for 
     <lb/>
     schemes to further promote development of 
     <lb/>
     agriculture. Against this they propose spending 
     <lb/>
     only $650,000 for fishery development. So it may 
     <lb/>
     be that quite a few of us may nine years hence 
     <lb/>
     share in the beneficence of this approximately $5 
     <lb/>
     million expenditure, and under the benign in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the Commission of Government find

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if Mr. Keough would

     care to give us a little dissertation on the main

     problems of the professional farmer. He comes 
     <lb/>
     from a farming district. What are the obstacles in 
     <lb/>
     the way of a professional farmer, and does he see 
     <lb/>
     any general solution of these problems?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I will give Mr. Keough time to 
     <lb/>
     answer the question. Reverting to protection for 
     <lb/>
     farmers, the question that's been agitating me and 
     <lb/>
     a great number of us who are not farmers, is 
     <lb/>
     whether we ever hope to compete in our sale of 
     <lb/>
     vegetables with the people of the continent next 
     <lb/>
     door. Have we the land, and can we ever get the 
     <lb/>
     price down? If you can't, what is the best thing 
     <lb/>
     to do? is it better to subsidise the farmer or put 
     <lb/>
     the duty up and also the cost of living? That's the 
     <lb/>
     general question. Could you give your 
     <lb/>
     Committee's opinion on that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> The evidence that we got varied very 
     <lb/>
     considerably as between individual farmers. We 
     <lb/>
     were informed that it was possible to get down 
     <lb/>
     the cost of certain items. For example, I don't 
     <lb/>
     think we had any evidence to show that potatoes 
     <lb/>
     could be grown as cheaply as we could import 
     <lb/>
     them, but turnips, yes. The reason was that there 
     <lb/>
     is so much land that we have not yet cleared for 
     <lb/>
     growing potatoes with the help of machinery, and 
     <lb/>
     we could not afford that land. But turnips, you 
     <lb/>
     require so much less land that you can produce, 
     <lb/>
     not perhaps as cheaply as they can be imported, 
     <lb/>
     but pretty nearly.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Under no circumstances can you 
     <lb/>
     produce potatoes, is that it?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> in subsistence farming the more 
     <lb/>
     potatoes you grow, provided people do not stay 
     <lb/>
     away from productive work, the better, but on a 
     <lb/>
     commercial basis it is doubtful if you could grow 
     <lb/>
     them as cheaply as we can import them. Do you 
     <lb/>
     follow that?

     England at one stage there was a fine balance 
     <lb/>
     between agriculture and industry. Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     found she could make more money by going into 
     <lb/>
     industry to the neglect of agriculture. At the 
     <lb/>
     present time she is going back and spending a lot 
     <lb/>
     of money to try and build up her agricultural 
     <lb/>
     possibilities. It seems to me that if we could build 
     <lb/>
     up a lot of industries which would return to us 
     <lb/>
     greater wealth than farming, then maybe we 
     <lb/>
     should not do much farming. My opinion is that 
     <lb/>
     we should always do so much, because if one of 
     <lb/>
     your vital industries sadly failed, you would have 
     <lb/>
     something to fall back on. Do you not agree? 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Definitely.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> It is a question of the whole economy 
     <lb/>
     and stability. I believe in 1870, France, because 
     <lb/>
     of the fine balance between industry and agricul<lb break="no"/>ture, was able to pay off her debt to Germany and 
     <lb/>
     she came back quicker than if she had depended

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That is likely what is happening in 
     <lb/>
     England today. I am sure your Committee gave

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Yes, we thought of the soil which is

     rocky and rough; but you read the history of

     agriculture in Norway, and it is almost word for

     word the description of the soil in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     If you read the history of the founding of the New

     <lb/>
     the language used about the soils when they took 
     <lb/>
     over first. It seems to the Committee we are 
     <lb/>
     starting agriculture 300 years too late. We have 
     <lb/>
     the advantage now, of course, we will be able to

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Not for a long time. It might be pos<lb break="no"/>sible to rear calves for milk production and after<lb break="no"/>wards sell the cows. To go in for production on a 
     <lb/>
     big scale might be questionable. The same thing 
     <lb/>
     is true for sheep. A man has eight or ten sheep on 
     <lb/>
     a normal size farm; that can be worked all right; 
     <lb/>
     but to have sheep as acommercial proposition is 
     <lb/>
     not feasible.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I could add to that. I was talking 
     <lb/>
     to a farmer in the west end of St. John's; he grew 
     <lb/>
     2,000 barrels of potatoes. He did not grow them 
     <lb/>
     on his own land, he did not have enough, but he 
     <lb/>
     got the use of two or three farms and he grew 
     <lb/>
     2,000 barrels, ... sold them and made money on 
     <lb/>
     them. He himself said the trouble is that if you 
     <lb/>
     plant out five or ten acres in potatoes, you have 
     <lb/>
     not got enough land to do it on a large scale. Your 
     <lb/>
     unit of production is very low; and your cost per 
     <lb/>
     bushel or barrel naturally is going to be high. You 
     <lb/>
     have to get a high price to make it pay. The only 
     <lb/>
     way to get a good price is through the customs 
     <lb/>
     tariff which will make the price of competing 
     <lb/>
     potatoes artificially higher. If you get away from 
     <lb/>
     the small unit, and turn out at the rate of 2,000 
     <lb/>
     barrels, you can make money....
