<!-- GL, 2017-09-12, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
     <!--toil for a living. I share their feelings and the 
     <lb/>
     feelings of the toiiers of this country. They have 
     <lb/>
     never got a square show and a deliberate attempt 
     <lb/>
     has been made to stack up the powers of govern<lb break="no"/>ment and powers of taxation against them, so as 
     <lb/>
     to keep them down. I share that belief. Ihave no 
     <lb/>
     shame in saying it. There is nothing aristocratic 
     <lb/>
     about me. There is not a single ounce of blue 
     <lb/>
     blood in me. 
     <lb/>
            

            <p>
     But, sir, there is another reason why I shall 
     <lb/>
     vote against Commission government in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. Whatever little help the old mother 
     <lb/>
     country was able to give us when we needed it so 
     <lb/>
     badly before the war — and I repeat that we 
     <lb/>
     should be forever grateful to Britain for what she 
     <lb/>
     gave us before the war — what hope have we of 
     <lb/>
     any help from her in the future, should we need 
     <lb/>
     it? Never, in the history of mankind upon this 
     <lb/>
     earth, never did a country suffer as did the mother 
     <lb/>
     country this past ten years, since 1938. Never did 
     <lb/>
     people sacrifice as the British people sacrificed 
     <lb/>
     and as they are sacrificing today. They gave their 
     <lb/>
     all. They threw it into the fight gladly; they 
     <lb/>
     stripped themselves to the bare bone; everything 
     <lb/>
     went until they were naked and empty of hand. 
     <lb/>
     The whole world has stood in speechless amaze<lb break="no"/>ment over the prodigious sacrifice of the British 
     <lb/>
     people; such effort, such sacrifice and such 
     <lb/>
     courage! I am reminded of the words of Winston 
     <lb/>
     Churchill, "Let no man underrate the abiding 
     <lb/>
     power of the British Empire, not because you see 
     <lb/>
     46 million people on our island harassed about 
     <lb/>
     their food supplies, or because we have difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in re-starting our industries and export trade after 
     <lb/>
     six years of war effort, do not suppose we shall 
     <lb/>
     not come through these dark days as we have 
     <lb/>
     come through the years of the past or that a half 
     <lb/>
     century from now you will not see 70 or 80 
     <lb/>
     million Britons spread about the world united in 
     <lb/>
     the defence of justice and way of life." These are 
     <lb/>
     brave words, sir, and true words. Britain will 
     <lb/>
     come back. Of that I have no doubt. It will not be 
     <lb/>
     soon, but she will receive help from her sons and 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     friends around the world and she will strive as no 
     <lb/>
     other people ever strove, and some day she will 
     <lb/>
     stand among the nations of the earth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But meanwhile, we here in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     must vote this spring, this very spring, to decide 
     <lb/>
     what form of government we shall have for our 
     <lb/>
     country. We cannot lean on the old mother 
     <lb/>
     country. We cannot look to her for help. We may 
     <lb/>
     have some in our midst who are satisfied to have 
     <lb/>
     Britain share her poverty with us. We may have 
     <lb/>
     some who would hold on to the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government in the hope that through them 
     <lb/>
     Britain would, out of her own poverty and need, 
     <lb/>
     help us if we should need help. I hope that the 
     <lb/>
     number of such persons is small in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I shall vote for this motion to place these 
     <lb/>
     two forms of government before our people in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum this spring, for I know it is our 
     <lb/>
     people's right to decide. I have no right whatever 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     they wish, and I shall not oppose their having that

     right. I shall vote against these two forms of 
     <lb/>

     what I may term an unpleasant alternative. The

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before proceeding to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the order paper, I would like to say, Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, arising out of two matters to which you 
     <lb/>
     directed my attention yesterday afternoon, that I 
     <lb/>
     have inquired into both and I am about to report 
     <lb/>
     progress. With regard to the question on the New<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
     
foundland Savings Bank, you will appreciate the 
     <lb/>
     fact that it envisages what the position of the bank 
     <lb/>
     and the depositors would be in the event of this 
     <lb/>
     country becoming the tenth province of Canada 
     <lb/>
     by the superimposition of the BNA Act. The 
     <lb/>
     question requires the knowledge, on the part of

     the person who undertakes to answer the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, as to what effect the Canadian Bank Act and 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Bank and Bills of Exchange Act 
     <lb/>
     would have upon the institution in question. Fur<lb break="no"/>ther, it calls for a declaration by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government as to what its position would be, 
     <lb/>
     knowing as you do that a bank cannot start in 
     <lb/>
     Canada without first applying to and obtaining a 
     <lb/>
     charter from the federal government. It was 
     <lb/>
     decided by the local government that a positive 
     <lb/>
     pronouncement should be obtained from the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada, and, therefore I am in<lb break="no"/>structed to advise you that your question has been 
     <lb/>
     addressed to the Canadian government through 
     <lb/>
     the High Commissioner here, and it is expected 
     <lb/>
     that the answer or answers to your questions will 
     <lb/>
     be forthcoming any day now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the second question addressed 
     <lb/>
     to me by Major Cashin, Mr. Smallwood and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bradley, I have had a two hour conference with 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. A.J. Walsh, K.C., Acting Chairman of 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government.... I have to ad<lb break="no"/>vise the House that the Hon. Mr. Walsh has taken 
     <lb/>
     the matter under advisement, and while I do not 
     <lb/>
     want to anticipate him, his attitude or at least the 
     <lb/>
     attitude of the government, will be communi<lb break="no"/>cated to the House through me within the next 
     <lb/>
     day or two. I do not know if there are any further 
     <lb/>
     questions arising out of that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Beyond the fact that the questions 
     <lb/>
     regarding the Savings Bank have been in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Commission government for ten 
     <lb/>
     days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It was addressed through the 
     <lb/>
     High Commissioner here to the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, yesterday, when it was 
     <lb/>
     brought to their attention again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I was assured that the matter had 
     <lb/>
     been attended to and that the question was ad<lb break="no"/>dressed to the Government of Canada through the 
     <lb/>
     High Conunissioner here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I understand the question was 
     <lb/>
     directed probably yesterday or Saturday, despite 
     <lb/>
     the fact that it was in the hands of the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government for a week prior to that. It is an 
     <lb/>
     important question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You will appreciate the fact. in 
     <lb/>
     fairness to the Attorney General, to whom the 
     <lb/>
     question would be directed, that because of the 
     <lb/>
     legal implications he had to take the matter 
    

            <cb/>
         

     under advisement. It is a matter upon which I 
     <lb/>
     cannot make a pronouncement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I understand you cannot make a 
     <lb/>
     pronouncement, Mr. Chairman. I want to point 
     <lb/>
     out that we should have some definite informa<lb break="no"/>tion on this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I understand they were going to 
     <lb/>
     telegraph. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The last time we asked a question 
     <lb/>
     here it took them a long time to reply and then 
     <lb/>
     they gave us evasive answers. If the next one is 
     <lb/>
     as evasive it is worthless. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I did not find out how the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was communicated, but I was assured it had 
     <lb/>
     been forwarded.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I know from private information 
     <lb/>
     that in high circles I was condemned for even 
     <lb/>
     asking this question — that it is none of our 
     <lb/>
     business. I do know that certain steps were taken 
     <lb/>
     to try and curb this off. Mr. Smallwood told us 
     <lb/>
     that the Savings Bank will be continued. I want 
     <lb/>
     to see it in black and white. It is not in those 
     <lb/>
     books. I do not think Mr. Smallwood or any 
     <lb/>
     member of that Ottawa delegation or any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this house can give us that information; the 
     <lb/>
     only way to get it is from the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not feel that there is any<lb break="no"/>body who is able to make a pronouncement ex<lb break="no"/>cept the Canadian government. If I were the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General, I would not attempt to answer 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is a matter which the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation should have taken up with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government while they were in Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will be honest about this. I do 
     <lb/>not remember whether it was at one of our plen<lb break="no"/>ary sessions or whether it was in conversation 
     <lb/>with the Minister of Justice, but in one of these I 
     <lb/>know that I, for one, did definitely raise the 
     <lb/>question, under confederation, who would own 
     <lb/>the Newfoundland Savings Bank and who would 
     <lb/>control it and who would get the profits.... I think 
     <lb/>the profits of the Savings Bank up to now are over 
     <lb/>$800,000 or $900,000 accumulated profits. I 
     <lb/>raised the question, under confederation who 
     <lb/>would own the profits? The answer was clear; no 
     <lb/>hesitation about it. It would be the same as now. 
     <lb/>The Newfoundland government would operate 
     <lb/>it; it will go on owning it; it will set the rates; it 
     <lb/>will own the profits. The answer was not put in

     writing because the question was not put in writ<lb break="no"/>ing. I will admit frankly that when we submitted 
     <lb/>
     a long list of questions which are in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Book ... and which the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     answered in writing, when we did that, it would 
     <lb/>
     have been a good thing, if we had thought of it, 
     <lb/>
     to ask them the question in writing; they would 
     <lb/>
     have replied in writing and Major Cashin would 
     <lb/>
     have been saved the bother of getting it in writing. 
     <lb/>
     The High Commissioner has sent the question on 
     <lb/>
     to the government in Ottawa by cable, and if they 
     <lb/>
     reply by cable we ought to have the reply soon; 
     <lb/>
     and unless the Government of Canada has dis<lb break="no"/>covered something since talking to us, I think you 
     <lb/>
     will find the answer will be as I told you, namely 
     <lb/>
     that the government Savings Bank will not be 
     <lb/>
     affected, it will go right on under confederation 
     <lb/>
     the same as it is now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It is all right for Mr. Smallwood to 
     <lb/>
     say that, but these meetings in Ottawa — there 
     <lb/>
     was nothing I could find covering the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Savings Bank, which has $20 million 
     <lb/>
     belonging to the people of this country, averaging 
     <lb/>
     today 2.7%. In Canada there is no such thing as 
     <lb/>
     a government Savings Bank. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Has not any of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     got one? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No. They are all chartered banks. 
     <lb/>
     They have to have a charter. $20 million is not 
     <lb/>
     chicken-feed it may be to Mr. St. Laurent—they 
     <lb/>
     took very good care to state What would happen 
     <lb/>
     to our surplus but they said nothing about the 
     <lb/>
     Savings Bank. It looks fishy to me. And if they 
     <lb/>
     do not answer, I am going to put my own inter<lb break="no"/>pretation on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your concern is that there is not 
     <lb/>
     an official declaration, either in permanent form 
     <lb/>
     or otherwise by the Canadian government as to 
     <lb/>
     the future status and operation of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Savings Bank in the event of this 
     <lb/>
     country's deciding to federate with Canada? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It looks to me that they have told us 
     <lb/>
     what is going to happen. They distinctly tell us in 
     <lb/>
     the terms that the surplus will be divided as to 
     <lb/>
     one-third which has to be placed on security in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If we wish to put it on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> This would indicate that the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the monies in the Savings Bank will be trans<lb break="no"/>ferred to the Bank of Canada. Or does it not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am not Minister of Finance — 
     <lb/>
     although I was promised to be Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance of Canada. I might enlighten the House 
     <lb/>
     further with regard to this matter. I had conflict 
     <lb/>
     before in connection with this, and I may say that 
     <lb/>
     I came out on top. Under the Savings Bank Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1937 — if my memory serves me right — the 
     <lb/>
     profits that would accrue were to be placed in a 
     <lb/>
     special fund so as to build it up until profits 
     <lb/>
     amounted to 25% of the total deposits in the bank 
     <lb/>
     as further security against any loss depositors 
     <lb/>
     might run up against. At that time also in that act, 
     <lb/>
     provision was made whereby the profits would 
     <lb/>
     be handed over to the Crown Agents in London 
     <lb/>
     for administration. That act of 1937 was never 
     <lb/>
     carried out. Profits were never sent to the Crown 
     <lb/>
     Agents because two and half years afterwards 
     <lb/>
     they amended that act (1939) wiping out that 
     <lb/>
     clause. It was still laid down that profits were to 
     <lb/>
     be set aside, but those profits, as a matter of fact, 
     <lb/>
     are not properly set aside yet; they are just shown 
     <lb/>
     as assets of the bank. No fund has been created. 
     <lb/>
     If tomorrow they should get a run on the bank 
     <lb/>
     (God forbid!), and they had to sell some of these 
     <lb/>
     bonds at a discount, the profit might be wiped out. 
     <lb/>
     I want to assure the Convention and the country, 
     <lb/>
     because I know steps have been taken in high 
     <lb/>
     circles in this country condemning me for bring<lb break="no"/>ing this matter up. I consider it my job as a 
     <lb/>
     member of this Convention to bring it up. I want 
     <lb/>
     to see the thing straightened out and unless and 
     <lb/>
     until it is straightened out, I am not going to be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied. We cannot take Mr. Smallwoood's 
     <lb/>
     word or the word of any member of that delega<lb break="no"/>tion regarding the Newfoundland Savings Bank. 
     <lb/>
     If it comes officially from the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, all right. As I see it, it will not come from 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government; unless they are going 
     <lb/>
     to put a special provincial bank here, and they 
     <lb/>
     have none in any other part of Canada.... They 
     <lb/>
     have a provincial bank in Montreal, but it does 
     <lb/>
     not do regular chartered business, it is not any<lb break="no"/>thing like the one we have here — it is privately 
     <lb/>
     owned, not government owned. There is no 
     <lb/>
     government savings bank in Canada — if there 
     <lb/>
     is, I am from Missouri. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the other matter, I gathered 
     <lb/>
     from you that will be announced within the next 
     <lb/>
     day or two? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I had a two hour conversation

     agreed in principle as legal men as to the inter<lb break="no"/>pretation to be placed upon the act and while 
     <lb/>
     we were in tentative agreement, he wanted some 
     <lb/>
     time to think it over. I sprung it on him out of the 
     <lb/>
     clouds, so to speak. It was agreed that I would 
     <lb/>
     send him a transcript of that particular part of the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings, which I have done. Undoubtedly we 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I do 
     <lb/>
     not intend to take up much time in speaking to 
     <lb/>
     this resolution. At the onset I wish to make it clear 
     <lb/>
     that I am in support of it, particularly that part 
     <lb/>
     relating to the restoration of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I feel that in responsible government we 
     <lb/>
     have the best opportunity for the future. It is 
     <lb/>
     because I am not less interested than you are in 
     <lb/>
     the future of our country that I feel confident in 
     <lb/>
     justifying that statement. Now, sir, before all else, 
     <lb/>
     I think we must recognise that we are entering a 
     <lb/>
     new era. Things perhaps will never again be just 
     <lb/>
     as they were. We are moving out of old condi<lb break="no"/>tions and old social and economic surroundings. 
     <lb/>
     We are at the crossroads. Let us accept that as a 
     <lb/>
     fact, as simply and as categorically as we can, and 
     <lb/>
     let us build our house of the future accordingly. 
     <lb/>
     It is my conviction that the Newfoundland people 
     <lb/>
     are about to face a second great test of their 
     <lb/>
     powers of survival as a separate unit in the British 
     <lb/>
     Commonwealth. We have to be careful and see 
     <lb/>
     to it that we are not saddled with a group of 
     <lb/>
     experimenters and so-called planners with their 
     <lb/>
     intricate formulas of social and economic 
     <lb/>
     security under the misguided notion that 
     <lb/>
     economic security and freedom and liberty are 
     <lb/>
     one and the same thing. If you were to ask me, on 
     <lb/>
     what group of our people falls the greatest re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility for the future well-being of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, I would put my finger on those who 
     <lb/>
     drudge in the city, town and village, and those 
     <lb/>
     who toil in the forest, in the mines, on the land 
     <lb/>
     and upon the sea —- these are the people of labour, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman; these are the people who built this 
     <lb/>
     country, in good times and bad. It was the men 
     <lb/>
     and women of labour who made our cities, towns 
     <lb/>
     and villages and serviced them; it is they who 
    
            <cb/>
          

     built our churches and schools and staffed them. 
     <lb/>
     We are here, Mr. Chairman, representing those 
     <lb/>
     people, to consider the good and welfare of them 
     <lb/>
     all. So let us see to it that their faith in democratic 
     <lb/>
     government is not injured — and when we speak 
     <lb/>
     of faith, I say that faith can be applied to the 
     <lb/>
     events, problems and controversies of modern 
     <lb/>
     living, especially in the field of industry and the 
     <lb/>
     relationships of business and labour. Our prob<lb break="no"/>lem is to restore human affairs in this country to 
     <lb/>
     a satisfactory state without sacrificing the essen<lb break="no"/>tial framework of our way of life. To save what 
     <lb/>
     is good in our present economy based on a 
     <lb/>
     legitimate profit motive and the natural right of 
     <lb/>
     private ownership, we must first get to know 
     <lb/>
     entwining abuses, and then be prepared to cut 
     <lb/>
     those abuses away. What is basically good in this 
     <lb/>
     country of ours must be thoughtfully and con<lb break="no"/>scientiously observed in the face of sceptical and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps muddled thinking — that will take time 
     <lb/>
     and study, and study takes time and sacrifice. We 
     <lb/>
     must prepare, as any alert businessman would do 
     <lb/>
     to save a going concern, to sacrifice whatever 
     <lb/>
     does not contribute to the general good. The 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people must be careful in their 
     <lb/>
     consideration of their domestic problems. I feel 
     <lb/>
     confident, Mr. Chairman, that the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland are not going to be prompted by any 
     <lb/>
     jittery impulse to grasp at some quick social 
     <lb/>
     formula that promises some kind of a general 
     <lb/>
     remedy. The toilers of this country will decide in 
     <lb/>
     their own good time and in their own way without 
     <lb/>
     any flag-waving speeches and fancy talk from 
     <lb/>
     anyone. That is the way I look at it, and I believe 
     <lb/>
     the great majority of our people look upon this 
     <lb/>
     question in the same way. They will decide for 
     <lb/>
     themselves. It is quite true that we in New<lb break="no"/>

     foundland have had to contend with economic 
     <lb/>
     factors much less favourable than some 
     <lb/>
     countries. Of course we ate dole in New<lb break="no"/>foundland during the depression — the world ate 
     <lb/>
     dole. In Europe and in the Americas, a hundred 
     <lb/>
     million human beings ate dole, and there are 
     <lb/>
     many eating it today. Some of the finest cities in 
     <lb/>
     the world have their cracked pavements, sagging 
     <lb/>
     roofs and tumbledown shacks. These things are 
     <lb/>
     there for anyone to see, this position is not 
     <lb/>
     peculiar to Newfoundland. A political change 
     <lb/>
     cannot bring forth economic reform and freedom 
     <lb/>
     from want. The resources of this country are as 
     <lb/>
     God made them, and any change in the form of 
     <lb/>
     government will not bring a change in climate. It 
     <lb/>
     will not bring more fish to our shores, nor make 
     <lb/>
     the day longer, nor will it bring us any nearer to 
     <lb/>
     the great centres of supply. No, Mr. Chairman, a 
     <lb/>
     particular form of government will not give us 
     <lb/>
     economic security. It has been stressed here that 
     <lb/>
     there can be no political freedom without 
     <lb/>
     economic security. Where can this be found, this 
     <lb/>
     political freedom coupled with economic 
     <lb/>
     security? It has never existed. Are we to receive 
     <lb/>
     this gift overnight? Trash and nonsense! If we 
     <lb/>
     want political freedom with some measure of 
     <lb/>
     economic security, we shall have to dig and sweat 
     <lb/>
     for it. It is the only way. Life was more simple at 
     <lb/>
     one time, Mr. Chairman, it was not the tremen<lb break="no"/>dously complex thing we know today, and we 
     <lb/>
     should remember that any individual solution to 
     <lb/>
     a local problem is a definite contribution to the 
     <lb/>
     solution of national problems, which are cum<lb break="no"/>ulative. If we want democracy in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow, we must live it today. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p>Fundamentally the Newfoundland scene has 
     <lb/>not changed, but we are slowly moving away 
     <lb/>from old methods of doing things, perhaps even 
     <lb/>without our knowing it; we are moving through 
     <lb/>a transitional period in this present century; the 
     <lb/>whole financial, government and economic 
     <lb/>structure of our island has been vastly changed; 
     <lb/>we have to adapt ourselves to new world condi<lb break="no"/>tions. And before we take one step forward into 
     <lb/>the future, we Newfoundland people must see to 
     <lb/>it that we have restored to us our hard-won rights 
     <lb/>as a separate unit in the Empire. In closing, sir, I 
     <lb/>say that we must find for ourselves a framework 
     <lb/>of philosophy of life that will make it possible for 
     <lb/>us to approach and solve our problems in an 
     <lb/>intelligent and therefore democratic manner.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have waited a 
     <lb/>
     long time and in patience for this day. I can still 
     <lb/>
     remember Friday, February 16, 1934. I had just 
     <lb/>
     passed my 17th birthday, and like most young 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders of the day who had finished 
     <lb/>
     school the preceding June, I was more taken up 
     <lb/>
     with the problem of what to do next than with 
     <lb/>
     affairs of state. Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, I had 
     <lb/>
     sufficient sense of destiny to realise on that bleak 
     <lb/>
     February day 14 years ago, that something 
     <lb/>
     momentous was happening which, though I was 
     <lb/>
     not aware of it at the moment, was to have great 
     <lb/>
     meaning in time in my own personal life. I 
     <lb/>
     sensed, sir, then, that it was a great historical 
     <lb/>
     moment, and in a way, perhaps, I was a living 
     <lb/>
     symbol of the belief then held by a great section 
     <lb/>
     of our people, that the system of government that 
     <lb/>
     day being inaugurated in Newfoundland was des<lb break="no"/>tined to open up a new era for this country. This 
     <lb/>
     sense of destiny and that faith — more conscious 
     <lb/>
     than expressed — caused me to wander that 
     <lb/>
     afternoon to the vicinity of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Hotel to gaze at the notables as they arrived in 
     <lb/>
     their cars, and vanished into the impressive por<lb break="no"/>tals of that structure on their way to the Ballroom, 
     <lb/>
     where the deed was to be done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The papers said the weather was ideal, but I 
     <lb/>
     know better. It was cold and bleak, a grey 
     <lb/>
     February day as I recall it, and it has seemed to 
     <lb/>
     me, in every day that has passed thereafter that I 
     <lb/>
     think upon that scene, that a greyness comes into 
     <lb/>
     my soul as well. For you see, sir, I was young 
     <lb/>
     then, green; I knew little of governments and less 
     <lb/>
     of politics. The only recollection I can summon 
     <lb/>
     to my mind of the days of parliamentary govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this island is a recollection of the general 
     <lb/>
     election of 1932, when the Alderdice government 
     <lb/>
     was elected, whose manifesto said in effect that 
     <lb/>
     it would seek the appointment of a royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion to study the situation of the country and 
     <lb/>
     recommend as to the alteration of the existing 
     <lb/>
     constitution. but that no such recommendations 
     <lb/>
     should be carried into effect without an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people. Well, in June, 1932, I was more 
     <lb/>
     interested in the Council of Higher Education's 
     <lb/>
     examination papers for grade ten, than I was in 
     <lb/>
     the personnel and manifestoes of the contending 
     <lb/>
     parties in that election. I can still vaguely recall 
     <lb/>
     the indifference with which I and my companions 
     <lb/>
     passed shops and offices in whose windows long 
     <lb/>
     lists gave the hour-to-hour results of the polling. 
     <lb/>

     And so in 1932, but more so in 1934, two crises 
     <lb/>
     of our national life were reached and gone 
     <lb/>
     through, and the ignorance and the unconcern of 
     <lb/>
     youth thought less of them than of summer 
     <lb/>
     holidays in 1932, and a job in 1934. And yet, in 
     <lb/>
     looking back, I sometimes wonder if some of the 
     <lb/>
     unconcern was more imagined than real; that the 
     <lb/>
     sense of destiny may have gone deeper than I 
     <lb/>
     thought. Else how, sir, I have often said to myself, 
     <lb/>
     "How can you account for this?" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is a portion of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi>, for 
     <lb/>
     Saturday, February 17, 1934. I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     read what's in it, but I want to refer to it for just 
     <lb/>
     a moment as I move on to deal with the motion 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair. The pages contain a detailed 
     <lb/>
     description of the proceedings that went on inside 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland Hotel on the previous day 
     <lb/>
     while I stood outside in the bleak day and 
     <lb/>
     wondered. I do not propose to describe that scene, 
     <lb/>
     which is so familiar to so many of our people, nor 
     <lb/>
     to list the imposing array of very important per<lb break="no"/>sons who attended in one capacity or another. But 
     <lb/>
     I wish briefly to summarise the meaning of that 
     <lb/>
     scene and that event as it then appeared. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The new Letters Patent of 1934 suspended the 
     <lb/>
     Letters Patent of 1876 and 1905, and contained 
     <lb/>
     in the third paragraph the statement that the new 
     <lb/>
     Letters Patent "would provide for the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of the said Island, until such time, as it may 
     <lb/>
     become self-supporting again", and was a natural 
     <lb/>
     sequel to the 1933 Act which declared that when 
     <lb/>
     the country was self-supporting again and <hi rendition="simple:italic">on 
     <lb/>
     request of the people</hi>, responsible government 
     <lb/>
     would be restored. On this celebrated occasion 
     <lb/>
     Governor Anderson, who opened the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, said in part: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>

            <p>
     We recognise the courageous spirit of 
     <lb/>

     country's recovery to <hi rendition="simple:italic">accept a suspension of

     <lb/>
     could be no better augury for the success of

     the new form of constitution. The object of 
     <lb/>
     the Letters Patent now proclaimed is to pro<lb break="no"/>vide for such time as may be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     enable it to become self-supporting again. 
     <lb/>
     We hope and believe <hi rendition="simple:italic">that the result will be to 
     <lb/>
     place its affairs upon so firm and sound a

     difficulties</hi> will be well-nigh impossible.<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref>

            <p>Thus spoke the Dominions Secretary. The 
     <lb/>Hon. F.C. Alderdice, ex-Prime Minister, on that

            <p>I ask you to contemplate just for a moment or two, 
     <lb/>just how far, and to what extent, subsequent 
     <lb/>events and history came up to such high hopes

            <p>
     That, Mr. Chairman, was 1934. I had a lack of 
     <lb/>
     understanding then. But to resume my case his<lb break="no"/>tory. Failing a job that year, I got the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of attending the Memorial College, and a new 
     <lb/>
     phase in the education of a Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     began. I studied economics and political science 
     <lb/>
     amongst other things, and for the first time in my 
     <lb/>
     17 years I began to develop an interest in the 
     <lb/>
     history of my own country and the story of our 
     <lb/>
     people. I read books which I did not know had 
     <lb/>
     been written, and learned of men whom I did not 
     <lb/>
     know had existed, and of deeds and events I was 
     <lb/>
     not aware had ever occurred in the very city I had 
     <lb/>
     grown up in, and the many places that were 
     <lb/>
     familiar only on the map during the day's lesson 
     <lb/>
     in geography. And there grew in me, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, a slow, impotent rage; to realise that what I 
     <lb/>
     witnessed and read of February 22, 1934, was not 
     <lb/>
     something that had occurred to meet an emergen<lb break="no"/>cy of a moment, but was in actual historical fact 
     <lb/>
     the culmination of a process that covered cen<lb break="no"/>turies, and was as calculated and as ruthless as it 
     <lb/>
     could be, having regard to the various periods of 
     <lb/>
     history, and the sense of values that each genera<lb break="no"/>tion of men and their governments had lived by. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, it would take all the time that 
     <lb/>
     is alloted to this entire debate, even to outline the 
     <lb/>
     cruel and bitter story of this island's history and 
     <lb/>
     its steadfast growth in the face of the most im<lb break="no"/>placable obstacles that any white colonial people 
     <lb/>
     of the British Empire has had strewn in its way 
     <lb/>
     towards progress and fulfillment. "The visitors 
     <lb/>
     who came and went" says one authority,

     like tides and winds, and who embodied the 
     <lb/>
     very spirit of mutability and anarchy, had the 
     <lb/>
     first century to themselves. Their being alter<lb break="no"/>nated with not-being; they lived like seals 

            <cb/>
       

     and thought like geologists; to them New<lb break="no"/>foundland was little more than a sunken fish<lb break="no"/>ing bank with a dry top here and there, and 
     <lb/>
     they left indelible traces of their genius on the 
     <lb/>
     place. During the next century a few small 
     <lb/>
     groups of settlers arrived who were imbued 
     <lb/>
     with the ideas of permanence, home and 
     <lb/>
     order, but they were overshadowed by the 
     <lb/>
     influences which were already there .... Time

     <lb/>
     given at the close of the second century, but 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the third century the visitors 
     <lb/>
     became so unimportant, and the settlers so 
     <lb/>
     numerous, that it was at last unanimously 
     <lb/>
     recognised that Newfoundland, instead of 
     <lb/>
     being half colony and half fishing bank, was 
     <lb/>
     a whole colony like other colonies, and with 
     <lb/>
     a destiny of its own. The final recognition of 
     <lb/>
     this fact ushered in the fourth century of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. The wheels of the chariot of 
     <lb/>
     history moved very slowly as though tor<lb break="no"/>toises were in the shafts, and it took three 
     <lb/>

            <p>There in a nutshell, in the words of J.D. Rogers, 
     <lb/>is the history of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the records the history of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     began in 1497, when the history of North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica also began. But in the actual fact, the history 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland as a country beginning to go 
     <lb/>
     somewhere of its own, made its first feeble steps 
     <lb/>
     with the granting of representative government in 
     <lb/>
     1832, and its first real strides after the granting of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government in 1855. It cannot be 
     <lb/>
     repeated too often, the condition of New<lb break="no"/>foundland up to the 1850s — the middle of the 
     <lb/>
     last century, just about 100 years ago — because 
     <lb/>
     no man, woman or child can fully appreciate or 
     <lb/>
     realise what happened in 1934 without that 
     <lb/>
     knowledge. The island was a wilderness. It had 
     <lb/>
     no roads, no communications of any kind. Its 
     <lb/>
     population, just beginning to grow after centuries 
     <lb/>
     in which settlement was forbidden, had only 
     <lb/>
     reached a figure of some 70-80,000. It was only 
     <lb/>
     a little over 20 years since the first white man had 
     <lb/>
     crossed the island from east to west, and brought

     back some knowledge of the interior and the 
     <lb/>
     wealth it contained.<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> Then in 1855 Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers were given responsible government — 
     <lb/>
     but I shouldn't say they were given it — no, rather 
     <lb/>
     that they won it, which they did. Now if ever a 
     <lb/>
     people were politically immature, they were that. 
     <lb/>
     They had barely 20 years of representative 
     <lb/>
     government, since l832, that Nova Scotia had 
     <lb/>
     had since 1758, Prince Edward Island since 1769, 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick since 1784, Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada since 1791. And the granting of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government to these other British North 
     <lb/>
     American colonies had come anywhere from six 
     <lb/>
     to 14 years before Newfoundland. The New<lb break="no"/>foundland people in 1855 had had less than 25 
     <lb/>
     years to prepare for mastership in their own 
     <lb/>
     house, full self-government for which those 
     <lb/>
     others had been preparing for 60 to 80 years. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders began self-government with 
     <lb/>
     two strikes on them, as we say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But they had the stuff. They were no better, no 
     <lb/>
     worse than their neighbours, even though the 
     <lb/>
     system of education which had been slowly and 
     <lb/>
     painfully built up by the various denominations 
     <lb/>
     had its beginnings early in the 19th century, little 
     <lb/>
     more than 100 years ago. On the other hand, in 
     <lb/>
     the neighbouring provinces of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, and in the new republic of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, schools, colleges and even universities 
     <lb/>
     had been in existence, from the middle of the 17th 
     <lb/>
     century onwards, permitted by law and en<lb break="no"/>couraged, as they were forbidden and dis<lb break="no"/>couraged in this island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And then, Mr. Chairman, even when respon<lb break="no"/>sible government was granted, it was not at all 
     <lb/>
     that complete and full authority some of us 
     <lb/>
     believe it was. Actually Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     never quite free; never wholly independent. 
     <lb/>
     Hence the pages of our history contain episode 
     <lb/>
     after episode of struggle between the oldest 
     <lb/>
     colony and the mother country, principally over 
     <lb/>
     fishery rights, which were a bone of contention, 
     <lb/>
     not only between England and France (witness 
     <lb/>
     the French Shore), but between England and the 
     <lb/>
     United States as well. There are dozens of instan<lb break="no"/>ces, great events in our story, that recount how 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's political leaders went as delega<lb break="no"/>tions of a sovereign people to London, to Ottawa, 


            <cb/>
        

     to Halifax and to Washington, and by sheer per<lb break="no"/>sistence and dogged courage buttressed by 
     <lb/>
     shrewd and farseeing minds, gradually weakened 
     <lb/>
     and finally broke these outside controls on our 
     <lb/>
     country and its people, till in 1904 the French 
     <lb/>
     were gone, and in 1910 the Americans withdrew 
     <lb/>
     — 1904, 1910, only yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I did not propose when I set out 
     <lb/>
     to speak on this motion to give the Convention or 
     <lb/>
     the country a history lesson. But it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that without a study, even a cursory one, of that 
     <lb/>
     history, none of us can properly assess just what 
     <lb/>
     our maligned responsible governments did for 
     <lb/>
     this country. As I said at the beginning, our 
     <lb/>
     collapse of 1934 was deeply rooted in the facts 
     <lb/>
     of that history. As I pointed out the other day, the 
     <lb/>
     commission form of government was suggested 
     <lb/>
     for this country in 1895, when she was in finan<lb break="no"/>cial straits after the bank crash. But the men of 
     <lb/>
     that time were made of sterner stuff; they rose to 
     <lb/>
     the occasion, and Newfoundland weathered the 
     <lb/>
     storm and went on to the 20th century and an age 
     <lb/>
     of new and greater development. Although we 
     <lb/>
     are still very close to the events of 1933 and 1934, 
     <lb/>
     it is fair to admit, and has been admitted in many 
     <lb/>
     responsible quarters, that Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     asked to pay too high a price for her solvency. 
     <lb/>
     Professor Harold Innis, author of <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Cod

     The decline of bankruptcy as a method of

     These words, written in 1940 of the events of 
     <lb/>
     1933-34, are full of portent today, as a more huge

     But getting back to my case history Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man. I studied the story of Newfoundland, and I 
     <lb/>
     drew my own conclusions. So much so that in 
     <lb/>
     1943, when I made my first public address — a 
     <lb/>
     toast to Newfoundland — the sum and substance 
     <lb/>
     of my belief was contained in one sentence; that 
     <lb/>
     as far as I was concerned, "the miracle of New<lb break="no"/>foundland was not that so little had been done 
     <lb/>
     here, but so much." The Amulree Report, with its 
     <lb/>
     condemnation of our public men, became the 
     <lb/>
     textbook of all those whose intention, deliberate 
     <lb/>
     or otherwise, was to damn with faint praise all 
     <lb/>
     responsible governments of Newfoundland be<lb break="no"/>cause it was the fashion. I think the attitudes of 
     <lb/>
     many Newfoundlanders to our former public 
     <lb/>
     men, especially those who should have known 
     <lb/>
     better, can be best summed up in a portion of the 
     <lb/>
     Gospel according to St. John: "They shall put you 
     <lb/>
     out of the synagogues; yea, the hour cometh, that 
     <lb/>
     whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth a 
     <lb/>
     service to God." And my own attitude on the 
     <lb/>
     radio, six times a week as Mr. Smallwood did 
     <lb/>
     before me, is contained in the two verses that 
     <lb/>
     immediately precede that portion I have quoted: 
     <lb/>
     "He shall give testimony of me; and you shall 
     <lb/>
     give testimony, because you are with me from the 
     <lb/>
     beginning. These things I have spoken to you, 
     <lb/>
     that you may not be scandalised." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No, Mr. Chairman, there was no excuse for the 
     <lb/>
     suspension of responsible government in this 
     <lb/>
     country. No method of cure could be as drastic as 
     <lb/>
     that for whatever ills beset us. They cut the legs 
     <lb/>
     from under us and still expected us to walk and 
     <lb/>
     to advance. If one could strain a point and find an 
     <lb/>
     excuse for the suspension of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment it might lie perhaps in the words of Com<lb break="no"/>missioner Lodge, just quoted: "To have assumed 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for the good government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland out of altruistic motives and to have 
     <lb/>
     achieved economic rehabilitation might have 
     <lb/>
     cost the British taxpayer a few millions. It would, 
  

            <cb/>
         

     however, have added to the prestige of the British 
     <lb/>
     Empire." But that did not happen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What did happen? From 1934 to 1940 this 
     <lb/>
     country, this people, suffered privation the like of 
     <lb/>
     which was never known in her history. I was a 
     <lb/>
     civil servant from 1937 to 1941, in the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Public Health and Welfare. Every day 
     <lb/>
     there passed through my hands, as through the 
     <lb/>
     hands of many others, the harrowing story of the 
     <lb/>
     misery, distress, sickness and death; the Geth<lb break="no"/>semane, as someone already has said in here, of 
     <lb/>
     an entire people. I say there was a reason, too, for 
     <lb/>
     that — the absence of our traditional democratic 
     <lb/>
     institutions. Do you expect me to believe, that 
     <lb/>
     had Newfoundland retained the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     system of responsible government that this 
     <lb/>
     country would have had to wallow in squalor and 
     <lb/>
     despair until a war brought unheard-of wealth to 
     <lb/>
     the island? Do you really believe that New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders elected by their fellow-New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders would sit indifferent to the cries and 
     <lb/>
     demands of the electorate? Do you think they 
     <lb/>
     would give away parts of our territory for 99 
     <lb/>
     years, without seeking and demanding something 
     <lb/>
     in return? But there is no need to go on, you know 
     <lb/>
     the answer as well as I do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I fully agree with Mr. Smallwood, that Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government is not a right or per<lb break="no"/>manent form of government for the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country; but I cannot agree that responsible 
     <lb/>
     government is so full of the doom and disaster 
     <lb/>
     that he now so ardently declares it will be for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. In 1934 Mr. Smallwood was 
     <lb/>
     older than I am now, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Who's Who</hi> of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland declares with respect to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, that he was an ardent supporter of 
     <lb/>
     the commission form of government in the first 
     <lb/>
     few years of its career. Thereafter he realised his 
     <lb/>
     error and become one of its stoutest opponents, 
     <lb/>
     and as has been pointed out, up to a few years ago, 
     <lb/>
     was the most redoubtable protagonist and booster 
     <lb/>
     of the return of Newfoundland to responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. I honestly believe that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood in that role did more than most people 
     <lb/>
     to create the vague stirrings for national inde<lb break="no"/>pendence which in recent years developed to a 
     <lb/>
     strong demand in many sections of the island. 
     <lb/>
     Surely, it seems fair to ask, why wasn't union 
     <lb/>
     with another country suggested then either by Mr.

     control of their own affairs to whatever peoples 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders to retain the present dictatorial

     Mr. Job's question, that the commission form 
     <lb/>
     may not yet appear on the ballot paper; or that a 
     <lb/>
     statement of Great Britain's inability to finance 
     <lb/>
     the system may be issued coincident with the 
     <lb/>
     holding of the referendum. I think it is also right 
     <lb/>
     to point out that at the present time the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government does not hold office by the 
     <lb/>
     will of the people. However, if at the referendum 
     <lb/>
     it should be voted into power, it would then be in 
     <lb/>
     the position of a popular legislature, of a kind, 
     <lb/>
     and possessed of the authority to put this country 
     <lb/>
     into union with another country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The foundation for the presumed solid en<lb break="no"/>trenchment of the Commission government in 
     <lb/>
     our midst is the argument that they have extended 
     <lb/>
     our social services That, it would seem, is the 
     <lb/>
     only argument. Yet, as I have pointed out, this 
     <lb/>
     was not commenced in actuality until 1941, and 
     <lb/>
     the various reports of the committees of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention which went thoroughly into these 
     <lb/>
     matters, all indicate that up to 1941 the policy was 
     <lb/>
     to make both ends meet and no more, and that all 
     <lb/>
     extensions of such services were coincident with 
     <lb/>
     the influx of money from the United States and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere. So their achievement is that they spent 
     <lb/>
     money, a lot of money, since 1941. It is fair to 
     <lb/>
     draw the conclusion, based on their policy of the 
     <lb/>
     years from 1934 to 1941, that but for the war that 
     <lb/>
     money would not have been spent, because they 
     <lb/>
     would not have had it to spend. When that money 
     <lb/>
     is all gone, as it will be very soon at the present 
     <lb/>
     rate of spending, what can we in this country 
     <lb/>
     expect? Surely we do not believe that Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, a rich country before the war, which 

            <cb/>
       

     could only allow the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     enough money to pay the interest to the British 
     <lb/>
     bondholders while Newfoundland itself balanced 
     <lb/>
     its own accounts out of its own revenues, surely 
     <lb/>
     we do not believe that Great Britain, a country in 
     <lb/>
     dire straits after the war, can give us financial aid 
     <lb/>
     to support the present system of government and 
     <lb/>
     the services which we will be expected to main<lb break="no"/>tain? Of course we don't! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What then? This Convention has now reached 
     <lb/>
     the end of its deliberations. A few days ago the 
     <lb/>final and conclusive Report of the Finance Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on the Economic Position of New<lb break="no"/>foundland was adopted unanimously by the 
     <lb/>members, thus acknowledging that the country is 
     <lb/>self-supporting, and has been for several years, 
     <lb/>and is likely to remain so in the forseeable future 
     <lb/>— for three years at least. On that basis the 
     <lb/>present resolution is before the Chair: "Be it 
     <lb/>therefore resolved that this Convention recom<lb break="no"/>mend to the United Kingdom government that 
     <lb/>the wishes of the people of Newfoundland should 
     <lb/>be ascertained at the earliest moment as to 
     <lb/>whether they wish to return to the form of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government or retain the present form of 
     <lb/>Commission of Government", or words to that 
     <lb/>effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I intend to vote for this resolution, as I believe 
     <lb/>
     most, if not all of the delegates here will do also. 
     <lb/>
     But I want to make it quite clear that I am voting 
     <lb/>
     for this resolution because it is the only thing I 
     <lb/>
     can do. The 1933 Act says that responsible 
     <lb/>
     government on the request of the people will be 
     <lb/>
     restored. That is, the people must express their 
     <lb/>
     desire for its return, as against a desire to retain 
     <lb/>
     the present Commission. Since they have not as 
     <lb/>
     yet in any concrete form expressed that desire, 
     <lb/>
     they will be given a referendum; the matter will 
     <lb/>
     be referred to them for their decision. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to make it quite clear and have it go in 
     <lb/>
     the record, Mr. Chairman, in case it's not already 
     <lb/>
     clear, that I am not in favour of the commission 
     <lb/>
     system. I never was, long before I came to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. It was repugnant to me, because of 
     <lb/>
     the things I had learned and come to understand. 
     <lb/>
     It would be false to all the beliefs and ideals I have 
     <lb/>
     ever held or followed, if I were to recommend its 
     <lb/>
     retention to our people in this crisis, as we stand 
     <lb/>
     in the open doorway of a beckoning and wonder<lb break="no"/>ful future. I have stated on every occasion that 
     <lb/>
     constitutional matters were discussed in this Con<lb break="no"/>

     vention that the main choice we as a people have 
     <lb/>
     to make is this: "Do we want to be governed by 
     <lb/>
     others, or do we want to govern ourselves?" If we 
     <lb/>
     decide we want to govern ourselves, then the way 
     <lb/>
     lies open at any future date, if we are so minded, 
     <lb/>
     to enter into union with one of the larger countries 
     <lb/>
     to the west of us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not agree with the opinion expressed in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention that people don't care what kind 
     <lb/>
     of government they have, so long as they have a 
     <lb/>
     full belly. I know that isn't true; it is in opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the history of mankind. Economic freedom 
     <lb/>
     does not come before political freedom, it is the 
     <lb/>
     other way about. Today all over the world, politi<lb break="no"/>cal freedom is the goal of all men — white, 
     <lb/>
     yellow and black. Are we to be any less than 
     <lb/>
     those? We, who for our size and population are 
     <lb/>
     in an economic and strategic position today that 
     <lb/>
     many peoples can truly envy? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I made the statement that Newfound<lb break="no"/>land was never quite free, never wholly inde<lb break="no"/>pendent. What did I mean by this? Simply that 
     <lb/>
     while Newfoundland was theoretically under 
     <lb/>
     responsible government managing her own af<lb break="no"/>fairs, in reality, in the last analysis, Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     had the final say on any matters affecting the 
     <lb/>
     extra-territorial activities of this country. Hence, 
     <lb/>
     amongst other things, the blocking of the Bond- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Blaine reciprocity treaty, when Canada went over 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's head to Great Britain, with the 
     <lb/>
     known results. Things have greatly changed 
     <lb/>
     since then, and there is in existence what is 
     <lb/>
     known as the Statute of Westminster, enacted in 
     <lb/>
     1931 in relation to the dominions, of which New<lb break="no"/>foundland was one in 1931, and still is, though 
     <lb/>
     with suspended status, as you yourself, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman have written in an excellent article 
     <lb/>
     published some years ago in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Book of New<lb break="no"/>foundland</hi>, edited by Mr. Smallwood.<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> I have just 
     <lb/>
     been reading a very good book on the Statute of 
     <lb/>
     Westminister and its application to the various 
     <lb/>
     dominions, including Newfoundland, written by 
     <lb/>
     no less a person than our mutual friend and 
     <lb/>
     former constitutional expert to this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     Professor K.C, Wheare, whose whereabouts are 
     <lb/>
     still something of a mystery to most of us.<ref target="#fn_08">[2]</ref> Now 
     <lb/>
     it would appear that in the interval between the 
     <lb/>
     conference of 1930 and the introduction of the 
 

            <cb/>
         

     Statute of Westminister into the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, Newfoundland requested the insertion of 
     <lb/>
     a clause postponing the application of sections 2 
     <lb/>
     - 6 of the statute to Newfoundland until its par<lb break="no"/>liament adopted any or all of these sections. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion 3 of these postponed clauses reads as 
     <lb/>
     follows: "3. it is hereby declared and enacted that 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to 
     <lb/>
     make laws having extra-territorial operation." 
     <lb/>
     That means, as I understand it, that if a respon<lb break="no"/>sible government of Newfoundland passed in its 
     <lb/>
     legislature that section of the Statute of 
     <lb/>
     Westminster, by and with the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     people, it could then be free to negotiate a trade 
     <lb/>
     or other agreement, a reciprocity treaty on the 
     <lb/>
     lines of the Bond-Blaine treaty, and there could 
     <lb/>
     be no interference by Britain, or by Canada through 
     <lb/>
     Britain. That is the clue to our future solution of our 
     <lb/>
     trade relations with the United States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the position of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government with relation to the Statute of 
     <lb/>
     Westminster is worth noting: 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     In the new constitution, issued in letters 
     <lb/>
     patent under the authority of this act, the 
     <lb/>
     former bicameral parliament of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land was abolished, and power to make laws 
     <lb/>
     for the peace, welfare, and good government 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland was transferred to the 
     <lb/>
     Governor, acting with the advice and consent 
     <lb/>
     of the Commission of Government. But al<lb break="no"/>though the Governor and Commission were 
     <lb/>
     empowered to amend, add to, or repeal any

     to be deemed to possess all the powers of that 
     <lb/>
     legislature, nor were they described as a 
     <lb/>
     legislature or parliament. It may be argued 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that no parliament exists to exer<lb break="no"/>cise the powers conferred by the Statute of

     Westminister upon 'the Parliament of a

     2 - 6 of the Statute is impossible so long as 
     <lb/>
     this system of government by commission 
     <lb/>
     exists. In law Newfoundland would appear to 
     <lb/>
     be a dominion still (though in name only), 
     <lb/>
     since section 1 of the statute extends to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and has not been amended to omit 
     <lb/>
     the name of Newfoundland, and section 11,

            <p>
     Therefore, in voting as I will on this resolution 
     <lb/>
     to give our Newfoundland people and ourselves 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity of choosing between the present 
     <lb/>
     system of benevolent dictatorship, and a return to 
     <lb/>
     control of our own affairs, a return to self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I would ask them to note what I have said 
     <lb/>
     about the Statute of Westminster; and would 
     <lb/>
     urge, though it scarcely needs urging, that if this 
     <lb/>
     country elects to run its own affairs again, that it 
     <lb/>
     insist of its leaders that the Newfoundland parlia<lb break="no"/>ment adopt the postponed sections of the Statute 
     <lb/>
     of Westminster, particularly section 3, which will 
     <lb/>
     give us the necessary full control and inde<lb break="no"/>pendence to deal with the USA, towards which 
     <lb/>
     the hopes of our people have gradually turned as 
     <lb/>
     the solution to whatever economic difficulties we 
     <lb/>
     have had or may have in the years ahead. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like to say 
     <lb/>
     first that I am heartily in support of the motion 
     <lb/>
     before this House. To my way of thinking, and 
     <lb/>
     supported by the facts which I have been able to 
     <lb/>
     acquire during the long session of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, I cannot help but feel that the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country should first be given the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     having restored to them their own right to free 
     <lb/>
     democratic government of themselves and by 
     <lb/>
     themselves; and this principle should, I feel, be 
     <lb/>
     adopted whatever the circumstances may be. As 
     <lb/>
     it happens, this National Convention has unani<lb break="no"/>mously found this country of ours to be self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting and the previous Commissioner for 
     <lb/>
     Finance, Mr. Wild, stated also that New<lb break="no"/>foundland was self-supporting; but even in the 
     <lb/>
     event of their not being so, I have come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that this should be the first step in any 
     <lb/>
     reformation of our political and economic affairs. 
     <lb/>
     I say that I have come to this conclusion by facts 
     <lb/>
     and other material considerations that I have been 
     <lb/>
     able to acquire and carefully study since the 
     <lb/>
     opening of this Convention. It has been proven to 
     <lb/>
     my own satisfaction that a country can only 
     <lb/>
     decide its own future, both securely and safely, 
     <lb/>
     through its own government elected by and with 
     <lb/>
     the support of the people. It has been obvious to 
     <lb/>
     me in recent months, the hopelessness of en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to find so-called security through 


            <cb/>
         

     methods so undemocratic and so futile of any real 
     <lb/>
     success — so helpless in the hands-tied-behind- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     the-back approach. Neither can our present form 
     <lb/>
     of government, however well or poorly they have 
     <lb/>
     governed, find a solution to our country's future. 
     <lb/>
     They are not our representatives in our sense of 
     <lb/>
     the word. Better it be that we decide our own 
     <lb/>
     future through our own elected government, even 
     <lb/>
     with the unavoidable ups and downs, and remain 
     <lb/>
     a people happy in the knowledge that we are our 
     <lb/>
     own masters and command our own destiny. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, this Nation<lb break="no"/>al Convention at the outset appointed committees 
     <lb/>
     ... and after the completion of the work by the 
     <lb/>
     several committees, each report was brought 
     <lb/>
     before the full Convention and debated and ques<lb break="no"/>tioned in what I would consider a very thorough 
     <lb/>
     manner. To the members of this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     politically and governmentally blindfolded for 
     <lb/>
     some 12 years, these reports were undoubtedly of 
     <lb/>
     great benefit in helping them assess the present 
     <lb/>
     economic position of our country, as well as 
     <lb/>
     providing them with some foresight of at least the 
     <lb/>
     near future, which in this upset world today 
     <lb/>
     would not be possible in a great many countries. 
     <lb/>
     I consider that the Finance Committee's report 
     <lb/>
     was really in substance a summary and factual 
     <lb/>
     finding of the remainder of the reports, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly so was their report on the economic 
     <lb/>
     position of Newfoundland, which clearly indi<lb break="no"/>cated what the people of this country could ex<lb break="no"/>pect and realise in what was quite rightly called 
     <lb/>
     the "foreseeable future". It has been clearly 
     <lb/>
     shown to me that this country is economically 
     <lb/>
     sound, self-supporting, and in a better position 
     <lb/>
     today than it has ever been in its history, and I 
     <lb/>
     doubt if there is a country in the world that can 
     <lb/>
     compare in this respect to Newfoundland. Our 
     <lb/>
     basic industries are in a much more sound, diver<lb break="no"/>sified and better economic position to face the 
     <lb/>
     future than they were before the war and, for that 
     <lb/>
     matter, any previous period in our history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Briefly, sir, our fisheries, still the main in<lb break="no"/>dustry of this country, have made great and rapid 
     <lb/>
     strides of improvement, and are stronger than 
     <lb/>
     ever. The foundation of the fishing industry is 
     <lb/>
     today more solid than at any time in our history. 
     <lb/>
     The saltfish branch has been greatly improved by 
     <lb/>
     useful help in production and curing, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly so in the standard of pack for each 
     <lb/>
     market, which has made such a great impression 


            <pb n="1261" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-20_Page_1261.jpg"/>

     on the buyers in our foreign markets and which 
     <lb/>
     is accounted for by the compulsory inspection of 
     <lb/>
     all grades including even the inferior and West 
     <lb/>
     Indian qualities. The marketing system has 
     <lb/>
     gradually become one of the finest, and has now 
     <lb/>
     brought the control and selling under one organ<lb break="no"/>isation, which works in conjunction with our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Fisheries Board. The result has 
     <lb/>
     put us away ahead of our Canadian competitors 
     <lb/>
     both in our more diversified marketing and our 
     <lb/>
     selling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I mention these few facts to show the advan<lb break="no"/>cement made in this branch of the industry, and 
     <lb/>
     so that our people can realise that we have today 
     <lb/>
     a more solid and closely-knit operation of this 
     <lb/>
     part of our primary industry. The development of 
     <lb/>
     the cold storage division of the fisheries, covering 
     <lb/>
     our fresh processing and filletting methods, is 
     <lb/>
     only now in its infancy, but has rapidly developed 
     <lb/>
     in the short period in which it has been operating. 
     <lb/>
     The investment of local capital monies in this 
     <lb/>
     branch of the fisheries has been tremendous, and 
     <lb/>
     with the recent acquisition of two new trawlers 
     <lb/>
     from the USA, is still further providing proof of 
     <lb/>
     improvement in our fishing methods, as well as 
     <lb/>
     increasing our production of not only codfish, but 
     <lb/>
     of many other kinds which are in demand in our 
     <lb/>
     fresh frozen fish markets. New developments of 
     <lb/>
     recent years are the fish reduction plants, such as 
     <lb/>
     the herring oil and meal plant at Curling, and the 
     <lb/>
     one in course of construction at Belleoram. Here 
     <lb/>
     again we have a new source of national produc<lb break="no"/>tion which bids fair to become a big factor in the 
     <lb/>
     economic future. Increased and improved 
     <lb/>
     methods of whaling have added to our volume 
     <lb/>
     and value of exports. There is canning of fresh 
     <lb/>
     codfish at Fogo and the new proposed plant at 
     <lb/>
     Bay Bulls, and the new herring and mackerel 
     <lb/>
     canning plant at Petries in Bay of Islands. These 
     <lb/>
     adventures are all of but a few years of age, and 
     <lb/>
     are extra developments and additional sources of 
     <lb/>
     income to our producers that we did not have 
     <lb/>
     prior to 1939. We live by what we produce and 
     <lb/>
     export, and these additional industries make our 
     <lb/>
     economy more solid than ever before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our paper industry, likewise, has not stood 
     <lb/>
     still. The addition of a sulphite plant in Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook, together with a large, estimated $12 mil<lb break="no"/>lion extension to the paper mill at the same place, 
     <lb/>
     will provide labour and income for a great many 
     <lb/>
     more of our people than for any time in our 
 

            <cb/>
        

     history. There is talk of another paper mill on our 
     <lb/>
     southwest coast. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, add all these factors together, 
     <lb/>
     and you get a brighter, sounder and more solid 
     <lb/>
     basis for an economic future for this New<lb break="no"/>foundland of ours. As you will realise, not only 
     <lb/>
     will those directly employed in these industries 
     <lb/>
     derive benefits, but the country generally and the 
     <lb/>
     people in it will share in any prosperity derived 
     <lb/>
     from our basic producing industries. There must 
     <lb/>
     be the ups and downs which every country and 
     <lb/>
     every nation must experience, but we were never 
     <lb/>
     better equipped to face the future than we are in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Financially, this country has enjoyed pros<lb break="no"/>perity to an extent that has never been known 
     <lb/>
     before, to us or our forefathers. One has only to 
     <lb/>
     refer to the Report of the Finance Committee and 
     <lb/>
     particularly to their report on the economic posi<lb break="no"/>tion of Newfoundland. Last November, I ex<lb break="no"/>pressed my opinion on this question of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's finances and its future and gave 
     <lb/>
     my reasons, together with figures; and I feel 
     <lb/>
     strongly that we have a promising, hopeful and, 
     <lb/>
     above all, a sound future as far as one may care 
     <lb/>
     to see in this world; and that is as much or more 
     <lb/>
     as can be said for any other country. If time 
     <lb/>
     permitted I could considerably add to and enlarge 
     <lb/>
     on these brief points which I have just covered. 
     <lb/>
     How any man in this country which has been 
     <lb/>
     known for its love of independence and re<lb break="no"/>sourcefulness, could fear the future under the 
     <lb/>
     improved economy and advancement in our in<lb break="no"/>dustries, is more than I can contemplate. We have 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity that never knocked at the doors of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland before. And if we do not avail of 
     <lb/>
     this opportunity now to speak for ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     govern ourselves, and be responsible only to our<lb break="no"/>selves, we will have failed in the greatest moment 
     <lb/>
     in that proud history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In so speaking, and in making a recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion to the people of this country that they should 
     <lb/>
     use the God-given right to restore to themselves 
     <lb/>
     the responsible government which is and should 
     <lb/>
     be ours by right, I would like to explain that once 
     <lb/>
     we can attain this natural status belonging to 
     <lb/>
     every country, we are then in a position to ap<lb break="no"/>proach or negotiate with any country we may so 
     <lb/>
     desire, to further our interests with them through 
     <lb/>
     and by our own elected government, and through 
     <lb/>
     which there is no better method of arriving at

     international conclusions or results. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In mentioning this I have a particular aspect 
     <lb/>
     of our future in mind. I am convinced that our 
     <lb/>
     economic future, or some security of it, lies with 
     <lb/>
     the USA. I say this for obvious reasons. The USA 
     <lb/>
     is one of the largest purchasers of our products, 
     <lb/>
     particularly of our newsprint and fish products. 
     <lb/>
     The USA, in turn, can supply practically all, if 
     <lb/>
     not all of our requirements. The USA is the most 
     <lb/>
     powerful and richest country in this world. There 
     <lb/>
     is still a tremendously large undeveloped market 
     <lb/>
     in that country for our products, a market that, if 
     <lb/>
     assisted by an economic union with the United 
     <lb/>
     States (under which there would be reciprocal 
     <lb/>
     arrangements), might mean unlooked-for 
     <lb/>
     developments of our industries, particularly 
     <lb/>
     processed fish of various kinds, a development 
     <lb/>
     that could mean much to our country. We could 
     <lb/>
     buy a lot more needed goods from that great 
     <lb/>
     country in return. We have the Americans here 
     <lb/>
     now in the bases they have established, and in 
     <lb/>
     return for a beneficial arrangement with them, I 
     <lb/>
     see no reason why these bases and facilities could 
     <lb/>
     not be further extended, thereby providing an 
     <lb/>
     increased volume of employment for some of our 
     <lb/>
     people, and in return giving to the US a more 
     <lb/>
     beneficial defence system and a less restricted 
     <lb/>
     action in the planning of defences, which would 
     <lb/>
     be to our advantage as much as to theirs. This 
     <lb/>
     would be a negotiated agreement, only possible 
     <lb/>
     through a government of Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     elected by the people. In addition to the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of an economic tie-up with the US, I 
     <lb/>
     believe it would be possible to re-open discussion 
     <lb/>
     on the question of the present bases which they 
     <lb/>
     have in Newfoundland today. It is impossible for 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government to do this, as 
     <lb/>
     they, through the British government, signed the 
     <lb/>
     original bases agreement and to them the matter 
     <lb/>
     is closed. Our own government would, however, 
     <lb/>
     be in a position to ask the consideration of the US 
     <lb/>
     to the question of discussion between them and 
     <lb/>
     our own elected government on the matter. I have 
     <lb/>
     reason to believe that Newfoundland, through a 
     <lb/>
     government of the country, would receive a sym<lb break="no"/>pathetic hearing, and in the light of our desire to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate an economic union, and to further offer 
     <lb/>
     them extension of or increases in bases, it is not 
     <lb/>
     beyond the bounds of possibility that we could 
     <lb/>
     secure some yearly rental for the bases now al<lb break="no"/>ready occupied. Even a rental small to them 
 

            <cb/>
         

     would be of no small assistance to us. The USA 
     <lb/>
     does not have to re-open the question of the 
     <lb/>
     leases, but I believe that there is a great possibility 
     <lb/>
     of their so doing, for the reasons I have just 
     <lb/>
     mentioned. Some members will endeavour to tell 
     <lb/>
     you that this suggested economic union is not 
     <lb/>
     possible, because the USA has favoured-nation 
     <lb/>
     treaties, whereby any facilities or benefits in 
     <lb/>
     duties or import restrictions of goods going into 
     <lb/>
     their country, must be offered to these other 
     <lb/>
     nations, on the same basis as negotiations might 
     <lb/>
     be concluded with us. That might have been true 
     <lb/>
     not only in fact, but in effect in 1939 and prior to 
     <lb/>
     that year. Today, conditions and world problems 
     <lb/>
     are different from those of prewar days. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's strategic position, while per<lb break="no"/>haps realised, has never been acknowledged so 
     <lb/>
     openly as today. The advancement in war tactics 
     <lb/>
     as well as the discovery of such terrible weapons 
     <lb/>
     as the atom bomb, have made not only the USA 
     <lb/>
     but every country extremely conscious of their 
     <lb/>
     vulnerability, and the USA has realised and ap<lb break="no"/>preciated this fact for some time. Consequently 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, in its geographical position, is of 
     <lb/>
     tremendous importance to North America. This 
     <lb/>
     factor has changed the conditions of 1939 and 
     <lb/>
     prior to that, and for that reason alone they might 
     <lb/>
     very well consider, and be anxious to do so, the 
     <lb/>
     question of an economic arrangement with this 
     <lb/>
     country. There is no need for me to further outline 
     <lb/>
     the benefits to our industries, both in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the Labrador, that could well 
     <lb/>
     materialise from such a union with America, if 
     <lb/>
     we had a government of our own to make the 
     <lb/>
     negotiations, as the USA could not enter into 
     <lb/>
     these discussions until such time as the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country have responsible government res<lb break="no"/>tored to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before concluding, I would like to tell you, in 
     <lb/>
     addition to the above benefits of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, the form and the type of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government I would like to support. I realise that 
     <lb/>
     many fear, perhaps, a return to a similar type of 
     <lb/>
     government which they experienced in earlier 
     <lb/>
     years. I consider that a responsible government 
     <lb/>
     should consist of say, 16 or 18 members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That would not be possible, un<lb break="no"/>less the redistribution of 1933 were amended. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> We do not need and do not want 
     <lb/>
     any government of 40 or 45 members such as we 
     <lb/>
     had in the past. The large number of members 
  

            <pb n="1263" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-20_Page_1263.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1263</fw>
         

     was added expense, was not needed, and in fact 
     <lb/>
     was not wanted. I believe in the minimum num<lb break="no"/>ber required. The next step then, would be to set 
     <lb/>
     up a somewhat different system of operating the 
     <lb/>
     government from that which we had prior to 
     <lb/>
     1933. The first step would be to set up a civil 
     <lb/>
     service commission composed of, say, three to 
     <lb/>
     five members who would be independent 
     <lb/>
     citizens, with no political attachments; obviously 
     <lb/>
     they could not be a member of or connected in 
     <lb/>
     any way with either the government or any op<lb break="no"/>position party. The function or duties of this 
     <lb/>
     commission would be the governing of the civil 
     <lb/>
     service. In consultation with the ministers and 
     <lb/>
     department heads of the various branches, they 
     <lb/>
     would re-organise, where necessary, the work<lb break="no"/>ings of the departments, decide on the examina<lb break="no"/>tions necessary to enter the service, the 
     <lb/>
     remuneration, the pension systems, and the 
     <lb/>
     employment and discharging of civil servants 
     <lb/>
     through their departmental heads, which would 
     <lb/>
     remove once and for all that political association 
     <lb/>
     of the past with the procuring or losing of posi<lb break="no"/>tions in the civil service. A person would have no 
     <lb/>
     fear of his job, no matter for which patty he might 
     <lb/>
     care to vote. He would be independent of politics 
     <lb/>
     and secure in his chosen profession. The standard 
     <lb/>
     of the civil service could thus, perhaps, be raised, 
     <lb/>
     the efficiency improved, and if the more respon<lb break="no"/>sible positions were rewarded in proportion, with 
     <lb/>
     higher salary in relation to services given, I feel 
     <lb/>
     sure that the service could become one to envy 
     <lb/>
     and provide a choice of a career with a future, 
     <lb/>
     which so many of our people may not consider it, 
     <lb/>
     as it exists in its operations today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A further step would be the proper direction 
     <lb/>
     in which allocations to departments would be 
     <lb/>
     spent, eg the Public Works Department. It is 
     <lb/>
     necessary in this case, as in that of any and all the 
     <lb/>
     departments, that the allocations in each year of 
     <lb/>
     the government's budgets could only be made 
     <lb/>
     and controlled by the government itself in light 
     <lb/>
     of its estimated revenue and expenditure, and of 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of certain works to be done or public 
     <lb/>
     service provided or maintained. Once, however, 
     <lb/>
     the allocation is made, say to the Public Works 
     <lb/>
     Department, then the spending of the monies of 
     <lb/>
     each year would be in the hands of a public works 
     <lb/>
     commission, including the head of that depart<lb break="no"/>ment. The spending on improvement, extensions 
     <lb/>
     or maintenance of services would be done to 
  

            <cb/>
     

     serve the most people beneficially and where it 
     <lb/>
     would do the most good, both in respect of the 
     <lb/>
     welfare of the people and the general economy of 
     <lb/>
     the country. That it would be spent wisely and 
     <lb/>
     fairly could be assured by your already estab<lb break="no"/>lished civil service commission, through whom 
     <lb/>
     the service personnel is controlled and who 
     <lb/>
     would and could investigate any political im<lb break="no"/>plications or unfavourable methods of expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, resulting if they so desired, in the relieving 
     <lb/>
     of his position of the one responsible for the 
     <lb/>
     department concerned. In this respect, the civil 
     <lb/>
     servants taking these responsibilities would need 
     <lb/>
     to be reimbursed in relation to their position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This method of public service would have a 
     <lb/>
     much-desired result in the elimination of political 
     <lb/>
     promises to voters, either by individuals or par<lb break="no"/>ties, and would make useless the election 
     <lb/>
     promises of roads to be built in any particular 
     <lb/>
     settlement, or the digging of a well for Uncle 
     <lb/>
     Tom; and unswayed by the old familiar promises, 
     <lb/>
     would permit the voters to elect the member, or 
     <lb/>
     party, in which they would have the most con<lb break="no"/>fidence to govern this country. It would take the 
     <lb/>
     political interference out of the civil service, pro<lb break="no"/>vide for better government administration, and 
     <lb/>
     go a long way to assure that the best government 
     <lb/>
     was elected, which might not always have been 
     <lb/>
     the case in the past, where wild and extravagant 
     <lb/>
     promises persuaded the people to vote against 
     <lb/>
     their better judgement. Each department could be 
     <lb/>
     similarly handled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, I have endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     give just a simple illustration of my conception 
     <lb/>
     of the form and manner in which our government 
     <lb/>
     of the future should be handled. I realise that I 
     <lb/>
     was perhaps generalising, but my suggestion 
     <lb/>
     would take a few months of close study to iron 
     <lb/>
     out the wrinkles and avoid the pitfalls, and time 
     <lb/>
     does not permit me to in any way do justice to it 
     <lb/>
     in the short period I am allowed in the debate on 
     <lb/>
     this motion. I trust, however, that I have in some 
     <lb/>
     measure shown the members of the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     as well as the people of the country, the basis on 
     <lb/>
     which our own government should be ad<lb break="no"/>ministered.... Along the lines of these principles, 
     <lb/>
     we can have a better-than-ever self-governed 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Some people may be inclined to 
     <lb/>
     doubt the practicability of my suggestions, but I 
     <lb/>
     am convinced that it could be worked out practi<lb break="no"/>cally if tackled in the proper manner by sensible

     men, of which there are no small number in this 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since entering this National Convention I 
     <lb/>
     have endeavoured to look at the facts we have had 
     <lb/>
     before us with an unbiased mind. I have been 
     <lb/>
     sincere; and have endeavoured to be fair in all my 
     <lb/>
     criticisms and findings, and to look at this whole 
     <lb/>
     question of our future in the light of what is best 
     <lb/>
     for the most of our people, and best for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There were words written some number of 
     <lb/>
     years ago, not written for the most important time

            <p><persName ref="pers:CRAN1">Mr. Cranford</persName> Mr. Chairman, in 1934 when the 
     <lb/>Commission of Government took over the affairs 
     <lb/>of this country, a great many people, including 
     <lb/>myself, thought it was a move in the right direc<lb break="no"/>tion. We thought it would be like a father who 
     <lb/>saw that his children had gone astray, and had 
     <lb/>made a move to put things right. The people of 
     <lb/>this country today are greatly disappointed, or 
     <lb/>may I say disgusted to find that such was not the 
     <lb/>case. It was more like a group of people who 
     <lb/>would like to hold the reins of power forever. In 
     <lb/>the light and knowledge of the actions of Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, and confirmed by this 
     <lb/>National Convention, every action of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission was to make the people of this country 
     <lb/>believe that we could remain solvent only under 
     <lb/>the form of Commission of Government, and that 
     <lb/>government only is honest enough to carry on the 
     <lb/>affairs of this country. That is as I see it, and I 
     <lb/>would like the people of this country to under<lb break="no"/>stand that I am not dictated to by any man, nor 
     <lb/>aml affiliated with any firth or corporation, either 
     <lb/>in business or politics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

            <p>
     There never was a government that was in a 
     <lb/>
     better position to do what was best for this 
     <lb/>
     country than Commission of Government. They 
     <lb/>
     were under no obligation whatever to the voters; 
     <lb/>
     therefore there was no pressure that could be 
     <lb/>
     forced upon them, and no excuse they can give 
     <lb/>
     for not doing everything that was in the best 
     <lb/>
     interest of the country. What do we find? From 
     <lb/>
     1934 to 1939, the only difference between Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government and responsible govern<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
   
ment was that the British government recognised 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government, when they were 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to recognise responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. That is the only difference that I can see; 
     <lb/>
     they carried along on the same lines as all former 
     <lb/>
     governments, without any improvement 
     <lb/>
     whatever. They made no attempt to change our 
     <lb/>
     method of business to help the fishermen and 
     <lb/>
     workers, but instead made it worse for them, and 
     <lb/>
     for the country in general. They put us further in 
     <lb/>
     debt. In 1939 the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     had a deficit of $4,069,320 as compared with a 
     <lb/>
     deficit of $1,528,525 in 1934 when they took 
     <lb/>
     over. I refer you to the Financial Report, pages 
     <lb/>
     20 and 30. It can be clearly seen that the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government did not handle our affairs 
     <lb/>
     any better than responsible government in the 
     <lb/>
     light of our financial standing from 1934 to 1939. 
     <lb/>
     If there had been no world war, what would have 
     <lb/>
     happened? Would there be any Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government to be bothered with today? So far as 
     <lb/>
     I am concerned I am going to consider the 
     <lb/>
     stewardship of this caretaker government in the 
     <lb/>
     light of their actions from 1934 to 1939. Since 
     <lb/>
     that time illiterate women would have run the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of this country just as well. For my part I 
     <lb/>
     cannot see one act of the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that could be commendable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, permit me to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks in connection with just two acts of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission which, in my opinion, will give a 
     <lb/>
     fair illustration of all their acts. First, so-called 
     <lb/>
     free and compulsory education. I say "so-called" 
     <lb/>
     because there is a 60% duty on exercise books, 
     <lb/>
     scribblers, pencils, etc. imported into this 
     <lb/>
     country. Therefore the word "free" is absurd. 
     <lb/>
     "Inconsistency thou art a jewel!" Second, the 
     <lb/>
     spending of thousands of dollars preaching co<lb break="no"/>operation, and causing thousands of dollars to be 
     <lb/>
     lost by the same people that co-operatives would 
     <lb/>
     benefit. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to be 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood. I do not want people to think for 
     <lb/>
     one moment that I am against co-operation, but 
     <lb/>
     quite the contrary. What I want to point out is the 
     <lb/>
     inconsistency of the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Thousands of dollars were lost to the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen and workers of this country by the 
     <lb/>
     creation of the government's Supply Depart<lb break="no"/>ment, by killing the trade of the outport importer 
     <lb/>
     and uprooting the business that had taken them a 
     <lb/>
     lifetime to establish, and the fishermen and

     workers of this country lost at least 30% on their 
     <lb/>
     purchases. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, it is a recognized fact that the 
     <lb/>
     government's Department of Supply picked their 
     <lb/>
     favourites when appointing their committees or 
     <lb/>
     groups, call them what you like. Perhaps these are 
     <lb/>
     the parasites that Governor Walwyn referred to 
     <lb/>
     in his farewell address, in which he said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The cost of living here is terribly high, but 
     <lb/>
     I hope it will tend to fall before long. I am 
     <lb/>
     assured on the highest authority that this high 
     <lb/>
     cost of living is not due to the high duties on 
     <lb/>
     necessities, but is due to the high profits and 
     <lb/>
     the excessive profits being made locally. 
     <lb/>
     There are too many middlemen and commis<lb break="no"/>sion agents, who are really parasites on the 
     <lb/>
     community. 
     <lb/>
      </p></quote>


            <p>This expression, coming from no less a person 
     <lb/>than a past chairman of the Commission of 
     <lb/>Government, does not speak well for that body, 
     <lb/>but rather verifies my statement of what can be 
     <lb/>and is being done with the help of governments 
     <lb/>to feed parasites rather than destroy them. It has 
     <lb/>been said that it was rather late for the past 
     <lb/>chairman to make this expression in his farewell 
     <lb/>address. Maybe it was a little late, but it was much 
     <lb/>earlier than the rest of the Commissioners. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know that none of the Commissioners will 
     <lb/>
     attempt to say that they fail to see where any evil 
     <lb/>
     was committed. If they do, we could all rejoice 
     <lb/>
     that such men did not have charge of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of England at the time when Hitler began 
     <lb/>
     his threat to dominate the world. If they could not 
     <lb/>
     see from the very day that the Supply Department 
     <lb/>
     was instituted and its committees formed, that it 
     <lb/>
     meant the domination of the trade of this country 
     <lb/>
     by a few, then they were too small or indifferent 
     <lb/>
     to realise what was going to take place; I hope we 
     <lb/>
     won't, as a body of Newfoundlanders entrusted 
     <lb/>
     by our fellow men to help to put things right. In 
     <lb/>
     order to put things right, we must regard this 
     <lb/>
     Convention as a declaration of war against 
     <lb/>
     domination, manipulation and intrigue, and I 
     <lb/>
     hope we will meet with the success that the Allied 
     <lb/>
     armies met with against Hitler's domination. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, again I do not want to be 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood. I know and agree that price con<lb break="no"/>trol and the control of the distribution of food and 
     <lb/>
     other necessities for the winning of the war was 
     <lb/>
     essential; but the handling of the textile business 
     <lb/>
     by the Department of Supply was abused right 


            <cb/>
           

     and left, and the outport importer was dis<lb break="no"/>criminated against. If there is any person who 
     <lb/>
     would like to dispute what I have said, let us ask 
     <lb/>
     ourselves the question, "Did we know of any 
     <lb/>
     ceiling price on a suit of clothes, or anything in 
     <lb/>
     the drygoods line during the war?" No, sir, we did 
     <lb/>
     not, and I say without fear of contradiction that 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government did help big 
     <lb/>
     business, and in doing so took a delight in upset<lb break="no"/>ting the business of the outport importer; and 
     <lb/>
     again I repeat, the fishermen and workers of this 
     <lb/>
     country lost at least 30% on their purchases. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, perhaps you do not grasp the 
     <lb/>
     means whereby monopolies were created by the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of the Supply Department. I will 
     <lb/>
     make an attempt to point it out to you. When an 
     <lb/>
     outport importer needed goods from any foreign 
     <lb/>
     country, the first thing he had to do was apply to 
     <lb/>
     the Supply Division of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government for a certificate of essentiality. That 
     <lb/>
     application had to go before a committee of men 
     <lb/>
     who were that man's competitors. In other words, 
     <lb/>
     they were the wholesalers of St. John's. They 
     <lb/>
     were given the privilege of being able to dive into 
     <lb/>
     that man's private business, and even prevent him 
     <lb/>
     from getting any goods. Perhaps you may ask in 
     <lb/>
     what way they could do that. Well, here is an 
     <lb/>
     example. I know of a man who in 1942 applied 
     <lb/>
     for a certificate of essentiality for a quantity of 
     <lb/>
     goods from New York. When his goods were 
     <lb/>
     packed and addressed ready for shipment, an 
     <lb/>
     agent from Newfoundland appeared at the ware<lb break="no"/>house in New York and seeing the address on two 
     <lb/>
     cases of goods he inquired from that firm if they 
     <lb/>
     shipped to that man. When being told they had 
     <lb/>
     been shipping to that man for a considerable time 
     <lb/>
     he simply put the gun to the shipper by saying, 
     <lb/>
     "If you ship that man these two cases you will 
     <lb/>
     have to cancel our ten", with the result that that 
     <lb/>
     man got no goods from the firm since. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now these are the acts of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, and I will leave it to my listeners to 
     <lb/>
     decide for themselves if it was through ignorance 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the Commission of Government of 
     <lb/>
     how business is conducted, or was it to help their 
     <lb/>
     favourites? Whatever it was, the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country had to pay two profits, one to the 
     <lb/>
     wholesaler and another to the retailer, which 
     <lb/>
     amounted to at least 30% more than if imported 
     <lb/>
     by the outport importer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know we have had bad governments in the 
  

            <pb n="1266" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-20_Page_1266.jpg"/>

     past, governments that introduced class legisla<lb break="no"/>tion to benefit their favourites and supporters. I 
     <lb/>
     know that, but this caretaker government out<lb break="no"/>strips them all; although I, with thousands of 
     <lb/>
     other Newfoundlanders, thought that by the ad<lb break="no"/>vent of Commission of Government these evils 
     <lb/>
     would be remedied. But instead of the evils being 
     <lb/>
     remedied they made things worse for the majority 
     <lb/>
     of people, and helped a few to make a fortune at 
     <lb/>
     the expense of the taxpayers. There is no need for 
     <lb/>
     me to say any more about the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government, as I know their doom is sealed by 
     <lb/>
     themselves. They have been weighed in the 
     <lb/>
     balance and found wanting, and should not be 
     <lb/>
     considered as a future form of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As for myself, I am like the man and woman 
     <lb/>
     who were fighting in their own backyard, when 
     <lb/>
     a stranger passing by saw that the woman was 
     <lb/>
     getting the worst of it. The stranger went in to part 
     <lb/>
     them, when suddenly to his surprise both the 
     <lb/>
     woman and the man turned on him and he had to 
     <lb/>
     run for his life. They did not want any inter<lb break="no"/>ference in their affairs. They were capable of 
     <lb/>
     settling their own squabbles together. The same 
     <lb/>
     thing applies to me in considering our future form 
     <lb/>
     of government. I do not want to see any more 
     <lb/>
     interference in our political life. We have had it 
     <lb/>
     for 15 years, and everyone knows we have had 
     <lb/>
     enough of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I come to the question of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government Mr. Chairman, although supporting 
     <lb/>
     the motion now before us I would support it more 
     <lb/>
     whole-heartedly if the words on the eighth and 
     <lb/>
     ninth lines were deleted, which read, "as it ex<lb break="no"/>isted in Newfoundland prior to its suspension in 
     <lb/>
     1934", because who in Newfoundland wants to 
     <lb/>
     revert back to responsible government as it ex<lb break="no"/>isted in Newfoundland prior to its suspension in 
     <lb/>
     1934? Who in Newfoundland cannot see the 
     <lb/>
     error of our ways, and has not gained wisdom and 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the running of our affairs, so as to 
     <lb/>
     conduct it on a sound and solid business method? 
     <lb/>
     Who in Newfoundland would dare to say we do 
     <lb/>
     not need a fusion of informed co-operations and 
     <lb/>
     sound policies in the sphere of finance and trade, 
     <lb/>
     and general development of the country? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I really do believe that the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people today are waiting and anxious for the time 
     <lb/>
     to come when they can vote for our return to 
     <lb/>
     dominion status imbued with new blood, to see 
     <lb/>
     that our country is put on a sound footing, with a 
 

            <cb/>
   

     determination that never again will outsiders 
     <lb/>
     conduct our affairs and throw out the insult that 
     <lb/>
     we are not fit to guide our own destiny. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us be honest with ourselves. Let us 
     <lb/>
     face the untamished, brutal fact, as one member 
     <lb/>
     would like to put it, and that is, we have men in 
     <lb/>
     this country who can look after our affairs, and 
     <lb/>
     we need not import men to run our country, or 
     <lb/>
     appeal to any other country to rock us in the 
     <lb/>
     cradle. We have men who have not been asleep 
     <lb/>
     during the past 14 years, and have realised how 
     <lb/>
     essential it is that we look after our own affairs 
     <lb/>
     instead of allowing outsiders to do it for us. We 
     <lb/>
     have men in this country brilliant enough to have 
     <lb/>
     seen the error of our ways, and if given a chance 
     <lb/>
     would see to it that their country would be 
     <lb/>
     governed just as good, or better, than any other 
     <lb/>
     country on the globe. Please remember that New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders have been classed "better than the 
     <lb/>
     best". We have men that have decided that we 
     <lb/>
     safeguard ourselves in the beginning, by seeing 
     <lb/>
     to it that a reformation must take place in our 
     <lb/>
     constitution that will eliminate all evils, and 
     <lb/>
     prevent monopolies which the fishermen and 
     <lb/>
     workers of this country, in the past, have had to 
     <lb/>
     support; a constitution strong enough to direct its 
     <lb/>
     course in an honourable manner, beating in mind 
     <lb/>
     that we live on a rock and our principal source of 
     <lb/>
     living is the fish that touch in near that rock, not 
     <lb/>
     in a regular manner, but in a manner that con<lb break="no"/>stitutes a gamble for a living. Therefore, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, we must take the fishery as a guiding 
     <lb/>
     star in all our undertakings, and other industries 
     <lb/>
     will be automatically protected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We do not care what name is placed on our 
     <lb/>
     future government. What we want is a govern<lb break="no"/>ment that will carry out its obligations to the 
     <lb/>
     letter, and will be strong enough to resist all evils, 
     <lb/>
     such as persons or firms that attempt to prevent 
     <lb/>
     competition, that would create monopolies, and 
     <lb/>
     would class them as parasites, and boycott their 
     <lb/>
     goods until such time as our principal industry, 
     <lb/>
     the fishery, had no competition I hope and pray 
     <lb/>
     that we will not be carried away with the idea that 
     <lb/>
     we are here only to try and make a beginning to 
     <lb/>
     establish a government, but that we are here to 
     <lb/>
     try and bring about ways and means whereby we 
     <lb/>
     could live on our industries, and make laws that 
     <lb/>
     will equally bear on all, and be prepared for any 
     <lb/>
     eventualities that may take place in future years, 
     <lb/>
     when we will be able to sing from the bottom of

     our hearts, "God guard thee Newfoundland." 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The motion is before the Chair. 
     <lb/>Is the Convention ready for the question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> Mr. Chairman, I listened with very 
     <lb/>
     great interest to the different speakers. They have 
     <lb/>
     shown much enthusiasm for the cause they are 
     <lb/>
     sponsoring. I do not propose to take up much time 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the report before us. I merely 
     <lb/>
     wish to say that I support the idea of placing 
     <lb/>
     before the people the two forms, if I may call 
     <lb/>
     them so, which are contained in this resolution, 
     <lb/>
     because I feel the people have a right to make one 
     <lb/>
     of these their choice. But I could not wholehear<lb break="no"/>tedly support this resolution, Mr. Chairman, and 
     <lb/>
     I think that it might so happen that the other form 
     <lb/>
     of government, if that may be so termed a form 
     <lb/>
     of government, which is uppermost in the minds 
     <lb/>
     of many scattered throughout Newfoundland — 
     <lb/>
     I would not, I say, support that motion if I thought 
     <lb/>
     by any chance this other form, namely confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, will be.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you don't mind, Mr. Hillier, I 
     <lb/>
     don't want to embarrass you, but you are 
     <lb/>
     required to confine your remarks to the two forms 
     <lb/>
     of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> Thank you, I do not wish to be out 
     <lb/>
     of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not ruling you out of order, 
     <lb/>
     I just want to draw your attention... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I just beg to support placing before 
     <lb/>
     the people the two forms of government, if they 
     <lb/>
     may be called forms, before the people at the 
     <lb/>
     national referendum. Thank you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Mr. Chairman, in supporting 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins' motion now before this house, I do 
     <lb/>
     it because I feel it is due to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country to give them a choice of possible govern<lb break="no"/>ments. How can we do otherwise? It is not being 
     <lb/>
     fair to the people for me or any other member of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention to attempt to prevent any of the 
     <lb/>
     electors from voting for the government of their 
     <lb/>
     choice, within limits, or to put it more plainly, a 
     <lb/>
     government within the Empire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Ever since this Convention started I have tried 
     <lb/>
     to maintain a non-partisan attitude. I have tried 
     <lb/>
     within my humble attainments to sift out from the 
     <lb/>
     voluminous reports, and the equally voluminous 
     <lb/>
     and not always edifying arguments of the various 
     <lb/>
     speakers, some information which would lead me 
     <lb/>
     to a decision as to the forms of government to 
     <lb/>
     recommend to His Majesty's Government, and 


            <cb/>
          

     indirectly to the people, that would be beneficial, 
     <lb/>
     and also, as I understand we are expected to do, 
     <lb/>
     make my own individual choice as to the par<lb break="no"/>ticular form, that in my opinion, would be the best 
     <lb/>
     in the interests of our people generally. I have 
     <lb/>
     tried through study and my own experiences to 
     <lb/>
     justify my reasons for finally dealing with this 
     <lb/>
     question of recommendations of forms of 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Personally, I am not greatly interested in 
     <lb/>
     politics, beyond seeing that the people get a 
     <lb/>
     square deal in their choice; I have no political axe 
     <lb/>
     to grind, and it is highly improbable that after this 
     <lb/>
     Convention is finished I will be very active in 
     <lb/>
     political affairs. If the Convention has taught me 
     <lb/>
     anything, it is that politics is not my line. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, we have in the motion before 
     <lb/>
     us two forms of government, responsible as it 
     <lb/>
     existed prior to its suspension in 1934, or that the 
     <lb/>
     present form of government he continued. Let us 
     <lb/>
     consider both in the light of the opinions of some 
     <lb/>
     of our people. First, responsible as prior to 1934. 
     <lb/>
     We had this type of government for about, I think, 
     <lb/>
     80 years. During this time, we had what might be 
     <lb/>
     described as good, bad, and indifferent govern<lb break="no"/>ments — it all depends on our own political 
     <lb/>
     leanings. We had leaders who were statesmen, 
     <lb/>
     not politicians; others who were politicians, not 
     <lb/>
     statesmen. It has been said that the difference 
     <lb/>
     between a statesman and a politician is that the 
     <lb/>
     former thinks he belongs to the state, and the 
     <lb/>
     latter that the state belongs to him. I am afraid we 
     <lb/>
     have had a few of the latter. In my own recollec<lb break="no"/>tion of governments, going back about 50 years 
     <lb/>
     or so, I have seen some of our public men practi<lb break="no"/>cally ruin themselves in their businesses, owing 
     <lb/>
     to the interest which they took in their public 
     <lb/>
     duties, as Mr. Higgins intimated. I have also heard 
     <lb/>
     others accused of gross incompetency and worse; I 
     <lb/>
     suppose it's all in this game they call politics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the period that Mr. Higgins refers to, 
     <lb/>
     when revenues were low and we carried on, he 
     <lb/>
     must concede the fact that the expenses of 
     <lb/>
     government were correspondingly low, and cer<lb break="no"/>tainly it is no argument to compare responsible 
     <lb/>
     government with Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>
     who, while having exceedingly high revenues, 
     <lb/>
     also had to face exceedingly high costs of main<lb break="no"/>tenance and capital expenditures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We also sometimes forget that during the 20 
     <lb/>
     years before Commission our credit was good, 


            <pb n="1268" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-20_Page_1268.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1268</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> 


         

     and in consequence, through continued bor<lb break="no"/>rowings, our public debt rose by leaps and 
     <lb/>
     bounds; when we ran out of cash, we simply 
     <lb/>
     borrowed more, thus sending our costs of govern<lb break="no"/>ment soaring. When we could not borrow more, 
     <lb/>
     then came the grand finale — no credit, no cash 
     <lb/>
     to pay our bills, resulting in loss of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government and the inauguration of Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government. It must be conceded that some of 
     <lb/>
     our troubles were caused by world depression, 
     <lb/>
     but I think the Amulree Report intimated that not 
     <lb/>
     a few of our troubles were caused by incom<lb break="no"/>petence on the part of our own governments. We 
     <lb/>
     did not like that report, which may or may not 
     <lb/>
     have been exaggerated in some particulars, but at 
     <lb/>
     least it was a report from a highly competent body 
     <lb/>
     of men who made an independent enquiry, and 
     <lb/>
     reported as they found. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are now giving the people the choice of 
     <lb/>
     going back to the same kind of government we 
     <lb/>
     had prior to 1934, with all its failings; the kind of 
     <lb/>
     government which will probably carry on in the 
     <lb/>
     old tradition, fill positions in the civil service 
     <lb/>
     from the ranks of party heelers, irrespective of 
     <lb/>
     their abilities, who would only hold office during 
     <lb/>
     the tenure of that particular party, and then out; 
     <lb/>
     give old supporters a job for a couple of years, 
     <lb/>
     and then pension them with a good retirement 
     <lb/>
     allowance; in other words, upset the system the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government has gone to some 
     <lb/>
     pains to inaugurate in our civil service during the 
     <lb/>
     past 14 years. We will also have our old system 
     <lb/>
     of indirect taxation, a system which gives us a 
     <lb/>
     good revenue when prices of imported com<lb break="no"/>modities are high, and the people find it hard to 
     <lb/>
     survive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">In fine</hi>, Mr. Chairman, under responsible 
     <lb/>
     government we have the glorious privilege of 
     <lb/>
     having our very own independent system of 
     <lb/>
     government; but can we afford this? Can we hope 
     <lb/>
     to stand alone, and still afford our people and the 
     <lb/>
     comparable standard of life as enjoyed by the 
     <lb/>
     peoples of the American continent? It has been 
     <lb/>
     said, and I think truly, that Newfoundland might 
     <lb/>
     carry on under responsible government if the 
     <lb/>
     people were satisfied to have a lower standard of 
     <lb/>
     living than that of the peoples I have already 
     <lb/>
     mentioned. The electors should give this par<lb break="no"/>ticular form of government due consideration, 
     <lb/>
     and a lot of serious thought before supporting it. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>The second form of government mentioned in 
  

            <cb/>
         

     the motion is the present one, Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government. This administration has, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, done a good job generally speaking; it is 
     <lb/>
     not an ideal form of government to have per<lb break="no"/>manently; it has the disadvantage of being a 
     <lb/>
     system of taxation without representation, a sys<lb break="no"/>tem that has caused untold troubles in the world, 
     <lb/>
     a system that lost the American colonies to 
     <lb/>
     Britain, and was probably the cause of the war in 
     <lb/>
     South Africa. In Newfoundland it has probably 
     <lb/>
     outlived its usefulness, and I think the time has 
     <lb/>
     arrived to take more of our responsibilities on our 
     <lb/>
     own shoulders. But let us give credit where credit 
     <lb/>
     is due, the Commission of Government has done 
     <lb/>
     some good work during its tenure of office; it has 
     <lb/>
     been an honest administration, it has undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     put the civil service on a more businesslike basis 
     <lb/>
     than any of our own governments ever did; it has 
     <lb/>
     given our young people a better opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     advance in that service, and to feel that their 
     <lb/>
     positions do not rely on changes of government. 
     <lb/>
     It has increased our social services in the matter 
     <lb/>
     of health services and education, although much 
     <lb/>
     still remains to be done. It has endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     give us good roads, though undoubtedly they 
     <lb/>
     overdeveloped the fisheries. It must be conceded 
     <lb/>
     that they had large revenues to accomplish all 
     <lb/>
     this, but it also shows they had the will to do it. 
     <lb/>
     They may have made mistakes, but who doesn't? 
     <lb/>
     We should at least be thankful to the British 
     <lb/>
     government and the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     for the conduct of our affairs during the past 14 
     <lb/>
     years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To conclude, Mr. Chairman, I feel it is my 
     <lb/>
     duty as a member of this Convention, knowing 
     <lb/>
     that some of our people wish it, to support the 
     <lb/>
     motion before the Chair, and give them the op<lb break="no"/>portunity to support either of the two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government mentioned, should they so desire, at 
     <lb/>
     the same time reserving my right as an individual 
     <lb/>
     to question whether either of them would be in 
     <lb/>
     the best interests of our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, with regard to every 
     <lb/>
     minor and major event in this world there comes 
     <lb/>
     a time when, to use a nautical expression, "this is 
     <lb/>
     the pay-off", the meaning of that term being "a 
     <lb/>
     coming to an end". I can say for myself and a 
     <lb/>
     large number of members in this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     with cheerful hearts, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi> 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding, in retrospect one can see the 
     <lb/>
     mistakes, but that is nothing. We can profit by it.

     If a man never makes a mistake, on investigation 
     <lb/>
     you will find out he never accomplished any<lb break="no"/>thing. I will leave that to posterity... I have done 
     <lb/>
     my best as I saw it. I have put quite a few yaps in 
     <lb/>
     it, and I suppose that people thought they could 
     <lb/>
     do it better. My only comment on that is that it is 
     <lb/>
     a shame that those people did not tell the public 
     <lb/>
     what experts they were, and got the people to 
     <lb/>
     nominate them for the election. What an awaken<lb break="no"/>ing the people would have had! What service they 
     <lb/>
     would have rendered to the country! Surely New<lb break="no"/>foundland should have had the best, but we are 
     <lb/>
     just a bunch of common people, trying to find a 
     <lb/>
     way out. Some could have done better, others, I 
     <lb/>
     venture to say, worse. I will excuse that, especial<lb break="no"/>ly those of the younger generation. They have 
     <lb/>
     been left in a fog of political oblivion for 14 years 
     <lb/>
     and were never taught, and never knew how a 
     <lb/>
     democracy works. I wonder what one columnist 
     <lb/>
     would have written or thought if she had attended 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons and heard the Commons, 
     <lb/>
     with the enemy at the gates and the world falling 
     <lb/>
     to pieces, take time out to debate if the women 
     <lb/>
     sailors' undies would be pink or blue — and other 
     <lb/>
     matters just as irrelevant. Perhaps it would have 
     <lb/>
     been OK for the Commons to have done that, 
     <lb/>
     being learned in the way of democracy, but for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders — I guess they expect the 
     <lb/>
     courts of Newfoundland to produce philoso<lb break="no"/>phers, but what a kick they got! It is only common 
     <lb/>
     men who came in here and I guess we will go 
     <lb/>
     down in history as the only <hi rendition="simple:italic">cod</hi>vention that ever 
     <lb/>
     sat! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I take this out of a poem, "The Human Na<lb break="no"/>tion"; I quote the first verse:

            <p>This I have kept constantly in mind through life, 
     <lb/>and especially since I have been in this assembly. 
     <lb/>I weigh this from every angle, and I can assure 
     <lb/>you it has been my guide. I want to leave, not a 
     <lb/>stumbling block for the generations that come 
     <lb/>after, but a stepping stone to higher heights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <p>
     I have no political aspirations, for I believe 
     <lb/>
     that in the parliament of the future the people 
     <lb/>
     should not only elect those who should rule them, 
     <lb/>
     but nominate them as well. This is my political 
   

            <cb/>
           

     belief, and I can't see anybody with common 
     <lb/>
     sense nominating me, and I don't see any political 
     <lb/>
     party taking me in. For one thing I don't take the 
     <lb/>
     nod from anybody in either hell, earth or heaven, 
     <lb/>
     only my Creator, and sometimes not from him — 
     <lb/>
     if I did I would be a better man.

            <p>
     Those forms of government, which according 
     <lb/>
     to those terms of reference we are to advise the 
     <lb/>
     home government on, I take each in turn. First, I 
     <lb/>
     believe this is the biggest "jumblement" that was 
     <lb/>
     ever foisted on a people, and I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     jumble it any more. But with regards to myself I 
     <lb/>
     am going to make it clear, the stand I am taking 
     <lb/>
     and why I am taking that stand. I am voting that 
     <lb/>
     responsible government go on the ballot, but I 
     <lb/>
     firmly believe that there should not be a ballot, 
     <lb/>
     that Britain, with or without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     people, should give back that which never should 
     <lb/>
     have been taken away — the right that 1,400 of 
     <lb/>
     our finest laid down their lives for, and at least 
     <lb/>
     1,400 more went to an early grave for— the right 
     <lb/>
     of self-government. And the hard part of it is that 
     <lb/>
     those in Parliament who at the time raised Cain 
     <lb/>
     because it was taken from us when they were in 
     <lb/>
     opposition, today are in power and have put into 
     <lb/>
     operation this cumbersome, expensive 
     <lb/>
     machinery, while without any fanfare they have 
     <lb/>
     turned loose, to full and dominion independence, 
     <lb/>
     nearly half the Empire. We would have got the 
     <lb/>
     same treatment if we had been 1,000 miles 
     <lb/>
     southeast of where we are... Well, as long as 
     <lb/>
     water runs I'll always believe that an English<lb break="no"/>man's word is not worth the oxygen he uses up 
     <lb/>
     to form the word or sentence. Why has this hap<lb break="no"/>pened? I'll whisper a secret, gentlemen. We did 
     <lb/>
     not take the nod, the imperial nod in the sixties, 
     <lb/>
     and this time by hook or by crook we are going 
     <lb/>
     to take the nod. Now the only thing between us 
     <lb/>
     and that imperial nod (in fact now it is a frown) 
     <lb/>
     is the people's "X". God grant they will use it 
     <lb/>
     wisely. For myself, never will a foreign power, 
     <lb/>
     no odds how friendly, hold dominion over the 
     <lb/>
     152,000 square miles of this earth's surface, with 
     <lb/>
     my consent, that our forbears helped to claim and 
     <lb/>
     colonise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I look back on the history of my own family, 
     <lb/>
     outlawed and under sentence of death after the 
     <lb/>
     Jacobite rising in Scotland. The two brothers 
     <lb/>
     came to the Isle of Man and from there to New<lb break="no"/>

     foundland, about the 1730s. If any of you read 
     <lb/>
     Parson Harvey's <hi rendition="simple:italic">History of Newfoundland</hi><ref target="#fn_09">[1]</ref> — 
     <lb/>
     "1812, did today visit the family of William 
     <lb/>
     Bailey at Little Harbour, and christened his fami<lb break="no"/>ly" — that was my grandfather's father, New<lb break="no"/>foundland-born. William Bailey's father 
     <lb/>
     believed in self-government and swinging a 
     <lb/>
     claymore in defence of what he believed was the 
     <lb/>
     right form of government for him. He did not get 
     <lb/>
     it there, but in the woods of Newfoundland he 
     <lb/>
     found it far from ideologies. Today our 
     <lb/>
     forebear's theories are right, for apart from a 
     <lb/>
     minority, all the world plans for self-government 
     <lb/>
     — all those who can get it. I know there are 
     <lb/>
     certain sections of this world where a minority 
     <lb/>
     rules. They are behind an Iron Curtain. We are 
     <lb/>
     the only ones in the Anglo-Saxon world who are 
     <lb/>
     deprived of that right. Power politics are doing 
     <lb/>
     that to us. Latitude and longitude today determine 
     <lb/>
     the amount of self-govemment we will have if 
     <lb/>
     the powers that be have their way, and this is 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the Atlantic Charter, contrary to 
     <lb/>
     democracy and also to the American way. A cry 
     <lb/>
     was raised in the 18th century there, about taxa<lb break="no"/>tion without representation. Britain found out to 
     <lb/>
     her cost that by not heeding that cry, it had to be 
     <lb/>
     rammed down her throat, and the operation was 
     <lb/>
     painful. Had power politics been forgotten then 
     <lb/>
     and the rights of men taken into account, I wonder 
     <lb/>
     if the affairs of this world would not have been 
     <lb/>
     different. I doubt today if we would have had the 
     <lb/>
     two bloody wars we have had lately and that 
     <lb/>
     peace would be on this earth. I believe that all 
     <lb/>
     people should govern themselves. It should be 
     <lb/>
     the right of any man to do just that. Why deny it 
     <lb/>
     to me? I have been deprived of that right for 14 
     <lb/>
     years and a right good mess has been made of it. 
     <lb/>
     Of that I will speak later. I have paid a little more 
     <lb/>
     than lip service to democracy. That's why I 
     <lb/>
     joined a queue four city blocks long, four deep, 
     <lb/>
     to put on a uniform August 6, 1914. If anybody 
     <lb/>
     saw the crowd there that day you would see there 
     <lb/>
     was a lot of us of one single mind. It is a service 
     <lb/>
     that all citizens should give, and if you count the 
     <lb/>
     number in this gathering that have served their 
     <lb/>
     stint in defence of King and country and look at 
     <lb/>
     them when the vote is counted, you'll find out 
     <lb/>
     that the great majority of them believe in the 
     <lb/>
     divine right of self-government. Let the vote 


            <cb/>
           

     speak for itself. The world will soon have a 
     <lb/>
     chance to learn how it will go. Men from this 
     <lb/>
     island built up a name to the Germans, the "White 
     <lb/>
     Indians", a name Newfoundland can cherish, a 
     <lb/>
     name their sons can be proud of, a name equal to 
     <lb/>
     the Scotsmen's name of the "Ladies from Hell". 
     <lb/>
     You'll note the enemy gave them both names and 
     <lb/>
     only two classes of men in the Empire, the 
     <lb/>
     Scotsmen and Newfoundlanders. There must be 
     <lb/>
     nothing wrong with a country that can produce 
     <lb/>
     men that even the enemy will name — nothing 
     <lb/>
     that can't be cured. Scotland is turning her hand 
     <lb/>
     today towards making her homeland fit for her 
     <lb/>
     "Ladies from Hell" to live in. What are we doing? 
     <lb/>
     I'm fairly, shall I say cosmopolitan, and in touch 
     <lb/>
     with the outside — and what do I find? What is 
     <lb/>
     being done to make Newfoundland a fit country 
     <lb/>
     for the "White Indians" of both wars? Why those 
     <lb/>
     of us who went through the hell of '14 to '18 and 
     <lb/>
     who have raised our families have had 30 years 
     <lb/>
     of civvy street in Newfoundland, understand 
     <lb/>
     what those "White Indians" who have come back 
     <lb/>
     have to go through, who know the restlessness of 
     <lb/>
     settling to a different life, because war with its 
     <lb/>
     months of intense boredom punctuated by mo<lb break="no"/>ments of intense fear does something to you. Can 
     <lb/>
     we who understand war, who understand peace, 
     <lb/>
     men who are at the age when men are at their best 
     <lb/>
     in administrative positions, have no say at all? 
     <lb/>
     Because, in a world torn by an economic crisis 
     <lb/>
     the like this world had never experienced before, 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain stepped into the breach. We lost 
     <lb/>
     self-government, but buoyed up with the hope 
     <lb/>
     that when the island was self-supporting, then 
     <lb/>
     self-government would be restored at the request 
     <lb/>
     of the people. Although Britain knew our resour<lb break="no"/>ces, our liabilities, she brought us in here in a 
     <lb/>
     convention, had 45 of us running around from 
     <lb/>
     Cape Race to Quirpon collecting statistics that 
     <lb/>
     could have been given to us when we came in, 
     <lb/>
     putting in motion cumbersome expensive 
     <lb/>
     machinery after 14 years of political oblivion, 
     <lb/>
     beginning with a blackening of all statesmen and 
     <lb/>
     political institutions, forgetting that her own 
     <lb/>
     political history was not so bright. She never 
     <lb/>
     attained her position politically without civil war. 
     <lb/>
     To anybody interested in political history, the 
     <lb/>
     history of the Mother of Parliaments makes juicy 
     <lb/>
     reading, and much can be improved on yet. I'll

     handle this when speaking to Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must apologise to you for bringing in the 
     <lb/>
     history of my own family, but I did it for this 
     <lb/>
     reason. Each year Confederation Life puts out a 
     <lb/>
     calendar they give to the public, a picture of how 
     <lb/>
     our great sister dominion was colonised. You see 
     <lb/>
     that great statesman Lord Halifax, with his ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     soldier settlers, backed by British cash, planning 
     <lb/>
     and building the city of Halifax. Another gives 
     <lb/>
     the settlers wading ashore at Pictou to the skirl of 
     <lb/>
     the pipers, a complete unit in itself. Go north to 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton Island, and at Soldier's Cove and 
     <lb/>
     vicinity you'll find where Wellington's veterans, 
     <lb/>
     some who stood in the squares at Waterloo, 
     <lb/>
     carved out new homes. Go to south Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     there you'll find the Hessians, veterans of the 
     <lb/>
     American war. All those were settled with British 
     <lb/>
     cash, British organisation, and last of all with 
     <lb/>
     British blessing and care while they were getting 
     <lb/>
     on their feet. Compare that with the way our 
     <lb/>
     forebears settled here, not with the help of their 
     <lb/>
     government, but against the dictates of it. My 
     <lb/>
     people were here about 80 years before it was 
     <lb/>
     legal to build a chimney in a house. We could 
     <lb/>
     forget this persecution in the past, but it is carried 
     <lb/>
     on today. We must still take the nod and it makes 
     <lb/>
     no odds what government is in power, whether 
     <lb/>
     Tory, Liberal or Labour. We are not grown up 
     <lb/>
     and must be babied, must go the way they think 
     <lb/>
     we should go. Are those people mad? I can tell 
     <lb/>
     them they are playing with dynamite. Take this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, hardly one of us knew the other until 
     <lb/>
     we met here, and today although two-thirds of us 
     <lb/>
     are of the opinion that the agreement between the 
     <lb/>
     British Parliament of 1933 and the New<lb break="no"/>foundland parliament of that date should be car<lb break="no"/>ried out, what do we find? Dictatorial terms of 
     <lb/>
     reference passed not by Newfoundland's elected 
     <lb/>
     representatives, no, but by remote control, some<lb break="no"/>thing that won't allow us to even mention the 
     <lb/>
     agreement of 1933. It's <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi>, beyond the 
     <lb/>
     scope. To boil it down, it's this. The ballyhoo 
     <lb/>
     about Newfoundland's effort in the two wars, her 
     <lb/>
     2,000 dead — they did not die in defence of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland democracy. They died for the 
     <lb/>
     Czechs, the Poles, the Belgians. You have no 
     <lb/>
     right to mention that agreement should be carried 
     <lb/>
     out. It's <hi rendition="simple:italic">ultra vires</hi>, beyond the scope of the death 
     <lb/>
     in action of 2,000 Newfoundlanders and the prob<lb break="no"/>able shortening of the lives of 3,000 more. While 
 

            <cb/>
   

     the cheers in the Commons and the Lords on 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's effort in the war are still echo<lb break="no"/>ing through the buildings, they were putting out 
     <lb/>
     those cursed terms, the scalloped shroud of New<lb break="no"/>foundland democracy. While we have always 
     <lb/>
     looked upon ourselves as the keystone in the arch 
     <lb/>
     of empire loyalty, let Britain beware through this 
     <lb/>
     action she does not tumble that arch down by 
     <lb/>
     tampering with it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I can only at this stage affirm my belief in a 
     <lb/>
     government by Newfoundlanders for New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, divorced from remote control. A 
     <lb/>
     government that should never have been 
     <lb/>
     tampered with. We hope that those countries, 
     <lb/>
     Britain and the United States, who signed the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic Charter, will take cognisance of this, our 
     <lb/>
     appeal from the larger number of the people's 
     <lb/>
     only representatives for the past 14 years, and 
     <lb/>
     grant that dominion status be given as quickly as 
     <lb/>
     possible, and allow us to put before the people 
     <lb/>
     whatever type of government they believe in, in 
     <lb/>
     a legal manner. Only this will give us back the 
     <lb/>
     confidence that we have lost in the mother 
     <lb/>
     country. Only then will we believe an English<lb break="no"/>man's word is his bond. This has been shown in 
     <lb/>
     the manner we have been treated and I, for one, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of what my fellow delegates think, 
     <lb/>
     believe both the country and the people have not 
     <lb/>
     been given a square deal. Politically in life I've 
     <lb/>
     carried my end of the plank, in government I want 
     <lb/>
     nobody to carry my end of the plank. It's my 
     <lb/>
     God-given right, the right man has struggled for 
     <lb/>
     a thousand years. Let Britain wipe the slate clean 
     <lb/>
     of this wrong she has done her eldest daughter 
     <lb/>
     and prove she is not playing power politics and 
     <lb/>
     paying only lip service to democracy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to this form of government that 
     <lb/>
     fate seems to have foisted on us, I can only quote 
     <lb/>
     one of our politicians when he said that a certain 
     <lb/>
     district left a bad taste in his mouth. This form of 
     <lb/>
     Commission government has always left a bad 
     <lb/>
     taste in my mouth. If it was the best form of 
     <lb/>
     government in the world I would say that, and it's 
     <lb/>
     not that. I cannot think how anybody with a drop 
     <lb/>
     of blood in their veins could say anything else. 
     <lb/>
     The first time I contacted Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment it was a puzzle to me — that was in 1936, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1948 it still remains the $64 question — 
     <lb/>
     how it operates. I would like to meet the Rip Van 
     <lb/>
     Winkle who first worked out the plan, for I'm 
     <lb/>
     sure that only somebody who has been asleep for 
 

            <pb n="1272" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-20_Page_1272.jpg"/>

     100 years and had never been aware of the chan<lb break="no"/>ges that had taken place in human endeavour, 
     <lb/>
     could foist that form of government on his long- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     suffering human brother, because we and the 
     <lb/>
     English, if you undress us and we don't speak, 
     <lb/>
     you can hardly tell us apart. I have asked myself 
     <lb/>
     the question, why did our people stand for it? For 
     <lb/>
     you can't give away freedom and have it. There 
     <lb/>
     is only one answer to my mind. There were too 
     <lb/>
     many of our bonds held in Newfoundland. I 
     <lb/>
     haven't the least doubt that the constitution 
     <lb/>
     would not have gone only it was a choice between 
     <lb/>
     the 5% and 6% interest on the bonds and the 
     <lb/>
     constitution. So the constitution lost. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this I am reminded of a bond poster in 
     <lb/>
     England during the first world war. It said, "You 
     <lb/>
     gave your sons, but you won't lend your money." 
     <lb/>
     In this case it was "You'll make sure of your 
     <lb/>
     percentage" — the mess of pottage. And then 
     <lb/>
     through promises, half truths, a heaven on earth 
     <lb/>
     was promised by a nation who, for a scrap of 
     <lb/>
     paper in 1914, went to war. That was our battle 
     <lb/>
     cry, '33, how nice the promises, how soft the 
     <lb/>
     siren's song. I have the Amulree Report; how 
     <lb/>
     much it says, how little it means — something 
     <lb/>
     like my Lord Addison, one question answered 
     <lb/>
     seven different ways, then coming back, the other 
     <lb/>
     scrap of paper treated by our sainted mother just 
     <lb/>
     as callously as Germany treated that scrap of 
     <lb/>
     paper guaranteeing the independence of Belgium 
     <lb/>
     — so has Britain treated us, less the loss of life 
     <lb/>
     and property. Let us examine the report. It starts 
     <lb/>
     with a history time forbids us to go into, so we'll 
     <lb/>
     take things that count for our period. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I'll first quote paragraph 218: "The credit 
     <lb/>
     system might have disappeared without direct 
     <lb/>
     intervention by the government, had an attempt 
     <lb/>
     been made to train the people to independence."<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
     Let's see what the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     did to train them. Never in the history of this 
     <lb/>
     island was the chance better to train our people 
     <lb/>
     in independence. The dole could have been a 
     <lb/>
     blessing in disguise, for it was the first time in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland history that poor people had a 
     <lb/>
     regular income, and this is what could and should 
     <lb/>
     be done. It could have been tried out on a small 
     <lb/>
     scale. First, two of us were sent into St. John's by 
     <lb/>
     the people of Trinity South in 1939 because 
     <lb/>
     things had come to such a pass that life was 
     <lb/>
     unbearable, owing to mismanagement by those 
 

   
  
            <cb/>
          

     in authority. The flour was full of weevils and 
     <lb/>
     rope— unpalatable, nauseating. I knew what was 
     <lb/>
     the matter, as from 18 to 24 years of age I had 
     <lb/>
     been at sea, three years of that in the grain trade, 
     <lb/>
     sometimes at sea for 117 days. If your flour tanks 
     <lb/>
     weren't steamed at least once a year, the weevils 
     <lb/>
     would over-top you and in the flour tanks you had 
     <lb/>
     more weevils than flour. The flour was good but 
     <lb/>
     a high wheat content, which lends easily to rope 
     <lb/>
     and weevils. I visited the Furness sheds. The 
     <lb/>
     sheds in August were packed to the metal roofs 
     <lb/>
     with flour which had been there nearly a month, 
     <lb/>
     although we had nearly a weekly service to the 
     <lb/>
     old country, and in the summer months only a 
     <lb/>
     monthly supply of flour should be kept on hand. 
     <lb/>
     The winter it did not matter, as the cold weather 
     <lb/>
     would keep the flour in good condition. I con<lb break="no"/>tacted those in authority but could not get to see 
     <lb/>
     them, although 11,000 people had sent me in 
     <lb/>
     from the Broads to Lead Cove. That was the 
     <lb/>
     fatherly, beneficial dictatorship we were under! I 
     <lb/>
     saw a few heads of departments, but no soap. We 
     <lb/>
     saw the Commissioner for Natural Resources, 
     <lb/>
     and here I come to where our people could have 
     <lb/>
     been lifted out of this credit system. We had an 
     <lb/>
     income even if it was only six cents per day, but 
     <lb/>
     how did we get it? First go to the little dictator, 
     <lb/>
     the relieving officer, with a note; and then to the 
     <lb/>
     local peddler who had friends at court. Mind you, 
     <lb/>
     they were sure you would not learn anything, no, 
     <lb/>
     you weren't grown up. Consequently, you could 
     <lb/>
     only turn in your note at the peddler and take out 
     <lb/>
     the bit of pork, the bit of tea, sugar, beef and last 
     <lb/>
     but not least, the weevilly flour— good flour that 
     <lb/>
     was spoiled by the indifference and ignorance of 
     <lb/>
     the Department of Public Health and Welfare. 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p>While travelling from Winterton to Hant's 
     <lb/>Harbour I came across a small party, two cars. 
     <lb/>They were boiling up. I made enquiries and found 
     <lb/>out it was the Whitfield Laite Baritone Troupe, 
     <lb/>"baritoning", singing the glories of co-operation 
     <lb/>to a starving people. I had just done about 150 
     <lb/>miles, a lot of it on foot; I had an intimate close-up 
     <lb/>of every village from Lead Cove to the Broads, 
     <lb/>had figures on how TB had increased in each 
     <lb/>village. I was not in a good frame of mind, 
     <lb/>because the thought struck me forcibly that I was 
     <lb/>always intrigued with the idea of Nero fiddling 
     <lb/>while Rome burnt, but I never thought I would 
     <lb/>see Newfoundland starve while Laite "baritoned".

     When we came into St. John's we saw the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner for Natural Resources as I found out he 
     <lb/>
     was responsible for this campaign. I lit into him, 
     <lb/>
     as I was interested in co-ops; I was on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador when Dr. Grenfell put one there, and I 
     <lb/>
     had studied it in both Bristol and Glasgow. The 
     <lb/>
     outcome was Mr. Gorvin asked me if I would take 
     <lb/>
     up fieldwork, I said, "Yes, you give me October 
     <lb/>
     and September cheques for Chelsea and Hant's 
     <lb/>
     Harbour and I'll go over and form up a committee 
     <lb/>
     in both places, hire a truck and go to Carbonear, 
     <lb/>
     buy wholesale and distribute the whack for each 
     <lb/>
     month, then the people will understand what co<lb break="no"/>operation means, and no other way. You'll find 
     <lb/>
     out the six cents will feed the larger family and 
     <lb/>
     the smaller family will be a lot better off." He told 
     <lb/>
     me he could not do it, he was trying it out on the 
     <lb/>
     south coast. There it ended, and the hellish con<lb break="no"/>ditions went on until the war came and I went 
     <lb/>
     away. Mr. Gorvin informed me the government 
     <lb/>
     was behind the co-op. I said, "Yes, but a long way 
     <lb/>
     behind." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Why in heaven's name was this colossal fraud 
     <lb/>
     worked on us? All the investigations, all the 
     <lb/>
     promises, and here was a chance for a people to 
     <lb/>
     help themselves. We had the men who were 
     <lb/>
     prepared to work without a cent. I wanted noth<lb break="no"/>ing, only the dole I was getting, for it was a pet 
     <lb/>
     scheme of mine; but if I was prepared to give up 
     <lb/>
     leading the people, a job would be found for me. 
     <lb/>
     No thank you! I don't take the nod. Our credit 
     <lb/>
     system was "an unmitigated evil, breeding 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty, extravagance, luxury (mind you), 
     <lb/>
     carelessness, recklessness regarding the future, 
     <lb/>
     want of energy, laziness and dependence among 
     <lb/>
     large sections of a naturally well-endowed hardy 
     <lb/>
     and able people."<ref target="#fn_11">[1]</ref> That's the charge, but what did 
     <lb/>
     they do to stop it? Sent around a baritone troupe, 
     <lb/>
     put everything into the peddler's hands, so in 
     <lb/>
     January he could count his profits until next 
     <lb/>
     January. You can be sure nobody was going to 
     <lb/>
     get an outfit under these conditions. I have always 
     <lb/>
     said if the mother country had had our interests 
     <lb/>
     at heart, she would never have given this form of 
     <lb/>
     government, but it seems like we have got into 
     <lb/>
     the old girl's hair too often, and this generation 
     <lb/>
     was going to take it and like it. I have stated, and 
     <lb/>
     I'm still of the opinion, the least we should have 
   

            <cb/>
     

     had was a modified form of North of Ireland 
     <lb/>
     status, where we would have had a say in our 
     <lb/>
     local affairs. If our politicians were as black as 
     <lb/>
     they were painted by those titled nincompoops, 
     <lb/>
     then could you cure it by taking away from us the 
     <lb/>
     only school we could learn in? It's like examining 
     <lb/>
     a schoolboy and finding out he was behind in his 
     <lb/>
     grades and, because that was the case, closing up 
     <lb/>
     the school. Can you tell me that a country that had 
     <lb/>
     come up through parliamentary procedure for 
     <lb/>
     1,000 years, and had a parliamentary history so 
     <lb/>
     juicy it would make ours look like the Lord's 
     <lb/>
     Prayer in comparison, now that they had a chance 
     <lb/>
     to put in a normal school and teach us, what did 
     <lb/>
     they do? They closed up the little red schoolhouse 
     <lb/>
     of democracy we had, and for that and the treat<lb break="no"/>ment we have had for the last two years, I'll  never 
     <lb/>
     forgive a Britisher. Had they come in, given us 
     <lb/>
     the right to manage our own local affairs, ad<lb break="no"/>justed our currency to our markets by putting in 
     <lb/>
     a national bank, and taking the load off the fisher<lb break="no"/>men who had to carry the weight of selling in a 
     <lb/>
     cheap currency market and buying a dear money 
     <lb/>
     market — we, the fishermen, were ground down 
     <lb/>
     by those two opposing forces, aided and abetted 
     <lb/>
     by an obstinate limey bureaucracy. We have to 
     <lb/>
     get divorced from the dear Canadian dollar. If 
     <lb/>
     markets can't be found in Canada for our 
     <lb/>
     products, then we have got to have a currency 
     <lb/>
     either tied to the pound where we sell, and where 
     <lb/>
     we can buy when things get to normal, or else 
     <lb/>
     with the US, where we can buy and sell. This 
     <lb/>
     must be the duty of whatever government is 
     <lb/>
     elected, Commission or responsible, if con<lb break="no"/>federation is turned down. We cannot go on turn<lb break="no"/>ing cheap drachmas, lira and other cheap 
     <lb/>
     currency into dear Canadian dollars, and only 
     <lb/>
     buy for cash in one market. Remember it's not 
     <lb/>
     going to be a seller's market all the time, and 
     <lb/>
     we'll have to trim our sails to suit the breeze. 
     <lb/>
     Barter will be coming more and more. Had we 
     <lb/>
     turned to barter in '33, things would not have 
     <lb/>
     been so hard with us. Ten years from now you are 
     <lb/>
     going to find a different world.

     school. Now let us ask ourselves some questions. 
     <lb/>
     We have had five years, ten years, 50 years 
     <lb/>
     without representative government, what then? Is 
     <lb/>
     the imperial government so naive that a group of 
     <lb/>
     citizens is going to grow up in Newfoundland that 
     <lb/>
     are going to jump in and after 14 years under the 
     <lb/>
     dictates of a dictatorship, be Sir Robert Bonds, 
     <lb/>
     Gladstones and Lloyd Georges? Even those 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners took some of those politicians 
     <lb/>
     they blackened and who, if the people had to 
     <lb/>
     elect, would not have elected them. What in 
     <lb/>
     heaven's name was going to happen when this 
     <lb/>
     rest period was over? I suppose the smiling lord 
     <lb/>
     envisaged such a good government, that when the 
     <lb/>
     period was up we would be all saints, and after 
     <lb/>
     this 14 year period we would automatically, like 
     <lb/>
     a child, copy our elders. But what have we had? 
     <lb/>
     I'll admit the Commission of Government has 
     <lb/>
     done some good — Napoleon did that, so did 
     <lb/>
     Hitler — and I want every red-blooded New<lb break="no"/>foundlander to weigh it up. Did the bad outweigh 
     <lb/>
     the good, or vice versa? I am the last one in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to pat our old politicians on the 
     <lb/>
     back. Parliamentary procedure won't allow me to 
     <lb/>
     say what I thought about them. A lot was good 
     <lb/>
     according to their time and place. They did a lot 
     <lb/>
     with a little. That you got to hand to them, but as 
     <lb/>
     fit to govern, no, and in the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Canada today the same old game is going on. I 
     <lb/>
     have seen some juicy things that would open your 
     <lb/>
     eyes, and things in Britain that were not so hot. 
     <lb/>
     There was the little story of our bonds, and this 
     <lb/>
     National Convention would not be held today if 
     <lb/>
     the Swedes had been as foolish as other govern<lb break="no"/>ments. The world would be likely singing 
     <lb/>
     "Deutschland Uber Alles". You know there is no 
     <lb/>
     Iron Curtain for a sailor, he gets inside it. Now 
     <lb/>
     come back home, we suffered from too much 
     <lb/>
     selfishness, that both in the high and low. In fact 
     <lb/>
     to put it mildly we got the type of government we 
     <lb/>
     deserved, and I believe the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government has done some good in that they 
     <lb/>
     have taught us a lesson. But did we get a rest from 
     <lb/>
     politics? Although none of those men had to face 
     <lb/>
     the electorate, yet we find public wharves built 
     <lb/>
     where there were only two boats, while other 
     <lb/>
     wharves, one costing $80,000, went into discard. 
     <lb/>
     It cost $1 million to build a railroad from Whit<lb break="no"/>bourne to Heart's Content under those politicians 
     <lb/>
     playing dirty politics, yet it cost $223,000 to build 
     <lb/>
     a road on the railroad bed and they have no road 
 

            <cb/>
         

     there yet. I was told in England one of the finest 
     <lb/>
     rows in Parliament was because up to that time, 
     <lb/>
     1939, every mile of road in Newfoundland had 
     <lb/>
     cost $20,000 for labour and $10,000 for 
     <lb/>
     machinery. They asked if it was golden roads, so 
     <lb/>
     my informant told me. We did not find any great 
     <lb/>
     amount of machinery on the Transportation 
     <lb/>
     Committee. We don't know how this works. I 
     <lb/>
     don't... There isn't anybody to question it and 
     <lb/>
     after it's done there is no questioning it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Department of Natural Resources recent<lb break="no"/>ly sold two loads of herring, one 278,000 pounds, 
     <lb/>
     the other 268,000 pounds, to a Canadian fishing 
     <lb/>
     firm, to catch fish in competition with us, with 
     <lb/>
     bait from bait depots built and kept up with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland taxpayers' money; and it's no use 
     <lb/>
     for the department to say they made a profit, 
     <lb/>
     because you could not catch fish enough to pay 
     <lb/>
     for the bait when you come to consider what it 
     <lb/>
     costs to construct and run a bait depot — frenzied 
     <lb/>
     finance! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have before me two documents — one a 
     <lb/>
     report on Public Health and Welfare, which never 
     <lb/>
     was debated because we have another which is 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">sub judice</hi>. I don't know what this hambone Latin 
     <lb/>
     is, but it looks <hi rendition="simple:italic">sub juicy</hi> to me. We were promised 
     <lb/>
     when we took it that there was an investigation 
     <lb/>
     on and that we, in time, would hear all about it. 
     <lb/>
     Well, it is dated March, 1946. Two years is long 
     <lb/>
     enough to have something like this cleared up. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot recommend this form of government to 
     <lb/>
     the people. There are all sorts of rumours out 
     <lb/>
     about it running anywhere from $100,000 to $1 
     <lb/>
     million adrift. The Auditor General says a final 
     <lb/>
     and definite opinion cannot be recorded by him, 
     <lb/>
     as to the causes of errors and omissions without 
     <lb/>
     investigating matters which are outside his 
     <lb/>
     proper functions. The Auditor General says it is 
     <lb/>
     his duty to inform the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that in his view the time has come for an 
     <lb/>
     enquiry to be made. Well, we were informed an 
     <lb/>
     enquiry was going to be made and we would 
     <lb/>
     know the outcome of it, but that's as far as it has 
     <lb/>
     gone. I think myself it's unfair for this stuff to be 
     <lb/>
     around charging people. If an investigation has 
     <lb/>
     been held we should be told about it, the innocent 
     <lb/>
     cleared, the guilty punished — or the Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General told he was getting off a lot of hot air. 
     <lb/>
     It's not possible that any graft is going on in a 
     <lb/>
     government the country believes is clear of those 
     <lb/>
     things — that could only happen under crooked

     politicians and in responsible government. Per<lb break="no"/>haps we did not get such a bargain in giving up 
     <lb/>
     responsible government after all. I always looked 
     <lb/>
     upon this government as being as our Indian 
     <lb/>
     friends would say, pukka, but I must admit I have 
     <lb/>
     been terribly disillusioned since coming into the 
     <lb/>
     National Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Take the supplies. It's no secret that some 
     <lb/>
     sections of the country could not get sugar 
     <lb/>
     enough to fill their rations, while others could buy 
     <lb/>
     it by the sack. If this is the best the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government could do, then I don't think we 
     <lb/>
     did much better by not following the old way, for 
     <lb/>
     the Good Book says, he that is faithful in the wee 
     <lb/>
     things will be faithful in the greater. That can go 
     <lb/>
     just as well in reverse. Anyway, I would like a 
     <lb/>
     look at St. Peter's private log on the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government. Only then would I be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that everything is oak and copper-fastened. I 
     <lb/>
     think one should have an opposition in a govern<lb break="no"/>ment. At least you would learn how it was work<lb break="no"/>ing, and sometimes you would find out about the 
     <lb/>
     minor graft, even if the big got away on you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We'll not forget the construction of the bases 
     <lb/>
     — 60 cents for a Newfie driving a truck, if he had 
     <lb/>
     no accident; and 50 cents per hour if he had an 
     <lb/>
     accident; while his opposite number from the US 
     <lb/>
     was doing the same job for $1.10. Now the 
     <lb/>
     powers that be could not get around that. They 
     <lb/>
     had to keep the Newfie down. It's a crime for a 
     <lb/>
     Newfie to have or get a dollar. How easy to let 
     <lb/>
     him get all the traffic could bear and then clap on 
     <lb/>
     a 20% income tax. If traffic was dislocated on the 
     <lb/>
     railroad or along the street, the income tax could 
     <lb/>
     take up the slack. Today all over the world, it is 
     <lb/>
     talked about how the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     treated their people, and would not have money 
     <lb/>
     in their country when it was to be had for the 
     <lb/>
     asking. I expect any day now to see one of those 
     <lb/>
     vaporous terms that Newfoundland won't take 
     <lb/>
     only $5 per quintal for fish. It may dislocate 
     <lb/>
     something — brains, common sense, con<lb break="no"/>spicuous by its absence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have tried to show, Mr. Chairman, that to my 
     <lb/>
     mind anybody that votes for this form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment really has no knowledge of men, let alone 
     <lb/>
     of government. I'm sorry I've got to adopt it or 
     <lb/>
     whatever we've got to do with it, for I'm still at 
     <lb/>
     sea, but I guess with those famous terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence, I have to do something with it; but it won't 
     <lb/>
     be to vote for it, for I have never recognised it as 


            <cb/>
         

     a body governing me, and I never will. It is 
     <lb/>
     undemocratic, it is contrary to the laws of God 
     <lb/>
     and man what Great Britain did to her own; she 
     <lb/>
     did little worse when Pitt charged her with turn<lb break="no"/>ing loose the tommyhawk and the scalping knives 
     <lb/>
     of the Indians on our own blood in the war of the 
     <lb/>
     American Revolution; and until she repairs the 
     <lb/>
     wrong she has done, mother or not, she will 
     <lb/>
     always be to me Perfidious Albion. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I put in from 1931 to 1933 in the depression 
     <lb/>
     days in the United States. I was fishing and my 
     <lb/>
     wages as a fisherman were $387.78 a year. My 
     <lb/>
     family ate dole under responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     Then I went to Halifax. It was the same thing 
     <lb/>
     there. I came back here. We had an insurance 
     <lb/>
     policy. We ate that. In 1937 I headed three miles 
     <lb/>
     for the dole. I expect I am the only man on the 
     <lb/>
     floor who ate the dole. I went through it. I had 
     <lb/>
     spent my lifetime at sea. As long as there was any 
     <lb/>
     place where I could make a living, I did not care 
     <lb/>
     where it was, whether it was Patagonia or Geor<lb break="no"/>gia, I felt that the world was behind me. There 
     <lb/>
     came a time when every part of the world was 
     <lb/>
     alike and wherever I went, the most I could hope 
     <lb/>
     to get was $25 a month, if I got that. I was fishing 
     <lb/>
     out of the United States and we had 88,000 
     <lb/>
     pounds of fish in the hold waiting for a chance to 
     <lb/>
     dump it. I had to take a crust of bread out of the 
     <lb/>
     gum box and dry it on the stove and eat it. I have 
     <lb/>
     seen it done. When I came back here, I struck the 
     <lb/>
     same thing. I had never looked after my land or 
     <lb/>
     anything else. Our family was small. My land 
     <lb/>
     was down, but I said, "If I can live so long, 
     <lb/>
     nobody can starve me now." I went to work on 
     <lb/>
     the land. I know the feeling of getting up in the 
     <lb/>
     morning and taking two slices of that black mink 
     <lb/>
     and wash it down with switchel tea; then swing a 
     <lb/>
     pick on the rocks, trying to clear the land. I tell 
     <lb/>
     you, after two hours of that, I have seen the flying 
     <lb/>
     saucers before anyone else ever saw them. It is 
     <lb/>
     no laughing matter. This is the reason I am here 
     <lb/>
     — that is why I came in through that door — if I 
     <lb/>
     do not go through it one of those days. I am in 
     <lb/>
     earnest. I know what it is like. I cannot only stand 
     <lb/>
     up here and tell about John Doe's beri-beri. I 
     <lb/>
     know what it is myself. I know what the fisher<lb break="no"/>men went through. The Commission government 
     <lb/>
     lost us $2 on every quintal of fish we caught, 
     <lb/>
     through the rate of exchange. It was power 
     <lb/>
     politics. We went through it. I went on until the 
     <lb/>
     war broke out. I came over here with 50 cents in 


            <pb n="1276" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-20_Page_1276.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1276</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
      

     my pocket, and there was 50 cents in the house. 
     <lb/>
     I went to the Newfoundland Hotel; I knew Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Stafford and I got my dinner. Then I got out of 
     <lb/>
     the country, and thank God, luck has been with 
     <lb/>
     me ever since. But I had to go aboard a Greek 
     <lb/>
     ship to get a job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The other day we had here one of the best 
     <lb/>
     bargains in a ship that Newfoundland ever had, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not need anyone to tell me anything 
     <lb/>
     about ships. I went up and I saw the Commisioner 
     <lb/>
     and I said, "Why not get her?" I was told that they 
     <lb/>
     would investigate the matter. We have a deficit 
     <lb/>
     on the Railway, and here was something that for 
     <lb/>
     the next five years, three at least, would take 
     <lb/>
     $200,000 off the deficit. But, no, that was not 
     <lb/>
     worth bothering about. One of the members of a 
     <lb/>
     firm here who gave me my first job, got the ship 
  

            <cb/>
         

     and is repairing her here in Newfoundland. This 
     <lb/>
     is what we are up against. There are roughly 
     <lb/>
     4,000 seamen here and not 500 of them can get a 
     <lb/>
     job. One of these days depression will strike and 
     <lb/>
     we will have nothing; and when it does, God help 
     <lb/>
     whoever is in charge of this country — whether 
     <lb/>
     it is confederation, Commission or responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. I can assure you, you are not talking 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundlanders like you had in 1939. You 
     <lb/>
     have Newfoundlanders now who know what it is 
     <lb/>
     to have had a dollar. Let us prepare this country 
     <lb/>
     so that we can earn a living. That is why I am 
     <lb/>
     here. And if we do not have a better New<lb break="no"/>foundland in the future, I will stretch rope for it.

            <p>
     January 21, 1948 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have replies to a couple of 
     <lb/>
     questions we directed to Canada, questions, that 
     <lb/>
     is, that were put by me. Some of these I put more 
     <lb/>
     or less on my own, and others in response to 
     <lb/>
     questions by members throughout the debate. 
     <lb/>
     One question was to ask for statistics showing 
     <lb/>
     exports of salt dried codfish from Canada to the 
     <lb/>
     foreign markets over a period of years, together 
     <lb/>
     with some explanation of why salt codfish exports 
     <lb/>
     to the Mediterranean markets have fallen off in 
     <lb/>
     recent years. That answer, sir, is rather long, and 
     <lb/>
     I don't think the copies are on the desks of the 
     <lb/>
     members, and if not they certainly will be. It says: 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Canada's exports of salt cod to countries 
     <lb/>in the Mediterranean area were of consider<lb break="no"/>able extent in the 1925-29 period, when they 
     <lb/>averaged about l5% of total Canadian ex<lb break="no"/>ports of this commodity. The fish involved 
     <lb/>was product of the Gaspé fisheries mainly, 
     <lb/>and almost all of it was exported to the Italian 
     <lb/>market, with negligible quantities to the 
     <lb/>Spanish and Portuguese markets. This trade 
     <lb/>declined after the period mentioned as a 
     <lb/>result of several influences... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Then it goes on to say that the reason it fell off in 
     <lb/>Europe was that the hard times there dried up the 
     <lb/>demand for fish, and because of the sanctions that 
     <lb/>the League of Nations imposed on Italy at the 
     <lb/>time of the Ethopian war. It points out also that 
     <lb/>in the same time period the current exports from 
     <lb/>the Gaspé coast and Newfoundland exports fell 
     <lb/>off at the same time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     There is another question: "Whether, in the 
     <lb/>
     event of union, existing or other privately-owned 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting stations would be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     operate, and what is the policy of the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada as to power output to such private 
     <lb/>
     stations." The answer is short: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The policy of the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     authorities is, receiving the recommendation 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 
     <lb/>
     each case, annually to renew licences for 
     <lb/>
     private commercial broadcasting stations, 
     <lb/>
     unless there is a special reason for non- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     renewal, and to grant new applications for 
     <lb/>
     licences for such stations where they appear 
     <lb/>
     advisable and technically possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A general ceiling of 5 kw on the power of 
     <lb/>
     private commercial broadcasting stations has 
     <lb/>
     been in effect, but there have been exceptions 
     <lb/>
     to this and it is expected higher power will be 
     <lb/>
     allowed in some other cases where it appears 
     <lb/>
     desirable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the event of union the same policies in 
     <lb/>
     these matters would be applied to New<lb break="no"/>foundland as in the rest of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The ceiling of 5 kilowatts is 5,000 watts, which 
     <lb/>
     is ten times more, I think, than any private broad<lb break="no"/>casting station in Newfoundland at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then there is another question: "Whether ex<lb break="no"/>isting specially low rates charged to fishermen 
     <lb/>
     travelling by Railway trains and steamers be<lb break="no"/>tween Newfoundland and Labrador would be 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
