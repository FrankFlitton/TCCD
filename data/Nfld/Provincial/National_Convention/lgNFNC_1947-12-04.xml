<!--<p>
     pose a certain course of conduct is carried out; to 
     <lb/>
     carry that into effect, I will avail myself of my 
     <lb/>
     rights to appoint a special committee for that 
     <lb/>
     purpose. I might be put in a position where I 
     <lb/>
     would have to appoint a committee when mem<lb break="no"/>bers could accomplish the very same thing. If I 
     <lb/>
     am forced to do it, I certainly will appoint a 
     <lb/>
     Special committee to deal with future procedure 
     <lb/>
     of the matter now before the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am agreeable to the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee, but I would say that any suggestion 
     <lb/>
     or any decision should be a decision by the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, and not the Steering Committee. That is 
     <lb/>
     turning it into something it was never intended to 
     <lb/>
     be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The Convention has to make the 
     <lb/>
     decision.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are anticipating too much. 
     <lb/>
     I am asking the Steering Committee to meet me 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of discussing matters which have 
     <lb/>
     arisen this evening and which are not going to be 
     <lb/>
     resolved unless and until some course of proce- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     dure is adopted. To that end, therefore, the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Steering Committee, not as a Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee at all, but rather in the status of an 
     <lb/>
     advisory committee are asked to meet me in the 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to try and find some means whereby 
     <lb/>
     the Convention members may be facilitated in the 
     <lb/>
     discharging of the duties assigned to them, in 
     <lb/>
     particular in regard to the business now before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. Surely there is nothing wrong about that. 
     <lb/>
     We will meet to consider and recommend. I have 
     <lb/>
     not attempted to force anything on this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. Recommendations will be made; if the Con<lb break="no"/>vention sees fit to adopt them, all right; if they see 
     <lb/>
     fit to throw them out, well and good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I move the adjournment until 3 pm

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, the wording 
     <lb/>
     adopted by Mr. Hollett in that question of which 
     <lb/>
     he gives notice is different from that used in the 
     <lb/>
     other questions. All other questions up to this one 
     <lb/>
     have been as from some member of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. This one puts it as from the Convention 
     <lb/>
     itself. I have wondered, with regard to all the 
     <lb/>
     questions to be forwarded to the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, whether those were to be regarded as 
     <lb/>
     having come from the Convention or from in<lb break="no"/>dividual members. In the case of Mr. Hollett's 
     <lb/>
     question, it is so worded as to have it come from 


<note xml:id="fn_01">1 Volume II:520. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>

     the Convention as a whole, and not merely from 
     <lb/>
     one member and I wonder if Mr. Hollett meant it 
     <lb/>
     to be that way, or was that a thought that he did 
     <lb/>
     not have in mind at all? 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> All questions come from the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, if I might reply to 
     <lb/>that. As you know, the question arises from a 
     <lb/>meeting of the Steering Committee, which was 
     <lb/>held yesterday afternoon, and that Committee 
     <lb/>agreed such information should be obtained. I 
     <lb/>therefore felt it was proper that the enquiry 
     <lb/>should be laid on the table to be passed on to the 
     <lb/>Department of External Affairs. I left it therefore 
     <lb/>to your discretion, as to whether it should go or 
     <lb/>not. That's why I worded it that way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, Mr. Hollett, and 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood, obviously the final pronounce<lb break="no"/>ment upon the matter must of necessity be made 
     <lb/>by the Information Committee, and anything I 
     <lb/>say at this time is not necessarily binding upon its 
     <lb/>members. As I see this question, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>I see nothing whatever the matter with it. It begins 
     <lb/>with the covering words, "I give notice that I will 
     <lb/>on tomorrow...", and then it goes on to say, "Now 
     <lb/>therefore will the said Department of External 
     <lb/>Affairs inform the National Convention...." Here 
     <lb/>is information sought by a member of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention to be placed before the Convention as a 
     <lb/>whole. I don't see how this can be construed as 
     <lb/>being a request from the Convention. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>Mr. Chairman That's all there is to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> My understanding was that the 
     <lb/>Convention desires to know something, that 
     <lb/>those words appear in it. Not the questioner, but 
     <lb/>the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, unless I am reading the 
     <lb/>thing altogether wrong. Here is a question.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I am not objecting to the 
     <lb/>question, you understand. As I heard it read, there 
     <lb/>occurred in it words to the effect the the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion desired certain information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, put simply Mr. Hollett re<lb break="no"/>quests the Department of External Affairs, 
     <lb/>through His Excellency the Governor, to furnish 
 

            <cb/>
         

     this Convention with certain information. He re<lb break="no"/>quests it. <hi rendition="simple:italic">He</hi> requests that certain information be 
     <lb/>
     forwarded to this Convention. That cannot pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be construed as a request from the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi>.... The final say upon the question 
     <lb/>
     rests with the Information Committee, but at the 
     <lb/>
     moment I see nothing wrong with it. 
     <lb/>
     
       </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, isn't it properly a 
     <lb/>question for the Information Committee? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, except that Mr. Hollett has 
     <lb/>asked me to express an opinion at this time; and 
     <lb/>also arising out of the point raised by 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood, I felt I might go beyond my job 
     <lb/>and express my opinion on it. The matter will 
     <lb/>come before the Information Committee tomor<lb break="no"/>row, as I said before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Mr. Chairman. I am not quite right 
     <lb/>on the powers of the Information Committee. 
     <lb/>Maybe I have developed an entirely different 
     <lb/>opinion of what its powers were: but as I remem<lb break="no"/>ber, its duties were to see that there was no 
     <lb/>repetition of questions. Not only that, but they 
     <lb/>would direct the questions to the proper division 
     <lb/>of government, or to the proper government in 
     <lb/>this case, and, as I remember it, that is as far as 
     <lb/>their authority went. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are wrong on the second 
     <lb/>point. The Information Committee can be 
     <lb/>responsible for directing specifically requested 
     <lb/>information into the hands of any particular offi<lb break="no"/>cial or officials. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Well, sir, that's how I remember it. 
     <lb/>Some questions might be termed "double-bar<lb break="no"/>relled", and the Committee were to send the 
     <lb/>relevant portion to one department and the same 
     <lb/>with the balance to the other department; but as I 
     <lb/>see it they have no power whatever to interfere in 
     <lb/>any questions that are put by the delegates to this 
     <lb/>Convention, and that is what is happening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't know what you mean by 
     <lb/>interfering. This Information Committee was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, I understand, by my predecessor, 
     <lb/>Mr. Justice Fox, at the request of the government, 
     <lb/>who decided that there had to be some sort of a 
     <lb/>sifting arrangement set up. In fact, if I am proper<lb break="no"/>ly informed, they declined to answer or to deal 
     <lb/>with any questions unless they were first dealt 
     <lb/>with by a subcommittee of the Convention. To 
     <lb/>that end an Information Committee was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by Mr. Justice Fox, and its duty is to 
     <lb/>avoid repetition and to otherwise facilitate the

     Convention and the government in obtaining any 
     <lb/>
     information which may be requested from the 
     <lb/>
     government by members of the Convention. But 
     <lb/>
     to say that it is the duty of the Information Com<lb break="no"/>mittee to decide whether or not a question shall 
     <lb/>
     go to a particular department, I think that you are 
     <lb/>
     grossly misinformed on that point. It is not for us 
     <lb/>
     at all. If the question is addressed to the Governor 
     <lb/>
    in Commission, it goes to the Secretary of the 
     <lb/>Commission of Government, and it is his duty, 
     <lb/>not ours, to have it brought before the department 
     <lb/>or departments which might be primarily con<lb break="no"/>cerned with furnishing the information in ques<lb break="no"/>tion.

            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I might say, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     originally these questions were put in this man<lb break="no"/>ner: "That I do ask the department of government 
     <lb/>
     concerned...", and not even any department was 
     <lb/>
     named when the question was put, and that, as I 
     <lb/>
     understood it, was one of the duties of the Infor<lb break="no"/>mation Committee. Now with regards to the for<lb break="no"/>mation of that Committee... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It may be your understanding, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Miller, but it is not mine, and that is not how 
     <lb/>
     it is going to happen while I am here. We are not 


            <cb/>
        

     going to decide whose province it is to answer 
     <lb/>
     these questions. Let it go forward to the Governor 
     <lb/>
     in Commission, and let them decide whose 
     <lb/>
     province it is to answer it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Well, it is all a matter of record, and 
     <lb/>
     I do ask, so that I may not in any way conflict, 
     <lb/>
     that the secretariat of the Convention be asked to 
     <lb/>
     lay that particular motion, or that particular 
     <lb/>
     minute that dealt with that somewhat over a year 
     <lb/>
     ago, before the members now, so that we can be 
     <lb/>
     in a refreshed position on it. I don't want to do 
     <lb/>
     anything contrary to your rules, but if that's a 
     <lb/>
     motion of this Convention then it is a standing 
     <lb/>
     rule of the Convention, and no one can go beyond 
     <lb/>
     the authority of that Information Committee. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Are you questioning the in<lb break="no"/>tegrity of the Chair, or the integrity of the Infor<lb break="no"/>mation Committee?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I am referring entirely to the Infor<lb break="no"/>mation Committee, Mr. Chairman.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you want this thing re-opened

     you will have to have notice of question.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I will do that.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will require at least 24 hours

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, when we rose 
     <lb/>
     on Tuesday night we had been discussing Annex 
     <lb/>
     IV of the Grey Book, which set forth the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government's estimate of what we 
     <lb/>
     would collect from the people in taxes in New<lb break="no"/>foundland if we became a province, and also what 
     <lb/>
     they estimate they would spend in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     if we became a province. In the course of the 
     <lb/>
     debate, Major Cashin particularly, and Mr. Job 
     <lb/>
     also, expressed the feeling that the estimates 
     <lb/>
     provided by the Canadian government on those 
     <lb/>
     two matters were not sufficiently accurate and 
     <lb/>
     comprehensive, or in sufficient detail in some 
     <lb/>
     respects. So the feeling seemed to develop 
     <lb/>
     amongst some delegates that the matter should be 
     <lb/>
     looked into, and for that reason no public or 
     <lb/>
     private session of the Convention was held 
     <lb/>
     yesterday. Instead a meeting of the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee was held, and I think I may say that 
     <lb/>
     the result of yesterday's Steering Committee 
     <lb/>
     meetings was shown this afternoon, when Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin gave notice of these questions bearing on 
  

            <cb/>
        

     the Canadian government's estimates of what it 
     <lb/>
     would collect in the way of revenue from New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and in the next place by Mr. Hollett's 
     <lb/>
     notice of question directed to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government, asking them for more details of that 
     <lb/>
     amount of $9.4 million which the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government estimates it would spend here. There 
     <lb/>
     was a feeling in the Steering Committee meeting 
     <lb/>
     that it might take some time for the governments 
     <lb/>
     to furnish the information which Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Hollett request ... and that therefore it 
     <lb/>
     would be impossible, or at least not very practi<lb break="no"/>cal, to proceed with the debate on the financial 
     <lb/>
     aspects of these terms, or of this Grey Book, until 
     <lb/>
     that information is forthcoming, and that we 
     <lb/>
     would in the meantime postpone our debate on 
     <lb/>
     these financial aspects. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There was a further thought that although it 
     <lb/>
     was not practical to go ahead with the debate 
     <lb/>
     from a federal standpoint, it might be practical to 
     <lb/>
     go ahead with the debate from the purely provin<lb break="no"/>cial standpoint, that is what would likely be the 


            <pb n="948" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-04_Page_0948.jpg"/>

     provincial government's revenues and expendi<lb break="no"/>tures, since that that might be ready by Monday 
     <lb/>
     next; but that until Monday next it would not be 
     <lb/>
     practical to proceed even with the provincial 
     <lb/>
     finances. Therefore, as there remained a number 
     <lb/>
     of matters of considerable importance in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with this whole confederation question, a 
     <lb/>
     number of matters of importance in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books, we would save time while waiting to 
     <lb/>
     receive the information requested if we 
     <lb/>
     proceeded to discuss some of these other matters 
     <lb/>
     that are in the Black Books, that we have not as 
     <lb/>
     yet touched on.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No one wants anyone to begin at the first page 
     <lb/>
     of the first volume and plod all the way through 
     <lb/>
     to the last page of the second volume. I don't 
     <lb/>
     think any one of us or the country would be very 
     <lb/>
     much the wiser. So there is no purpose in our 
     <lb/>
     doing that, but rather we should take some of the 
     <lb/>
     matters that are in the Black Books.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now in Volume 1, on page 2, there is a list of 
     <lb/>
     contents of chapter 3 — functions of certain 
     <lb/>
     federal boards, agencies, and offices, etc. I don't 
     <lb/>
     know that there would be any particular value to 
     <lb/>
     anyone to wade all the way through that, but there 
     <lb/>
     are, as I see it, six or seven of these matters that 
     <lb/>
     seem as though they might have some impor<lb break="no"/>tance, which we might take up. I was thinking, 
     <lb/>
     for example, of the Canadian Broadcasting Cor<lb break="no"/>poration; another one, the Civil Service Commis<lb break="no"/>sion; and another, the Foreign Exchange Control 
     <lb/>
     Board, and the National Film Board, the National 
     <lb/>
     Harbours Board, the National Research Council, 
     <lb/>
     and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I 
     <lb/>
     thought that we might take up these and go 
     <lb/>
     through them and then turn to some other 
     <lb/>
     matters. New page 105 of the Black Book deals 
     <lb/>
     with the first matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ex<lb break="no"/>ists under an act of 1936. The Corporation has 
     <lb/>
     two principal jobs: "(1) To carry on a national 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting service within the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada; (2) to regulate and control all 
     <lb/>
     programs...." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....I don't know, sir, that there is anything else 
     <lb/>
     in that section that is worth reading. It is not a 
     <lb/>
     particularly important matter, probably we could 
     <lb/>
     move on to another one if no one has anything to 
     <lb/>
     say on it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why not go over to page 137 of the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book? It is a very important matter I think.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What is it?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Excise taxes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, we had a meet<lb break="no"/>ing of the Steering Committee yesterday, as you 
     <lb/>
     know, and it was agreed that finance and taxes 
     <lb/>
     would be held over until we get this informa<lb break="no"/>tion... We have a lot of things in these books that 
     <lb/>
     we can take up without going into a question of 
     <lb/>
     taxation. I suggest strongly that we drop the 
     <lb/>
     matter of taxation now. When it is dealt with let 
     <lb/>
     it all be dealt with at the one time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> May I rise to a point of order? Not 
     <lb/>
     exactly a point of order, but I don't entirely agree 
     <lb/>
     with the statement which my friend 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has made about the agreement 
     <lb/>
     reached about financial matters not being dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. I do agree if he will state this: that the 
     <lb/>
     discussion of federal revenues and expenditures 
     <lb/>
     would not be discussed, and also a discussion of 
     <lb/>
     the matter touching our proposed budget which 
     <lb/>
     might be brought in by the Ottawa delegation, but 
     <lb/>
     surely this matter which Mr. Higgins has just 
     <lb/>
     raised here with regard to customs and excise 
     <lb/>
     tariffs, I am sure that would not in any way, shape 
     <lb/>
     or form interfere with these two matters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, the matter of 
     <lb/>
     taxes is certainly covered in revenue. If we are to 
     <lb/>
     discuss taxes we have to discuss revenue. That is 
     <lb/>
     how revenue is got — through taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> No, Mr. Chairman, I disagree. We 
     <lb/>
     have to find out here what taxes, duties and excise 
     <lb/>
     taxes are, and to what things they apply. We don't 
     <lb/>
     go into the amounts, we certainly find out what 
     <lb/>
     they are and how much they are — not in quan<lb break="no"/>tity, but specific items. l think we should know 
     <lb/>
     that. We don't know what they are around here, 
     <lb/>
     because we have never had them. We have never 
     <lb/>
     had excise duties or excise taxes. We have had 
     <lb/>
     excise on a couple of things only. Now we have 
     <lb/>
     excise duties and excise taxes to consider, and I 
     <lb/>
     think we should know what they are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree with Mr. Higgins that 
     <lb/>
     we have got to know these things. The only 
     <lb/>
     question is, when is the time? It was agreed 
     <lb/>
     yesterday, with one man dissenting... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> There was no disagreement, sir. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It was generally agreed that 
     <lb/>until this information was obtained this matter 
     <lb/>would be left over. Now why take it up a bit at a 
     <lb/>time? Why not wait until all the question is before

     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> This in no wise prevents your 
     <lb/>referring to it later on. It is merely letting the 
     <lb/>house and the people understand what it means. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I understand very thoroughly 
     <lb/>what Mr. Higgins means. But what is the need for 
     <lb/>us to debate it now when we are going to debate 
     <lb/>it thoroughly later on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, it is much more important 
     <lb/>
     than discussing Canadian broadcasting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If you don't want to discuss 
     <lb/>
     Canadian broadcasting, let's discuss something 
     <lb/>
     else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> What? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What is the good of deciding 
     <lb/>
     something in these private meetings and then go 
     <lb/>
     right back on it again? That's why I did not want 
     <lb/>
     to attend that meeting yesterday. We attended a 
     <lb/>
     meeting the night before, and discussed a lot of 
     <lb/>
     things, and then came in here at a public session 
     <lb/>
     and turned it right upside down again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, may I speak now? I 
     <lb/>
     insist, sir, that there was no agreement at all, and 
     <lb/>
     I don't want to refer back to that Steering Com<lb break="no"/>mittee at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't think I should be put in 
     <lb/>
     a position where I have to rule on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> If I may, if there was any agreement 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever it was the matter of the probable 
     <lb/>
     federal revenues and expenditures, and the prob<lb break="no"/>able budget that one might conjure up if we 
     <lb/>
     became a province. Now these things here to 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Higgins has referred are customs and 
     <lb/>
     excise duties which are in effect at the moment, 
     <lb/>
     and neither Mr. Smallwood nor myself can alter 
     <lb/>
     them, and there is no reason why they should or 
     <lb/>
     may be altered before we enter into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. These are things which are not relevant to 
     <lb/>
     the matters which we cannot discuss before we 
     <lb/>
     get certain information asked for; and I insist that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood is making a misinterpretation, 
     <lb/>
     not intentional I suspect, but there are certain 
     <lb/>
     things there that our people do not know, and I 
     <lb/>
     want them to know, and I hope Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     does that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> There is one thing here that struck 
     <lb/>
     my mind... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you don't mind, Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Bailey, I want to settle the matter before we 
     <lb/>
     go on. It is with the greatest reluctance that I make 
     <lb/>
     any reference at all whatsoever to the meeting of 
 

            <cb/>
          

     the Steering Committee which occurred yester<lb break="no"/>day afternoon; but I feel it is correct to say there 
     <lb/>
     was no unanimity of opinion as to the procedure 
     <lb/>
     to be employed between then, yesterday after<lb break="no"/>noon, and Monday afternoon next. My impres<lb break="no"/>sion is that perhaps a slight majority might have 
     <lb/>
     had what Mr. Smallwood suggests in mind, but I 
     <lb/>
     am quite sure that that was not unanimously 
     <lb/>
     agreed to, because one member very emphatical<lb break="no"/>ly stated that he would not consider himself 
     <lb/>
     bound by any such decision, even if it were 
     <lb/>
     arrived at; and secondly, it will have to be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that a decision of the Steering Committee 
     <lb/>
     is not binding upon the Convention at all. It is a 
     <lb/>
     recommendation as to the procedure to be fol<lb break="no"/>lowed in a given case, which may be accepted or 
     <lb/>
     rejected by the Convention and therefore I do feel 
     <lb/>
     there is no useful purpose to be served in debat<lb break="no"/>ing, or trying to break down the probable 
     <lb/>
     revenues and expenditures as set forth in pages 
     <lb/>
     l5 and 16 of Annex IV, until the information 
     <lb/>
     requested from the various governments and 
     <lb/>
     government departments is forthcoming, and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood introduces his breakdown of the 
     <lb/>
     figures in question. But, Mr. Smallwood, while it 
     <lb/>
     may very well happen that miscellaneous excise 
     <lb/>
     taxes and sources of revenue of $1.5 million is an 
     <lb/>
     item included in the probable revenues estimated 
     <lb/>
     by the federal government, I think that might be 
     <lb/>
     deferred until Monday for the reason that we have 
     <lb/>
     decided, at least I think we ought to decide, to 
     <lb/>
     defer discussion in this matter. But surely, surely, 
     <lb/>
     in discussing the meaning of excise duties, its 
     <lb/>
     effect upon the economy of a country is some<lb break="no"/>thing entirely different from trying to show how 
     <lb/>
     the figure of $l.5 million miscellaneous excise 
     <lb/>
     taxes and other sources of revenue is arrived at 
     <lb/>
     by the federal government. Is there anything 
     <lb/>
     wrong in principle in discussing the meaning of 
     <lb/>
     excise taxes? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Without reference to actual 
     <lb/>
     rates of taxation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How exactly? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why should they be hidden? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, they are not to be hidden. 
     <lb/>
     I am not trying to hide this confederation thing. I 
     <lb/>
     am the last man in Newfoundland to do that.... 
     <lb/>
     Let the guilt lie where it belongs, not on me. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now, now, now! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No sir, there is the accusation 
   

            <pb n="950" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-04_Page_0950.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">950</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
          

     about this thing. If the country wants to know 
     <lb/>
     who is doing the hiding they will hear it some 
     <lb/>
     day! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We don't want any innuendoes 
     <lb/>
     at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, it was thrown at me. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well, the suggestion of Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood is that since this question of excise 
     <lb/>has to be dealt with by him in the breakdown 
     <lb/>which he proposes to introduce into the house on 
     <lb/>Monday, that... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No sir, not on Monday. That's 
     <lb/>
     provincial. Federal is the matter under discussion 
     <lb/>
     just now. But there is this point. Sir, we have here 
     <lb/>
     in this book the Canadian rates of customs and 
     <lb/>
     excise taxes on certain goods. Since that was 
     <lb/>
     prepared many of these have been changed in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Not downward? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Downward, absolutely. Down<lb break="no"/>ward. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Can't you tell us? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I can't tell you because I have 
     <lb/>
     tabled a question asking the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to tell us all the changes that have been 
     <lb/>
     made since they gave us this book. There have 
     <lb/>
     been these multilateral agreements. Canada has 
     <lb/>
     been a party to them. There is a great change in 
     <lb/>
     their rates of taxation, downward in some and 
     <lb/>
     upward in others, and until we get the actual 
     <lb/>
     figures what is the good of debating it now, only 
     <lb/>
     to find that we have to debate it all over again 
     <lb/>
     when we get the new rates? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Isn't this official from Ottawa? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What have we got to go on then, 
     <lb/>
     these are correct? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> We have got to wait six months 
     <lb/>
     until they change their tariffs, is that it? I move 
     <lb/>
     that the matter be discussed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The position is that this 
     <lb/>
     reflected the factual position at the time it was 
     <lb/>
     prepared. It has been suggested by Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood that there has been a change since this was 
     <lb/>
     prepared, by the fact that rates have been reduced 
     <lb/>
     since that time, and therefore, in order to recon<lb break="no"/>cile the "then" position with the "now" position 
     <lb/>
     that he would send a question to the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, and I recall his question going for<lb break="no"/>ward, and he is awaiting the current information 


            <cb/>
          

     from Ottawa before he can intelligently discuss 
     <lb/>
     the question. But if he feels that he cannot discuss 
     <lb/>
     that until he receives this information, Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett, I don't see there is very much point in going 
     <lb/>
     on with it. If we are going to deal with it at all 
     <lb/>
     let's deal with it upon the assumption that it 
     <lb/>
     reflects the actual position, not as it was six 
     <lb/>
     months ago, or as it may be six months time. Let's 
     <lb/>
     take the actual position as it is at the moment. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, may I ask 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood if he enquired of our government 
     <lb/>if there are any changes likely to be made in these 
     <lb/>Newfoundland tariffs or excise taxes? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, I have not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Not interested? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, I am interested; but the 
     <lb/>
     fact of the matter is that since the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada gave us their rates of taxation in certain 
     <lb/>
     matters, since we brought the Black Books down 
     <lb/>
     here, the Government of Canada has entered into 
     <lb/>
     multilateral trade treaties with a large number of 
     <lb/>
     countries, and these reductions in tariff rates are 
     <lb/>
     taking effect from December 31,  this very month. 
     <lb/>
     Now in open session here, I tabled a question 
     <lb/>
     asking the Government of Canada to give us the 
     <lb/>
     correct figures. What is the good of wasting the 
     <lb/>
     country's time, and the Convention's time, talk<lb break="no"/>ing about figures which we know have been 
     <lb/>
     changed, until we get the actual changes? Let's 
     <lb/>
     put our cards on the table, Mr. Chairman. It is 
     <lb/>
     agreed now, right here in this Convention, that 
     <lb/>
     whether we like it or not, that we cannot finish 
     <lb/>
     before December 15. We have got to come back 
     <lb/>
     here in January, and by then we hope to have the 
     <lb/>
     information from the Government of Canada that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett has requested, and the information 
     <lb/>
     that Major Cashin has requested today: and as by 
     <lb/>
     then we will have these corrected figures from 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada on customs and ex<lb break="no"/>cise, then isn't it ordinary downright common<lb break="no"/>sense to put off this question of taxation and 
     <lb/>
     revenue until we have all the facts before us? 
     <lb/>
     Why take it piecemeal? Why do that when we 
     <lb/>
     have so many other things we can ventilate and 
     <lb/>
     debate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> If the Convention wants, I presume 
     <lb/>
     we can have a vote on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Oh, you can have a vote on it, 
     <lb/>
     and if you have a vote on it I could tell you what 
     <lb/>
     the vote will be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a minute, Mr. Smallwood, 
 

            <pb n="951" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-04_Page_0951.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">951</fw>
         

     please. The actual position is that it is the right of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention to raise any question at this time 
     <lb/>
     arising out of the terms received from Canada, all 
     <lb/>
     of which have been read and the business is 
     <lb/>
     before the Chair. I ruled in the beginning and 
     <lb/>
     several times since that members would be free 
     <lb/>
     to revert back to any clause after and when the 
     <lb/>
     document as a whole had been read and con<lb break="no"/>sidered. Now I do feel that until the information 
     <lb/>
     is forthcoming to enable us to make this break<lb break="no"/>down, that there is not much point in going on 
     <lb/>
     with this debate on the aspects of clauses 7-14 
     <lb/>
     inclusive.... If we are going to debate it should be 
     <lb/>
     on the actual position. If these figures are wrong, 
     <lb/>
     or at least out of date, I cannot see much point in 
     <lb/>
     pursuing it. I am not suggesting you cannot 
     <lb/>
     debate it; but unless you are prepared to carry on 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the presupposition that the figures 
     <lb/>
     here are subject to change, there is not much 
     <lb/>
     point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> If there are any changes, we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to make the changes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> This is 1945-46; it is as fair to New<lb break="no"/>foundland as it is to Canada. It is the Customs 
     <lb/>
     returns for 1945-46. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I wonder when we received these 
     <lb/>
     books if they were sitting at Geneva? Why did 
     <lb/>
     not the Canadian authorities make a note that they 
     <lb/>
     would be changing their tariffs? We have the 
     <lb/>
     official report, but by the time we received it, 
     <lb/>
     there was a conference at Geneva by which this 
     <lb/>
     will be changed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It may develop that Canada or 
     <lb/>
     no other country could forecast the outcome. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> They could have put in a note that 
     <lb/>there may be changes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That has been done. The conference 
     <lb/>
     has made public the various tariff changes. And 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland made it in the public press a 
     <lb/>
     couple of weeks ago. I presume the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     changes were not in the press. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have a table sent by the 
     <lb/>
     government of the changes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The Canadian government should 
     <lb/>
     have had courtesy enough to know that we were 
     <lb/>
     discussing these terms or proposals and they 
     <lb/>
     should know that these figures are not sufficient 
     <lb/>
     in any way, shape or form. In other words, that 
     <lb/>
     thing is a fraud. No member of the delegation to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa can attempt to get up here and discuss the 
     <lb/>
     questions to which they should know the 
    

            <cb/>
        

     answers, and be able to explain to us the various 
     <lb/>
     figures in the Grey Book, to the satisfaction of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. I could tell you how long it will take 
     <lb/>
     to get the answers regarding the Customs — in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion and in the opinion of the experts of 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, it will take six months. Are we going to 
     <lb/>
     stay here six months trying to dig up information 
     <lb/>
     from Canada ... when it should be here properly 
     <lb/>
     made out? There is not a correct figure in the 
     <lb/>
     book. These experts at Ottawa faked the figures 
     <lb/>
     in this book as far as the Ottawa delegation is 
     <lb/>
     concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> We are trying to base these terms on 
     <lb/>
     known facts at the time the delegation was in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. I fail to see why changes should be 
     <lb/>
     brought in except where we find anything in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books which may be wrong; then it is our 
     <lb/>
     duty to secure confirmation or contradiction of 
     <lb/>
     the facts. There may be changes in the tariffs in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, changes in the excise duty. After receiv<lb break="no"/>ing particulars of the changes we may debate this 
     <lb/>
     only to find out 12 months from now that there 
     <lb/>
     may be other changes. In reality we are en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to debate what is contained in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books. If we find the figures open to ques<lb break="no"/>tion, we have every right to question them. It is 
     <lb/>
     on the basis of these terms of confederation that 
     <lb/>
     we must continue our debate. I am agreeable to 
     <lb/>
     waiting for particular information. I am not so 
     <lb/>
     sure any of the questions asked cover the excise 
     <lb/>
     taxes which are really different from tariffs. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Is it not correct that any tariff chan<lb break="no"/>ges, before they can be made, first have to be 
     <lb/>debated in the Canadian Parliament, no matter 
     <lb/>what agreement was arrived at? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is not binding upon the sig<lb break="no"/>natories unless and until it is implemented by the

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is quite possible they may not be 
     <lb/>
     debated until January, February or March. If we 
     <lb/>
     have to wait until that matter comes before the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Parliament to discuss this important 
     <lb/>
     matter, where are we going to be?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> In connection with this matter, 
     <lb/>
     the suggestion has come up here as to when the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Parliament is going to discuss tariff 
     <lb/>
     changes. There is one question in my mind in 
     <lb/>
     connection with this whole business, these Black 
     <lb/>
     Books. We have the understanding that there will 
     <lb/>
     possibly be changes. What about the Grey Book?

     recommended to Parliament and even then they 
     <lb/>
     must have an agreement among themselves. We 
     <lb/>
     have no reason to believe that this Grey Book will

     clarification on this.

     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> We had no session yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless I did a little work. It is laid down 
     <lb/>
     here that the federal government will collect $2 
     <lb/>
     million in customs and import duties....

            <p>

     <lb/>
     either wait for information or let us be frank. We 
     <lb/>
     decided we are going to hang the dog until 
     <lb/>
     December 15. We have nothing to do.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not think you have any right

     to make any such statement implying that all the

     <lb/>
     It does not follow at all. Because any member is 
     <lb/>
     desirous of seeking information, and we are wait<lb break="no"/>ing receipt of further information, we are not 
     <lb/>
     hanging the dog. You have no right to arrive at

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I feel like doing some plain

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think if members would cool

     down, I would not pay too much attention to what

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I want the people to know the truth 
     <lb/>
     as far as taxes are concerned. As far as excise tax 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, I do not think there is much difficul<lb break="no"/>ty. I do not think the tariff or the Geneva agree<lb break="no"/>ment is going to make much difference. 
     <lb/>
     Nevertheless the total in the estimates of the 
     <lb/>
     federal government is $2 million customs duty; 
     <lb/>
     $400,000 liquor tax; $500,000 tobacco tax; $1.5 
     <lb/>
     million miscellaneous excise taxes. Take that 
     <lb/>
     $4.4 million — I took the customs returns for 
     <lb/>
     1946 on only nine items, including four items 
     <lb/>
     contained in this book and I got $3 million over 
     <lb/>
     and above this estimate, which is the estimate of 
     <lb/>
     the federal government.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is why I question the ad<lb break="no"/>visability of going ahead with the debate at this

     the present set-up, whereas these figures are 
     <lb/>
     predicated upon what our probable position will

     be if and when we became a province of Canada;

     <lb/>
     taxes? What will each have to pay? I think it is 
     <lb/>
     the proper way to talk about it — for instance, 20

     cents on a pack of playing cards.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You want to get in a sly dig

     every once in a while. We are going to have a

            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I have a lot of sympathy for Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood. He finds himself in this position. He 
     <lb/>has to debate and pilot through the House figures 
     <lb/>which he himself does not know how they were 
     <lb/>arrived at, how they were compiled. He cannot 
     <lb/>do it. As far as I am concerned, there were certain 
     <lb/>questions asked from the Canadian government 
     <lb/>and Newfoundland government concerning the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland section of this document. Ap<lb break="no"/>parently, to kill time, we are going to debate all 
     <lb/>over again the things we have debated. To me, it 
     <lb/>does not make sense. I would rather adjourn for 
     <lb/>a week or ten days than debate that all over again. 
     <lb/>I move the committee rise now.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Are we not to discuss this matter at

     all now?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I have a motion to rise the com<lb break="no"/>mittee. Is it the intention to adjourn the House?

     <lb/>we get to revenue and expenditure we will need

     money and my time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> A couple of days ago we reached a 
     <lb/>
     point where individuals had asked questions to 
     <lb/>
     which they had not received answers and the 
     <lb/>
     answers were necessary. We left it to the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee to determine the method of proce<lb break="no"/>dure. Apparently the Steering Committee did not 
     <lb/>
     agree unanimously. While I cannot agree with 
     <lb/>
     everything Mr. Crosbie has said, I am certainly 
     <lb/>
     in sympathy with him on one point. While I 
     <lb/>
     would like to see this Convention over as quickly 
     <lb/>
     as anyone else, I do not see the sense of quibbling 
     <lb/>
     for four or five days without the information. 
     <lb/>
     That is all we did this afternoon — quibbled. Let 
     <lb/>
     us adjourn until we have the information to go on 
     <lb/>
     with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I disagree with Mr. Crosbie and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Newell. These two Black Books are sent us 
     <lb/>
     by Ottawa and we are supposed to do the best we 
     <lb/>
     can by telling the people of this country their 
     <lb/>
     contents. Although we have asked some ques<lb break="no"/>tions which have not been answered, and al<lb break="no"/>though we have asked questions which never will 
     <lb/>
     be answered, I do not believe that is any reason 
     <lb/>
     why we should hold up the debate. If you will 
     <lb/>
     bear with me, on the particular question I asked 
     <lb/>
     today — a breakdown of the $9.4 million — it is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely immaterial in one sense except that it 
     <lb/>
     would help us to understand a little more. That 
     <lb/>
     $9.4 million has to be taken as read; that is not 
     <lb/>
     going to be changed, as far as we know. If the 
     <lb/>
     question which I asked today has any bearing on 
     <lb/>
     holding up the Convention, I here and now 
     <lb/>
     withdraw that question. Let us tell the people 
     <lb/>
     what is in the books. Let us get it over with; then 
     <lb/>
     forget it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think Mr. Crosbie was fair 
     <lb/>
     when he pointed out that it is not possible for Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood to be expected to break down these 
     <lb/>
     figures or to give detailed information in respect 
     <lb/>
     of matters he has not got the information about. 
     <lb/>
     Either he can or he cannot. Only he can decide 
     <lb/>
     that. If there are other matters which have no 
     <lb/>
     direct bearing upon the questions which have 
     <lb/>
     been forwarded, it is rather a pity that the House 
     <lb/>
     should rise at this particular time. I suppose they 
     <lb/>
     will have to be touched upon if the report has to 
     <lb/>
     be fairly debated. I am entirely in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I would like to say a few words on that 
     <lb/>
     point. It seems to me we cannot get ahead with 
   

            <cb/>
        

     this debate on this Canadian question, because a 
     <lb/>
     great many of the figures in this Grey Book are 
     <lb/>
     grossly wrong. How can we possibly put that 
     <lb/>
     document or anything like it before the elec<lb break="no"/>torate? To get the information, I am convinced it 
     <lb/>
     is going to take months. Are we going to sit here, 
     <lb/>
     keep this Convention sitting all that time, until we 
     <lb/>
     get it? Or are we going to do what I think should 
     <lb/>
     be done? These figures have been challenged. If 
     <lb/>
     we are not going to get the correct information 
     <lb/>
     within a reasonable time, I am of the opinion that 
     <lb/>
     we should simply vote this thing out. I do not see 
     <lb/>
     how we could put before the country figures we 
     <lb/>
     have not approved. Major Cashin pointed out one 
     <lb/>
     glaring case, these liquor figures, where the es<lb break="no"/>timate given by the Canadian government was 
     <lb/>
     $400,000 and it seems it should be $1.6 million. 
     <lb/>
     If Major Cashin's contention is correct, those 
     <lb/>
     figures generally should be increased by 20%. 
     <lb/>
     Surely the basis upon which the offer has been 
     <lb/>
     made would be materially changed. They base 
     <lb/>
     their offer on the fact that they are expecting to 
     <lb/>
     get from Newfoundland $20 million; that is per<lb break="no"/>fectly clear in the Grey Book. If they are going to 
     <lb/>
     get $24 million, then surely they could make their 
     <lb/>
     offer a better one. I have great sympathy with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, and those people who spent a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of time on this confederation issue, 
     <lb/>
     who have it honestly at heart. But the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion question would not be dead if we turned it 
     <lb/>
     down. It would be impossible, in my opinion, for 
     <lb/>
     this Convention to recommend that confeder<lb break="no"/>ation be placed on the referendum paper, unless 
     <lb/>
     we are sure that these figures are correct.... I do 
     <lb/>
     not want people to think I am against putting this 
     <lb/>
     before the country. I think there are people inter<lb break="no"/>ested in this and they should have all the infor<lb break="no"/>mation we can give them. If that information is 
     <lb/>
     incorrect, we have no right whatsoever to put it 
     <lb/>
     before them. I think that is all I have to say about 
     <lb/>
     it. I do not think if it was turned down, the time 
     <lb/>
     we have put in on it has been wasted. I think it 
     <lb/>
     will come in very useful at some future time. I 
     <lb/>
     think this whole question of confederation must 
     <lb/>
     be a matter of negotiation between governments; 
     <lb/>
     it is utterly impossible for us to negotiate, and that 
     <lb/>
     is what we will be doing if we go back and say. 
     <lb/>
     "Your figures are wrong, based on wrong infor<lb break="no"/>mation". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't accept that position. If 
     <lb/>
     you ask a man for better particulars you are not

     necessarily negotiating. You could say to him, 
     <lb/>
     "Well, this thing is ambiguous, and I don't under<lb break="no"/>stand it. Would you mind breaking it down and 
     <lb/>
     telling me exactly what you mean?" I don't think 
     <lb/>
     you are negotiating by the mere fact that you 
     <lb/>
     request further information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I was not making that point, sir; but in 
     <lb/>
     any case, the main point that we have got to 
     <lb/>
     decide in the next few days is how long it will 
     <lb/>
     take to get this information corrected... I don't 
     <lb/>
     know what the feeling of this Convention is, but 
     <lb/>
     my own feeling is that if it is going to take 
     <lb/>
     months, how can we possibly ask the country to 
     <lb/>
     wait? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the 
     <lb/>
     gracious and charming things the Hon. Mr. Job 
     <lb/>
     has said. I think there is something utterly 
     <lb/>
     delightful in the naivete with which he suggests 
     <lb/>
     that we might perhaps drop this question of con<lb break="no"/>federation. And on what basis? On the basis that 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin doubts the accuracy of one or two 
     <lb/>
     items in this table here compiled. Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     has a right to doubt it. He has directed a question 
     <lb/>
     asking the Government of Newfoundland — no, 
     <lb/>
     sir, not to break down this same table, that is 
     <lb/>
     something completely different. This is a table 
     <lb/>
     compiled by the Government of Canada giving 
     <lb/>
     the estimate of what revenue they would collect 
     <lb/>
     from the people of Newfoundland if New<lb break="no"/>foundland became a province. In doing that they 
     <lb/>
     have tried to picture Newfoundland's trade as a 
     <lb/>
     province, and on that basis they have compiled 
     <lb/>
     that table. Major Cashin has asked our govern<lb break="no"/>ment not to picture Newfoundland as a province, 
     <lb/>
     but only to picture Newfoundland paying the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian rates of tariff on the trade we are now 
     <lb/>
     doing, not on the trade that we would do if we 
     <lb/>
     were a province. I suggest this to Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     now, that he ask the Government of Canada in 
     <lb/>
     respect of this table the same thing that Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett has asked the Government of Canada in 
     <lb/>
     respect of the table on the next page. Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     has asked them to give us more details of what 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government will spend in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Now I suggest that he or Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, or someone, ask the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada more detail of the estimate of what they 
     <lb/>
     will collect from Newfoundland. If it is suggested 
     <lb/>
     that this thing is so hopelessly wrong, let's get at 
     <lb/>
     the bottom of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> How long will it take? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How long? i could suggest an 
     <lb/>
     idea on that.... Do we deny that the Ministry of 
     <lb/>
     Finance of the Government of Canada is served 
     <lb/>
     by outstandingly able financial men. do we deny 
     <lb/>
     that? Why we have them in our own Finance 
     <lb/>
     Department, a tiny little department. but the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada is served by some of the 
     <lb/>
     ablest economists in the world, not <hi rendition="simple:italic">the</hi> ablest, but 
     <lb/>
     some of the ablest.... Don't think for a moment 
     <lb/>
     that when they compiled that table of $20 million 
     <lb/>
     they were just pulling it out of the air like a 
     <lb/>
     magician. Oh, no! It is based on solid, concrete 
     <lb/>
     information. And furthermore, don't suppose 
     <lb/>
     that when they got that total of $20 million that 
     <lb/>
     they then took all their basic working pages and 
     <lb/>
     burnt them. I suggest that it is likely that the 
     <lb/>
     individual tables of statistics upon which each of 
     <lb/>
     these items are based are still extant, in the 
     <lb/>
     various financial offices in Ottawa; and i I suggest 
     <lb/>
     that if we sent to them and asked them, politely, 
     <lb/>
     because they are a friendly government ... to 
     <lb/>
     explain in a little more detail the estimate of $3.2 
     <lb/>
     million a year for income tax that they figure they 
     <lb/>
     would get from the people of Newfoundland; if 
     <lb/>
     you ask them to explain how they arrive at a 
     <lb/>
     figure of $7.5 million a year from Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in tax on the companies and corporations. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that they would give us more detail. If you ask 
     <lb/>
     how they come to the figure of $2 million on 
     <lb/>
     customs duties and excise taxes, I have little 
     <lb/>
     doubt that they would give you that information, 
     <lb/>
     and you could have it back here in time for your 
     <lb/>
     re-opening in January. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      Do you suppose that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada ... do you expect that that nation is served 
     <lb/>
     by ignorant clowns? Do you suppose they pluck<lb break="no"/>ed these figures out of the air? Do you suppose 
     <lb/>
     they are not based on something, when they know 
     <lb/>
     every little nook and comer of our national debt? 
     <lb/>
     They know exactly every item of merchandise 
     <lb/>
     that comes into Newfoundland, where it comes 
     <lb/>
     from, what it costs, and what duties are paid on 
     <lb/>
     it. They have a Department of Trade and Com<lb break="no"/>merce with 6,000 employees, one of the world's 
     <lb/>
     greatest, and don't think for a moment that this is 
     <lb/>
     a table that is faked or fraudulent, or that they 
     <lb/>
     imagined it, that it is without foundation. You are 
     <lb/>
     talking about a table compiled by the government 
     <lb/>
     of a great nation. You can't talk about them as 
     <lb/>
     though they were a pack of crooks... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I would suggest to Major Cashin, as he 


            <pb n="955" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-04_Page_0955.jpg"/>

     is genuinely concerned as to the accuracy of these 
     <lb/>
     figures making up this total of $20 million, that 
     <lb/>
     he can solve the matter and put it beyond doubt. 
     <lb/>
     He can ask the Government of Canada, table a 
     <lb/>
     question and ask them, will they please give us 
     <lb/>
     some of the details on which they worked it out. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett has already done it in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government figures on what they will 
     <lb/>
     spend in Newfoundland. He has not done that 
     <lb/>
     exactly, but what he has done is ask for further 
     <lb/>
     detail on one item. Here is a table of $26 million 
     <lb/>
     or $27 million, that is made up of various items, 
     <lb/>
     and one of the items is $9 million that the various 
     <lb/>
     federal departments figure they will have to 
     <lb/>
     spend in Newfoundland.... The Departments of 
     <lb/>
     Agriculture, Fisheries, Transport, Health, and 
     <lb/>
     Labour of Canada have to spend money in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Mr. Hollett would like to have the 
     <lb/>
     details and he has put in a question. We will get 
     <lb/>
     those details. If Major Cashin will put in a ques<lb break="no"/>tion on the details of what taxes they expect to get 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland we will get it. Then as sen<lb break="no"/>sible, practical men we can stand up here and 
     <lb/>
     debate this thing to our heart's content, and the 
     <lb/>
     people will know the truth. That's the way to do 
     <lb/>
     it. In the meantime let's adjourn the Convention 
     <lb/>
     and go home and take a rest. I know I need a rest, 
     <lb/>
     for one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think we are 
     <lb/>
     doing a lot of yelling and talking about very little. 
     <lb/>
     We seem to have overlooked the more important 
     <lb/>
     phase of this. We have asked for these questions 
     <lb/>
     to be tabled and sent forward, and I think we were 
     <lb/>
     agreed that this would take some time to get, and 
     <lb/>
     it might not be before we re-assemble in January. 
     <lb/>
     I think everyone feels we cannot get out of here 
     <lb/>
     without a Christmas recess, but we seem to be 
     <lb/>
     overlooking the fact, when we talk about ad<lb break="no"/>journing, that as I understood on Monday we 
     <lb/>
     would have some figures to go on with our dis<lb break="no"/>cussion on a provincial budget, and that's a lot 
     <lb/>
     more important than this federal one. This federal 
     <lb/>
     one is important because it means the money that 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government will take out of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and spend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And spend? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Yes, and spend. But what is more 
     <lb/>
     important is: as a Government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     what are we going to get as revenue and expen<lb break="no"/>diture? I think that has a much greater bearing on 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country, and they should have 


            <cb/>
          

     every opportunity to know that. Now that debate, 
     <lb/>
     as I thought, we had decided to have on Monday. 
     <lb/>
     Why can't we forget this? The questions have 
     <lb/>
     gone in and we realise we won't get the answers 
     <lb/>
     till January. Let's rise and adjourn until Monday, 
     <lb/>
     when we can go on with the provincial discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and I don't know, but we might be able to 
     <lb/>
     finish by December 15. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before you resume your seat, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman, would you mind? Mr. Hollett, I 
     <lb/>
     think, feels that there are matters of interest, other 
     <lb/>
     than the purely financial questions, which could 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Well, sir, on that, and going back 
     <lb/>
     to yesterday's Steering Committee, there was no 
     <lb/>
     such agreement on what we would do, if any<lb break="no"/>thing, for one good reason mentioned this after<lb break="no"/>noon, and yesterday afternoon in the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee — that the Committee can make no 
     <lb/>
     agreements binding on this Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     there were suggestions that there was much in 
     <lb/>
     this that has no bearing on that question of 
     <lb/>
     finance; and the suggestion that this should be 
     <lb/>
     brought up or not brought up was discussed; and 
     <lb/>
     the very point was made the Steering Committee 
     <lb/>
     could decide nothing because it would only be the 
     <lb/>
     decision of a few, and the other 34 or 35 members 
     <lb/>
     could bring up anything they like as long as it is 
     <lb/>
     relevant to what we are discussing, which is these 
     <lb/>
     books and the Grey Book, and for that reason 
     <lb/>
     there was no such agreement made. In fact there 
     <lb/>
     would have been no unanimity because there 
     <lb/>
     were men in disagreement there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Hollett is perfectly correct. 
     <lb/>
     All I want to say is that I will have to put the 
     <lb/>
     motion for us to rise. If it is adopted, it must of 
     <lb/>
     necessity mean that those voting for its adoption 
     <lb/>
     do so on the understanding that there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     further that can be discussed until the proposed 
     <lb/>
     breakdown of figures is introduced by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood sometime next week. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, if I may, if 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett would permit me... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I will permit nothing. I have not 
     <lb/>
     spoken. I have the floor. I have taken just one 
     <lb/>
     word too much from you this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You may have to take a lot

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I may have to take a lot more yet, 
     <lb/>
     but I trust it won't be from you. I don't want any 
     <lb/>
     more of that nonsense. I was going to say that I

            <fw type="num">956</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
         

     think it is a pity to adjourn now and not carry on. 
     <lb/>
     I don't care if Mr. Smallwood objects to having 
     <lb/>
     the tariff set out. Let's have something else. But 
     <lb/>
     I do object to one man insisting that his will shall 
     <lb/>
     be carried over 44 men. That's one thing, and I 
     <lb/>
     don't care if you take another hour to decide that. 
     <lb/>
     I think it is an outright disgrace to adjourn until 
     <lb/>
     Monday. Here we have the rest of this afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     and the night session, and tomorrow afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     and we should not adjourn, but go ahead and get 
     <lb/>
     what we are allowed to give to the people out of 
     <lb/>
     these Black Books.... These are the only things 
     <lb/>
     we can give to the people. We cannot go back to 
     <lb/>
     Canada and start to negotiate for better terms. We 
     <lb/>
     are not allowed to as a Convention, the delegation 
     <lb/>
     was not allowed to. I think it is ridiculous.... I am 
     <lb/>
     very much against any adjournment on this mat<lb break="no"/>ter, and I think Mr. Crosbie might agree to that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that I 
     <lb/>
     created anything of a furore. I have never done 
     <lb/>
     that in my life! But here is the position. I have a 
     <lb/>
     lot of sympathy in many ways with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood. He fostered this delegation to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa in the beginning. They went to Ottawa, and 
     <lb/>
     I hold that the delegation came back with an 
     <lb/>
     incomplete report. They have made no report 
     <lb/>
     whatever as a delegation to this Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     this Grey Book may or may not be the result of 
     <lb/>
     their efforts in Ottawa; we don't know, because 
     <lb/>
     before they left Ottawa this was not in their 
     <lb/>
     possession. It was sent here afterwards by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government through His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     the Governor in Commission, and from then it 
     <lb/>
     was sent to this office, consequently the delega<lb break="no"/>tion which we sent to Ottawa merely came back 
     <lb/>
     with the Black Books. Now when we received 
     <lb/>
     this document here, and when we go into the 
     <lb/>
     figures in it, we find that they have no foundation 
     <lb/>
     in fact, and that there is no member of the delega<lb break="no"/>tion who is able to properly explain them. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, surely the members of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation should be able to get up and explain 
     <lb/>
     every item that is in here in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     financial situation of both Canada and New<lb break="no"/>foundland; but no, what happened was, as I see 
     <lb/>
     it, when they adjourned in Ottawa to return to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, the Canadian government made 
     <lb/>
     up a budget, so to speak, of its own, particularly 
     <lb/>
     with regard to federal expenditures, and the Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa delegation came back; and when they see 
     <lb/>
     this, whilst they might have talked about it up 


            <cb/>
          

     there, they got no information on it as to how it 
     <lb/>
     should be spent, is $9.4 million. It means, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, that the Ottawa delegation fell 
     <lb/>
     down on its job, because they should have had all 
     <lb/>
     this information, and we should not have to ask 
     <lb/>
     any questions at all. Mr. Smallwood pointed out 
     <lb/>
     to me that the way I asked these questions this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon did not suit him. I am going to ask them 
     <lb/>
     the other way at the next meeting of this House, 
     <lb/>
     because I want to draft them properly — it took 
     <lb/>
     me all night to try to figure out the other one — 
     <lb/>
     and ask them on what basis they made them up. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Hear! Hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And if they made them up on the 
     <lb/>
     same basis that they made up this $9.4 million, 
     <lb/>
     then I will say they are fraudulent. It is all 
     <lb/>
     guesswork. I said when this House opened 15 
     <lb/>
     months ago, and I am going to repeat it: there is 
     <lb/>
     only one regret I have, that I consented to be a 
     <lb/>
     party to this farce. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well I don't know that you 
     <lb/>
     ought to say that, Major Cashin. You stated here 
     <lb/>
     15 months ago...  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, and I am sorry that I have to 
     <lb/>
     make a confession about it. This has been the 
     <lb/>
     greatest political mistake of my career, to stay 
     <lb/>
     here and talk at a mock parliament that means 
     <lb/>
     nothing. The power remains with the other 
     <lb/>
     people, and we held the glory. I think I made that 
     <lb/>
     statement here, and I am going to repeat it now. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You made that statement on 
     <lb/>September 8, 1946. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No sir, September 18, 1946, and 
     <lb/>
     two days later it was attacked in the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> And some time later people 
     <lb/>
     apologised for making that attack, and now they 
     <lb/>
     realise that what I did say at that time was the 
     <lb/>
     truth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Major Cashin will you ex<lb break="no"/>onerate me from that? I made the attack, but I did 
     <lb/>
     not apologise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I don't care who apologised. It was 
     <lb/>
     true anyhow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I apologised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, now we have arrived at the 
     <lb/>
     stage where the Ottawa delegation came back 
     <lb/>
     without a report, and we have got to go on the 
     <lb/>
     best way we can, in some way. We have either 
     <lb/>
     got to kick this thing out or discuss it. It is going 
     <lb/>
     to take us months to get the information. I am

     prepared to ask Mr. Smallwood a question, but 
     <lb/>
     before I ask it I want an assurance from the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government that they are going to 
     <lb/>
     answer some of the questions that I have already 
     <lb/>
     asked them, and until such time ... I refuse to ask 
     <lb/>
     them anything further. I am going to wait until I 
     <lb/>
     see whether they answer them, but if they don't, 
     <lb/>
     then I claim they will be dishonest, and the whole 
     <lb/>
     truth is going to come out before very long. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as adjourning is concerned it is im<lb break="no"/>material to me, but I will say this, in justice to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, and I have had something to do 
     <lb/>
     with making up an Economic Report, I believe it 
     <lb/>
     should be the work of the committee that went to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa to do it. I am exonerating no one, I am 
     <lb/>
     taking them as a collective unit. That Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation should have been in a position when 
     <lb/>
     they returned here to lay the goods on the table 
     <lb/>
     as regards our position if we become a province 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. That has not been done. There are 
     <lb/>
     some things in this Black Book, or one of the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books, and I will give you an item just to 
     <lb/>
     show you how foolish it is, while I am on my feet. 
     <lb/>
     I don't have to look at it. Mr. Chairman, if the 
     <lb/>
     members will turn up the finance revenue that 
     <lb/>
     they have estimated in that Black Book, we find 
     <lb/>
     repayments from the Housing Corporation 
     <lb/>
     brought in as prospective revenue for a province. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, would you ever think anything so 
     <lb/>
     silly? Because it is money which should go back 
     <lb/>
     to where it was borrowed from, and it is not 
     <lb/>
     revenue of the province, it is repayment of loans, 
     <lb/>
     and it is not a revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Why not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Because it's not. It can't go on 
     <lb/>
     indefinitely, it's capital account. Consequently 
     <lb/>
     there's one item alone ... does not exist, because 
     <lb/>
     it should be paid back to the surplus, if we have 
     <lb/>
     any left by the time this thing is all over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now to come to the surplus. I was attacked 
     <lb/>
     here, or the Finance Committee was attacked, on 
     <lb/>
     our estimates being faked, and here we come to 
     <lb/>
     the greatest faker of all in this document. I have 
     <lb/>
     said I have sympathy with Mr. Smallwood, be<lb break="no"/>cause he is piloting this through on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, so to speak, as I was 
     <lb/>
     trying to pilot the Finance Report through on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of the Finance Committee; and he is taking 
     <lb/>
     the position today, in a sense, that he is the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, and replying to every 
     <lb/>
     question we put to him. That should not be his 
 

            <cb/>
       

     position — it should not have been mine, but we 
     <lb/>
     adopted it in the beginning, and have to carry it 
     <lb/>
     on to the end. It is immaterial to me whether we 
     <lb/>
     adjourn now or any time. I am prepared to stay 
     <lb/>
     here forever now. We are accustomed to being 
     <lb/>
     here, and the people are laughing at us for being 
     <lb/>
     here, because that's all we are, a laughing stock. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p>There is a matter on which I want to say a few 
     <lb/>words this afternoon, as people have been blow<lb break="no"/>ing off steam, and that's the matter of the public 
     <lb/>debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, not just yet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am speaking to the members of the 
     <lb/>committee, and I am entitled to mention this 
     <lb/>matter, the public debt of Canada. In this book 
     <lb/>there is nothing regarding the public debt of 
     <lb/>Canada — nothing. Why? Is that honesty on the 
     <lb/>part of the Canadian government? They were 
     <lb/>going to enter into a partnership with New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and they certainly put down 
     <lb/>Newfoundland's debt and pointed out why they 
     <lb/>were going to take off $64 million or $65 million, 
     <lb/>whatever it might be; but they conveniently and 
     <lb/>deliberately refrained from putting in their own 
     <lb/>public debt, and showing the per capita debt of 
     <lb/>Canada as against the per capita debt of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and I say that is done deliberately. In 
     <lb/>view of the fact that we questioned other figures 
     <lb/>in here, and that this $9.4 million has not been 
     <lb/>explained properly to this Convention, I am jus<lb break="no"/>tified therefore in saying that the exclusion of the 
     <lb/>Canadian public debt from being set side by side 
     <lb/>with the Newfoundland public debt has been 
     <lb/>deliberate, because we are going into partnership, 
     <lb/>Mr. Chairman. And what do we find the 
     <lb/>Canadian public debt is today? We will use their 
     <lb/>figures this time, not mine. We find that the total 
     <lb/>debt of Canada, federally now I am speaking, the 
     <lb/>total debt is $18,890,359,000. 
     <lb/>

     General's report there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The net debt is $13 billion and 
     <lb/>
     the per capita debt is $1,100. They have got 
     <lb/>
     nearly $5 billion in assets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> What are the assets? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have not got the list here. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, I am going to tell you some 
     <lb/>of them. Loans that they will never get returned, 
     <lb/>to Europe, etc. Billions of dollars they have al<lb break="no"/>lowed for relief in Europe — charity if you like, 
     <lb/>and they have put them down as an asset, and they 
     <lb/>won't get half of them. No. The per capita debt 
     <lb/>is $1,492.89, and their provincial debt is $149.06, 
     <lb/>and the municipal debt is $77.29 per head. Add 
     <lb/>these three together and you have nearly $1,800 
     <lb/>per head in Canada. Now let's have a look at 
     <lb/>ourselves, and I am going to use the Canadian 
     <lb/>figures. I am not using mine, because I have been 
     <lb/>accused of faking mine. Now we have to go and 
     <lb/>get some of these experts up there to make up 
     <lb/>ours. No, according to their figures, not Cashin's, 
     <lb/>our per capita debt is $212.94 per head, and our 
     <lb/>St. John's city debt is $44.94, say $45.00, that 
     <lb/>means a total debt for Newfoundland, including 
     <lb/>the City of St. John's, of approximately $260 per 
     <lb/>head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would you add in the contin<lb break="no"/>gent debt? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I am coming to that too, Mister. You 
     <lb/>
     just keep quiet now, I know my stuff on this 
     <lb/>
     contingency debt. We had our security for this 
     <lb/>
     contingency, and I know what Mr. Smallwood is 
     <lb/>
     driving at — Bowaters; Harbour Grace water<lb break="no"/>works a few thousand dollars; Placentia, and a 
     <lb/>
     few more, but Bowaters is the outstanding one, 
     <lb/>
     and I see now it is less than $7 million. Now our 
     <lb/>
     own debt is $260 a head, taking in our 
     <lb/>
     municipality of St. John's. Theirs, with their 
     <lb/>
     provincial and - no, we will figure that they 
     <lb/>
     haven't any provincial debt, or any municipal 
     <lb/>
     debt; they have $1,492 net debt, we will call it, 
     <lb/>
     and take $260 from that and it leaves us what? A 
     <lb/>
     $1,230 difference between the two. Now some<lb break="no"/>one take it down if you like, and multiply 320,000 
     <lb/>
     people by $1,200, and you will find a $380 mil<lb break="no"/>lion-odd difference. Now what is happening? 
     <lb/>
     Here is the basis of a proposal that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would enter union with Canada, figuring that we 
     <lb/>
     owe $260 a head, or whatever it is. We say, "All 
     <lb/>
     right, we are a wealthy people now, we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to take upon ourselves a further 
   

            <cb/>
         

     liability, We will wipe out ours and take on a 
     <lb/>
     liability of $1,492." But that's not the whole 
     <lb/>
     story. A few weeks ago the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     went to the United States to borrow money. We 
     <lb/>
     went one time too, to Canada, and were turned 
     <lb/>
     down. They went to the USA to borrow some 
     <lb/>
     money not long ago, and they got $300 million, 
     <lb/>
     and they were looking for $700 million. If, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, Newfoundland got its just des<lb break="no"/>serts and entered union with Canada on an equal 
     <lb/>
     basis, that $300 million that they borrowed from 
     <lb/>
     the United States belongs to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people, because it is the difference, between their 
     <lb/>
     per capita debt and our per capita debt. You might 
     <lb/>
     also say it was on our credit that they were able 
     <lb/>
     to raise that $300 million, because they were not 
     <lb/>
     able to raise all they wanted on their own. Now 
     <lb/>
     with respect to this contingent liability, 1 think we 
     <lb/>
     have them here — anyhow, l remember them. 
     <lb/>
     Our contingent liabilities are something over $7 
     <lb/>
     million. What are the contingent liabilities of 
     <lb/>
     Canada? I can't count them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $5 billion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Some difference. Multiply that by 
     <lb/>
     320,000, and the other by $12 billion and see 
     <lb/>
     what you get. Everything is against us con<lb break="no"/>federating with Canada. Mr. Chairman, I have 
     <lb/>
     every sympathy for the Ottawa delegation in one 
     <lb/>
     sense, although I criticise them for not coming 
     <lb/>
     here with full particulars. I have every sympathy 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Smallwood trying to drive this thing 
     <lb/>
     through the House here with such poor informa<lb break="no"/>tion at his disposal, because he has not got any. 
     <lb/>
     The Government of Canada gave them no finan<lb break="no"/>cial information.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Don't pity me too much, be<lb break="no"/>cause we have a lot of information yet.

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, you had better come out with

     it in connection with the financial business.

            <p>

     can answer the questions. As a matter of fact we

     position is this: here in Newfoundland the people 
     <lb/>
     and the government have $115 million on deposit 
     <lb/>
     down here, and we don't know what reserve of 
     <lb/>
     gold is behind it. We are entitled to know if we 
     <lb/>
     are going in partnership. I think I told the story of 
     <lb/>
     the gold standard in 1932, and how, through 
     <lb/>
     manipulation at that time with the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government and the Canadian banks, New<lb break="no"/>foundland depositors were deprived of ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $20 million. As far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I am going to see that that does not 
     <lb/>
     happen again, that before this country goes into 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada, or into confederation 
     <lb/>
     with any other country we want to know the state 
     <lb/>
     of their affairs, just the same as they know ours. 
     <lb/>
     We were told here this afternoon by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood that the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     knew all about our affairs. 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Our trade, our business. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well our trade, our business, how 
     <lb/>do they know all about it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They have a High Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, and they have had a High 
     <lb/>Commissioner here since 1941, who laid the seed 
     <lb/>to bring Newfoundland into confederation, and I 
     <lb/>mean former Commissioner Burchell. That was 
     <lb/>his main object, and today he has a continuation 
     <lb/>in his office here in Newfoundland, and the only 
     <lb/>regret, Mr. Chairman, that I have is that his office 
     <lb/>is located in the house in which I live. He left his 
     <lb/>job and was given a holiday. For what? To go to 
     <lb/>Ottawa to help the Newfoundland delegation. 
     <lb/>Now, Mr. Chairman, I propose to make a further 
     <lb/>speech on this whole affair at some later date, 
     <lb/>particularly when Mr. Smallwood brings in his 
     <lb/>provincial set-up, which I understand from him 
     <lb/>will be on Monday. But in the meantime it is 
     <lb/>immaterial to me whether this House adjourns 
     <lb/>until Monday or not. As far as the financial situa<lb break="no"/>tion is concerned I am prepared to go ahead with 
     <lb/>it now, and in that respect, if Mr. Smallwood is 
     <lb/>not prepared to give us the information, and the 
     <lb/>High Commissioner for Canada comes in here 
     <lb/>and gives us the information, I am prepared to go 
     <lb/>ahead with the debate with him, and let him tell 
     <lb/>the story of Canada's present financial position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I got an answer to a question 
     <lb/>yesterday which I placed on the order paper, and 
     <lb/>I am sorry I have not got it here at the moment. I 
     <lb/>asked how much the present austerity program 
 

            <cb/>
          

     recently adopted in Canada will affect the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. It was no surprise to me. It is 
     <lb/>
     going to affect the people of Newfoundland. If 
     <lb/>
     you, sir, or me, or any other gentleman. wants to 
     <lb/>
     take a holiday in the United States now (and we 
     <lb/>
     are entitled to one if we can afford it), some for 
     <lb/>
     health purposes, etc., you get $150 of your own 
     <lb/>
     money, Canadian money, American money, 
     <lb/>
     that's all they will allow you, even though we are 
     <lb/>
     probably $20 million in credit in United States 
     <lb/>
     currency in Newfoundland. Consequently the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland are being persecuted, so 
     <lb/>
     to speak, in order to assist Canada in this present 
     <lb/>
     austerity program. That was the question I placed 
     <lb/>
     the other day, and to which I received an answer. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Can't you get more than $150? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, hold on a minute now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That has absolutely no bearing

     on the...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> It has a bearing on the whole situa<lb break="no"/>tion.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> As I said a minute ago, in view of 
     <lb/>the fact that Mr. Smallwood is not ready to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the debate I am prepared to refrain further 
     <lb/>this afternoon from any comments in connection 
     <lb/>with this whole matter, and I am prepared now to 
     <lb/>support Mr. Crosbie's motion that this committee 
     <lb/>rise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I appreciate 
     <lb/>
     very much what Major Cashin has said, and what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Crosbie has said about rising the committee, 
     <lb/>
     for this reason: if I am to bring in certain figures 
     <lb/>
     and statistics on Monday, affecting possible and 
     <lb/>
     probable provincial government finances, to 
     <lb/>
     have the next couple of days to do that would be 
     <lb/>
     a great help to me. After all, I don't know that 
     <lb/>
     there is much that we could debate between now 
     <lb/>
     and Monday that would be very profitable, and it 
     <lb/>
     would be a good idea in my opinion, as Mr. Cros<lb break="no"/>bie has suggested, and Major Cashin agreed, that 
     <lb/>
     we should rise the committee and then adjourn 
     <lb/>
     until Monday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> We have heard a lot about the good 
     <lb/>
     side of confederation — baby bonuses and old

     <lb/>
     to the dark and gloomy side. I want to hear the

     <lb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The motion is that the commit<lb break="no"/>tee rise and report progress, and ask leave to sit

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I give notice 
     <lb/>
     that I will on tomorrow ask His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor in Commission to ask the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada if they would assist the National Con<lb break="no"/>vention in its consideration of the proposals for

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     union by explaining in some detail the basis of 
     <lb/>
     computation of the table in Annex IV, showing 
     <lb/>
     probable federal revenue from Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     the event of union.

     Report of the Ottawa Delegation 
     <lb/>
     Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of Newfoundland into Confederation 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, we adjourned 
     <lb/>
     on Thursday last with the thought that today we 
     <lb/>
     would deal with prospective expenditure and 
     <lb/>
     revenue of the government of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, should we become a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It was understood that I would bring in 
     <lb/>
     today some figures and statistics that might indi<lb break="no"/>cate generally the expenditure that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government would need to make, and also the 
     <lb/>
     revenue that it might expect to take in to meet 
     <lb/>
     those expenditures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On their desks, members will find the first part 
     <lb/>
     of that estimate,1 namely the probable expendi<lb break="no"/>tures of the provincial government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. On the revenue side I have not, as yet, 
     <lb/>
     had the figures mimeographed. I have them here 
     <lb/>
     in front of me. Before we can get to a considera<lb break="no"/>tion of the revenue side they will be 
     <lb/>
     mimeographed and placed on the desks of the 
     <lb/>
     members. I ought to make one or two points clear 
     <lb/>
     before we come to an examination of the expen<lb break="no"/>diture table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The first point is this: that confederation does 
     <lb/>
     not mean that Canada would take Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     over and run it, because Canada is a federal union 
     <lb/>
     of nine provinces — Newfoundland would make 
     <lb/>
     the tenth. A federal union, wherever it does exist 
     <lb/>
     in this world, means only a sharing or dividing of 
     <lb/>
     responsibilities and powers; so that confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would mean that the powers which our 
     <lb/>
     government now has would be divided. We 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     would have some powers, and the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada would have some, and the respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities and burdens our government now has 
     <lb/>
     would be divided. Our government would carry 
     <lb/>
     some of the burdens and the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would carry some. Now, confederation 
     <lb/>
     may or may not be a good thing for this country. 
     <lb/>
     One thing, however, is fairly clear, that if there 
     <lb/>
     are advantages from confederation for the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, confederation is still not a 
     <lb/>
     good thing if the government of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is not able to pay its way. Or put 
     <lb/>
     it this way: we might get many advantages from 
     <lb/>
     confederation. These advantages might be con<lb break="no"/>siderable, but they will all fall by the way if the 
     <lb/>
     government of the province is not able to collect 
     <lb/>
     enough revenue to pay the cost of those things 
     <lb/>
     which the government of the province would still 
     <lb/>
     have to do, even with confederation. Not only 
     <lb/>
     that, the government of the province must be able 
     <lb/>
     to pay its way without imposing too great a 
     <lb/>
     burden of taxation on the people; without costing 
     <lb/>
     the people too much in taxes; and again without 
     <lb/>
     stinting on those public services, which the 
     <lb/>
     government of the province would have to 
     <lb/>
     carry.... The government of the province would 
     <lb/>
     still have its public services to render to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. Confederation, there<lb break="no"/>fore, to be of real benefit, must not only give the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland certain advantages and 
     <lb/>
     benefits from the Government of Canada; it must 
     <lb/>
            </p>
