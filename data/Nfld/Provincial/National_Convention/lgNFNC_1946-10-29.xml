 <!--<p>
     like ourselves, and whatever other delegates may 
     <lb/>
     do I am not prepared to say to that New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, "No, my mind is closed against it, 
     <lb/>
     closed against federation." I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say to them that I won't listen to anything con<lb break="no"/>nected with confederation. I am prepared to listen 
     <lb/>
     to whatever terms can be found. I am not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to take any attitude against the resolution at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. I for one cannot see how this Con<lb break="no"/>vention can turn a deaf ear to this resolution. 
     <lb/>
     Many of our people believe in it. Many others 
     <lb/>
     who may not yet believe in it now, if they get the 
     <lb/>
     terms, may yet believe in it. I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     deny them the chance to get the facts. If con<lb break="no"/>federation is to be a possibility in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     special terms would doubtless be necessary. If 
     <lb/>
     the Convention should decide that a delegation 
     <lb/>
     should be sent to Ottawa, I think in all fairness, 
     <lb/>
     another delegation should be sent to England. 
     <lb/>
     Certainly there are possibilities of her helping her 
     <lb/>
     oldest charge, and it is now that we want to find 
     <lb/>
     this out. If I voted against this resolution I would

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     be voting against getting facts, so I am voting to 
     <lb/>
     support it. When this resolution is passed it will 
     <lb/>
     give us the information we want. Then, and not 
     <lb/>
     until then, will I make up my mind on this whole 
     <lb/>
     confederation business, and the people as a whole 
     <lb/>
     will make up their minds. I do not commit myself 
     <lb/>
     to this. I do not see how we can do so. This is our 
     <lb/>
     duty, sir. Let us as members sent here by the 
     <lb/>
     people perform that duty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Newell I was about to rise, sir, to propose 
     <lb/>
     the adjournment of this debate. It is not my inten<lb break="no"/>tion to speak on this subject, and I do not rise to 
     <lb/>
     ask precedence for myself tomorrow, but there is 
     <lb/>
     a very real danger that the merits of the question 
     <lb/>
     under discussion may be confused with the per<lb break="no"/>sonalities involved in that discussion, and I think, 
     <lb/>
     sir, perhaps we can all come to this debate on the 
     <lb/>
     morrow with clearer minds and perhaps more 
     <lb/>
     disciplined tongues. I therefore move the ad<lb break="no"/>journment of the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Vincent I beg to second the motion.

     Mr. Chairman Orders of the day: Mr. Hollett,

     committee of the whole on the report of the

     Education Committee.

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Before proceeding into committee 
     <lb/>
     of the whole, there was a point raised which was 
     <lb/>
     of very great interest not only to members of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, but to the whole country generally, 
     <lb/>
     and which should be disposed of one way or 
     <lb/>
     another before we go into a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole to discuss the reports on education and 
     <lb/>
     forestry. If we could get around to discussing that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     particular matter and deciding the issue first we 
     <lb/>
     would probably make more progress. I move, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that the discussion on the Education 
     <lb/>
     and Forestry Reports be allowed to stand over, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Newcll be allowed to proceed with his 
     <lb/>
     resolution, and that we resume the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     motion to send a delegate to Canada.

     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, before Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell proceeds would it be in order to ask you, 
     <lb/>
     or alternatively Professor Wheare, to express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the propriety, or rather the authority 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention's sending a delegation to con<lb break="no"/>fer with the Govemment of Canada, assuming 
     <lb/>
     always that the Convention decided to send such 
     <lb/>
     a delegation? I think perhaps it would be quite 
     <lb/>
     helpful to the gentlemen here if we had some 
     <lb/>
     knowledge as to our authority, should the motion 
     <lb/>
     be adopted, to proceed... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Do you refer your question to  
     <lb/>
me as Chairman, or to Professor Wheare, Mr.
 <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     Smallwood? I will answer if you like. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I would like an 
     <lb/>
     opinion from both of you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman You are not taking any chances! 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Quite, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Insofar as my opinion is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, Mr. Smallwood, I think it is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     competent for the Convention, if it so desires, to 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to Ottawa, if the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government is prepared to receive such a delega<lb break="no"/>tion, to elicit information as to the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions upon the basis of which the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government may be prepared to consider the

     federal union of Newfoundland with Canada. In 
     <lb/>
     that way facts would be elicited, information 
     <lb/>
     obtained, as might be required in regard to any 
     <lb/>
     other factual matter or circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Professor Wheare I concur entirely with what 
     <lb/>the Chairman has said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Newell Mr. Chairman, the question of 
     <lb/>
     whether or not this country should become part 
     <lb/>
     of the federal union of Canada is not a new one; 
     <lb/>
     though, until yesterday, it has not during the 
     <lb/>
     present century been a very live issue. It is never<lb break="no"/>theless a matter on which there is a wide diversion 
     <lb/>
     of opinion; it is also, perhaps, inevitable that the 
     <lb/>
     matter should come before this Convention. This 
     <lb/>
     country is in a state of change. Sometime next 
     <lb/>
     year our people are going to be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     vote for the form of government they desire. 
     <lb/>
     Many of us have not given much thought to 
     <lb/>
     possible forms of government over the past 
     <lb/>
     decade. Others have, and perhaps have already 
     <lb/>
     secured sufficient information to make up their 
     <lb/>
     minds. Whatever conclusions these people have 
     <lb/>
     reached, and it is no secret that we have delegates 
     <lb/>
     here who have definitely made up their minds, we 
     <lb/>
     must see that they are given every opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     put their case before the Convention and the 
     <lb/>
     country, and that they are given a sympathetic 
     <lb/>
     hearing at the proper time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Others among us, however, because we have 
     <lb/>
     not had the same opportunity to study the politi<lb break="no"/>cal and economic situation of the country, are not 
     <lb/>
     in the happy position of being able to subscribe 
     <lb/>
     without further study to this or that form of 
     <lb/>
     government. It is imperative, and I speak of this 
     <lb/>
     latter group, to assert our right to the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of our views however incomplete they may 
     <lb/>
     be; and further to make sure that we are guided 
     <lb/>
     in our deliberations by sound judgement rather 
     <lb/>
     than emotion, facts rather than sentiment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The country has the right to expect certain 
     <lb/>
     things of us. It has a decided right to expect that 
     <lb/>
     we will get whatever facts — not propaganda - <lb/> but whatever facts are necessary to enable the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country to choose wisely when 
     <lb/>
     confronted with a final choice. The country has 
     <lb/>
     the right to expect us to show some material 
     <lb/>
     evidence of that open mind which many of us 
     <lb/>
     claimed we had when we came here. It is not for 
     <lb/>
     me to question any man's motives, much less sit 
     <lb/>
     in judgement on him. It certainly is our privilege 
     <lb/>
     and our duty to insist that the widest inquiries 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     possible be entered into before we make a final 
     <lb/>
     recommendation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel that the majority of us here, who sub<lb break="no"/>scribe to the open-mind school, will require the 
     <lb/>
     case for confederation to be examined just as 
     <lb/>
     exhaustively as any other case. At the same time, 
     <lb/>
     the question is greater than the personalities in<lb break="no"/>volved. We must try to see it in that light. I feel, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, that we. are capable of objective 
     <lb/>
     analysis, and just as objective decisions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have stated hitherto that I cannot conceive of 
     <lb/>
     any political democracy succeeding unless it is 
     <lb/>
     based on economic democracy. I hope to have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of enlarging on that thesis. I am 
     <lb/>
     therefore prejudiced, if you will, to the extent that 
     <lb/>
     before any form of government is adopted by this 
     <lb/>
     country, I want to see its economic implications 
     <lb/>
     worked out first. And that applies to confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, responsible government or any other 
     <lb/>
     government that you care to name. There are 
     <lb/>
     businessmen here, representatives of labour and 
     <lb/>
     others who will stand with me on that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whether or not we discuss the possibilities of 
     <lb/>
     federal union with Canada now or later interests 
     <lb/>
     me but little. The issue cannot be evaded, if only 
     <lb/>
     because there are enough people in this country 
     <lb/>
     who want it discussed. There are a great many 
     <lb/>
     people in my own constituency who want it dis<lb break="no"/>cussed — and they are as hardworking and as 
     <lb/>
     loyal Newfoundlanders as any in this country. 
     <lb/>
     They want all the facts - and do not want anyone 
     <lb/>
     to restrict their freedom of choice. That is the way 
     <lb/>
     I feel about the matter. I can conceive of no 
     <lb/>
     reasonable argument against having the matter 
     <lb/>
     aired. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Meanwhile, my own view on the subject of 
     <lb/>
     federal union has in no way been influenced by 
     <lb/>
     the proposer of this motion, nor by its opponents. 
     <lb/>
     Some may look on Canada through highly mag<lb break="no"/>nifying spectacles; others through dark glasses. It 
     <lb/>
     is for us to allow ourselves to be cajoled by none 
     <lb/>
     — and equally important — to be intimidated by 
     <lb/>
     none. But surely it is pertinent to observe that two 
     <lb/>
     countries hitherto independent of each other, can 
     <lb/>
     only, in the ordinary course of events, be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to form a partnership for the same reason 
     <lb/>
     that two natural persons form a partnership m 
     <lb/>
     each expects to be benefitted materially thereby. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     May I state most strongly that I am against any 
     <lb/>
     approach to Canada or any other country, that 
     <lb/>
     places us in the position of the Cinderella appeal<lb break="no"/><pb n="106"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-10-29_Page_0106.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">106</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">October 1946</fw>ing to the fairy godmother. I would go so far as 
     <lb/>
     to say that if that is the kind of people we are, I 
     <lb/>
     don't think Canada would want us — I'm sure 
     <lb/>
     she wouldn't respect us. Certainly, we couldn't 
     <lb/>
     respect ourselves. The whole question of federal 
     <lb/>
     union is bigger than that. It is my feeling the day 
     <lb/>
     may soon come when the peoples of the entire 
     <lb/>
     North American continent may find it even 
     <lb/>
     necessary to let down their barriers and adopt a 
     <lb/>
     common citizenship. Many people feel that day 
     <lb/>
     is long overdue, and that it points the way to 
     <lb/>
     eventual peace and prosperity for all men. Should 
     <lb/>
     that day come, we will need to bring to bear on 
     <lb/>
     the problem sound reasoning in minds free of 
     <lb/>
     thought of personal aggrandisement or selfish 
     <lb/>
     gain. Newfoundlanders are watching us, hoping, 
     <lb/>
     praying that we have among us men equal to the 
     <lb/>
     task. Can we produce men of the calibre of those 
     <lb/>
     who did their duty in these chambers long ago? 
     <lb/>
     If we can, we are saved. God help us if we can't. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Job I feel I should say a few words for or 
     <lb/>against the resolution proposed by Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, and somewhat half-heartedly seconded by 
     <lb/>Mr. Higgins. It is probable that somebody at 
     <lb/>some time will have to ascertain the terms ob<lb break="no"/>tainable for confederation, but personally I doubt 
     <lb/>if this Convention is the body that should ask for 
     <lb/>these terms. I think the request, if any, will have 
     <lb/>to come from a government of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>which at least has some elected representatives 
     <lb/>of Newfoundland in its body. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is most unfortunate that Mr. Smallwood has 
     <lb/>
     disturbed the even tenor of our way, by introduc<lb break="no"/>ing this confederation issue when we were all 
     <lb/>
     working so well together to secure the informa<lb break="no"/>tion necessary for our decisions. No one will 
     <lb/>
     approve of Mr. Smallwood's tactics in seeking to 
     <lb/>
     destroy the independent views of members of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention by enticing them with promises of 
     <lb/>
     seats on the proposed delegation, senatorships, 
     <lb/>
     etc. This savors very much of the old petty 
     <lb/>
     politics and is not conducive to the smooth work<lb break="no"/>ing of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am opposed to the resolution for the follow<lb break="no"/>ing reasons: firstly, I think it is premature for this 
     <lb/>
     Convention to broach the subject of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation at a time when we are bending our energies 
     <lb/>
     to solving the question of our self-supporting 
     <lb/>
     status. Secondly, because I consider that the 
     <lb/>
     resolution as worded is not at all adequate. Pre<lb break="no"/>vious speakers, especially Mr. Harrington, have 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
           
     stressed the first point and I cannot add anything 
     <lb/>
     of value to their remarks. As regards the second 
     <lb/>
     point, my feeling is that if any Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegation is sent to Ottawa, its objects should 
     <lb/>
     range further than a discussion of terms for con<lb break="no"/>federation, and that there should also be dis<lb break="no"/>cussed the general policy of Canada towards 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland if confederation is <hi rendition="simple:italic">not</hi> adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have previously stated that Canada has an 
     <lb/>
     important interest in the future welfare of New<lb break="no"/>foundland on account of the great value of New<lb break="no"/>foundland's strategic position, as evidenced 
     <lb/>
     during the recent war. It might conceivably be to 
     <lb/>
     the interest of both Canada and Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     take down entirely their tariff and immigration 
     <lb/>
     barriers without any actual federal relationship, 
     <lb/>
     and I take the liberty of quoting from a most 
     <lb/>
     interesting address by our very highly respected 
     <lb/>
     fellow citizen, Raymond Gushue, which was 
     <lb/>
     made before the Canadian Club in Ottawa on 
     <lb/>
     February 13, 1945. In this address Mr. Gushue 
     <lb/>
     said in part: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I have referred more than once to the fact 
     <lb/>
    that Newfoundland is indissolubly a part of a 
     <lb/>larger continental unit. North America is in 
     <lb/>many ways one geographic and economic 
     <lb/>entity. Would it not accrue to the benefit and 
     <lb/>well-being of the whole continent if that large 
     <lb/>fact were more fully realised? We are all 
     <lb/>North Americans - more alike in our think<lb break="no"/>ing and ways of living than perhaps any other 
     <lb/>similar collection of contiguous people, in an 
     <lb/>area of great resources and in which we can 
     <lb/>all contribute something to the others. Is not 
     <lb/>this a situation which favours the adoption 
     <lb/>and practical expression of a broad principle 
     <lb/>relating, among other things, to commerce 
     <lb/>among the three countries? Where for ex<lb break="no"/>ample there is an exchange of food — that 
     <lb/>most essential of all articles of commerce - <lb/> should we not examine the merits of free or 
     <lb/>freer interchange? If, in this greater 
     <lb/>geographic and economic entity there are 
     <lb/>regions favoured by nature for the most effi<lb break="no"/>cient, and therefore most economical produc<lb break="no"/>tion of a commodity, why should we try to 
     <lb/>offset that gift, and make living harder, not 
     <lb/>only for producers within such regions, but 
     <lb/>also for consumers within the larger unit? It 
     <lb/>is not only possible but probable, that if the

     with an eye first to the soundness or other<lb break="no"/>wise of the principle, then to its implementa<lb break="no"/>tion as fully as possible, the results could be 
     <lb/>
     of lasting benefit to all the co-partners. I am

     aware of the wider implications of this sug<lb break="no"/>gestion, but feel they merely add force to it.

     If we are really serious about the part which 
     <lb/>
     a freer flow of trade can play in improving 
     <lb/>
     world conditions, if all the recommendations 
     <lb/>
     of international conferences and the admoni<lb break="no"/>tions of policy-makers mean anything, I can 
     <lb/>
     think of no better spring-board from which 
     <lb/>
     this policy can be launched than the entity of 
     <lb/>
     which I speak, where physically, economi<lb break="no"/>cally and idea-logically, conditions are so

     encouraging. If the ripple created spreads out 
     <lb/>
     into a wider circle, we shall have made a real 
     <lb/>
     contribution to the practical exemplification 
     <lb/>
     of the high principles which have been so 
     <lb/>
     convincingly stated at conference tables and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere, and which can be so easily sub<lb break="no"/>merged in the welter of post-war controversy.

     You will observe the bold suggestion that 
     <lb/>
     tariff barriers on foodstuffs not only between 
     <lb/>
     Canada and Newfoundland but also between 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Newfoundland and the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America, might be dropped. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The point might be discussed at the same time 
     <lb/>
     as the confederation terms by a delegation, if any 
     <lb/>
     is sent, and the effect of some such arrangements 
     <lb/>
     so far as all these countries are concerned might 
     <lb/>
     prove to be very much more beneficial than any 
     <lb/>
     confederation arrangements, under which neither 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders nor Canadians would be very 
     <lb/>
     happy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I don't agree with Mr. Smallwood's idea that 
     <lb/>
     there is any need to hasten the request for 
     <lb/>
     Canada's confederation terms, and believe that 
     <lb/>
     he has done himself and this Convention a disser<lb break="no"/>vice by introducing the subject at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. I have not seen in Mr. Smallwood's address 
     <lb/>
     of yesterday, nor in his newspaper correspon<lb break="no"/>dence anything to convince me that the standard 
     <lb/>
     of living of our people would be improved by 
     <lb/>
     confederation, though my mind is open to con<lb break="no"/>viction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope that some day the confederation issue 
     <lb/>
     and our general relations with Canada will be 
     <lb/>
     discussed by this Convention in a calm and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable atmosphere, and the pros and cons 
     <lb/>
     carefully debated in an unprejudiced spirit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     One thing is certain, and that is that we must 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to live on close and friendly terms 
     <lb/>
     with our neighbours in Canada and try to remem<lb break="no"/>ber their many kind acts towards us, as well as to 
     <lb/>
     forget the occasions upon which they have 
     <lb/>
     crossed our path in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I strongly favour the amendment proposed by 
     <lb/>
    Mr. Penney to postpone further discussion of 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood's resolution, and intend to vote 
     <lb/>for the amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Burry I rise to make a few remarks on this 
     <lb/>question before the House. I was hoping that 
     <lb/>today we would get around to the debate on the 
     <lb/>report of the Education Committee, and that 
     <lb/>would give us a chance to cool off from yes<lb break="no"/>terday. I find myself regretting that the issue 
     <lb/>yesterday was on the level that it was, not in the 
     <lb/>spirit of condemnation of any member who took 
     <lb/>part, because I can assure those who did take part 
     <lb/>and raised their voices towards the end and if I 
     <lb/>may say, got a little hot under the collar, had no 
     <lb/>more attentive listener in this House than myself. 
     <lb/>Not because I agreed with what they said or how 
     <lb/>they said it, but because I know how interested 
     <lb/>they are in the issue, and I feel they were sincere 
     <lb/>in the attitude they took towards it... I have 
     <lb/>found myself, and will find myself, in a position 
     <lb/>such as these men were yesterday, and get excited 
     <lb/>over some of the issues that will be raised; but if 
     <lb/>I do, I assure you I will call upon all the powers 
     <lb/>that I have to control myself and to conform to 
     <lb/>the rules of procedure, and to carry on the debate 
     <lb/>as quietly, or as near to the rules of procedure, as 
     <lb/>possible. I do not wish to have this Convention 
     <lb/>resolved into a boys' Sunday school class.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     We have this matter before us and we have to 
     <lb/>
     do something about it... We are working as<lb break="no"/>siduously in committee meetings, getting infor<lb break="no"/>mation in various ways. That will inform us on 
     <lb/>
     forms of government, such as responsible 
     <lb/>
     government of the past and Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government of the present, and I may say that 
     <lb/>
     when these committee reports are brought into 
     <lb/>
     the house, all the information will not be on the 
     <lb/>
     debit side of those who favour responsible 
     <lb/>
     government or Commission government. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that when we have discovered all the facts, those 
     <lb/>
     who sponsor these forms of government will 
     <lb/>
     have very fine creditable arguments to bring for<lb break="no"/>ward. Some feel there are other forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment... Of these, confederation with Canada is

     one; there are others but I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     make any other suggestions. I do say that there 
     <lb/>
     are other forms coming up for discussion when 
     <lb/>
     the time comes. I am not prepared and may not 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">then</hi> be prepared... I do not know enough about 
     <lb/>
     constitutional government and about confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with Canada, and just how we would come 
     <lb/>
     out if we decided to get into confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to know more and have an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of thinking it over.... Personally I do not feel I 
     <lb/>
     could progress as willingly with the work of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention if I did not feel that I would have the 
     <lb/>
     information which would enable me to discuss 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada. I know there is a 
     <lb/>
     majority of people in this country and in Labrador 
     <lb/>
     who are thinking that this matter of confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada is a possible way out of our apparent 
     <lb/>
     difficulties and in getting a decent living for our 
     <lb/>
     people. They may be wrong in that; but there is a 
     <lb/>
     considerable number of such people in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Labrador and we should satisfy 
     <lb/>
     them by bringing in intelligent observations on 
     <lb/>
     that form of government. I feel that I must vote 
     <lb/>
     for the resolution in order to get information 
     <lb/>
     about other forms of government. I do not feel 
     <lb/>
     any member of this Convention would want to 
     <lb/>
     deny the people this information. If the 
     <lb/>
     machinery is not set up it will delay the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and I do not want to be here longer than I 
     <lb/>
     have to be. It is unfair to us if the Convention 
     <lb/>
     votes down this motion; other men are getting 
     <lb/>
     information about other forms of government; I 
     <lb/>
     feel that I should get this information and the 
     <lb/>
     machinery should be set up to get it.

            <p>
     Mr. Vincent After listening to yesterday's stor<lb break="no"/>my debate on the resolution submitted by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, I felt rather disillusioned, for I had 
     <lb/>
     thought that, with only a very small faction of this 
     <lb/>
     assembly schooled in the ways of old time poli<lb break="no"/>tics, the days of personal recriminations and un<lb break="no"/>pleasant invective hurled back and forth with 
     <lb/>
     almost atomic energy had well passed into 
     <lb/>
     oblivion. I am not I trust departing from the usual 
     <lb/>
     and expected courtesies when I say that not only 
     <lb/>
     was much of yesterday's discussion pointless, 
     <lb/>
     but it was not all conducive to the future wise 
     <lb/>
     deliberations of this body. Basically the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion was sound, the timing definitely right, and as 
     <lb/>
     to the attitude of the public to its reception, I 
     <lb/>
     affirm with some authority, and a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     cross-section of opinion on the northeast coast, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
           
     that confederation is fast becoming a live issue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I divert with your kind permission to make a 
     <lb/>
     bow to the gentlemen of the press, over-anxious 
     <lb/>
     I believe to know the political leanings of the men 
     <lb/>
     who comprise this assembly. They did dig up a 
     <lb/>
     left-wing socialist. So now I'll make a definite 
     <lb/>
     statement for their benefit. I am not and will not 
     <lb/>
     be a confederate until and unless the terms of 
     <lb/>
     union are obtained and are found to be in the best 
     <lb/>
     interest of Newfoundland as a whole. I say 
     <lb/>
     without any apology and with no hesitation that 
     <lb/>
     with the facts at present at my command, if a 
     <lb/>
     referendum were held tomorrow, I would vote for 
     <lb/>
     a retention of Commission of Government. I 
     <lb/>
     make no apology for saying that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is my opinion that the terms of reference 
     <lb/>
     setting up this Convention provide an adequate 
     <lb/>
     procedure for full examination of all the issues, 
     <lb/>
     and naturally in the light of present-day events, 
     <lb/>
     these should include the terms of union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada — unlike Mr. Harrington I am not greatly 
     <lb/>
     concerned with the legal fabric constituting such 
     <lb/>
     procedure, and am well content to leave that to 
     <lb/>
     the legal minds actively associated with this as<lb break="no"/>sembly. What does concern me as the repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of a district very genuinely interested in 
     <lb/>
     the status of our government — a district that 
     <lb/>
     does not expect me to be biased in my view or 
     <lb/>
     narrow in my approach to the vital problem con<lb break="no"/>fronting this Convention, a district which in<lb break="no"/>vested me with the power to investigate and 
     <lb/>
     explore every issue, is to see that there be no 
     <lb/>
     restriction of the free choice of the people or 
     <lb/>
     abrogation of their rights to express their 
     <lb/>
     franchise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This resolution is not at all premature; ma<lb break="no"/>chinery can be set up to arrange for securing the 
     <lb/>
     terms and now is the proper and opportune time 
     <lb/>
     to set about it. It is of little moment what my 
     <lb/>
     political sympathies are, whether I stand a con 
     <lb/>
     firmed supporter of the present administration or 
     <lb/>
     an avowed hater of old-time politics. It would be 
     <lb/>
     foolhardy for me to assert a superior knowledge, 
     <lb/>
     to say "I know what's best for my district and for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and I will fight confederation or 
     <lb/>
     responsible government to the last ditch" - <lb/> what's more, to my mind it's positively dan<lb break="no"/>gerous. The Newfoundland electorate will not be 
     <lb/>
     treated with impunity after giving their approval 
     <lb/>
     to the setting up of this Convention. They have 
     <lb/>
     reserved the right to decide, in the last analysis, 
     <lb/>

     just what kind of government they want, not what 
     <lb/>
     the Convention thinks is best for them. Will one 
     <lb/>
     of us then, mistakenly identifying himself as a 
     <lb/>
     Daniel Webster and an Abe Lincoln rolled into 
     <lb/>
     one, and falsely assuming an authority that was 
     <lb/>
     never vested on him, get up and say, "You can't 
     <lb/>
     vote for Commission, I positively hate it, and I 
     <lb/>
     am going to ensure you don't get a chance to vote 
     <lb/>
     for union with Canada." To me its very obvious 
     <lb/>
     that a few of us have improperly imagined that 
     <lb/>
     we are the be-all and the end-all here. I won't 
     <lb/>
     repeat that much-quoted text from the terms of 
     <lb/>
     reference, Mr. Chairman, for your lucid explana<lb break="no"/>tion of said terms at the outset of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     made it clear beyond a doubt that this assembly 
     <lb/>
     has no right to restrict the choice of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country or limit the issues. For my part, I 
     <lb/>
     know nothing that might even remotely suggest 
     <lb/>
     confederation would be an extremely good or 
     <lb/>
     definitely bad issue to put on the ballot in the 
     <lb/>
     forthcoming referendum. I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     believe, nor will I be convinced that any member 
     <lb/>
     of this assembly is in the least cognisant with the 
     <lb/>
     text of the terms that may be offered us, apart 
     <lb/>
     from the outmoded BNA Act which does give us 
     <lb/>
     recognition in sections 146-147. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some of us may be concerned about narrow 
     <lb/>
     nationalism, I am not; others may be worrying 
     <lb/>
     about their place in that administration of tomor<lb break="no"/>row, but that doesn't worry me in the least; but I 
     <lb/>
     am deeply concerned that the boys and girls of 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow grow up in an environment that is 
     <lb/>
     much better than that of their forebears. I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned that the government that will help 
     <lb/>
     shape our future be a government that will work 
     <lb/>
     in the best interest of Newfoundlanders every<lb break="no"/>where, north, south, east and west. The people 
     <lb/>
     who sent us here are looking to this Convention 
     <lb/>
     for something constructive. They do not expect 
     <lb/>
     that we will revert to the days of useless 
     <lb/>
     recrimination and name-calling; they expect 
     <lb/>
     some definite recommendations. We must justify 
     <lb/>
     our existence, but we must not seek to unneces<lb break="no"/>sarily lengthen the life of this assembly, or it 
     <lb/>
     might well be that this costly experiment may 
     <lb/>
     cause our fellow-countrymen to lose their 
     <lb/>
     patience. We were given a definite assignment a 
     <lb/>
     clear-cut assignment, so let's forget our petty 
     <lb/>
     bickerings and go straight to our objective. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, as the voice of the men and 
     <lb/>
     women of Bonavista North, who are intelligently 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     watching the outcome of this Convention, who 
     <lb/>
     hold to the undeniable rights of free men and free 
     <lb/>
     women to choose for themselves, I support the 
     <lb/>
     resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Roberts This being my first time to address 
     <lb/>
     this assembly, I hope you will be patient if I do 
     <lb/>
     not stick strictly to parliamentary procedure. In 
     <lb/>
     seconding the amendment I did not do so with 
     <lb/>
     any intimation of not getting Canada's terms for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I considered the time inoppor<lb break="no"/>tune; when all committee work is finished and we 
     <lb/>
     have a picture of the financial state of the country, 
     <lb/>
     then will come the time to approach Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     was elected by acclamation and did not have to 
     <lb/>
     canvass my district for any political plank. But, 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the admissions of some of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, I did come here with an idea of the form of 
     <lb/>
     government I would like to see in this country. I 
     <lb/>
     am not going to disclose it at this time. But I may 
     <lb/>
     say I am not an advocate for confederation. This 
     <lb/>
     does not necessarily mean I would not favour 
     <lb/>
     confederation or any other form of government, 
     <lb/>
     if it can be shown me that it would be better for 
     <lb/>
     the country. So in due time I hope the proper 
     <lb/>
     authorities will find out for us what Canada's 
     <lb/>
     terms are. After all, as Mr. MacDonald said, we 
     <lb/>
     have a large number of people in this island who 
     <lb/>
     are sympathetic to the idea of confederation, why 
     <lb/>
     not give them a chance to learn more about it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was said by a member of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     that Canada's terms would be so favourable we 
     <lb/>
     would become confederates overnight. I am in<lb break="no"/>clined to take this with a grain of salt. When we 
     <lb/>
     read the history of. this country and see the raw 
     <lb/>
     deals we have always received, confederation 
     <lb/>
     may be another one of those deals. If we approach 
     <lb/>
     Canada as Mr. Smallwood would have us, saying 
     <lb/>
     we are a poor, ignorant, ill-clad, diseased, starv<lb break="no"/>ing people, do you suppose we can expect 
     <lb/>
     generous terms? I would say "No". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I resent the expression that we are such a 
     <lb/>
     people; it's true we have some cases as he has 
     <lb/>
     described. I have seen people in such dilapidated 
     <lb/>
     shacks here in this city, that it's unbelievable they 
     <lb/>
     could live there, especially during the winter 
     <lb/>
     months. I never saw the like in an outport — as 
     <lb/>
     bad as we are supposed to live. But the same 
     <lb/>
     exists in the city of Ottawa with all its fabulous 
     <lb/>
     wealth. A relative of mine, a Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     woman who became the matron of a large hospi<lb break="no"/>tal in Quebec province, had many an argument 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="110"

     with Canadians about living conditions in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. She often told them they had only to 
     <lb/>
     slip outside of their back doors to see far worse 
     <lb/>
     than she ever saw in Newfoundland. These 
     <lb/>
     people never saw Newfoundland. They got their 
     <lb/>
     information from propaganda such as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood delivered here yesterday. Some 
     <lb/>
     time ago I saw a comparison of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Canadian prices in our daily papers. There 
     <lb/>
     were some very important omissions. A relative 
     <lb/>
     of mine living in western Canada paid for New<lb break="no"/>foundland dry cod — and for our worst quality 
     <lb/>
     — 50 cents a pound or $6 a quintal. Our firm 
     <lb/>
     packed herring this spring for which we received 
     <lb/>
     $15.75 a barrel, a good price. This person paid 25 
     <lb/>
     cents each for Newfoundland split herring or 
     <lb/>
     $ 125 a barrel. Our lobster fishermen received the 
     <lb/>
     equivalent of $1 a pound for lobster meal. A 
     <lb/>
     friend of mine in Montreal paid $5.25 for it. I 
     <lb/>
     could tell you of other things, but this will suffice 
     <lb/>
     to show you that Canadians are also gypped on 
     <lb/>
     some prices as well as Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am a Newfoundlander, first, last and always; 
     <lb/>
     and if I am poor, I am proud. I am of middle age 
     <lb/>
     and am not worrying about my future, but I want 
     <lb/>
     my family to get as good a living in New<lb break="no"/>foundland as I have had, and I don't see why we 
     <lb/>
     cannot find good men to look after the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     state. Why should we run whining to Canada or 
     <lb/>
     some other country to take us in? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the years of responsible government I 
     <lb/>
     mentioned to a learned friend of mine that I was 
     <lb/>
     alarmed at the borrowing of our government. He 
     <lb/>
     laughed. "Don't worry about that", said he, 
     <lb/>
     "there will always be money for the country to 
     <lb/>
     borrow." But alas, the time came when we could 
     <lb/>
     not borrow and the government collapsed. I look 
     <lb/>
     at the borrowings of our wealthy neighbour 
     <lb/>
     Canada with the same alarm, and feel sure the 
     <lb/>
     time will come when her borrowings will come 
     <lb/>
     to an end in spite of all her reputed wealth. I don't 
     <lb/>
     want this country to be a part of Canada and have 
     <lb/>
     to face another period of financial stress such as 
     <lb/>
     was witnessed in this country in the 1930s, 
     <lb/>
     brought about by the borrowings of her govern<lb break="no"/>ments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the war England's national debt in<lb break="no"/>creased by millions. Her people had to tighten 
     <lb/>
     their belts and the standard of living was down. 
     <lb/>
     When the war ended her people said, "Now we 
     <lb/>
     will begin to live", but the Labour government, 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     said, "No, we have a debt to pay. Haul in your 
     <lb/>
     belts a bit tighter. Pay our bills, then you can have 
     <lb/>
     eggs and bread, motor cars, etc." The standard of 
     <lb/>
     living in England today is lower than in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. They are now putting their house 
     <lb/>
     in order. They are doing a lot of grumbling, but 
     <lb/>
     they are tackling the job, and here are we in the 
     <lb/>
     height of prosperity afraid to tackle the future -<lb/> wanting someone else to do our job. Neverthe<lb break="no"/>less, the least we can do is to examine Canada's 
     <lb/>
     terms when we are ready, and I hope the people 
     <lb/>
     who go for these terms will be proud and upright 
     <lb/>
     citizens of Newfoundland, not snivellers and 
     <lb/>
     whiners. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Fowler I feel at this time in duty bound to 
     <lb/>
     express my opinion on the motion now before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair. My opinion, will not influence this Con<lb break="no"/>vention to any great extent, yet before the bar of 
     <lb/>
     history I wish to leave no shadow of doubt 
     <lb/>
     regarding my position in this issue, regardless of 
     <lb/>
     whether the judgment will be favourable to me or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I consider Mr. Smallwood's motion prema<lb break="no"/>ture, poorly timed and badly presented, and his 
     <lb/>
     unwarranted attack upon our island home could 
     <lb/>
     elicit nothing but resentment from a loyal and 
     <lb/>
     ancient people conscious of their heritage. I dis<lb break="no"/>agree entirely with Mr. Smallwood when he says 
     <lb/>
     our outlook is darker than it was a century ago. It 
     <lb/>
     is only now that we are becoming conscious of 
     <lb/>
     our strategic position at the crossroads of the 
     <lb/>
     world, the bastion of the North Atlantic, a posi<lb break="no"/>tion which has been proved vital to the very 
     <lb/>
     existence of the Empire, and particularly to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's paradise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot understand how this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     with no constitutional rights, can go empty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     handed to the Canadian government and ask for 
     <lb/>
     terms of federal union. We have no terms to offer 
     <lb/>
     them, nor the right to discuss them, and has not 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian prime minister himself said that 
     <lb/>
     Canada would only discuss confederation at the 
     <lb/>
     request of the Newfoundland people through 
     <lb/>
     their duly elected government? Many speakers 
     <lb/>
     have expressed doubt as to the whole issue, and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood himself, by the very wording of 
     <lb/>
     his resolution showed he was as much at sea 
     <lb/>
     regarding the proper approach as any of us. Sure<lb break="no"/>ly somebody knows the answer. If so they should 
     <lb/>
     advance it, and enable us to discuss the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter intelligently.

     reports of the various committees; secondly be<lb break="no"/>cause in the ears and eyes of the public it will 
     <lb/>
     eclipse the facts that should be given careful 
     <lb/>
     study at this time. I feel that if there are people in 
     <lb/>
     this country interested in confederation, and if we 
     <lb/>
     believe in democracy, we must at the proper time 
     <lb/>
     give them the opportunity to express their desires. 
     <lb/>
     I think that had Mr. Smallwood awaited a more 
     <lb/>
     opportune time, and introduced his resolution in 
     <lb/>
     a different spirit, there could have been little 
     <lb/>
     reasonable opposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must confess I was not invited to the alleged 
     <lb/>
     confederation "conference", nor did Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood as yet make any overture to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suggest we define once and for all our posi<lb break="no"/>tion, and with confidence pursue our tasks to a 
     <lb/>successful conclusion with equal rights for all 
     <lb/>and privileges for none. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman and members of the 
     <lb/>Convention, contrary to the expressed opinions 
     <lb/>of a great many, we have already reached the 
     <lb/>stage when the subject matter before us calls for 
     <lb/>alert thinking and lively debate. I came to this 
     <lb/>Convention with an open mind, and I still main<lb break="no"/>tain it in spite of what anyone may guess or think. 
     <lb/>My mind is closed only on the form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment that I do not think for a moment any member 
     <lb/>of this Convention, elected under strictly 
     <lb/>democratic principles, would tolerate, that being 
     <lb/>a continued dictatorship for this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Before we have had a real opportunity of even 
     <lb/>
     weighing the pros and cons of our terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence, in order to soberly tackle the tremendous 
     <lb/>
     task before us, some of the Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canadian papers have chosen the future leaders 
     <lb/>
     of our country. To these people I would say, 
     <lb/>
     "Judge not that ye be not judged", unless your 
     <lb/>
     judgment shows some semblance of intelligence. 
     <lb/>
     Who knows, from the little ground we have 
     <lb/>
     covered, but what the real leaders of New<lb break="no"/>foundland may have scarcely spoken at this Con<lb break="no"/>vention. In fact they may not be here at all.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have not been offered any job. No one has 
     <lb/>
     attempted to bribe me to vote for or against the 
     <lb/>
     resolution and if they had it would not influence 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     me in the least. I am prepared to sink or swim on 
     <lb/>
     the dictates of my own conscience. My district 
     <lb/>
     gave me a clear mandate to vote according to the 
     <lb/>
     facts as I saw them. I went through that same 
     <lb/>
     district in 1932 as a strictly independent can<lb break="no"/>didate after refusing a party ticket with expenses 
     <lb/>
     paid, and polled 820 votes or 100 over the party 
     <lb/>
     candidate. This time in the same district I had 
     <lb/>
     about the same number as the whole of my five 
     <lb/>
     opponents put together, and I never had a single 
     <lb/>
     interruption or a sarcastic question in my whole 
     <lb/>
     campaign. My people generally want to know 
     <lb/>
     what the best terms for confederation would be, 
     <lb/>
     and to know what the chances are of continuing 
     <lb/>
     on our own, as there are many erroneous state<lb break="no"/>ments in the air for and against, and it is our duty 
     <lb/>
     to clarify the issue and enlighten the public as far 
     <lb/>
     as possible on the matter. It is solely with this 
     <lb/>
     motive in view that I support the resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wish to make it clear I had never seen or 
     <lb/>
     discussed it with anyone except as a casual 
     <lb/>
     remark among the members. As far as getting the 
     <lb/>
     terms for confederation with Canada is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, it is our bounden duty to get them and see 
     <lb/>
     just what they are. We would be failing in our 
     <lb/>
     obligation to the people if we were to terminate 
     <lb/>
     our deliberations without making a fair and 
     <lb/>
     proper analysis in minute detail covering every 
     <lb/>
     phase of their offer as far as it would affect the 
     <lb/>
     future economy of this country. What we must 
     <lb/>
     eventually decide to recommend is what in our 
     <lb/>
     opinion would be the greatest good for the 
     <lb/>
     greatest number. I do regret that it has entered the 
     <lb/>
     discussion stage so early in our proceedings, and 
     <lb/>
     it devolves on us the responsibility of holding our 
     <lb/>
     heads, controlling our language and avoiding as 
     <lb/>
     far as possible any real debate on what might be 
     <lb/>
     the ultimate outcome of a matter so vitally affect<lb break="no"/>ing the future of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not propose to suggest any particular form 
     <lb/>
     of government for our country at this juncture as 
     <lb/>
     it would be premature. All forms of government 
     <lb/>
     should be left out of our deliberations as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible until the basic facts of our peculiar 
     <lb/>
     economic set-up are fully explored. At the proper 
     <lb/>
     time this important part of our duty will be 
     <lb/>
     properly taken care of and every phase of our case 
     <lb/>
     will be fully covered. Gentlemen, what you say 
     <lb/>
     or do here will go down in history and your names 
     <lb/>
     will be blazoned in future text books for the 
     <lb/>
     principles you support. What such a member or

     paper said in criticism of your language or in 
     <lb/>
     contempt for disloyal politicians will be forgot<lb break="no"/>ten; but the contribution we make toward lifting 
     <lb/>
     our country from this shameful abyss, to re-es<lb break="no"/>tablishing our civic pride and independence as a 
     <lb/>
     free people, either on our own or as propor<lb break="no"/>tionately equal partners within the framework of 
     <lb/>
     the British Commonwealth, will live forever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are now, or should be, all working 
     <lb/>
     together for one common goal, that being a 
     <lb/>
     thorough study of our assets and liabilities, with 
     <lb/>
     a view to deciding whether or not we are self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting... We all have certain pet ideas on forms 
     <lb/>
     of government; but many of these corners will be 
     <lb/>
     brushed off when the basic facts of our true 
     <lb/>
     position and most peculiar economic structure 
     <lb/>
     are fully understood by the members as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     I am most conscious and deeply concerned over 
     <lb/>
     every aspect of our case, and I shall under all 
     <lb/>
     circumstances base my recommendations on the 
     <lb/>
     facts and the results of our findings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What we have learned already calls for brave 
     <lb/>
     men, with big hearts, gifted with a clear unbiased 
     <lb/>
     understanding of the many broader issues at 
     <lb/>
     stake. We should not be influenced by mere 
     <lb/>
     oratory, anyone can write a speech; but, it is the 
     <lb/>
     cold-blooded undeniable facts alone that should 
     <lb/>
     influence our decisions. We are all very con<lb break="no"/>scious of the disgraceful manner in which our 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate country has been exploited in the 
     <lb/>
     past, and how it is still the victim of soulless 
     <lb/>
     individuals, to whom suffering, liberty, the 
     <lb/>
     people's fear of want or respect for the rights of 
     <lb/>
     others, mean nothing. Therefore the future form 
     <lb/>
     of government must be the people's choice, but 
     <lb/>
     from this elected body must emanate a true un<lb break="no"/>biased picture of the real facts as we know them, 
     <lb/>
     in order to assist our people to vote intelligently 
     <lb/>
     at the polls. There is only one commitment I will 
     <lb/>
     make and there is no limit to which I would not 
     <lb/>
     go to defend it — that any future form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment for Newfoundland should be fully 
     <lb/>
     democratic in principle We have earned it, paid 
     <lb/>
     for it in blood, and we must have it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Banfield Mr. Chairman, whether we are 
     <lb/>
     confederates or anti-confederates, I don't see that 
     <lb/>
     it enters into the picture when it comes to voting 
     <lb/>
     on this motion. It is not a motion that makes 
     <lb/>
     confederates of us, nor anti-confederates of 
     <lb/>
     us, that takes any stand in the matter — it is not 
     <lb/>
     a pro-confederation motion, nor an anti-con<lb break="no"/><cb/>federation motion. If I were the strongest and 
     <lb/>
     bitterest anti-confederate in this Convention, I 
     <lb/>
     would vote to get the terms of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     even if it was only for the purpose of attacking 
     <lb/>
     the terms. I cannot see that this Convention has 
     <lb/>
     any moral right to vote against the resolution, 
     <lb/>
     because it means voting against getting infor<lb break="no"/>mation that the people want. The people are 
     <lb/>
     expecting us to be fair and square, to get all the 
     <lb/>
     facts about confederation or any other form of 
     <lb/>
     government. There will be precious little respect 
     <lb/>
     for us if we close our ears and our minds to any 
     <lb/>
     proposal that may be for the good of the people. 
     <lb/>
     Who knows? Confederation may turn out to be 
     <lb/>
     the best thing that ever happened to us. It may 
     <lb/>
     also turn out to be the worst thing. We don't know 
     <lb/>
     which it would be, because we don't know what 
     <lb/>
     we're talking about. We can't be confederates 
     <lb/>
     today, any more than we can be anti-con<lb break="no"/>federates. The first thing to do is get the facts, and 
     <lb/>
     that's all the resolution asks. I am one of the many 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders anxious to get at the facts. I 
     <lb/>
     want to make up my mind on this confederation 
     <lb/>
     question that has been kicked about in this 
     <lb/>
     country as long as I can remember as a political 
     <lb/>
     football. We were never told the truth — we were 
     <lb/>
     never given the facts about it. We all want to do 
     <lb/>
     the best possible thing for the country. When we 
     <lb/>
     know the terms and conditions, then we can form 
     <lb/>
     a sensible opinion. We will know if it is worth 
     <lb/>
     recommending, and the people will know if it's 
     <lb/>
     worth voting for. I am not afraid of the people, of 
     <lb/>
     their fairness or common sense. I trust their sound 
     <lb/>
     judgment. It is not for this Convention to say 
     <lb/>
     whether we shall have confederation or not, that 
     <lb/>
     is not our job. That is up to the people. It is for 
     <lb/>
     them to decide whether we'll have confederation 
     <lb/>
     or any other form of government. This resolution 
     <lb/>
     asks us to agree that we want the facts about 
     <lb/>
     confederation. I agree and if Mr. Smallwood had 
     <lb/>
     not moved this resolution I would have moved it 
     <lb/>
     myself, because I think it is our duty. I think we 
     <lb/>
     owe it to our Newfoundland people so I am going 
     <lb/>
     to vote for this resolution when the vote is taken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman, I had not any intenx 
     <lb/>tion of discussing the present question, nor do I 
     <lb/>consider it calls for any lengthy debate; therefore 
     <lb/>I shall be as brief as possible. I will refer to a 
     <lb/>remark made by Mr. Butt earlier. He said: "We 
     <lb/>don't seem to be quite clear on many things", and 
     <lb/>I would say that we don't seem to know where 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="113"

     we are going, and are inclined to drift. This 
     <lb/>
     certainly applies to the question now being dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. To my mind we must establish certain 
     <lb/>
     things first One of these is whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     Convention can, and if so, will, discuss this point 
     <lb/>
     has not been continued beyond any doubt. If the 
     <lb/>
     answer is no, then let's put it in the attic; if yes, 
     <lb/>
     then we might as well recognise it as part of our 
     <lb/>
     work and drop the parley. The possible forms of 
     <lb/>
     government to be discussed should be listed, and 
     <lb/>
     this should have been done long ago. In this 
     <lb/>
     respect I claim we are drifting. By not doing this 
     <lb/>
     we rest on the haphazard manner of having the 
     <lb/>
     issues introduced by ardent supporters — would- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     be leaders — who in their turn win the an<lb break="no"/>tagonism of the proponents and would-be leaders 
     <lb/>
     of some other form, and so we get a succession 
     <lb/>
     of blind rushes accompanied by invective which 
     <lb/>
     is unnecessary here. Surely we can discuss this 
     <lb/>
     matter without adopting the low methods of at<lb break="no"/>tack resorted to by some delegates. I have heard 
     <lb/>
     it said and read in both the local and foreign press, 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland, and the world, looks to the 
     <lb/>
     men of the National Convention to supply at least 
     <lb/>
     in part material for future governments. How 
     <lb/>
     disappointing it is then, and sad, to hear these men 
     <lb/>
     fall back on low methods of attack. Surely it is a 
     <lb/>
     poor recommendation for local autonomy. Fur<lb break="no"/>ther still, these blind rushes show always a lenien<lb break="no"/>cy towards some particular form of government 
     <lb/>
     desired by the speaker, as well as a move to crush 
     <lb/>
     any contrary opinion. This is a definite shortcom<lb break="no"/>ing. I and others like me, would be content to hear 
     <lb/>
     propositions from all the major powers, England, 
     <lb/>
     Canada, etc.... Yet there are those so confirmed 
     <lb/>
     in their opinion that they would narrow the field 
     <lb/>
     of survey. Had we not then better end this Con<lb break="no"/>vention in view of the predominance of this con<lb break="no"/>firmed opinion? No, we had better go right on 
     <lb/>
     with our programme, because sitting before me 
     <lb/>
     are delegates willing to give a fair hearing to all 
     <lb/>
     issues. To these delegates, and I hold it an honour 
     <lb/>
     to be one of them, I say stand firm. Not through 
     <lb/>
     high oratory or low invective is the real issue 
     <lb/>
     found, but rather in the cool calculated decisions 
     <lb/>
     I know you are so capable of making. Mr. Job, 
     <lb/>
     speaking to an earlier meeting and referring to the 
     <lb/>
     St. John's merchants, said the old suspicion still 
     <lb/>
     exists. I will, if I may, make a similar remark 
     <lb/>
     about the outport members... We read in the 
     <lb/>
     press and hear in everyday conversation how 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     these outport men are being talked over, yea 
     <lb/>
     bought over, by the would-be leaders. Since this 
     <lb/>
     opinion has been stated on the floor of the house 
     <lb/>
     I deem it my unpleasant duty to tell any delegates 
     <lb/>
     who might have short-sighted opinions of the 
     <lb/>
     outport men, that these men are here with a 
     <lb/>
     knowledge born of realism; that they are New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders and have just as much patriotism as 
     <lb/>
     any member here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I have said, these discussions disclose a 
     <lb/>
     leniency towards whichever form of government 
     <lb/>
     a particular speaker closely guards as his secret, 
     <lb/>
     or, as in some cases, openly declares as his plat<lb break="no"/>form, both to my mind equally harmful. We have 
     <lb/>
     as a result a wall of suspicion and jealousy build<lb break="no"/>ing up, so much so that name-calling is just 
     <lb/>
     around the comer, so that the question is not 
     <lb/>
     discussed, but rather the personalities behind the 
     <lb/>
     question. I fear that our decisions will not be in 
     <lb/>
     the best interest of Newfoundland. We have in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention no Hitlers, no Quislings, no 
     <lb/>
     Judases, nor do we expect to give to the world a 
     <lb/>
     new demon or God. Why then discuss per<lb break="no"/>sonalities? Why stand on that philosophical 
     <lb/>
     pedestal on which some members try so hard to 
     <lb/>
     balance? There have been instances in the world 
     <lb/>
     of some born philosophers, but they have been 
     <lb/>
     rare. Let's be content with the fact that we are a 
     <lb/>
     bunch of ordinary Newfoundlanders.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I have been lis<lb break="no"/>tening with considerable interest to these addres<lb break="no"/>ses of yesterday and today, and I have given quite 
     <lb/>
     a lot of thought to this question, as it is one of the 
     <lb/>
     most important to come before us up to now. I 
     <lb/>
     think from what I can gather that the majority of 
     <lb/>
     the members here, perhaps all of them, are in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the motion as put by Mr. Smallwood. I 
     <lb/>
     myself subscribe to the motion, but I cannot 
     <lb/>
     subscribe to the immediate rush of having this 
     <lb/>
     submitted at the present time. Some people want 
     <lb/>
     the Convention to be finished before Christmas, 
     <lb/>
     some finished by January, and there must be an 
     <lb/>
     election, according to Mr. Smallwood by May. 
     <lb/>
     This job is probably one of the most important in 
     <lb/>
     the history of the country, and the few months or 
     <lb/>
     a year we may take to thoroughly go into this 
     <lb/>
     question and arrive at a conclusion should not 
     <lb/>
     interfere. It may be for the benefit of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland for the next 100 years or more, 
     <lb/>
     and what's a year in that? I think we are rushing 
     <lb/>
     too much.... I have a feeling that even the reports

     have been rushed. It is not a matter of short 
     <lb/>
     investigation on something small. It is even big<lb break="no"/>ger than some of the delegates realise... We 
     <lb/>
     should carry on as we are until we come to some 
     <lb/>
     definite conclusions; there will be plenty of time 
     <lb/>
     to get the terms of confederation. There is lots to 
     <lb/>
     do before we get round to discussing it. After 
     <lb/>
     earnest consideration, I cannot do anything but 
     <lb/>
     support the amendment Mr. Penney put forward 
     <lb/>
     yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Keough ....At this moment, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     I hold no brief for confederation. At this moment 
     <lb/>
     I am not convinced that we should come to enjoy 
     <lb/>
     a more spacious tomorrow as the tenth province 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, than we should enjoy should we 
     <lb/>
     undertake to carry on crosshanded. I should like 
     <lb/>
     that to be quite clear. I should also like it to be 
     <lb/>
     remembered that I said "at this moment". For 
     <lb/>
     when we come to the working out of the equation, 
     <lb/>
     the answer I arrive at may well make me a con<lb break="no"/>firmed confederate. It may make me exactly the 
     <lb/>
     opposite. For the moment I am more concerned 
     <lb/>
     to probe for the identity of several as yet un<lb break="no"/>known quantities — among them the terms of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wish to speak in support of the motion moved 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Smallwood because I consider that there 
     <lb/>
     is a matter of principle involved. The principle is 
     <lb/>
     this: the right of the people of Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>
     know all the facts, to see both sides of the story 
     <lb/>
     to be shown all the angles. When the people of 
     <lb/>
     this island finally come to determine upon the 
     <lb/>
     form of government they desire I want them to 
     <lb/>
     be in a position to determine, if they so desire, 
     <lb/>
     upon that form of government that will admit of 
     <lb/>
     a higher standard of living than any other. They 
     <lb/>
     may well determine upon that form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment that will just enable them to make both ends 
     <lb/>
     meet — they hope. But they should be in a 
     <lb/>
     position then, among the several forms that may 
     <lb/>
     be available to their discretion, to determine upon 
     <lb/>
     that calculated to mean the most in terms of better 
     <lb/>
     living. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When we read our terms of reference we find 
     <lb/>
     that we are here, in the first instance, to examine 
     <lb/>
     into the economic and financial condition of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In interpretation of those terms a not incon<lb break="no"/>siderable number of people would subscribe to 
     <lb/>
     the view that we here should endeavour, in the 
     <lb/>
     first instance, to answer the question, "Just how 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
           
     much of what is enough?" — meaning enough to 
     <lb/>
     get along, or enough to make both ends meet and 
     <lb/>
     have a little to spare that could be tied into a little 
     <lb/>
     bow of security. I am not satisfied that it is 
     <lb/>
     "enough" to know where one's next meal is com<lb break="no"/>ing from. I see no reason for subscribing to any 
     <lb/>
     lesser dimension of "enough" than a standard of 
     <lb/>
     living for our people comparable with that en~ 
     <lb/>
     joyed by other western peoples. Whether we can 
     <lb/>
     ever rise to such material apexes is another mat<lb break="no"/>ter. But I see no good and sufficient reason for 
     <lb/>
     being satisfied with anything less. "Enough", as 
     <lb/>
     far as I am concerned, is not less than the most 
     <lb/>
     that may be had. I hate to say anything so original, 
     <lb/>
     but the best is none too good. And, whilst I do not 
     <lb/>
     wish to imply that confederation is the best that 
     <lb/>
     may be had, I do wish to affirm that we must not 
     <lb/>
     fail to search out all information that will enable 
     <lb/>
     the people of this island to judge wherein the best 
     <lb/>
     may be achieved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are some who are prepared to settle for 
     <lb/>
     less than that. Thus we hear much mention of the 
     <lb/>
     irreducible minimum cost of government. I do 
     <lb/>
     not like that yardstick. A mere 36 inches of ability 
     <lb/>
     to make both ends meet at this moment would 
     <lb/>
     seem to me too meagre a measure of our ability 
     <lb/>
     to be sufficient unto ourselves tomorrow. I can<lb break="no"/>not see that it would be the wisest thing to decide 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional issue on our ability to meet the 
     <lb/>
     irreducible minimum cost of government at this 
     <lb/>
     moment. For given an economic reversal of any 
     <lb/>
     magnitude we might easily find ourselves below 
     <lb/>
     that level. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the motion before the House, I 
     <lb/>
     am not going to be greatly moved by any who 
     <lb/>
     may care to point the finger of constitutional 
     <lb/>
     scorn. I am not an expert in constitutional law. 
     <lb/>
     Thus was I shocked in the beginning to hear this 
     <lb/>
     Convention in which I sat termed illegal. I did 
     <lb/>
     subsequently console myself with the thought 
     <lb/>
     that perhaps the Parliament of Britain did also 
     <lb/>
     know something about what was constitutional 
     <lb/>
     and what was not, that whilst that Parliament 
     <lb/>
     might often do things of which many did not 
     <lb/>
     approve, it was unlikely to do that which was 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally improper. So I sit here quite con<lb break="no"/>tent that it is legal to sit here. It may be immoral, 
     <lb/>
     even fattening, but I am quite convinced that it is 
     <lb/>
     not illegal to sit here. Similarly if the appropriate 
     <lb/>
     authorities act now as requested, then I feel that 
     <lb/>
     we shall have every assurance that the act en<pb n="115"

            <fw type="num">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>
            <fw type="num">115</fw>visioned by the motion is in order. 
     
    <lb/></p>
<p>
     I am not going to be greatly moved either by 
     <lb/>
     the argument that we must restore intact our 
     <lb/>
     island sovereignty or there will be those who will 
     <lb/>
     turn over in their graves. If my great-grandfather 
     <lb/>
     wants to turn over in his grave because we want 
     <lb/>
     to hear both sides of the story, that's entirely the 
     <lb/>
     business of his revered shade. If those who were 
     <lb/>
     giants in his day and theirs want to join in his 
     <lb/>
     macabre gymnastics, that is entirely their own 
     <lb/>
     business. It is our business in this day and genera<lb break="no"/>tion to endeavour to provide for the future so that 
     <lb/>
     our children, and their children after them, will 
     <lb/>
     not have to stumble down into early graves on 
     <lb/>
     beri-beried legs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It might be just as well if we were to face up 
     <lb/>
     to a few facts concerning sovereignty. It is some<lb break="no"/>thing that has intimate relations with economics. 
     <lb/>
     Sovereignty must be based upon an economic 
     <lb/>
     structure that will admit of being sovereign unto 
     <lb/>
     itself. One reason why, let us say Bell Island, 
     <lb/>
     would not be granted responsible government 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow would be the economic inability of 
     <lb/>
     Bell Island to be sovereign unto itself in all 
     <lb/>
     things. I have often wondered if it was not lack 
     <lb/>
     of an adequate economic basis for sovereignty 
     <lb/>
     that was the main cause of our failure in respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. It is a fact of our history that 
     <lb/>
     we have depended, for the most part, upon our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries to finance our sovereignty. It is a fact 
     <lb/>
     also that most every time the fisheries failed a 
     <lb/>
     large number of Newfoundlanders have nearly 
     <lb/>
     starved to death. I am by no means an old man, 
     <lb/>
     and in my own time I have known more than one 
     <lb/>
     man who did not know where his next meal was 
     <lb/>
     coming from. And as far as the man who does not 
     <lb/>
     know where his next meal is coming from is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, sovereignty is not enough. And there 
     <lb/>
     will subscribe to that opinion, all those New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who in the years that were rotted 
     <lb/>
     with depression sought to walk the world with 
     <lb/>
     dignity, as sovereign men should, on six cents a day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, Abraham Lincoln once 
     <lb/>
     warned his people that they could not escape 
     <lb/>
     history. We might as well now come to realise 
     <lb/>
     that we cannot escape the 20th century. And the 
     <lb/>
     lives of men in this mid-20th century are 
     <lb/>
     dominated by two desires of such dimension as 
     <lb/>
     to make them the predominant passions. There is, 
     <lb/>
     first of all, the fierce passion to be free. Within 
     <lb/>
     the days of all of us here, men have fought two 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     titanic wars to be free. The generals and the 
     <lb/>
     politicians and the financiers may have had other 
     <lb/>
     ideas. But the ordinary man who fought at 
     <lb/>
     Beaumont Hamel and at Ypres, who stormed the 
     <lb/>
     heights of Cassino and who closed the Falaise 
     <lb/>
     Gap — he fought to be free. Second, there is the 
     <lb/>
     passion, equally fierce, to be secure — for three 
     <lb/>
     square meals a day, a decent suit of clothes and a 
     <lb/>
     tight roof that I have already made mention of in 
     <lb/>
     this house. The proletariat has mastered the three 
     <lb/>
     Rs. It has come even to understand a little of the 
     <lb/>
     language of economics. It has read all the as<lb break="no"/>surances that have been given that the historic 
     <lb/>
     problem of production has been solved. It is 
     <lb/>
     convinced that the affairs of men can be so or<lb break="no"/>dered as to make it possible for all men to earn 
     <lb/>
     from an honest effort a decent living. And the 
     <lb/>
     mass of men everywhere are in a mood for the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of such controls as will achieve 
     <lb/>
     that desideratum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those two things the men of this mid-20th 
     <lb/>
     century demand. Liberty! Security! One of them 
     <lb/>
     they're going to have. Which one? Or need it be 
     <lb/>
     which one? Must men choose between the mas<lb break="no"/>tery of their own destinies and three square meals 
     <lb/>
     a day? There are those who answer that they 
     <lb/>
     must; those who assert that civic liberty and 
     <lb/>
     economic security are two such disparate entities 
     <lb/>
     as may no more be fused into a satisfactory social 
     <lb/>
     order than water and hot lead may be fused into 
     <lb/>
     an amalgam. I am not one who subscribes to such 
     <lb/>
     dark pessimism. I have every confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     ability of that Christian intelligence, which has 
     <lb/>
     proven equal to every challenge of two millennia, 
     <lb/>
     yet to arrive at the reconciliation of civic liberty 
     <lb/>
     and economic security into a social order to 
     <lb/>
     which the Christian conscience can subscribe. If 
     <lb/>
     that can be done, then will the future offer men 
     <lb/>
     some chance of happiness and dignity. If it cannot 
     <lb/>
     be done, then will the future be dark and heavy 
     <lb/>
     with a new and a more monstrous Gethsemene 
     <lb/>
     than has ever come upon the face of the earth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Every man of goodwill has a contribution to 
     <lb/>
     make to the achieving of that satisfactory social 
     <lb/>
     order for the lack of which civilisation itself may 
     <lb/>
     well go by default. The immediate contribution 
     <lb/>
     the men of this Convention have to make is to 
     <lb/>
     indicate, as well as we may, the way the people 
     <lb/>
     of this island should go to a more spacious des<lb break="no"/>tiny. We have consequently, and among other 
     <lb/>
     things, to seek out the terms of confederation. For

     that knowledge is necessary for the people that 
     <lb/>
     they may be the better able to judge of what will 
     <lb/>
     be best for them. They have a right to that 
     <lb/>

     there ever were, or will be, to the verdict of 
     <lb/>
     history. I am concerned to search out as soon as 
     <lb/>
     possible that form of government which, other 
     <lb/>
     things being equal, would seem the more to offer 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland an adequacy of ships and shoes 
     <lb/>
     and cabbages. And that I may the better be able 
     <lb/>
     to do that I will, for the moment, vote against the

     Mr. Cashin This Convention met on September 
     <lb/>
     11, and a week later we formed ourselves into 
     <lb/>
     nine committees for the purpose of ascertaining 
     <lb/>
     certain facts relative to the present financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic position of the country. Two reports 
     <lb/>
     were presented yesterday and immediately these 
     <lb/>
     reports had been presented, something upset the 
     <lb/>
     applecart. Yesterday afternoon I listened very 
     <lb/>
     attentively to Mr. Smallwood's abuse, so to 
     <lb/>
     speak, of our country, and our people. Following 
     <lb/>
     which I listened to my friend, Mr. Harrington, 
     <lb/>
     who is a colleague of mine for the district of 
     <lb/>
     St. John's City West, and following which I had 
     <lb/>
     the pleasure of listening to Mr. Hollett. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has not repudiated the statements 
     <lb/>
     made by Mr. Harrington or Mr. Hollett and I 
     <lb/>
     want to know, what is behind the idea of offering 
     <lb/>
     senatorships and trips to Ottawa to try and in<lb break="no"/>fluence delegates? On whose authority is that 
     <lb/>
     being done? Is it on Mr. Smallwood's authority 
     <lb/>
     alone? Is it on the Commission of Govemment's 
     <lb/>
     authority? Is it on the Canadian government's 
     <lb/>
     authority? Is it on the Dominions Office's 
     <lb/>
     authority? Or whom? That is the thing that should 
     <lb/>
     be cleaned up now before we vote on this. If there 
     <lb/>
     are influences outside of this House about which 
     <lb/>
     we know nothing, offering positions, emolu<lb break="no"/>ments and trips all over the country to certain 
     <lb/>
     individuals if they vote certain ways, the time is 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     right now to put an end to it. I would like to have 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, before we go any further with 
     <lb/>
     this debate, either to deny or affirm those state<lb break="no"/>ments that he made offers or suggestions to either 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Harrington and/or Mr. Hollett. I understand 
     <lb/>
     one has been offered the job of Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor when this place becomes a province. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood is now gone out of this house and 
     <lb/>
     I would ask that he be brought back and settle it 
     <lb/>
     once and for all. I have lived in Canada ... I have 
     <lb/>
     liked Canada, it is a great country, but I love 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and I am not going to have it 
     <lb/>
     railroaded up the St. Lawrence, as expressed by 
     <lb/>
     my friend here. Here he comes! Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>
     never said anything outside of this House which 
     <lb/>
     I am not prepared to say inside and I want an 
     <lb/>
     explanation here right now. The idea of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood or any other member of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention offering or suggesting senatorships and 
     <lb/>
     trips to Ottawa provided they vote a certain way 
     <lb/>
     for a certain resolution — I want an explanation 
     <lb/>
     of that before this thing goes any further, and 
     <lb/>
     before I vote we are going to get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood You'll get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Please, gentlemen, I want this 
     <lb/>
     debate conducted without the interchange of per<lb break="no"/>sonalities. I laid that down as a primary rule, and 
     <lb/>
     there is no reason why the motion before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair cannot be discussed without the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of personalities. Personalities can have only 
     <lb/>
     one result, and that is disorder. It is my duty to 
     <lb/>
     prevent disorder, and I propose to carry out that 
     <lb/>
     duty. Major Cashin, please discuss this without 
     <lb/>
     interchange of personalities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin I am entitled to an explanation, the 
     <lb/>
     country is entitled to it. The statement was made 
     <lb/>
     here yesterday in my hearing. This gentleman 
     <lb/>
     here, a young man, Mr. Harrington, and Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>lett, two reputable members of this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     one stating he was offered a trip to Ottawa as a 
     <lb/>
     member of the delegation, the other offered a 
     <lb/>
     senatorship. I am not out of order and I am not 
     <lb/>
     being personal. I am asking Mr. Smallwood to 
     <lb/>
     tell us on whose authority he made such offers if 
     <lb/>
     he made them. I am asking that question and I 
     <lb/>
     await his reply. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman If you await his reply someone 
     <lb/>
     will take up the debate. Once you sit down you 
     <lb/>
     have spoken once to the motion. You have to 
     <lb/>
     confine yourself to the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin We cannot get away from the fact 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">117</fw>
           
     that these statements were made here by mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Convention and I draw the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the members and the country to it... I make the 
     <lb/>
     statement that only two years ago the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Quebec made a statement in the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Quebec that Newfoundland should hand 
     <lb/>
     over Labrador to Canada; and, incidentally, to the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Quebec because they had sent 
     <lb/>
     Canadian troops down here to defend New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the troops, or a lot of them were 
     <lb/>
     zombies, and our own boys had to be sent to Italy. 
     <lb/>
     I resent it as a returned soldier of two wars. Big 
     <lb/>
     corporations in Canada are now making efforts 
     <lb/>
     to steal the Labrador from Newfoundland. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know whether these same individuals offered 
     <lb/>
     senatorships and trips to Ottawa, but I know that 
     <lb/>
     it is going on. Confederation has been an issue in 
     <lb/>
     this country since the inception of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government nearly 100 years ago. We had it in 
     <lb/>
     1865, again later, and in 1895, and now con<lb break="no"/>federation is being brought up again. From 1923 
     <lb/>
     on, someone was up spouting off that the other 
     <lb/>
     chap was a confederate, and here we have it 
     <lb/>
     again. Now we are discussing the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     sending a delegation to Ottawa. The Chairman 
     <lb/>
     has given his decision that the Convention has 
     <lb/>
     power to send a delegation. Certainly the Con<lb break="no"/>vention has power to send a delegation provided 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa government receives them. But I want 
     <lb/>
     to draw the attention of this assembly to this fact, 
     <lb/>
     that even if they go to Ottawa, we have no guaran<lb break="no"/>tee that we are going to have even a plebiscite 
     <lb/>
     under this Convention Act. If there is I want 
     <lb/>
     someone to show it to me. We are told that we are 
     <lb/>
     here to dig out facts and figures, and recommend 
     <lb/>
     certain forms of government to the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, which will be submitted to the people. 
     <lb/>
     When? Whenever they feel like it. That's the 
     <lb/>
     answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now what is the actual situation? In 1933 a 
     <lb/>
     resolution was passed in this House requesting 
     <lb/>
     the British government to take over Newfound<lb break="no"/>land because of its financial situation. I hold that 
     <lb/>
     our people should have defaulted and not have 
     <lb/>
     handed over our constitution. But they did make 
     <lb/>
     one provision, that when this country became 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting, responsible government would 
     <lb/>
     be restored at the request of the people. Well, we 
     <lb/>
     represent the people here this afternoon, and if 
     <lb/>
     anyone goes to Ottawa tomorrow and brings back 
     <lb/>
     the terms of confederation, and it is submitted to 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom cannot 
     <lb/>
     amend that original act of 1933, because there is 
     <lb/>
     no House of Assembly here to guarantee that 
     <lb/>
     amendment. It would have to be adopted by our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government if an amendment to 
     <lb/>
     that 1933 act has to be made. Is the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government going to break the law it 
     <lb/>
     passed in 1933? Certainly not. Then there are 
     <lb/>
     only two forms of government we have to con<lb break="no"/>sider in this country, Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and responsible government. There is no 
     <lb/>
     such thing in this act as confederation, or repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government, or commission. There are 
     <lb/>
     people in this country who are Communistic. I 
     <lb/>
     had just as much right, if I was a Communist, to 
     <lb/>
     get a delegation to go to Moscow and ask Joseph 
     <lb/>
     Stalin what kind of government or terms he 
     <lb/>
     would give us. I can't understand how young 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders can come here and say they 
     <lb/>
     want terms from another country. I cannot under<lb break="no"/>stand it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The facts are in the Auditor General's report 
     <lb/>
     for 1944-45, and all the reports that are going to 
     <lb/>
     be brought in here won't alter the fact. The longer 
     <lb/>
     we are going on here the less money we will have. 
     <lb/>
     The treasury is being cleaned out, gentlemen. I 
     <lb/>
     make the bold statement that the treasury of New<lb break="no"/>foundland is being looted, and I defy any man in 
     <lb/>
     the country to contradict that statement. The idea 
     <lb/>
     is, to loot her until the last dollar is gone, and then 
     <lb/>
     it will be confederation or Commission or some<lb break="no"/>thing else. That's the programme, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood knows it is. Now in 1895 a delegation 
     <lb/>
     went to Ottawa to talk confederation with the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada, and our debt at that time 
     <lb/>
     was some $15 million. The Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     came back to that delegation and said, "Look, our 
     <lb/>
     debt is $50 per head (that's Canada's debt, ours 
     <lb/>
     was $10 per head). We will allow you $50 per 
     <lb/>
     head of your debt (at that time our population was 
     <lb/>
     not anything like it is today). Our debt will then 
     <lb/>
     amount to $10 million, and the other $5 million 
     <lb/>
     you will have to carry as a provincial debt." 
     <lb/>
     Naturally the Newfoundland people turned it 
     <lb/>
     down cold. But Canada balked at $5 million at 
     <lb/>
     that time. What is the situation today? The situa<lb break="no"/>tion today is that our per capita debt is less than 
     <lb/>
     $150, that is when you take the sinking fund and 
     <lb/>
     our cash on hand at the present time, which I hold 
     <lb/>
     should have been cancelled in 1940-41, but 
     <lb/>
     granted that it was not cancelled, our total nation<lb break="no"/><pb n="118"

            <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">October 1946</fw>al debt is less that $150 per head. What is the 
     <lb/>
     national debt of Canada? It is $1,200 per head. 
     <lb/>
     You bring up the agreement of 51 years ago — if 
     <lb/>
     they were prepared to settle on that it means $300 
     <lb/>
     million for the Canadian government to hand 
     <lb/>
     over to Newfoundland. But, Mr. Chairman, I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to sit down here and be a party to what 
     <lb/>
     I feel in my soul is a policy to sell out this country 
     <lb/>
     to Canada. I lived in Canada longer than any man 
     <lb/>
     in this House, and I like Canada, but I love 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I know what happened in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian provinces, in the eastern provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     have also lived in British Columbia. I heard 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood here yesterday state that our 
     <lb/>
     people were 50 years behind the times. I think our 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. Brown brought him up on that. I have 
     <lb/>
     been on Queen Charlotte Islands, and I would 
     <lb/>
     like to bring Mr. Smallwood there and show him 
     <lb/>
     conditions, and also to the city of Montreal and 
     <lb/>
     let him look at the conditions that exist there, and 
     <lb/>
     then come back and make a comparison with our 
     <lb/>
     people. I never heard of any Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     who would come in here and blacken his people 
     <lb/>
     as this gentleman did. I want to say, as a man who 
     <lb/>
     went over in 1914 and did my bit at that time - <lb/> I did not see him over there though!... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I was 14 years old. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin How old are you now? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood I am 46. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman I told you, Major Cashin, not to 
     <lb/>
     indulge in personalities. You will kindly refrain 
     <lb/>
     from indulging in personalities. I don't want it to 
     <lb/>
     happen again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin I have stated that there is an ulterior 
     <lb/>
     motive behind this whole motion. I grant you that 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who are supporting it don't realise 
     <lb/>
     it. I believe that the Commission of Government, 
     <lb/>
     directly or indirectly, and the Dominions Office, 
     <lb/>
     are behind it. Why do I make that statement? On 
     <lb/>
     the 18th of September of this year I gave a short 
     <lb/>
     talk in this House, and was severely criticised by 
     <lb/>
     some people. In that talk I made a short quotation 
     <lb/>
     taken from a speech delivered in the British 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons by Prime Minister Attlee: "It 
     <lb/>
     is important that a series of reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     measures which the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     are planning to introduce should proceed without 
     <lb/>
     interruption, and these will be pushed forward as 
     <lb/>
     rapidly as possible. The Commission have a full 
     <lb/>
     programme to meet during the next two or three 
     <lb/>
     years." What is the interpretation to be placed on 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     these remarks?.... I would analyse it like this, that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Attlee, when he made that talk on December 
     <lb/>
     11 last, stated that we are going to hold Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government in Newfoundland for two or 
     <lb/>
     three years because they have a definite program 
     <lb/>
     which has got to go forward without interruption. 
     <lb/>
     If that is true, what are we doing here? I have 
     <lb/>
     asked for a statement by someone who knows 
     <lb/>
     what they mean by that, and I think I am entitled 
     <lb/>
     to an answer. I got a letter from the Secretary to 
     <lb/>
     this effect: "With reference to your question sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Information Committee to be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to Mr. Attlee and the House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     1 am directed by the Information Committee to 
     <lb/>
     inform you that it needs further consideration, 
     <lb/>
     and that it would be reviewed at a later date". 
     <lb/>
     Reviewed by whom — the Information Commit<lb break="no"/>tee? That question should have gone to the 
     <lb/>
     government, and from there to the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office and back here. It has been held up by the 
     <lb/>
     Information Committee, and they are going to 
     <lb/>
     review it later. It was merely a question asking 
     <lb/>
     for an explanation, and it has not been ex<lb break="no"/>plained.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If my construction is right ...and if this Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government is going to stay here for 
     <lb/>
     two or three years, what are we doing here wast<lb break="no"/>ing $800 or $1,000 a day?.... If I can get a 
     <lb/>
     seconder I am going to move that this Convention 
     <lb/>
     adjourn until such time as that question is proper<lb break="no"/>ly answered. Someone may say that I am holding 
     <lb/>
     up the progress of the Convention. No, I am 
     <lb/>
     trying to get that important question explained to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, whether it is a fact that we are 
     <lb/>
     going to have Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     regardless of whether or not this Convention 
     <lb/>
     votes for confederation. What is the three year 
     <lb/>
     programme of work referred to, and does this 
     <lb/>
     mean that the Commission of Government are 
     <lb/>
     going to be retained in office until such 
     <lb/>
     programme is carried out? I don't think anyone 
     <lb/>
     can say that's not a fair question... Surely we are 
     <lb/>
     entitled, before we take these steps of sending a 
     <lb/>
     delegation off on, a wild goose chase, to know 
     <lb/>
     where we stand... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It's no use for us to discuss responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, or confederation or even annexation 
     <lb/>
     to the United States... Mr. Chairman, if I can get 
     <lb/>
     a seconder to that motion 1 will take my seat. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brown I will second the motion.

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Well, Mr. Chairman, with your

     consent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Subject to a further rule that all 
     <lb/>
     questions on the order paper have to be con<lb break="no"/>cluded. The question now before the Chair has 
     <lb/>
     not yet been finalised. Therefore under the rules 
     <lb/>
     I am forced to withhold my consent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Thank you. I will bring this in 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman If you will confine yourself to 
     <lb/>
     the motion before the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Returning to the original motion, of 
     <lb/>
     whether or not we send a delegation to Ottawa to 
     <lb/>
     get the terms of confederation, I am going to 
     <lb/>
     support Mr. Penney's amendment, We started off 
     <lb/>
     getting various particulars regarding the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of government during the past 
     <lb/>
     several years. We arrived at a point where we 
     <lb/>
     were making fair progress, and the main reports 
     <lb/>
     have got to come in here yet.... In view of this I 
     <lb/>
     consider that the present resolution now before 
     <lb/>
     the house, regarding sending a delegation to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa, comes at a most inopportune moment... Let 
     <lb/>
     us get our facts ready. Supposing the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Canada telegraphed tonight that he would 
     <lb/>
     receive a delegation of the Convention (and I 
     <lb/>
     doubt it very much), what are you going to take 
     <lb/>
     up there with you? You have no facts and figures 
     <lb/>
     to take. Surely if this thing is going to be one of 
     <lb/>
     the forms of government that are going to be put 
     <lb/>
     to the people, then the least they might do is wait 
     <lb/>
     until these reports are completed. That's not un<lb break="no"/>reasonable to ask, its only logical.... I don't intend 
     <lb/>
     to hold up this but I want to register my support 
     <lb/>
     in favour of the amendment by Mr. Penney that 
     <lb/>
     this resolution be deferred until such time as all 
     <lb/>
     reports are submitted to the House and the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, and let us discuss it then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Is the Convention ready for the 
     <lb/>
     question? I will put the question first and then the 
     <lb/>
     amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Ashbourne I would like to say a very few 
     <lb/>
     words on the motion. There is absolutely nothing 
     <lb/>
     wrong in ascertaining from Canada the terms she 
     <lb/>
     might be prepared to give any delegation. I have 
     <lb/>
     not been promised any position on that delega<lb break="no"/><cb/>tion, or even a senatorship. However, I realise the 
     <lb/>
     matter of confederation can hardly be discussed 
     <lb/>
     intelligently unless we have these terms. I fur<lb break="no"/>thermore understand that it is the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     present Government of Canada to give these 
     <lb/>
     terms on request, but not unless they are re<lb break="no"/>quested... I am going to vote on the motion; I am 
     <lb/>
     going to vote that the facts be given to this House 
     <lb/>
     — the terms; because it is up to us to get the terms. 
     <lb/>
     I have spent some time in Canada. I happen to be 
     <lb/>
     a graduate of the University of Toronto, one of 
     <lb/>
     the biggest in the British Empire. While I have an 
     <lb/>
     open mind about the matter of confederation, yet 
     <lb/>
     I consider thatI would like to know something of 
     <lb/>
     the terms which Canada is prepared to give to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I realise there have been great 
     <lb/>
     peoples who have come together in union, and 
     <lb/>
     our very flag is emblematic of that union, The 
     <lb/>
     question as to whether or not Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     might perhaps join up with the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     has also been mentioned in my hearing. I, to a 
     <lb/>
     certain extent, agree with the arguments which 
     <lb/>
     have been advanced by those who have spoken 
     <lb/>
     in favour of the amendment and I can appreciate 
     <lb/>
     their point of view. However, in the desire to get 
     <lb/>
     on with the business and to get through with it as 
     <lb/>
     quickly as possible. I feel that delays are 
     <lb/>
     dangerous. However, I feel that when the facts of 
     <lb/>
     our economic position are known they may 
     <lb/>
     reveal the ability to paddle our own canoe. How<lb break="no"/>ever, I am conscious of the fact that there is a 
     <lb/>
     desire on the part of a lot of people to study the 
     <lb/>
     matter of confederation. Unless there are further 
     <lb/>
     arguments advanced by other members, I intend 
     <lb/>
     at the present time to support it and I further 
     <lb/>
     believe we cannot decide about the matter of 
     <lb/>
     confederation until we have these terms. I hope 
     <lb/>
     no one thinks I am a confederate, but I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to study the terms, if they are given to 
     <lb/>
     us. However, unless we are blessed with the right 
     <lb/>
     kind of statesmen who are dedicated to their task 
     <lb/>
     of conducting the government of our country in 
     <lb/>
     the interests of Newfoundland, I fear very much 
     <lb/>
     that the time may come when we may have to go 
     <lb/>
     to some other country, to Canada or perhaps to 
     <lb/>
     the old country and, maybe, with our finger in our 
     <lb/>
     mouth.

     Mr. Watton I move the adjournment of the 
     <lb/>
     debate until tomorrow.
