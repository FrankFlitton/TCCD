<!--<p>
     my saying another word at this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> On that point may I ask Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood what is the per capita tax the average 
     <lb/>
     Canadian citizen in Canada is paying today? 
     <lb/>
     Comparing our per capita tax of $122 per head, 
     <lb/>
     what is it in Canada today? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What I was doing was to com<lb break="no"/>pare our present per capita tax with what would, 
     <lb/>
     or might be, our per capita tax under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I was not comparing it with taxation in 
     <lb/>
     Canada now or any other time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is a very good comparison to 
     <lb/>
     make. We will be Canadian citizens then, and I 
     <lb/>
     take it we would pay the same taxation as Canada 
     <lb/>
     pays now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Why? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think, in view of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has not been able to prepare his 
     <lb/>
     estimates of probable provincial revenues it 
     <lb/>
     would be just as well to receive the motion to rise 
     <lb/>
     the committee and ask leave to sit again tomor<lb break="no"/>row, particularly in view of the fact that members 
     <lb/>
     may be hampered in the debate until they receive 
     <lb/>
     this information. It won't be available until 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow. In addition to this, if it were agreeable 
     <lb/>
     to members, I would like to get a motion to 
     <lb/>
     adjourn until tomorrow afternoon, in view of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that there is business of a private nature that 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     I would like to take up with members, and if it 
     <lb/>
     suits you and is to your convenience I would like 
     <lb/>
     to hold the meeting this evening at such time as 
     <lb/>
     may be decided upon by the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I am prepared to move that the com<lb break="no"/>mittee rise, but before doing so, I was wondering 
     <lb/>
     if we could get copies of Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     speech when it is done by the stenographer? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It will take a week, I understand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Even so I think we ought to make 
     <lb/>some effort to get that done, because, from my 
     <lb/>point of view, it has some of the most amazing 
     <lb/>statements I have heard in some time. Also I 
     <lb/>would like to ask one question of Mr. Small- 
     <lb break="yes"/>wood, one single question. In your item of 
     <lb/>Refund, I think you counted on $666,000 from 
     <lb/>the federal government... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We have only one reporter. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I see. I am sorry. I just point out that 
     <lb/>no payments have been made according to the 
     <lb/>Auditor General's Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The payment will be this year 
     <lb/>
     we are in now. The first payment was this current 
     <lb/>
     year. That's why we won't see it in the accounts. 
     <lb/>
     I move that the committee rise and report 
     <lb/>
     progress and ask leave to sit again tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have nothing 
     <lb/>
     in particular to say at the moment. The figures I 
     <lb/>
     tabled yesterday are before the House.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> I assume 
     <lb/>
     members will want to discuss them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Chairman, as you know, we 
     <lb/>
     only went through this proposed budget of 
     <lb/>
     revenue and expenditure, as it would be under a 
     <lb/>
     province, yesterday afternoon, and it has not 
     <lb/>
     given us much time to study it. But in going 
     <lb/>
     through it there were a few notes I made, and I 
     <lb/>
     have only got a few comments on it for the time 
     <lb/>
     being. I can appreciate Mr. Smallwood's difficul<lb break="no"/>ty in bringing it in, and he did very well with what 
     <lb/>
     he had to work on. I am glad that the Finance 
   

            <cb/>
          

     Committee did not have to bring in one like it, 
     <lb/>
     because, while that was torn to shreds, I think we 
     <lb/>
     would go for years before we would be allowed 
     <lb/>
     to forget one like this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the expenditure side there is $15.1  million, 
     <lb/>
     I think, for the first four year period. In that 
     <lb/>
     section there was an item of $3.1 million for 
     <lb/>
     Education. That is the same amount as contained 
     <lb/>
     in the Commission of Government estimates for 
     <lb/>
     1947-48. I don't think that is sufficient. I have not 
     <lb/>
     got the figures yet to give you what will exactly 
     <lb/>
     be required, but I think you will find that that will 
     <lb/>
     be increased considerably in the estimates for 
     <lb/>
     1948-49. I understand the Department of Educa<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_01">[1] Volume II:522. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note>


            <pb n="974" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-09_Page_0974.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">974</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
         

     tion will ask for, whether they get it or not, 
     <lb/>
     another $1 million, and they will require as a 
     <lb/>
     minimum say $500,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the Public Health side we find that figure 
     <lb/>
     has been brought down to $5.2 million-odd, from 
     <lb/>
     $6,274,000. Some of that cut was explained and 
     <lb/>
     been taken care of. The department, however, 
     <lb/>
     will not be able to get along under present condi<lb break="no"/>tions on, not just the cut to $5.25 million, but it 
     <lb/>
     would not be able to get along with the budget 
     <lb/>
     made by the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     amounting to $6.25 million. We have got these 
     <lb/>
     extra hospitals, the General Hospital which is not 
     <lb/>
     yet completed, the sanatorium at Corner Brook, 
     <lb/>
     which will be a 250-bed hospital, and the 
     <lb/>
     Western Memorial Hospital. The late Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Puddester told us in committee here about 12 
     <lb/>
     months ago that even with what they were spend<lb break="no"/>ing then and would spend this year, they would 
     <lb/>
     require considerably more money to maintain the 
     <lb/>
     service, and that the maintenance cost would be 
     <lb/>
     considerably more. I think, if my memory serves 
     <lb/>
     me correctly, that it would run at least another $1 
     <lb/>
     million more. I may be wrong, perhaps Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin will remember. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> $1 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> So that would bring it up to about 
     <lb/>
     $7 million odd. And I understand now that they 
     <lb/>
     anticipate another million extra, which will be a 
     <lb/>
     difference of about $2 million as I see it; but put 
     <lb/>
     that conservatively, and call it $1 million or $1.5 
     <lb/>
     million. Now there is no provision, except at the 
     <lb/>
     end of $500,000, for expenditure in the province 
     <lb/>
     for new services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $750,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> $750,000, yes. Well, these hospi<lb break="no"/>tals all have to be finished, equipped and staffed. 
     <lb/>
     There is no provision made for the extra staffing; 
     <lb/>
     the only provision there is $750,000 each year for 
     <lb/>
     total new reconstruction. Now members will 
     <lb/>
     remember, in the early days of the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     we were given a reconstruction program by the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government, and in there they 
     <lb/>
     planned to spend $59 million or $60 million in 
     <lb/>
     ten years. That would be about $6 million per 
     <lb/>
     year that they had planned, providing the funds 
     <lb/>
     were there, to spend on reconstruction. Suppos<lb break="no"/>ing we cut that in half, making it $3 million for 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction; yet in this budget there is only 
     <lb/>
     $750,000 provided for all new services or recon<lb break="no"/>struction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Yes. Wait a minute I am coming 
     <lb/>
     to that. Now if you take these items, I note there 
     <lb/>
     is Education which roughly is $500,000 over and 
     <lb/>
     above what is in the budget, there is Public 
     <lb/>
     Health, which we figured at $2-2.5 million over 
     <lb/>
     and above the provincial budget. We will cut that 
     <lb/>
     down to $1.5 million, which will bring it down to 
     <lb/>
     $6.7 million, which is slightly more than required 
     <lb/>
     on today's basis. The reconstruction which the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government had provided for at 
     <lb/>
     $6 million for the next ten years, we will call only 
     <lb/>
     $2.5 million, on that total it brings us to a $4.5 
     <lb/>
     million expenditure, and I have tried to be con<lb break="no"/>servative in this, $4.5 million over and above the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure which Mr. Smallwood provided for 
     <lb/>
     in yesterday's budget. If you add that to the $15 
     <lb/>
     million expenditure which he anticipated you get 
     <lb/>
     approximately $19.5 million. That would be our 
     <lb/>
     expenditure if we have to spend on the same basis 
     <lb/>
     as we have the last few years, if we maintain the 
     <lb/>
     same services. There is no large provision there 
     <lb/>
     for relief, but I will come to that later on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now turning to the revenue side of the budget, 
     <lb/>
     included is the total repayment of the amount that 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government will have paid to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government for Gander, which I 
     <lb/>
     think he said was around $600,000. Anyway the 
     <lb/>
     total amount we paid to them we will get back, 
     <lb/>
     plus the money paid for the ships being built right 
     <lb/>
     now in England for the government here. That 
     <lb/>
     shows a revenue of $255,000 a year. Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood said he was prepared to argue in this Con<lb break="no"/>vention or with anyone outside it that that should 
     <lb/>
     go into this current revenue. As far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned Mr. Smallwood can argue forever on 
     <lb/>
     that point, but I will never be convinced that 
     <lb/>
     repayment of the money paid for Gander and the 
     <lb/>
     money for the boats, taken from the money we 
     <lb/>
     accumulated, belongs to current revenue. I know 
     <lb/>
     that last year the government did that, but they 
     <lb/>
     were wrong too, like Mr. Smallwood. You can 
     <lb/>
     argue till the cows come home, but it is not the 
     <lb/>
     right principle. I have yet to see a balance sheet 
     <lb/>
     that did not separate capital from ordinary expen<lb break="no"/>ditures. That $255,000 per year which is revenue 
     <lb/>
     shown in this provincial balance sheet should 
     <lb/>
     come out of it. It is not earnings of the province, 
     <lb/>
     it is not current revenue, it is repayment of money 
     <lb/>
     that we expended.... It is not current earnings, and 
     <lb/>
     similarly there is $125,000 in there per year as 
   

            <pb n="975" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-09_Page_0975.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">975</fw>
         

     repayment of loans from the Housing Corpora<lb break="no"/>tion. That is in exactly the same category, it is a 
     <lb/>
     repayment of a loan, and is not earnings. That 
     <lb/>
     makes a total for those two items alone of 
     <lb/>
     $375,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the total revenue under the provincial 
     <lb/>
     set-up for the first four years is shown as $13.9 
     <lb/>
     million, and if you deduct that $375,000 you will 
     <lb/>
     find that you have a net revenue of $13.6 million. 
     <lb/>
     There was a deficit on the first four years an<lb break="no"/>ticipated by Mr. Smallwood at somewhere 
     <lb/>
     around $1.2 million, and if you add this $375,000 
     <lb/>
     you will find that on his figures there would be a 
     <lb/>
     deficit of $1.5 million, but that deficit is based on 
     <lb/>
     an expenditure of only $15 million for the 
     <lb/>
     province. I contend, sir, on the figures I gave in 
     <lb/>
     the beginning, and they must necessarily be only 
     <lb/>
     estimates at the present time, the expenditure will 
     <lb/>
     be $19.5 million, call it $19 million, and the 
     <lb/>
     revenue should be $13.5 million; that leaves you 
     <lb/>
     a deficit on the provincial accounts of $5.8 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, or call it $5 million; not a deficit of $1.2 
     <lb/>
     million, but over $5 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I realise that in mentioning reconstruction, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood did say, when the question was 
     <lb/>
     raised on roads, that $3 million would be 
     <lb/>
     withdrawn annually from the surplus of $28 mil<lb break="no"/>lion which would be deposited with the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government, as provided in the Grey Book, at an 
     <lb/>
     annual interest of 2 5/8%.... If we withdraw that 
     <lb/>
     amount for eight years we would withdraw $24 
     <lb/>
     million. Now the surplus is only $28 million. On 
     <lb/>
     page 3 of the Grey Book we have to freeze 
     <lb/>
     one-third of that, which we can't touch. That's 
     <lb/>
     part of the terms. If we freeze one-third, that's 
     <lb/>
     over $9 million, that brings it down to $18 million 
     <lb/>
     surplus. So you can only draw your $3 million a 
     <lb/>
     year for six years, not eight, and the last two years 
     <lb/>
     you can't have anything to draw, if I understood 
     <lb/>
     his explanation yesterday.... I contend that we 
     <lb/>
     should not touch that surplus; it should be there 
     <lb/>
     for some day when we may need it. There has 
     <lb/>
     been no large amount provided for emergencies, 
     <lb/>
     or able-bodied relief. I hope we won't see the 
     <lb/>
     dole, but there is nothing for that. Because if 
     <lb/>
     times are going to be poor, and there's going to 
     <lb/>
     be bread lines or soup kitchens, no matter if we 
     <lb/>
     are on our own or with Canada or the United 
     <lb/>
     States, our surplus should not be touched. We 
     <lb/>
     should not start off presuming that we are going 
     <lb/>
     to use $3 million of it each year. If we do that, 
  

            <cb/>
        

     and there is no provision in this budget for 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction other than using the surplus each 
     <lb/>
     year, I am afraid that we have built our last 
     <lb/>
     hospital and our last mile of roads. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I said at the beginning, these remarks are 
     <lb/>
     only general because I have not had time to go 
     <lb/>
     into it; but this struck me at a glance, if this budget 
     <lb/>
     was to be the one we would use under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, I can very well see why one of the clauses 
     <lb/>
     was put in, that in eight years they would set up 
     <lb/>
     a royal commission to review the financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion of Newfoundland, and to recommend the 
     <lb/>
     form and scale of additional financial assistance, 
     <lb/>
     because we will need one. We will be insolvent, 
     <lb/>
     or so close to it that, perhaps, our only "out" 
     <lb/>
     would be to transfer the Labrador, for a price, to 
     <lb/>
     Quebec or the Canadian government. If that is the 
     <lb/>
     best budget that can be brought in, and the best 
     <lb/>
     hope for our people, I can't hold out very much 
     <lb/>
     hope for it. I would say that it was rather a defence 
     <lb/>
     of the terms offered. I can't see any equitable 
     <lb/>
     basis in that budget. I can see a deficit that we will 
     <lb/>
     have to withdraw $3 million a year from our 
     <lb/>
     surplus to meet, not for reconstruction but to pay 
     <lb/>
     off a deficit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There was another question, the gasoline 
     <lb/>
     taxes, licenses for motor cars and drivers as a 
     <lb/>
     source of revenue, which Mr. Smallwood antici<lb break="no"/>pated would be considerably increased, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly in the last four years of the first eight. I 
     <lb/>
     don't know how we are going to increase it with 
     <lb/>
     our present mileage of roads. The estimate in the 
     <lb/>
     budget brought in by Mr. Smallwood shows 
     <lb/>
     $1.25 million for roads, expenditure for the year. 
     <lb/>
     The current estimate of the Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government shows just over $3 million. Now 
     <lb/>
     that's been cut practically $2 million. I realise 
     <lb/>
     that we can use some of the withdrawals from the 
     <lb/>
     surplus to build roads, but I contend that our 
     <lb/>
     surplus should not be touched for that purpose. I 
     <lb/>
     fail to see where we can, out of revenue, do any 
     <lb/>
     construction on roads, or any other such service. 
     <lb/>
     Those taxes we are going to collect from motor 
     <lb/>
     cars and gasoline, clear of the fishermen's tax — 
     <lb/>
     I can't agree that we are going to get as much as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood anticipates. The license for a car 
     <lb/>
     is only $12, and the driver's only $3, and we have 
     <lb/>
     got to have quite an influx of tourists, and a 
     <lb/>
     personal income of the people that is going to be 
     <lb/>
     exceptionally high, to be able to increase the 
     <lb/>
     income from gasoline and licenses, unless we 


            <pb n="976" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-09_Page_0976.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">976</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
           


     raise the rates, which of course is just increasing 
     <lb/>
     the taxation on the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I explained, I did not have time to make a 
     <lb/>
    clear study on this, I would like to reserve the 
     <lb/>right to have a little more to say later on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I appreciate very much the fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>minded spirit in which Mr. Hickman has made 
     <lb/>his preliminary analysis of the figures I brought 
     <lb/>in here yesterday. He has not shown any animus 
     <lb/>or bad feeling, he has spoken very fairly, and I 
     <lb/>appreciate that, but, as he has said himself, he has 
     <lb/>not had time to think about these figures and I am 
     <lb/>afraid that the remarks he has just delivered are 
     <lb/>very good proof of that, because otherwise four- 
     <lb break="yes"/>fifths of the things he would never have said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I made notes as he went along. Road main<lb break="no"/>tenance. In this estimate we have $1.25 million a 
     <lb/>
     year for roads. That's only to maintain roads, not 
     <lb/>
     to build roads, and if you turn to the estimates of 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government you will see that 
     <lb/>
     that is their estimate for maintaining roads — not 
     <lb/>
     building them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> speaks about our surplus. In this 
     <lb/>
     estimate of mine I have pictured our $28 million 
     <lb/>
     surplus, which may be $30 million. It is proposed 
     <lb/>
     that the offer the Government of Canada has 
     <lb/>
     made be accepted, that that surplus be put on 
     <lb/>
     deposit, at 2 5/8% interest. Now should that be 
     <lb/>
     withdrawn once we would put it on deposit draw<lb break="no"/>ing interest every year, or left in there? Well, 
     <lb/>
     there are two schools of thought on that. One is, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Hickman just said, it should be left in there 
     <lb/>
     for the rainy day. What rainy day, sir? He says 
     <lb/>
     when there may be bread lines and unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment and destitution in the country. That's one 
     <lb/>
     school of thought — leave it for the rainy day. 
     <lb/>
     The other school of thought is this, and it is the 
     <lb/>
     one I have followed: not to leave it there forever, 
     <lb/>
     but to draw it out each year and spend it in such 
     <lb/>
     a way as not to have the rainy day. All right, when 
     <lb/>
     the laughing is thoroughly over, I will explain 
     <lb/>
     what I mean. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Throughout the world, in larger countries than 
     <lb/>
     this, countries where the science of government 
     <lb/>
     has been carried to a much finer degree of excel<lb break="no"/>lence than in Newfoundland, even under Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government, the idea has become 
     <lb/>
     well developed of what they call "timing grants" 
     <lb/>
     — to spend public money that has been accumu<lb break="no"/>lated as surplus (and if you have not got a surplus, 
     <lb/>
     to borrow it) on public projects for the purpose of 


            <cb/>
          

     taking up the slack in private industry. A depres<lb break="no"/>sion means that private employers can no longer 
     <lb/>
     employ men because they cannot make a profit, 
     <lb/>
     and many become unemployed. Fishermen don't 
     <lb/>
     fish because no one will supply them, and no one 
     <lb/>
     will supply them because there is no money to be 
     <lb/>
     made out of fish, so you get a depression; and 
     <lb/>
     when private capitalists are no longer able to 
     <lb/>
     employ the people or keep them fishing, then the 
     <lb/>
     government, with public money, takes up the 
     <lb/>
     slack. That's a well-developed policy and prin<lb break="no"/>ciple. We are told that many governments have 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction projects on the shelf, ready to be 
     <lb/>
     put into operation at a minute's notice, just ready 
     <lb/>
     to call for contracts, and one way to prevent a 
     <lb/>
     depression is by public spending at the time when 
     <lb/>
     private spending has come to an end. Instead, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, of leaving your $28 million or $30 
     <lb/>
     million surplus there on deposit until you have 
     <lb/>
     got unemployment right on your hands, draw it 
     <lb/>
     out so much per year and spend it for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of taking up the slack that has been created by the  
     <lb/>
     failure of private enterprise. That is the school of 
     <lb/>
     thought to which I adhere. Whether you draw out 
     <lb/>
     three or two or one million dollars a year, is a 
     <lb/>
     matter for a future government to decide. I would 
     <lb/>
     point out however, that if you don't draw it out 
     <lb/>
     at the rate of $3 million a year, your interest 
     <lb/>
     earning for the government will be that much 
     <lb/>
     greater each year, and your income from interest 
     <lb/>
     would be higher than is shown here, because 
     <lb/>
     what is shown in my table is the interest on the 
     <lb/>
     balance of the surplus that would remain each 
     <lb/>
     year after you had withdrawn $3 million.... 
     <lb/>
 </p>

            <p>Another point I want to deal with that Mr. 
     <lb/>Hickman has made, and I dealt with it yesterday. 
     <lb/>I would expect any businessman anywhere in this 
     <lb/>Convention or in this country or out of it, to speak 
     <lb/>exactly as Mr. Hickman has spoken, because very 
     <lb/>few businessmen in the world appreciate the fun<lb break="no"/>damental difference in public finance and private 
     <lb/>finance. Very few appreciate the difference be<lb break="no"/>tween a corporation balance sheet and the 
     <lb/>balance sheet of a government — all the dif<lb break="no"/>ference in the world, and until we get that point 
     <lb/>clear in our minds, we are wasting our time 
     <lb/>talking about public finance. Sir, a government's 
     <lb/>accounting is about the simplest thing in principle 
     <lb/>and outline in the world — it is simply a cash 
     <lb/>account. No government has a balance sheet, a 
     <lb/>profit and loss account, it is simply a cash ac<lb break="no"/>

     count. The law provides that every single cent 
     <lb/>
     that comes to a government in a year must go into 
     <lb/>
     the Consolidated Revenue Fund, every single 
     <lb/>
     cent no matter what it is. It may be conscience 
     <lb/>
     money, it may be $1.30 that someone cheated the 
     <lb/>
     government out of and he sends it in anonymous<lb break="no"/>ly, and that $1.30 by law has to go into the 
     <lb/>
     Consolidated Revenue Fund. If the government 
     <lb/>
     borrows money, what it borrows has to go into 
     <lb/>
     the CRF. If it gets interest on money that it loaned 
     <lb/>
     to somebody, and that somebody now pays back 
     <lb/>
     interest each year, that has to go into the CRF. 
     <lb/>
     Every cent that the government receives in any 
     <lb/>
     shape or form must by law go into the CRF. Now 
     <lb/>
     when you put it there, you can call it this, that or 
     <lb/>
     the other. Within the CRF you can set up various 
     <lb/>
     subsidiary funds, but the CRF is the 
     <lb/>
     government's money. That is what it takes in. Not 
     <lb/>
     one cent can be paid out of the CRF except on the 
     <lb/>
     authority of Parliament. Not one cent can be paid 
     <lb/>
     out of it except what Parliment orders. In a 
     <lb/>
     country like Britain you have two men who are 
     <lb/>
     appointed by Parliament itself, the Comptroller 
     <lb/>
     of the Treasury and the Auditor General. The 
     <lb/>
     Comptroller is there to see that every cent goes 
     <lb/>
     into the CRF, and that not one cent is paid out 
     <lb/>
     without the consent of Parliment. The Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General audits the accounts and sees that they are 
     <lb/>
     audited in the various funds. Here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland the two jobs are done by the one man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So what kind of thinking is it, what kind of 
     <lb/>
     argument is it, to quarrel about whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     interest payments that the government receives 
     <lb/>
     from the Housing Corporation, or anyone else 
     <lb/>
     that the government has loaned money to 
     <lb/>
     should not be counted as revenue? Every cent the 
     <lb/>
     government receives is revenue. It may not be 
     <lb/>
     revenue received by taxation, but every cent the 
     <lb/>
     government receives is revenue. So please, no 
     <lb/>
     matter what private organisation of business or 
     <lb/>
     finance may do, no matter what is their system of 
     <lb/>
     accounting, no matter what their system may be 
     <lb/>
     of balance sheets, it has nothing to do with public 
     <lb/>
     accounting.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now if Mr. Hickman, or any other gentleman 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention, is disposed to doubt what I 
     <lb/>
     am saying there is a simple way to solve it. Go 
     <lb/>
     down to the public library and take up any of the 
     <lb/>
     50 books that are there on public finance; not 
     <lb/>
     private, or corporation, or banking finance, but 
     <lb/>
     public finance. If you don't want to spend that 
 

            <cb/>
            

     much time, as I have done, reading dozens of 
     <lb/>
     books on public finance ... go down to the Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General, or the Fiance Commissioner, or anyone 
     <lb/>
     who has any knowledge, practical or theoretical, 
     <lb/>
     and you will find out if what I say is true or 
     <lb/>
     fooling. So I say this: the Housing Corporation, 
     <lb/>
     or other housing outfits who have had money 
     <lb/>
     loaned to them in the past and who now pay back 
     <lb/>
     interest and principal for many years to come, 
     <lb/>
     that money is income and revenue for the 
     <lb/>
     Government of <choice><sic>Nefoundland</sic><corr>Newfoundland</corr></choice>, no doubt about it. 
     <lb/>
     Do you suppose that with the best Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General that we have ever had in our lives, do you 
     <lb/>
     suppose that with a Commissioner for Finance 
     <lb/>
     who is a practical financial man, that when they 
     <lb/>
     show revenue from the Housing Corporation as 
     <lb/>
     revenue, that they don't know what they are 
     <lb/>
     doing? Of course they know what they are doing. 
     <lb/>
     They are following orthodox and established 
     <lb/>
     public finance practices. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now similarly, the other point that Mr. Hick<lb break="no"/>man made was this: the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment agreed a year or so ago to buy back from 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada whatever they own 
     <lb/>
     out there in Gander — equipment of all kinds. 
     <lb/>
     They got for $1 million what it cost the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government $25 million to put there. They agreed 
     <lb/>
     to pay that in three annual installments of 
     <lb/>
     $333,000. The Government of Canada says they 
     <lb/>
     will pay that back if we become a province, so in 
     <lb/>
     two years that means $666,000 which will come 
     <lb/>
     in to the Government of Newfoundland in cash. 
     <lb/>
     On top of that the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     placed an order in Scotland to build three boats, 
     <lb/>
     one of them is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Cabot Strait</hi> on duty now, and 
     <lb/>
     the other two are still being built and will be done 
     <lb/>
     very soon. The Canadian government says that if 
     <lb/>
     we become a province they will pay back the cash 
     <lb/>
     we paid out for these two boats. It is a couple of 
     <lb/>
     million dollars, or more.... That is revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     government. Now let us say that we are the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet. We say, "All right gentlemen, we just 
     <lb/>
     received a cheque from the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada for $2 million, what will we do with it?" 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett and Mr. Hickman give their ideas. To 
     <lb/>
     begin with we have no choice, it has to go into 
     <lb/>
     the CRF, but now what will we do with it? Will 
     <lb/>
     we spend it all the first year, or in two years, or 
     <lb/>
     eight years? According to my plan we divide it 
     <lb/>
     by eight, and spend $255,000 a year. Now what 
     <lb/>
     is wrong with that? We are the cabinet, and we 


            <pb n="978" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-09_Page_0978.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">978</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
   

     decide that we will spend it in one year, or 50 
     <lb/>
     years, or not spend it at all. Whatever the govern<lb break="no"/>ment decides, that is it; except that of course, after 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet decides, it has to be brought into the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly.... Now don't let's hear any 
     <lb/>
     more about that. It's bad enough to have to bring 
     <lb/>
     in a budget, without having to educate men on 
     <lb/>
     public finance. I take my hat off to Mr. Hickman, 
     <lb/>
     but although he has had a lot of experience in 
     <lb/>
     private finance, he has had very little in public 
     <lb/>
     finance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next point, he says I have not got enough 
     <lb/>
     in this estimate by $500,000 for Health and Wel<lb break="no"/>fare, and for the government's reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     policy, $2.5 million. Well, that's a good one — 
     <lb/>
     the present government's reconstruction pro<lb break="no"/>gram of $2.5 million. Since when has Mr. Hick<lb break="no"/>man become a convert to the present 
     <lb/>
     government's reconstruction policy? The day 
     <lb/>
     that this Convention opened, every member here 
     <lb/>
     was presented with what was called "A Proposed 
     <lb/>
     Reconstruction Programme", every year for ten 
     <lb/>
     years. We remember Mr. Wild, Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     for Finance and Customs. Major Cashin brought 
     <lb/>
     in a resolution, and we adopted it, and Mr. Wild 
     <lb/>
     came up to a private session of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     and he was asked a question about this 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction programme — $59 million or $60 
     <lb/>
     million dollars for ten years. "Where do you 
     <lb/>
     propose to get the money for that?" Every mem<lb break="no"/>ber remembers what he said: "Oh that's just a 
     <lb/>
     programme that we think should be carried out, 
     <lb/>
     provided the money were there to carry it out 
     <lb/>
     with". I doubt if there is one member in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention who would take that reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     programme and agree with it. Out of $60 million 
     <lb/>
     how much did they propose to spend on the 
     <lb/>
     fishery? $1 million wasn't it? On roads I think it 
     <lb/>
     was $12 million. There is not a man who agrees 
     <lb/>
     with the government's reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     programme, and Mr. Hickman does not agree any 
     <lb/>
     more than I do. But now he comes to the debate, 
     <lb/>
     and it is a different story: $2.5 million you have 
     <lb/>
     to spend on the government's reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     programme. It is very convenient to use it al<lb break="no"/>though he did not agree with it. I apologise for 
     <lb/>
     being so long, but I will come back to it later. 
            </p>

<p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Short recess]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I will just take 
     <lb/>
     a couple of minutes to finish what I was saying 
     <lb/>
     before the recess. On this estimate of mine, the 
  

            <cb/>
         

     total expenditure of the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     for the first four years of union would be $15.1 
     <lb/>
     million a year, and for the next four years it would 
     <lb/>
     be $15.5 million or $15.6 million a year, and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman claims that it is $2-3 million short; 
     <lb/>
     but my answer is this: it is not short, that these 
     <lb/>
     dollars that he claims should be added on will be 
     <lb/>
     spent all right, and probably should be spent, as 
     <lb/>
     this country has not got enough public services. 
     <lb/>
     We know that, and spending $15 million a year 
     <lb/>
     for the first four years, and $15.5 million for the 
     <lb/>
     next four years would not create any new services 
     <lb/>
     at all. I would ask you to take notice that 
     <lb/>
     provision is made, in these four years, for the cost 
     <lb/>
     of up-keeping new services that we have not got 
     <lb/>
     now, but those amounts do not cover the cost of 
     <lb/>
     putting the new services there. But Mr. Hickman 
     <lb/>
     claims that the cost of creating these new services 
     <lb/>
     should be shown in the new cost of government 
     <lb/>
     on the ordinary account side. I hold the exact 
     <lb/>
     opposite. We need more schools in New<lb break="no"/>foundland; a lot of schools that we have now need 
     <lb/>
     to be repaired and improved. We need new roads 
     <lb/>
     and a lot of new services; new hospitals, and a 
     <lb/>
     number of new things, which if we are to get them 
     <lb/>
     at all will have to be got by the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Some will be gotten by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment: bait depots, etc., would come under them, 
     <lb/>
     but under the provincial government a number of 
     <lb/>
     new services have to be got. I admit that, and I 
     <lb/>
     hold that the ordinary expenditure of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment year by year should cover the cost of keep<lb break="no"/>ing up any public services we have, but the cost 
     <lb/>
     of new public services — roads, hospitals, 
     <lb/>
     schools — should not, and does not need to be 
     <lb/>
     included in ordinary expenditure. They should be 
     <lb/>
     on extraordinary, special, capital, reconstruction, 
     <lb/>
     or whatever you like to call it; and for that we 
     <lb/>
     have money to do the job. We have $28 million; 
     <lb/>
     when this fiscal year is over we may have $30 
     <lb/>
     million, which we can put on deposit and draw 
     <lb/>
     interest on it, and draw out of that sum some 
     <lb/>
     amount each year to build new schools, new 
     <lb/>
     roads, new hospitals, and new public services. 
     <lb/>
     That is what that money would be for, and the 
     <lb/>
     amount that you would draw out every year to 
     <lb/>
     spend on capital account should be decided by 
     <lb/>
     the general conditions of the country. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, you should time your spending. Now it's 
     <lb/>
     been held, and I think rightly, that one mistake 
     <lb/>
     that our present government is making is to be 


            <pb n="979" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-09_Page_0979.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">979</fw>
          

     spending that public money on capital account, 
     <lb/>
     building schools, hospitals, bait depots and roads 
     <lb/>
     now, when the need, from the standpoint of 
     <lb/>
     giving employment, is not so great as it may be 
     <lb/>
     in the future, and our government is following the 
     <lb/>
     exactly opposite course from that adopted by 
     <lb/>
     most governments around the world. Most 
     <lb/>
     governments do this: when times are good they 
     <lb/>
     tax high and collect all they can; and when times 
     <lb/>
     are bad the money that they collected they spend 
     <lb/>
     when it is needed most, to take up the slack by 
     <lb/>
     private employment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My contention is that $15 million a year for 
     <lb/>
     the first four years, and $15.5 million a year for 
     <lb/>
     the second four years is ample to cover the ordi<lb break="no"/>nary expenditures of the government of the 
     <lb/>
     province, and that anything extraordinary should 
     <lb/>
     be spent out of capital account. We have a capital 
     <lb/>
     fund for that very purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, I want to say this: I don't want to do 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman an injustice, but I must say that he 
     <lb/>
     gives me this impression that the surplus should 
     <lb/>
     be laid aside and forgotten until we get the bread 
     <lb/>
     line. He said, "When you get bread lines on the 
     <lb/>
     mainland of Canada and the United States, you 
     <lb/>
     will have them in Newfoundland". Now that 
     <lb/>
     means destitution and unemployment, and he 
     <lb/>
     says we should save the $28 million or $30 mil<lb break="no"/>lion until that day. The impression I got is, "Don't 
     <lb/>
     touch your surplus until your people are destitute 
     <lb/>
     or nearly so, and then spend it for dole." If I got 
     <lb/>
     that impression wrongly he will correct me, and 
     <lb/>
     I will be glad, because I find it hard to believe. 
     <lb/>
     He is a practical and determined New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, who is old enough to remember 
     <lb/>
     what we went through from 1930 to 1940, and 
     <lb/>
     how we spent millions of dollars on dole, and he 
     <lb/>
     could not welcome that again, just spending it on 
     <lb/>
     dole. I think he would agree with me the better 
     <lb/>
     way is to spend the money before the dole days 
     <lb/>
     come on public works such as road building, the 
     <lb/>
     construction of buildings, etc., so as to create 
     <lb/>
     employment. Let's all hope and pray to God that 
     <lb/>
     there will be no need to ladle out dole again in 
     <lb/>
     this country. The very sound of the name turns 
     <lb/>
     your blood cold, when you remember the dole 
     <lb/>
     days from 1930 to 1940. Let's hope that we will 
     <lb/>
     spend that capital, timing it right, so that there 
     <lb/>
     will not be any need to pay dole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Smallwood at the beginning 
     <lb/>
     brought in a little dig which I don't think is right. 
 

            <cb/>
          

     He said it was plain that I did not study this. I did 
     <lb/>
     not need to study it. I could gather it quite easily 
     <lb/>
     yesterday afternoon, and the few notes I made 
     <lb/>
     then are quite clear. Now, on this question of 
     <lb/>
     surplus I would like to correct Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     and I know he did not intentionally misunder<lb break="no"/>stand what I said. I did not intend to say that the 
     <lb/>
     surplus should be saved until dole days, or until 
     <lb/>
     the people are on relief. I think it should be saved 
     <lb/>
     until the revenue drops, not until dole, and then 
     <lb/>
     it could be used for special expenditure. If for 
     <lb/>
     eight years we use $3 million a year we have $12   
     <lb/>
     million gone, but we have got to keep $9 million, 
     <lb/>
     as one-third of it is frozen under the terms of

     England, and I don't know how we can get that 
     <lb/>
     for a while. I don't want to get into an argument, 
     <lb/>
     but I will say this: that the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland prior to Commission government did 
     <lb/>
     not throw everything into the one hat. They did 
     <lb/>
     keep ordinary expenditure separate from capital 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, and whether the governments today 
     <lb/>
     do it or not, I still contend that it is the wrong thing 
     <lb/>
     to do. There would be a lot of governments who 
     <lb/>
     would be better off if they ran their governments 
     <lb/>
     like a private business. There would be fewer 
     <lb/>
     debts. Again, on this question on which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood spoke, the repayment of the 
     <lb/>
     money from the Gander and the boats purchased 
     <lb/>
     in England. After we have spent that for this eight

     year period, it is completely dissipated. It is gone. 
     <lb/>
     It is my opinion— Mr. Smallwood has his— that 
     <lb/>
     this should not go into current revenue, but into 
     <lb/>
     accumulated surplus, not surplus that we may get 
     <lb/>
     as a province, but surplus that we will be left with 
     <lb/>
     if we become a province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reference to roads, I know that the $1 mil<lb break="no"/>lion allowed in Mr. Smallwood's budget was for 
     <lb/>
     maintenance. I have looked at all these figures. 
     <lb/>
     That was my contention, that there was only $1 
     <lb/>
     million for roads, and that has to be for main<lb break="no"/>tenance. It is going to cost us $1 million under the 
     <lb/>
     provincial set-up for roads, but what I was saying 
     <lb/>
     was that there was nothing for new roads that will 
     <lb/>
     bring in taxes on cars and gasoline and drivers' 
     <lb/>
     licenses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, on that reconstruction, Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood gives me credit for now believing in Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government policy. If Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     has followed me closely, I brought out the fact 
     <lb/>
     that that deficit of approximately $5.8 million 
     <lb/>
     would be brought about by reconstruction at the 
     <lb/>
     rate of $2.5 million, and the educational cut, and 
     <lb/>
     the public health cut, if we maintain the present 
     <lb/>
     standards that we are doing today in reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion; and I presume it would be the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     any government in the next few years to carry on 
     <lb/>
     as we have been doing to finish the buildings we 
     <lb/>
     have started, and complete these services. That 
     <lb/>
     was my point, if we continue. But if you want to 
     <lb/>
     wipe out the $2.5 million, and take the estimate I 
     <lb/>
     originally made of $2 million for public health, 
     <lb/>
     and $1 million for education, it still brings it up 
     <lb/>
     to $18 million, and that's without any reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion deficit. You have the same thing, and that 
     <lb/>
     will bring it up to a $4 million deficit. You have 
     <lb/>
     got to add that to the $1 million already provided 
     <lb/>
     for in Mr. Smallwood's estimate. That brings it 
     <lb/>
     to $5 million that you have got to get from the 
     <lb/>
     people in some form in addition to the taxation 
     <lb/>
     they have to pay to the federal government. I 
     <lb/>
     think that clears up what Mr. Smallwood and I 
     <lb/>
     have to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Before we go any further there is one 
     <lb/>
     item I would like to see cleared up, that figure 
     <lb/>
     under Public Works for road maintenance. Now 
     <lb/>
     under heading 1 of sub-heading E, page 61...<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Pardon me, Mr. Butt, there is 
     <lb/>
     altogether too much noise, 1 can't hear members 
     <lb/>
     when they are addressing the Chair. Will you 
 

            <cb/>
         

     kindly refrain from noise in the galleries? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> All the headings with the exception of 
     <lb/>
     E-4, in my opinion are all maintenance, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that improvements and reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     of roads and bridges were under that heading. I 
     <lb/>
     will explain the difference. The maintenance of 
     <lb/>
     roads, that is the first item of $1 million, will be 
     <lb/>
     the pay for any maintenance men who are filling, 
     <lb/>
     cutting, spreading gravel, etc; under E-3, the 
     <lb/>
     improvement and reconstruction of roads and 
     <lb/>
     bridges, there is a slight separation. It could very 
     <lb/>
     easily go into maintenance of roads and bridges, 
     <lb/>
     because that would include such things as the 
     <lb/>
     replacement of ordinary bridges by, say, concrete 
     <lb/>
     bridges, and the replacement of ordinary wooden 
     <lb/>
     bridges by new wooden bridges. It would also 
     <lb/>
     take in side cuts where you have sharp curves. 
     <lb/>
     You would take these off and you would also fill 
     <lb/>
     in, for instance, where you have very soft ground, 
     <lb/>
     so that if we are going to improve our roads at all 
     <lb/>
     — and there is an important point to remember, 
     <lb/>
     by improving and not putting it under ordinary 
     <lb/>
     maintenance, you are thereby saving a lot of 
     <lb/>
     money in the future by upkeep of roads. On this 
     <lb/>
     sub-heading alone, apart from the $1 million and 
     <lb/>
     a very small section which would be used in the 
     <lb/>
     construction of new roads, roughly $2 million is 
     <lb/>
     today being spent on what I consider poor main<lb break="no"/>tenance, and I think $1,270,000 is quite wrong. I 
     <lb/>
     would go a little further, and if my memory serves 
     <lb/>
     me wrong I would like to be corrected, but I 
     <lb/>
     believe that when we were discussing the 
     <lb/>
     Transportation Report, it was said by one 
     <lb/>
     gentleman that Sir Wilfred Woods gave it as his 
     <lb/>
     opinion that $2 million would be needed to main<lb break="no"/>tain the roads that we have at present.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> That is exactly what he said.

     <lb/>
     clear picture as to what these two votes are for. 
     <lb/>
     Ordinary maintenance, such as driving the grader 
     <lb/>
     over and throwing down a bit of gravel, as against 
     <lb/>
     cutting off curves, side cuts, filling in soft spots, 
     <lb/>
     and concrete bridges, etc, which are all part and 
     <lb/>
     parcel of maintenance of roads, and are not for 
     <lb/>
     new construction at all. So I think it is out at least

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is a slight difference of 
     <lb/>
     opinion between Mr. Butt on the one hand and 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government on the other. If 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Butt will turn to paragraph 94 of the estimate, 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government's own estimate, 
     <lb/>
     not mine, the third item from the bottom, which 
     <lb/>
     is the three year reconstruction program of the 
     <lb/>
     present government; the third item from the bot<lb break="no"/>tom — $1.75 million. Now Mr. Butt regards all 
     <lb/>
     that as ordinary expenditure on maintenance of 
     <lb/>
     roads, whereas the government regards it and 
     <lb/>
     treats it as reconstruction expenditure, part of a 
     <lb/>
     three year reconstruction program, and the 
     <lb/>
     amount I have down of $1.27 million per year is 
     <lb/>
     the govemment's ordinary maintenance of roads 
     <lb/>
     as they now exist. But roads that will be built from 
     <lb/>
     the time that we would become a province, would 
     <lb/>
     be extra or special, or reconstruction, or capital, 
     <lb/>
     and the maintenance of them would have to be 
     <lb/>
     ordinary expenditure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> There is one way the Convention 
     <lb/>
     could settle a matter of that kind — call in the 
     <lb/>
     men who are doing this job in the government. 
     <lb/>
     The actual fact is that that money is all required 
     <lb/>
     for maintenance unless you are going to leave 
     <lb/>
     your roads exactly as they are today.... I don't 
     <lb/>
     speak definitely on matters of this kind unless I 
     <lb/>
     know whereof I speak. I say this is out by half a 
     <lb/>
     million dollars.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I find myself in a very peculiar posi<lb break="no"/>tion, in that Mr. Bradley moved, "that the Con<lb break="no"/>vention resolve itself into a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole to further consider and discuss the 
     <lb/>
     proposals received on November 6 from the 
     <lb/>
     Right Honourable the Prime Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Canada"; that is what this committee of the whole 
     <lb/>
     is supposed to be doing now. What are we doing? 
     <lb/>
     We are discussing a proposed budget brought in 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Smallwood. The whole discussion is out 
     <lb/>
     of order, but we are at it, and we may as well 
     <lb/>
     continue it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you don't mind, Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     I would like to make my position clear. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has, if not at the request of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention, at least by and with their consent, intro<lb break="no"/>duced this for the purpose of breaking down some 
     <lb/>
     figures that were received from the Prime Mini<lb break="no"/>ster of Canada. I have not ruled that he has the 
     <lb/>
     right to do it, but he has done it at the request of 
     <lb/>
     some members of the Convention, and I have 
  

            <cb/>
         

     allowed it to go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That may be so, but I maintain that 
     <lb/>
     he has not broken down these figures, but has 
     <lb/>
     brought in new figures. I propose to go through 
     <lb/>
     this, including also the Black Book and the Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book as time goes on, and for that purpose I want 
     <lb/>
     to start at the beginning of the proposed budget 
     <lb/>
     brought in by Mr. Smallwood and make an in<lb break="no"/>quiry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On page 15 you will notice "Trustee stock not 
     <lb/>
     converted...on these two loans", one up to 1950, 
     <lb/>
     and that amounts to $80,569 and the other in 1952 
     <lb/>
     amounts to $42,806, What I can't find out in the 
     <lb/>
     estimate is if any provision is made to pay the 
     <lb/>
     interest on these two loans. I know that $3 million 
     <lb/>
     has been set aside in Great Britain to wipe out 
     <lb/>
     these two loans at maturity, one in 1950 and the 
     <lb/>
     other in 1952, but I do say that our government 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, be it as it is now, or be it under 
     <lb/>
     confederation, has to supply enough money to 
     <lb/>
     pay that.... Your provincial government will have 
     <lb/>
     to pay the interest on that $80,000 and $40,000 
     <lb/>
     and some odd from 1950 to 1952. What I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask is, why Mr. Smallwood has not made 
     <lb/>
     any provision for that in his proposed expendi<lb break="no"/>ture? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In reply to Mr. Hollett, if he is 
     <lb/>
     prepared to wait until I have talked to the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Department I will give him a very complete 
     <lb/>
     answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> There is no answer beyond the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the government is transferring the interest on 
     <lb/>
     this money semi-annually, June 30 and Decem<lb break="no"/>ber 31, and in this provincial budget these two 
     <lb/>
     loans have to be taken care of as to interest. Now 
     <lb/>
     there is $3,232,000 at 2.5% set aside in the Bank 
     <lb/>
     of England to meet this loan of $3.5 million. We 
     <lb/>
     figure that as the loans mature the interest which 
     <lb/>
     will be accumulated on these two amounts will 
     <lb/>
     be sufficient to pay them off, but at the present 
     <lb/>
     time the interest is being transferred to London to 
     <lb/>
     pay these, consequently I realise, and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood realises, that it is immaterial. It 
     <lb/>
     does not matter whether he goes down to the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Department or not, it is left out. Until 
     <lb/>
     1950, or from then until 1952 it is $40-50,000 or 
     <lb/>
    more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     There is another thing while I am on my feet. 
     <lb/>
     I find in the Black Book, volume II, page 56, the 
     <lb/>
     total expenditure in this budget for the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Department, if I can make it out, because I never 
  

            <pb n="982" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-09_Page_0982.jpg"/>

     saw a budget like this in my life. We have here 
     <lb/>
     an amount to disappear of $2,228,500, and that 
     <lb/>
     includes three Commissioners. They are going to 
     <lb/>
     disappear. The Secretary of the Commission will 
     <lb/>
     disappear; grade I clerk, $2,000, in the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Department will disappear; the assistant 
     <lb/>
     secretary will disappear. Two grade III clerks are 
     <lb/>
     disappearing, the private secretary to the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners is disappearing, $2,000, the 
     <lb/>
     telephonist is disappearing, the statistical officer 
     <lb/>
     is disappearing, the clerk grade III is disappear<lb break="no"/>ing.... Then there is a slice off the Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General's department. Now the point I am 
     <lb/>
     making is this: all these people that are going to 
     <lb/>
     disappear from the Finance Department will be 
     <lb/>
     absorbed by the Finance Department of Canada...

     <lb/>people laid off from the Finance Department who 
     <lb/>will have to find employment in some other 
     <lb/>department of the Canadian government. Twelve 
     <lb/>or 14 are laid off, and we don't know where they 
     <lb/>will be fitted in. They might transfer them to 
     <lb/>Victoria, anywhere from Vancouver to Halifax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
     British Columbia. That's the law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well now, "Employees of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland in services taken 
     <lb/>
     over by Canada as provided for in clause 5 above 
     <lb/>
     will be offered employment in the corresponding 
     <lb/>
     Canadian service under the terms and conditions 
     <lb/>
     governing employment in that service, but 
     <lb/>
     without reduction in salary or loss of pension 
     <lb/>
     (superannuation) rights acquired under New<lb break="no"/>foundland law." As I read that they will be of<lb break="no"/>fered jobs in the Canadian civil service, and there 
   

            <cb/>
         

     is nothing to say as to what part of Canada they 
     <lb/>
     will have to go to. The Finance Department down 
     <lb/>
     here will be closed up, and the headquarters of 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Department will be in Ottawa. They 
     <lb/>
     will not have a branch down here. They will have 
     <lb/>
     an assessor's department down here to collect 
     <lb/>
     income tax, but they will not have all these finan<lb break="no"/>cial people down here, because the headquarters 
     <lb/>
     will be in Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There will be a Customs 
     <lb/>
     Department here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, there will be a Customs 
     <lb/>
     Department here, and how many will be laid off, 
     <lb/>
     particularly if we read these figures given by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government themselves, which says 
     <lb/>
     they are only going to collect $2 million in cus<lb break="no"/>toms duties here, and let's see, how many people 
     <lb/>
     have we in the Customs? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> 256. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, 256 people to collect around 
     <lb/>
     $2 million. They are going to collect $2 million, 
     <lb/>
     well $3 million altogether including excise on 
     <lb/>
     tobacco and liquor, and they will still employ 256 
     <lb/>
     people to do it, when we only employ 256 to 
     <lb/>
     collect $30 million! There will be people let off 
     <lb/>
     from the civil service and we have had proof 
     <lb/>
     during the discussions of this from Ottawa. The 
     <lb/>
     Railway will receive the same treatment. It's 
     <lb/>
     hidden in the Black Books, but it is in secret 
     <lb/>
     documents which we are supposed to have, and 
     <lb/>
     we find that there will be lay-offs in the Railway 
     <lb/>
     unless we are not able to read English. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As I put a question to the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada on that, why make a 
     <lb/>
     statement until the answer comes back? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Because they answered it themsel<lb break="no"/>ves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not in the official statement. 
     <lb/>
     
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The Black Book has nothing to do 
     <lb/>with it. In these discussions we have discovered 
     <lb/>there were other documents given to you by the 
     <lb/>Ottawa government, and in one of these docu<lb break="no"/>ments it was pointed out and intimated by one of 
     <lb/>the Canadian officials of the CNR that they 
     <lb/>thought that the Railway was overstaffed. That's 
     <lb/>what it meant in rough English. Consequently 
     <lb/>they have it in the back of their heads that when 
     <lb/>they take it over, they will lay off people over 
     <lb/>there, but for official purposes they did not men<lb break="no"/>tion it here. There are a lot of other secret docu<lb break="no"/>ments that will have to come out before this is

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> There are. You told us about some

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Why was it not in the Black Book?

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, but it has to be blasted out of 
     <lb/>you. There's other documents they have going

     <lb/>them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't know, and if any other

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What document? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That Blue Book.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You mentioned some document we

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We did not send you people up to 
     <lb/>Ottawa as a beggarly delegation — we sent you 
     <lb/>to Ottawa representing what I consider a fairly 
     <lb/>prosperous country, and what you did, you went 
     <lb/>up with your hat in your hands and said, "What 
     <lb/>are the best terms you can give us?" That's what 
     <lb/>happened. I bring that out right now, but as I go 
     <lb/>along I just want to make this clear: I find now 
     <lb/>that there's ten or 15 people who will be laid off, 
     <lb/>but there is nothing definite laid down as to where 
     <lb/>they will be employed. Those people who are 
     <lb/>included in the Black Book will find that when 
     <lb/>the provincial government (if we ever get one, 
     <lb/>and I doubt it) takes over the affairs of the 
     <lb/>province, that their jobs are gone, and they will 
     <lb/>have to go with their hats in their hands looking 
     <lb/>for similar employment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before you take your seat, I 
     <lb/>would like to draw your attention to the fact that 
     <lb/>the document which occasioned so much mystery 
     <lb/>was, at my request, turned over to the secretarial 
     <lb/>staff, and is being mimeographed at the moment, 
     <lb/>and I understand it will be available to members 
     <lb/>tomorrow or the next day at the latest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I hope we get them all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I want to make a very brief 
     <lb/>reply to Major Cashin. He says that in the Finance 


            <cb/>
         

     Department 12 or 14 men and women who work 
     <lb/>
     there now would ... be out of their jobs. That is 
     <lb/>
     true, but I would draw Major Cashin's attention 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that here in Newfoundland the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada would open up a number of 
     <lb/>
     federal departments over and above the depart<lb break="no"/>ments we have here now, that they would take 
     <lb/>
     over and run.... I estimate that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, after taking over certain public depart<lb break="no"/>ments that we have now (and in taking them over 
     <lb/>
     they take over with them the employees that are 
     <lb/>
     in them) would have to take on at least 1,000 civil 
     <lb/>
     servants in the new offices and departments that 
     <lb/>
     they would have to open up, and any civil ser<lb break="no"/>vants ... who would lose their jobs would have the 
     <lb/>
     first offer of employment in these other Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government departments that would be opened 
     <lb/>
     up. It is true that in departments that would be<lb break="no"/>come provincial departments there will be fewer 
     <lb/>
     employees, so many will have to go; but they and 
     <lb/>
     many more will be taken on in entirely new 
     <lb/>
     federal government departments that will be 
     <lb/>
     opened in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One other point only: Major Cashin tells us 
     <lb/>
     that the number of employees in the Customs 
     <lb/>
     Department is 256. I do not dispute that 250-odd 
     <lb/>
     are employed in the Department of Customs to 
     <lb/>
     collect $20 million a year off the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I hate the sound of it, but they will 
     <lb/>
     need employees to collect that money. Let me tell 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin that if the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     when it takes over the Customs Department, if in 
     <lb/>
     taking over the Government of Canada collects 
     <lb/>
     only $2-4 million a year, they will need just as 
     <lb/>
     many employees as there are now to collect $20 
     <lb/>
     million.... You will have exactly the same num<lb break="no"/>ber of customs ports of entry, so therefore you 
     <lb/>
     will have the same number of collectors and tide 
     <lb/>
     waiters, the same number of customs watchers 
     <lb/>
     and searchers, and clerical staff. We are an island, 
     <lb/>
     and confederation will not change that. If I am 
     <lb/>
     wrong, and they can get along with 200, well then 
     <lb/>
     the 56 will have the first chance of being 
     <lb/>
     employed in the other departments of the federal 
     <lb/>
     government.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I was asking

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> a question when the floor was 
     <lb/>more or less taken away from underneath my feet. 
     <lb/>Of course we have to put up with these things. 
     <lb/>One is dubious about saying anything here today,

     but if you say anything at all you are tried, as it 
     <lb/>
     were. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This budget which he has brought in starts by 
     <lb/>
     leaving out an expenditure of $123,000 which 
     <lb/>
     would have to be found by the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment, some of it up till 1952. I asked him why he 
     <lb/>
     left that out, and his reply was that if I would give 
     <lb/>
     him time to see the finance minister he would be 
     <lb/>
     able to reply. Now is the finance minister of this 
     <lb/>
     country at the present time responsible for this 
     <lb/>
     budget? Is not this Mr. Smallwood's own 
     <lb/>
     budget? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> In that case I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     why Mr. Smallwood cannot answer me now. I 
     <lb/>
     can understand a man forgetting it, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand that $123,000 has to be spent as soon as you 
     <lb/>
     get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the probable expenditures 
     <lb/>
     under consolidated funds service A, if you would 
     <lb/>
     put $499,625 you would be practically correct. 
     <lb/>
     We come on to the Department of Finance, and 
     <lb/>
     that has been spoken to by Major Cashin and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman. One of the things that did strike me 
     <lb/>
     was that in the Black Books there was $1,000 
     <lb/>
     allowed for civil service pensions. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood in the goodness of his heart has 
     <lb/>
     added $101,000 to that, because he suddenly 
     <lb/>
     discovered that the provincial government will 
     <lb/>
     be responsible for the present civil service pen<lb break="no"/>sions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If you would allow me, respon<lb break="no"/>sible for pensions of those who have been work<lb break="no"/>ing for the Government of Newfoundland up to 
     <lb/>
     the time of union, and for those who become 
     <lb/>
     federal employees, for that portion of their pen<lb break="no"/>sion earned up to the time of union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you don't mind Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood...? I would like to say, Mr. Hollett, that 
     <lb/>
     your criticism was just and proper, that the floor 
     <lb/>
     was taken away from you, and it arises from the 
     <lb/>
     fact that I permitted two men to occupy the floor 
     <lb/>
     at the same time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I note 
     <lb/>
     that we have 256 employees in the Customs at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. Apparently most of them will be 
     <lb/>
     done out of employment. Posts and Telegraphs, 
     <lb/>
     1,031 civil servants, most of whom will be 
     <lb/>
     retained. A good many of these will probably find 
     <lb/>
     themselves without work. Assessor of Taxes, 31 
     <lb/>
     civil servants. Coming down to the Depart<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
          
ment of Home Affairs, I notice under "Travelling 
     <lb/>
     and Miscellaneous" Mr. Smallwood has the fig<lb break="no"/>ure $2,300. I understand it is $9,800. Probably 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood would make a note and tell me 
     <lb/>
     why he has lopped off $7,800. There is another 
     <lb/>
     note in the estimates which provides $10,000 for 
     <lb/>
     war graves in Europe. It is just possible that if we 
     <lb/>
     go into confederation, that the war graves will be 
     <lb/>
     taken care of by the federal government, but I 
     <lb/>
     have yet to see any mention of that in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books. I would like to be sure on that point too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Education, too, has been spoken of this eve<lb break="no"/>ning. The estimate calls for $3,622,300 for the 
     <lb/>
     present year. $514,000 of that amount was allo<lb break="no"/>cated by the government for building of new 
     <lb/>
     schools throughout the island, and for repairing 
     <lb/>
     schools. Mr. Smallwood has cut off $514,600.... 
     <lb/>
     Again I maintain that we have no right what<lb break="no"/>soever, simply because the remainder of Canada 
     <lb/>
     does it, to cut off an allocation which has been 
     <lb/>
     made for the education of our children. The 
     <lb/>
     education of our children has been backward. 
     <lb/>
     You and I grew up in those backward days, with 
     <lb/>
     the rain beating in through the roof and the snow 
     <lb/>
     through the windows — not at the same time, I 
     <lb/>
     suppose! Do you remember those days?.... 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood will say no more repairs to 
     <lb/>
     schools, no more erection of school buildings, if 
     <lb/>
     we are going into confederation. I would suggest 
     <lb/>
     that instead of the $3,107,700 which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has cut out for Education, it 
     <lb/>
     should be $4 million, because we all know that 
     <lb/>
     the Education Department today is budgeting for 
     <lb/>
     a $4 million expenditure next year. Why should 
     <lb/>
     we deprive this country of that budget, simply to 
     <lb/>
     become a part and parcel of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We come on to the Department of Justice. 
     <lb/>
     There's this little matter of the magistrates, 21 at 
     <lb/>
     the present time and they are receiving $70,181. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has cut that down to $38,374, 
     <lb/>
     simply because he says the other seven will be<lb break="no"/>come county magistrates. Whether they are coun<lb break="no"/>ty magistrates or district magistrates I think 
     <lb/>
     makes very little difference. It has not yet been 
     <lb/>
     proved that these district magistrates will receive 
     <lb/>
     their stipend from the federal government. I am 
     <lb/>
     doubtful whether you can get along in this 
     <lb/>
     country without 21 magistrates. You can call

     a magistrate is somewhat lower in the judicial 
     <lb/>
     circle then a county magistrate in the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, so I see no reason why that should be 
     <lb/>
     cut down. Shorthand typists, is cut down to three 
     <lb/>
     which means that three will be done out of work. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p>Now I come to the Constabulary, $526,830. 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood very magnificiently has left that 
     <lb/>as it is. I have been dealing with constables and 
     <lb/>police officers for 25 years, and I know the con<lb break="no"/>ditions under which they live, and I know the 
     <lb/>salaries they are receiving even today, and when 
     <lb/>I tell you that a constable of 15 or 20 years 
     <lb/>experience receives $1,550, and a second grade 
     <lb/>clerk in the department here in St. John's with 
     <lb/>one year's experience gets  $1,500, I ask you, are 
     <lb/>these constables being treated right? 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood thinks they are. We won't in<lb break="no"/>crease that vote, we will leave it as it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Penitentiary. Mr. Smallwood says the federal 
     <lb/>government will pay half that amount. The al<lb break="no"/>location is now $25,000, and it is cut down to 
     <lb/>$12,500. I take it that's the amount that is re<lb break="no"/>quired to service and take care of the penitentiary 
     <lb/>as it exists today. We all know that that peniten<lb break="no"/>tiary is inadequate. I don't think any of you 
     <lb/>gentlemen would get a bed there tonight if you 
     <lb/>wanted to. How can you cut down your expendi<lb break="no"/>tures? Most of these men are sent there by the 
     <lb/>magistrates, and I take it under confederation our 
     <lb/>people are not going to become saints, and some 
     <lb/>will have to take temporary residence down 
     <lb/>there, and the amount of $25,000 is only just 
     <lb/>enough to get along. As a matter of fact, I don't 
     <lb/>think it is ample. The travelling of magistrates is 
     <lb/>cut from $20,000 to $15,000. Why? Magistrates, 
     <lb/>or county magistrates, are they not going to 
     <lb/>travel? It there not just as much travelling in this 
     <lb/>country for the magistrates under confederation 
     <lb/>as at the present time? How can he cut $5,000 off? 
     <lb/>These are only small amounts, gentlemen, but all 
     <lb/>added together will show you just how much we 
     <lb/>need to run this country, even as it was. General 
     <lb/>justice, $25,100 in the estimates, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>has cut off another $5,000 there. Maintenance 
     <lb/>and operation of vessels. Last year that took 
     <lb/>$11,200. I don't know what vessels that refers to, 
     <lb/>unless it is the vessel which takes the Supreme 
     <lb/>Court around the island. I don't believe they can 
     <lb/>do it less than that, or we will have no Supreme 
     <lb/>Court travelling around the island from time to 
     <lb/>time. If we are going to have that we will need 
 

            <cb/>
         

     $11,200, and not the $5,600 which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has put down for the main<lb break="no"/>tenance and operation of that vessel. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p>Penitentiary supplies. The vote is $45,000, 
     <lb/>and Mr. Smallwood has cut it to $10,000. I don't 
     <lb/>know how. The penitentiary will have prisoners, 
     <lb/>and has to be serviced and have supplies. How 
     <lb/>can we do it on $10,000 being a province of 
     <lb/>Canada? You will see that if you add these 
     <lb/>amounts, and the amount already placed there by 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood, that the estimated expenditure 
     <lb/>as made by our own government under the head<lb break="no"/>ing of Justice, which was $1,177,700, is little 
     <lb/>enough, so I would suggest that instead of 
     <lb/>$1,053,000, you really must leave that figure of 
     <lb/>$1,177,700. That is as far as I care to go this 
     <lb/>afternoon, because there are other men who 
     <lb/>would like to speak. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to reply to 
     <lb/>Mr. Hollett. He says there are 256 men or women 
     <lb/>working in the Customs, and he says that most of 
     <lb/>them will be done out of work.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Look at clause 5 and you will

     <lb/>take over they will take the employees with them, 
     <lb/>and obviously some of the employees of the

     <lb/>That's quite clear isn't it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Well, some of them.

     256 customs officers to do the work after con<lb break="no"/>federation. 
     <lb/>
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Yes, your statement was that 
     <lb/>there were 256 employees presently employed 
     <lb/>down there, and you went on to state your reasons 
     <lb/>as to why some of these employees should lose 
     <lb/>their jobs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> My reply was just as clearly 
     <lb/>that none of them would lose their jobs. I hope 
     <lb/>that no one else will say that in the Customs or 
     <lb/>any department ... any of these employees would 
     <lb/>lose their jobs; so let us hear no more of that.

     War graves. It is perfectly true that in the Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book or the Black Book there is no specific 
     <lb/>
     statement to the effect that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would maintain war graves in Europe. 
     <lb/>
     Does anyone doubt that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada does look after war graves? It is not 
     <lb/>
     looked after by the province, but by the federal 
     <lb/>
     government. It comes under Veterans' Affairs, 
     <lb/>
     which is a federal job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> says I have dropped $500,000, but 
     <lb/>
     I would ask Mr. Hollett to turn to page 94 of the 
     <lb/>
     estimates of the Government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     the third item down, D 8 and F 4, and he will find 
     <lb/>
     that a total amount of $514,600 is a reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion expenditure by the government, part of their 
     <lb/>
     three year reconstruction program; not per<lb break="no"/>manent but a program to spend $500,000 on the 
     <lb/>
     building of new schools and reconditioning old 
     <lb/>
     ones, and the building of regional libraries. So as 
     <lb/>
     it is only a reconstruction program I have omitted 
     <lb/>
     it as an ordinary expenditure, the idea being that 
     <lb/>
     it should be under capital expenditure — 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction expenditure... 
 </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Excuse me, have you got a capital 
     <lb/>account in that budget? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, it is an ordinary account 
     <lb/>budget, the ordinary expenditure for eight years, 
     <lb/>year by year. Anything else would have to be 
     <lb/>special. Now Mr. Hollett says that we have so 
     <lb/>many magistrates, and that I have cut seven of 
     <lb/>them down. That is true, because seven of them 
     <lb/>would not cease to be magistrates, but they would 
     <lb/>cease to be provincial and become federal. They 
     <lb/>would become county court judges, whose 
     <lb/>salaries are paid by the federal government. So, 
     <lb/>as the federal government would pay the salaries 
     <lb/>of seven magistrates, that would be seven 
     <lb/>magistrates that the provincial government 
     <lb/>would not have to pay for. The same thing exactly 
 

            <cb/>
           

     applies to the travelling. I have reduced the 
     <lb/>
     amount for travelling by the seven magistrates 
     <lb/>
     because the federal magistrates are not only paid 
     <lb/>
     their salaries, but their travelling expenses as 
     <lb/>
     well. Then Mr. Hollett notices that I have cut 
     <lb/>
     down the travelling expenses of the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court. I have, for a very good reason — that the 
     <lb/>
     salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court are 
     <lb/>
     paid by the Government of Canada, and so are 
     <lb/>
     their travelling expenses. It is a federal charge, a 
     <lb/>
     federal expense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Why the $5,600, then? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Speaking from memory, 
     <lb/>
     without looking it up for details, it is an amount 
     <lb/>
     of $5,600 lopped off of how much? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> $11,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Possibly I should have lopped 
     <lb/>
     a lot more off, and in leaving what I have left as 
     <lb/>
     a provincial government expenditure probably I 
     <lb/>
     have been too generous. Possibly it won't cost 
     <lb/>
     quite as much as I have said. If so it will be 
     <lb/>
     another little saving. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think that's all Mr. Hollett said, except the 
     <lb/>
     question he raised before, of those two debts that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland owes that are coming due in 1950 
     <lb/>
     and 1952, against which the government has 
     <lb/>
     placed money over in England. Why I have not 
     <lb/>
     put the interest in, I have told Mr. Hollett I will 
     <lb/>
     give him the answer tomorrow. Perhaps I have 
     <lb/>
     made a mistake, but at all events give me an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to look into the matter, and if I have 
     <lb/>
     made a mistake there's nothing to add. I have 
     <lb/>
     gone a long way in giving you some estimates of 
     <lb/>
     what the Government of Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     spend for the first eight years, and what would be 
     <lb/>
     their revenue for these eight years, and done it in 
     <lb/>
     considerable detail. It is entirely possible, not 
     <lb/>
     being minister of finance, and not having even a 
     <lb/>
     secretary that I have made a mistake. I have got 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of letters in my house that I have not 
     <lb/>
     had a chance to answer. Give me a chance, and 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow morning I will look into it, and tomor<lb break="no"/>row afternoon I will confess it very frankly. They 
     <lb/>
     say that open confession is good for the soul, and 
     <lb/>
     my soul needs some confessing after 14 months 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> With respect to these budgets, as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood recollects, the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     made a budget before going to Ottawa. They 
     <lb/>
     followed the same lines as the budget being 
     <lb/>
     brought in now, with the exception that there is a

     difference in the figures. I can understand why 
     <lb/>
     the difference in expenditure may arise, but 
     <lb/>
     frankly the difference in the expenditure from the 
     <lb/>
     one we made up rather puzzles me. The first gave 
     <lb/>
     an accounting for expenditure of $13,920,000. 
     <lb/>
     When we got to Ottawa, after some consideration 
     <lb/>
     we increased that budget by $500,000. If I 
     <lb/>
     remember rightly the budget for expenditure 
     <lb/>
     that we finally presented was $14,420,000. That 
     <lb/>
     is as you have it in your Black Book. Now on the 
 

            <cb/>
        

     revenue side we had a revenue of $3 million. That 
     <lb/>
     is apart altogether from this $1 million tax that 
     <lb/>
     we added on afterwards, a special tax...

     Report of the Ottawa Delegation

            <p>Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of Newfoundland into Confederation

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, when we ad- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     joumed yesterday, I was referring to budgets that 
     <lb/>
     had been made by the delegation prior to their 
     <lb/>
     going to Ottawa in June... Now we made two 
     <lb/>
     "guesstimates" going to Ottawa, one was to do 
     <lb/>
     with expenditures and one with revenue. There 
     <lb/>
     has been a difference in both these budgets, from 
     <lb/>
     the ones we made up and the ones that are before 
     <lb/>
     you today, and it is in that connection that I would 
     <lb/>
     like some explanation... Now if you will begin 
     <lb/>
     on page 56 of the Black Book, part II, you will 
     <lb/>
     probably follow me a little more intelligently. It 
     <lb/>
     is "Probable Division of Existing Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Public Expenditures".... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>[Mr. Higgins then went on to compare the es<lb break="no"/>timates of probable provincial expenditures and 
     <lb/>revenues prepared by the Ottawa delegation and 
     <lb/>printed in the Black Book, with the estimates 
     <lb/>submitted by Mr. Smallwood on December 8] 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>....I merely draw your attention to these [chan<lb break="no"/>ges] because frankly the way it appears to me is 
     <lb/>this: that when these estimates were made up by 
     <lb/>the committee going away, they did the best they 
     <lb/>could with what they had. They had no clerical 
     <lb/>help from the department concerned, even 
     <lb/>though application was made, but we did the best 
     <lb/>we could. Now I submit to Mr. Smallwood that 
     <lb/>he was faced with increased expenditure, and he 
     <lb/>had to find increased revenue for it, and he has 
     <lb/>apparently stepped up the figures that the com<lb break="no"/>mittee prepared, and I would like an explanation 
     <lb/>as to why he did mat.

     tawa delegation before we went to Ottawa, with 
     <lb/>
     the estimates of revenue and expenditure that I 
     <lb/>
     brought in here on Monday. Frankly I do not see 
     <lb/>
     the point. I do not see what point there is in 
     <lb/>
     comparing two things which are not comparable. 
     <lb/>
     Before we went to Ottawa we felt that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to have some idea of how much money the

     Government of Newfoundland would have to 
     <lb/>
     spend each year, if we became a province, and 
     <lb/>
     what would likely be the revenue to go towards 
     <lb/>
     that expense. We felt that we ought to do that. We 
     <lb/>
     did it according to the best of our knowledge at 
     <lb/>
     that time. We spent three months in Ottawa, and 
     <lb/>
     we learned a lot, and on the basis ofwhat I learned 
     <lb/>
     I brought in here on Monday estimates of what 
     <lb/>
     the Province ofNewfoundland would likely have 
     <lb/>
     to spend per year. and estimates of what the 
     <lb/>
     revenue from all sources would likely be.... What 
     <lb/>
     relation there is or can be between the two, apart 
     <lb/>
     from a purely academic relationship, 1 fail to see. 
     <lb/>
     As i have said several times in the last two or 
     <lb/>
     three weeks the estimates of expenditure and 
     <lb/>
     revenue that we made up before we went to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, that appear in the Black Book, are out of 
     <lb/>
     date... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     in introducing these estimates on Monday. I 
     <lb/>
     took, I believe, from 3.30 - 5.30 pm to read them, 
     <lb/>
     and to explain various items that differed 
     <lb/>
     materially from the government's own current 
     <lb/>
     estimates... The basis of comparison should be 
     <lb/>
     between the estimates that l brought in here Mon<lb break="no"/>day and those of the government as they exist in 
     <lb/>
     the current estimates. That is a fair basis of com<lb break="no"/>parison from the standpoint of expenditure. Now 
     <lb/>
     from the standpoint of revenue 1 grant you. the 
     <lb/>
