            <p>
     Sir, the motion embodies I feel what all the 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention feel. I am extremely 
     <lb/>
     pleased myself to be able to have the honour of 
     <lb/>
     moving this, particularly as a brother member of 
     <lb/>
     your profession, to be able to record the apprecia<lb break="no"/>tion of a group of citizens from all over the island 
     <lb/>
     assembled here in a Convention of which you 
     <lb/>
     have been such an able guide and guardian. I can 
     <lb/>
     say quite truthfully that at times matters have not 
     <lb/>
     been altogether in due decorum from the 
     <lb/>
     members' point of view. But you, I am sure, felt, 
     <lb/>
     with strong feelings running as they were bound 
     <lb/>
     to on matters such as we have had to debate, they 
     <lb/>
     would of necessity provoke an expression that at 
     <lb/>
     times might not be in accord with all that par<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
  
liamentary practice would desire; but that has 
     <lb/>
     happened in the best regulated parliaments, and 
     <lb/>
     I feel that the members here have nothing to be 
     <lb/>
     ashamed of in this respect. But even at times 
     <lb/>
     when tempers were on edge, you managed to 
     <lb/>
     preserve your impartiality, and treat members 
     <lb/>
     with your well-known courtesy, and the motion 
     <lb/>
     speaks of the able manner in which you have 
     <lb/>
     presided. I feel there is very little that needs be 
     <lb/>
     added to that. You carried out your duties here in 
     <lb/>
     the same able and professional manner that you 
     <lb/>
     carry out your professional duties, and for that 
     <lb/>
     reason I have much pleasure in moving this mo<lb break="no"/>tion at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I would like to have the honour of 
     <lb/>
     seconding that motion. I feel we all know that our 
     <lb/>
     Chairman has acted in a very fair and courageous 
     <lb/>
     way in all his arduous and difficult duties. I have 
     <lb/>
     personally received great kindness and con<lb break="no"/>sideration, not only from the Chairman, but also 
     <lb/>
     from all the delegates, and I very much appreciate 
     <lb/>
     this. I have been referred to, sir, as the father of 
     <lb/>
     the House, and I must say at times, while my 
     <lb/>
     children have been a little unruly, it has been a 
     <lb/>
     great thing, you have not had to call on the 
     <lb/>
     Sergeant-at-Arms at any time. I have great 
     <lb/>
     pleasure in seconding the motion.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, as one who has 
     <lb/>
     perhaps given you as much trouble as any other 
     <lb/>
     one member of the House, I would like to add my 
     <lb/>
     word of complete concurrence in the motion and 
     <lb/>
     in the remarks of Mr. Higgins and Mr. Job. I said, 
     <lb/>
     sir, when you took the Chair, that I regard you as 
     <lb/>
     one of our country's most brilliant sons, a bril<lb break="no"/>liant lawyer, a prodigious worker, and frankly, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I am full of admiration for the way in which 
     <lb/>
     you took hold of this job and mastered it, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that all your training for the last 12 or 
     <lb/>
     15 years was in a place and at work which is so 
     <lb/>
     very different from the work you had to take on 
     <lb/>
     when you became Chairman of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     I refer of course to your work and training in the 
     <lb/>
     courts, where they have a tradition and a proce<lb break="no"/>dure running back for a thousand years, and to 
     <lb/>
     take on work with a very different tradition, and 
     <lb/>
     in many respects very different procedure, that is 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary work, without having had the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of having been a former Speaker of a 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly, was a very great challenge 
     <lb/>
     to the ability and adaptability of any man, and I 
     <lb/>
     am full of admiration. Sir, I think now I would be

     the last man to challenge you on any point of 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary procedure, any point of parliamen<lb break="no"/>tary practice; and I think that in the three or four 
     <lb/>
     months you have been here you have mastered 
     <lb/>
     that as you had already mastered the intricacies 
     <lb/>
     and subtitles of court procedure, tradition and 
     <lb/>
     practice. I love a worker. You are a prodigious 
     <lb/>
     worker, and you have shown here how skillful 
     <lb/>
     you are, and how you can adapt yourself to a new 
     <lb/>
     situation, entirely new. They say, sir, that the real 
     <lb/>
     test of intelligence is the ability of a man to meet 
     <lb/>
     and cope witlt a new situation, and you met and 
     <lb/>
     coped with what for you was a new situation, to 
     <lb/>
     preside over a gang like this — Major Cashin and 
     <lb/>
     myself, and Mr. Hollett here behind me, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fudge. Why, sir, someone who could come in and 
     <lb/>
     keep us from each other's throats for the past 
     <lb/>
     three months should get a gold medal, and I agree 
     <lb/>
     that you have done that. You have been complete<lb break="no"/>ly impartial and fair to everyone in the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and I just want to go on record to that effect. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like very 
     <lb/>much to associate myself with this motion that 
     <lb/>has been proposed by Mr. Higgins, and seconded 
     <lb/>by the "father of this House". That, sir, is an 
     <lb/>honour to you, to have such a motion seconded 
     <lb/>by a man with the reputation and characteristics 
     <lb/>of the Hon. R. B. Job. Now as Mr. Smallwood has 
     <lb/>claimed first place with regard to the many an<lb break="no"/>noyances that have been caused you in your 
     <lb/>onerous position, I think I could claim second 
     <lb/>place at any rate. I like the wording of the motion. 
     <lb/>Mr. Higgins mentioned the "able and courteous 
     <lb/>manner in which you have performed your 
     <lb/>duties". He also mentioned the word "impartial", 
     <lb/>and that to my mind has been the reason why you 
     <lb/>have been so successful in finishing up the work 
     <lb/>which was passed over to you. If I were to go on 
     <lb/>oath today, sir, and be asked what your particular 
     <lb/>political leanings were, I would have to answer 
     <lb/>frankly and truthfully, "I do not know", and for 
     <lb/>any man in this present day in Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>be able to cover up so well as you have done in 
     <lb/>this particular position is a recommendation 
     <lb/>which will go down with you to your dying day. 
     <lb/>I do most heartily agree with the mover and 
     <lb/>seconder, and with the expression made by my 
     <lb/>friend Mr. Smallwood, and I sincerely hope, sir, 
     <lb/>that the work of this Convention, in the end, will 
     <lb/>justify our having such a fair, courteous and 
     <lb/>impartial Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> It must be a grand feeling to hear 
     <lb/>
     such words of praise about oneself while you are 
     <lb/>
     still living. Now I can only just in a very brief way 
     <lb/>
     add my own support to the resolution, and those 
     <lb/>
     to follow as well. I know that many times we have 
     <lb/>
     felt like jumping right after each other's throats. 
     <lb/>
     I never felt more like it in my life than Wednesday 
     <lb/>
     night, but I decided that discretion was the better 
     <lb/>
     part of valour, but I have had nothing but admira<lb break="no"/>tion for you, even when you tried to chastise a 
     <lb/>
     recalcitrant member. I wish to associate myself 
     <lb/>
     with the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> I don't propose to carry on this 
     <lb/>
     debate very long. The previous speakers have 
     <lb/>
     already expressed the feeling very well, but most 
     <lb/>
     of them are older than me, and, on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     younger members, I would like to associate 
     <lb/>
     myself with this motion and with the others on 
     <lb/>
     the line.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In expressing to you my deep 
     <lb/>
     appreciation and sincere thanks for all your kind<lb break="no"/>ness to me, particularly here this evening I want 
     <lb/>
     to express my gratitude and thanks, which 
     <lb/>
     began with my induction during an afternoon in 
     <lb/>
     October last. Now at that time, ifI recall correct<lb break="no"/>ly, I made two statements, one of which was that 
     <lb/>
     the extent to which I would be successful in the 
     <lb/>
     proper discharge of my duties would in the last 
     <lb/>
     analysis depend on the sympathy and co-opera<lb break="no"/>tion which I received from the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House. Therefore, if I have had any success in the 
     <lb/>
     proper discharge of my duties, it has only been 
     <lb/>
     made possible by the kindness and sympathy and 
     <lb/>
     co-operation to which I referred, so that the credit 
     <lb/>
     for my success must inevitably fall upon your 
     <lb/>
     shoulders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At that time I also stated that I made no 
     <lb/>
     pretence to infallibility. I am quite sure that you 
     <lb/>
     had ample and adequate illustration of that during 
     <lb/>
     the time that has intervened since I first began; 
     <lb/>
     but the thing I like to think about most, and for 
     <lb/>
     which I perhaps may be most proud, is the fact 
     <lb/>
     that while undoubtedly on occasions in the stress 
     <lb/>
     and heat of the moment, when I was called upon 
     <lb/>
     to make rulings, I ruled erroneously, I think the 
     <lb/>
     greatest kindness and courtesy, and the greatest 
     <lb/>
     compliment that has been paid me, is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     there has not been a single appeal from any ruling 
     <lb/>
     that I made against any member of the House 
     <lb/>
     since I accepted the chairmanship of the National

     Convention. That is something that I must con<lb break="no"/>tinue for the rest of my days to regard with great 
     <lb/>
     gratitude.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As the impartial Chairman of this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     I am not a member; I came here under a royal 
     <lb/>
     commission, and have been working with you 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen for going on four months. We have 
     <lb/>
     had our troubles, and perhaps made our mistakes 
     <lb/>
     and had our shortcomings, nor did we ever make 
     <lb/>
     a pretence to being an assembly of wise men. No 
     <lb/>
     properly elected assembly ever is or ever has 
     <lb/>
     been in the history of the world, but I want to say 
     <lb/>
     this: we have been criticised outside, and quite 
     <lb/>
     properly so. Any man who offers himself for 
     <lb/>
     public office must be prepared to accept 
     <lb/>
     criticism, but I do feel that the criticism directed 
     <lb/>
     at times towards the work of this Convention has 
     <lb/>
     not been fair. For if I have any powers of percep<lb break="no"/>tion, and if I am capable of evaluating man and 
     <lb/>
     his handiwork, then I want to lay down that in my 
     <lb/>
     judgement the work of this Convention must 
     <lb/>
     inevitably prove to be of an inestimable value to 
     <lb/>
     the country, not only now but in the future. It is 
     <lb/>
     a very easy thing to tell a man to do something, 
     <lb/>
     an entirely different thing to go and do it yourself. 
     <lb/>
     And I am not satisfied that the criticism at times 
     <lb/>
     directed towards this Convention was fair, for the 
     <lb/>
     reason that many of these critics did not take the 
     <lb/>
     time to qualify themselves by experience to as<lb break="no"/>sume the status of critics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would say ... that the work done by the 
     <lb/>
     committees particularly, and the Convention 
     <lb/>
     generally, was of a tremendous nature, to say the 
     <lb/>
     least. How could any man in his right mind, and 
     <lb/>
     with a proper sense of proportion, view all the 
     <lb/>
     reports which have been compiled by the com<lb break="no"/>mittees, the co-ordination of these reports, and 
     <lb/>
     eventually the recommendations which we are 
     <lb/>
     now about to make, and say that nothing has been 
     <lb/>
     accomplished?.... If this Convention did nothing 
     <lb/>
     other than to provoke this country out of the Rip 
     <lb/>
     Van Winkle sleep into which it had sunk for 14 
     <lb/>
     years, and had produced and created, as it has, 
     <lb/>
     political consciousness in the minds of our 
     <lb/>
     people, then I am prepared to reaffirm that from 
     <lb/>
     this standpoint alone, the members of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention have quite definitely justified their use<lb break="no"/>fulness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Eighteen months ago the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people that I met had no idea what form of 
     <lb/>
     government they intended to support. They were 
  

            <cb/>
        

     not interested in talking about forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Today you have in this country three 
     <lb/>
     schools of thought. That is to say, three forms of 
     <lb/>
     government are being discussed, their merits and 
     <lb/>
     demerits, by all sections of the people. And I 
     <lb/>
     would say this, that if Major Cashin has provoked 
     <lb/>
     people into a realisation of the merits of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, and others into deciding 
     <lb/>
     against responsible government, then Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin and his associates in this House have 
     <lb/>
     performed a most invaluable function, because 
     <lb/>
     they have made up the minds of these people as 
     <lb/>
     to what they desire in future forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The same goes for Mr. Smallwood. If the 
     <lb/>
     country ever gets the chance to decide for or 
     <lb/>
     against confederation, I think all fair-minded 
     <lb/>
     men must agree that the prodigious and untiring 
     <lb/>
     efforts of Mr. Smallwood have made that pos<lb break="no"/>sible. I could go on with further and repeated 
     <lb/>
     illustrations, but I do not want to unnecessarily 
     <lb/>
     trespass upon the time and patience of members, 
     <lb/>
     but I do feel duty bound to state at this time, as I 
     <lb/>
     propose to state publicly outside this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     that in my considered judgement I think this 
     <lb/>
     country is irreparably indebted to this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and the members. At times it was trying; but 
     <lb/>
     the fact that it was trying is proof paramount of 
     <lb/>
     the sincerity with which the members of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention discharged their duties. Had they 
     <lb/>
     been lackadaisical and indifferent about the wel<lb break="no"/>fare of the country, then there would have been 
     <lb/>
     no sharp exchanges because nobody would be 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently excited about the business to get 
     <lb/>
     angry over it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore, before taking leave of you, I feel 
     <lb/>
     duty bound to repeat whatI have already repeated 
     <lb/>
     — that is that in my considered judgement, and I 
     <lb/>
     would say there is no man better in a position in 
     <lb/>
     this country today to evaluate your work than I 
     <lb/>
     am, because I was here scrutinizing it night and 
     <lb/>
     day for some four months — I make this state<lb break="no"/>ment again and I defy any successful contradic<lb break="no"/>tion from any source whatsoever, that this 
     <lb/>
     country is irrevocably indebted to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion and to all the members of the Convention. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore having been permitted to associate 
     <lb/>
     myself with the highly successful discharge of 
     <lb/>
     your duties, it must inevitably prove to be a 
     <lb/>
     source of great satisfaction to me in the days that 
     <lb/>
     are to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In expressing again my deep appreciation and

     thanks to you for your kind sympathy and co<lb break="no"/>operation, I would like to express to Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>
     K.C., the mover of this motion and to the father 
     <lb/>
     of the house, Hon. Mr. Job, my particular ap<lb break="no"/>preciation and thanks for all their kindness. It is 
     <lb/>
     rather significant that it was the Hon. Mr. Job who 
     <lb/>
     assisted me into the Chair on the afternoon of my 
     <lb/>
     induction, by virtue of the fact that he seconded 
     <lb/>
     the motion that I take the Chair at this particular 
     <lb/>
     time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again I say that if I have been unfair, I can 
     <lb/>
     assure you it was quite unintentionally and un<lb break="no"/>consciously done. After all, we can take consola<lb break="no"/>tion from the fact that the man who makes no 
     <lb/>
     mistakes, does no work. And if we have made 
     <lb/>
     many mistakes here, it was because we did much 
     <lb/>
     work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, I should direct the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     country to the irreparable debt of gratitude it 
     <lb/>
     owes to members of this Convention, and say that 
     <lb/>
     after tomorrow ... I will have considerable to say 
     <lb/>
     about the work of this Convention and its mem<lb break="no"/>bers. I can give members my assurance right now 
     <lb/>
     that it will be of a highly complimentary nature. 
     <lb/>
     Thank you very much, gentlemen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I beg to move the following resolu<lb break="no"/>tion:

     members, particularly in the collection of 
     <lb/>
     material for reports, obtaining answers to the 
     <lb/>
     many questions submitted to them, and I suppose 
     <lb/>
     most of all for the meticulous manner in which

     they have kept all the minutes of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     That pretty well expresses the general work of

     Be it resolved that the members of this

     It is unnecessary to remind members of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention of the great assistance rendered at all 
     <lb/>
     times by our secretarial staff, and the tremendous 
     <lb/>
     amount of work which the various reports en<lb break="no"/>tailed; also the wonderful job we have had from 
     <lb/>
     our official reporters here, and the splendid job 
     <lb/>
     done by the assistants to the Secretary and Assis<lb break="no"/>tant Secretary in the office, and in general the 
     <lb/>
     great willingness displayed by all these ladies and 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in assisting us in our work here. Not 
     <lb/>
     only have they been willing to work at odd hours, 
     <lb/>
     and at times when they must have been extremely 
     <lb/>
     tired, but they have done it in such a capable 
     <lb/>
     manner, and always in such a courteous manner. 
     <lb/>
     For these reasons I have very great pleasure in 
     <lb/>
     moving the motion.

     mous opinion of every member present that our

     staff has been a very courteous one at all times. 
     <lb/>
     Whenever we approached them to get anything

     typed or re-typed, we always found them ready, 
     <lb/>
     and they were always willing to stay overtime if

     That the National Convention convey its

     sense of warm gratitude to the Broadcasting

     <lb/>
     public service in broadcasting the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of the Convention, and to the press of the

     It is perhaps the only time in the history of any 
     <lb/>
     country that the actual speeches of a delegate 
     <lb/>
     assembly were broadcast to the public over a 
     <lb/>
     period of time. I believe, in Australia, the Broad<lb break="no"/>casting Corporation of Australia did once or 
     <lb/>
     twice broadcast some — one day or part of a day 
     <lb/>
     of the House of Commons of the Commonwealth 
     <lb/>
     of Australia I think also on one or two occasions 
     <lb/>
     in other countries, they have broadcast part of the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings of such an assembly. We have, on 
     <lb/>
     occasion, heard the broadcast of the President of 
     <lb/>
     the United States when he addressed the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of Congress. I know of no other case 
     <lb/>
     anywhere, at any time, where all the proceedings, 
     <lb/>
     all the speeches, all the remarks, all the public 
     <lb/>
     business of such a body has been broadcast to the 
     <lb/>
     public, as the Broadcasting Corporation has done 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention. That, to my mind, is one of 
     <lb/>
     the finest pieces of public service ever performed 
     <lb/>
     in this country by anyone, by any organisation; 
     <lb/>
     because if this Convention of itself has been of 
     <lb/>
     any real value in Newfoundland, as someone 
     <lb/>
     remarked a few months ago, it was along the lines 
     <lb/>
     of interesting our Newfoundland people in their 
     <lb/>
     public affairs. But what chance would there have 
     <lb/>
     been really to have interested Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     in their public affairs through this Convention if 
     <lb/>
     the speeches of the Convention had not actually 
     <lb/>
     been broadcast? I have been attending these 
     <lb/>
     meetings since the Convention opened. I did not 
     <lb/>
     miss a meeting until the other night, when I had 
     <lb/>
     to be absent for a night session. I have sat here 


            <cb/>
  

     throughout the entire period, except when I stood 
     <lb/>
     over behind that door for a smoke, and apart from 
     <lb/>
     that I never left the chamber and I heard every 
     <lb/>
     word spoken by everyone. On top of that, I lis<lb break="no"/>tened also to the broadcasts. I sat through it all 
     <lb/>
     the afternoon, did not miss one word spoken by 
     <lb/>
     one member, and then went home at 9.15 or 9.30, 
     <lb/>
     turned on the radio and listened to the broadcast 
     <lb/>
     from the first word to the last word, whether 
     <lb/>
     11.30 or 12.30, for a very particular purpose. I 
     <lb/>
     had something special in mind in doing that. 
     <lb/>
     Sitting here, I heard it as we all heard it; but sitting 
     <lb/>
     home listening to the radio I heard the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion just as the public heard it. That is the way I 
     <lb/>
     want to hear it. I sat listening to speech after 
     <lb/>
     speech, trying to figure in my own mind just how 
     <lb/>
     interesting were these speeches to the man in Joe 
     <lb/>
     Batt's Arm, the man on the Grand Banks, the man 
     <lb/>
     in Deer Lake, in Bonne Bay, in Bonavista and 
     <lb/>
     Gander — trying to figure, well now, will he 
     <lb/>
     listen? Will he wait to hear the next chap? Trying 
     <lb/>
     all the time to estimate how it was taking with the 
     <lb/>
     public of Newfoundland. It is no secret that the 
     <lb/>
     only thing I have been concerned with is the 
     <lb/>
     public of Newfoundland. I never made any secret 
     <lb/>
     of that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Broadcasting Corporation has performed 
     <lb/>
     a service of very great public value to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. If the Convention has succeeded in 
     <lb/>
     arousing public interest, we have to thank the 
     <lb/>
     Broadcasting Corporation. The Broadcasting 
     <lb/>
     Corporation is run by a Board of Governors, and 
     <lb/>
     I am grateful to them for their decision to serve 
     <lb/>
     the public by their broadcasting. I am not think<lb break="no"/>ing merely of the Corporation, but the men who 
     <lb/>
     are the Corporation — the General Manager, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     William F. Galgay; Chief Accountant and Busi<lb break="no"/>ness Manager, Mr. Gordon Halley; Chief 
     <lb/>
     Operator, Mr. A. M. (Bert) House, who is <hi rendition="simple:italic">almost</hi> 
     <lb/>
     a member of the Convention. I am going to reveal 
     <lb/>
     a secret. The desk next to Mr. Burry has been 
     <lb/>
     occupied on more than one occasion by Aubrey 
     <lb/>
     MacDonald. Mr. MacDonald sat there with a 
     <lb/>
     card on his desk like we have. At first I wondered 
     <lb/>
     what was on the card, and when I saw it, it was 
     <lb/>
     marked "Mr. MacDonald, Funk Islands". 
     <lb/>
     Nobody noticed it. Nobody said a word about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the Broadcasting Corporation has done 
     <lb/>
     great public service, it is because the Corporation 
     <lb/>
     is served by a magnificent staff of New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders ... including Richard (Dick) O'<lb break="no"/>

     Brien, and Cecil Penney. This Convention — 
     <lb/>
     most of us — have no idea of the work that these 
     <lb/>
     men have to do. They have been here all hours of 
     <lb/>
     the day, until 5.30 the other morning, also some<lb break="no"/>one in the studio taking it all down on the records. 
     <lb/>
     I hope the Broadcasting Corporation will not 
     <lb/>
     forget to remember the staff when the bonuses are 
     <lb/>
     being passed around. I hope they will remember 
     <lb/>
     the work of the staff. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to say a special word for the Doyle 
     <lb/>
     News Bulletin.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> I am not thinking only of their 
     <lb/>
     impartiality, of their fairness in giving a square 
     <lb/>
     deal to every speaker; not only am I thinking of 
     <lb/>
     their accuracy. A man gets up here and talks for 
     <lb/>
     three-quarters of an hour. A man sits in that press 
     <lb/>
     box, and sums up quickly and accurately what 
     <lb/>
     that man says and compresses it into three or four 
     <lb/>
     minutes; that is a high-class job that calls for real 
     <lb/>
     skill. The Convention rises at six o'clock and they 
     <lb/>
     come on the air at quarter to eight, and give a 
     <lb/>
     compressed, square account of the proceedings. 
     <lb/>
     It is a fine piece of work, and in that work Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Michael Mulcahy is beyond comparison — one 
     <lb/>
     of the finest newspaper reporters or radio 
     <lb/>
     reporters this country has ever had. That man 
     <lb/>
     worked until he collapsed, simply collapsed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I also want to say a word of admiration for the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi>. I read every newspaper in the 
     <lb/>
     country — I read everything. I read the reports of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi>, and for 
     <lb/>
     their impartiality I have a great respect and I pay 
     <lb/>
     them tribute for their fair reports. I also pay 
     <lb/>
     tribute to the rest of the press in the country, and 
     <lb/>
     for that matter, all radio broadcasting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is the last that Newfoundland will hear of 
     <lb/>
     me through this Convention. I want to explain for 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the gentleman in Bonavista Bay or 
     <lb/>
     Placentia Bay — a gentleman who remarked to 
     <lb/>
     someone who was passing through that settle<lb break="no"/>ment that he listened to that man Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     thought he was a good man, but one thing he 
     <lb/>
     could not understand was why Smallwood was 
     <lb/>
     always getting up and asking for "a pint of 
     <lb/>
     water". It is not "a pint of water". I am not thirsty. 
     <lb/>
     It is "a point of order". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to say to all the members with whom I 
     <lb/>
     have been cross or angry at one time or another, 
     <lb/>
     that it was in the heat of debate, in the heat and 
 

            <cb/>
      

     fire of debate. If they have been cross with me, 
     <lb/>
     they are thoroughly forgiven, and I hope they will 
     <lb/>
     forgive me, and I wish them — all of you — the 
     <lb/>
     very best in the world. Everyone here knows the 
     <lb/>
     best form of government. I hope we will get our 
     <lb/>
     heart's desire. But whatever turns out, we will all 
     <lb/>
     be great friends. Some of us will be back next 
     <lb/>
     year — most of us, I hope, please God, with the 
     <lb/>
     leave and sanction of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I move that resolution that we express our 
     <lb/>
    gratitude to the Broadcasting Corporation and to 
     <lb/>the press of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I suppose this is the first time I

     <lb/>have. Particularly do I owe them a lot for what 
     <lb/>they did on March 2, 1947.<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> I want to add my

     <lb/>they were here recording all that time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I also want to voice my appreciation of the fine

     work done by the Doyle Bulletin and in particular 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Mulcahy, who was a reporter in this House 
     <lb/>
     40 years ago, and today he is able to do the job as 
     <lb/>
     well as 40 years ago. With regard to the others — 
     <lb/>
     newspapers and VOCM — I also think they have 
     <lb/>
     done a good job. They have done the best they 
     <lb/>
     know how. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not my intention to make any lengthy

     address; but before I withdraw, I want to again 
     <lb/>
     voice my special appreciation to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Broadcasting Corporation for all they 
     <lb/>
     did for me on March 2, 1947.

     measured in material costs. For the long hours 
     <lb/>
     those officials had to remain on duty, I presume 
     <lb/>
     they will be fully compensated. For the press and 
     <lb/>
     the Gerald S. Doyle News Bulletin I also add my 
     <lb/>
     praise.

     <lb/>
     themselves as elected representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland the changes that 
     <lb/>
     have taken place in the financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic situation of the Island since 1934, 
     <lb/>
     and, bearing in mind the extent to which the 
     <lb/>
     high revenues of recent years have been due 
     <lb/>
     to wartime conditions, to examine the posi-
