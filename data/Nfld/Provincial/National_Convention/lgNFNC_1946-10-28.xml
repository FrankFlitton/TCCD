<!--<p>
     Mr. Job I move that this report be adopted. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. MacDonald Does it mean that these re- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Commendations will be carried out? If it does, I 
     <lb/>hope that we are going to deal with the United 
     <lb/>States on reduction of tariffs, they will also con<lb break="no"/>sider other industries, such as paper, etc. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Pulp and paper have free entry into 
     <lb/>
     the United States. The Americans do not manu<lb break="no"/>facture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett What is meant by "adopting the 
     <lb/>
     report". There are several points to be brought up. 
     <lb/>
     If we adopt the report, what follows? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The Convention resolved itself 
     <lb/>
     into a committee of the whole to consider the 
     <lb/>
     report. Before that happened the report had to be 
     <lb/>
     read. Now the duty of the committee is to con<lb break="no"/>sider the report and having considered it, to rise 
     <lb/>
     and recommend that it be adopted by the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. After the committee rises that will be done. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hillier I move that we adjourn the debate 
     <lb/>until Monday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman There is a motion before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair that the report be adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Job I do not want to press mat if the Con<lb break="no"/>vention thinks it should be further debated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman There is a motion before the 
     <lb/>
     Chair that we rise and resume at 8 o'clock. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Before I can vote for the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of this report, I want to know why requests are 
     <lb/>
     made for action to be taken to get tariff conces<lb break="no"/>sions from the United States? I want to know 
     <lb/>
     why. Is it that the fresh fish industry cannot carry 
     <lb/>
     on longer at the present rates? If that is so, I would 
     <lb/>
     say adopt the report. But surely it must have some 
     <lb/>
     facts and figures to show that the fresh fish in<lb break="no"/>dustry is in danger of extinction by reason of 
     <lb/>
     tariffs placed on it by the United States. They 
     <lb/>
     must bring figures to show that. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     Canada, who has hitherto blocked our efforts, is 
     <lb/>
     anxious to help, the United States is anxious to 
     <lb/>
     help, other countries are anxious to help, but 
     <lb/>
     these things have to be debated before I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to adopt this report. I am not in favour 
     <lb/>
     of the motion to adopt the report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     <lb/>
     progress. The Convention adjourned]

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Gentlemen, I feel sure that I 
     <lb/>
     echo your thoughts when I say how pleased we 
     <lb/>
     are to have Mr. K.M. Brown back again and we 
     <lb/>
     hope his condition has improved, permanently 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     so; and that Mr. Fudge is back with us again. I 
     <lb/>
     have to report that Mr. Figary will not be able to 
     <lb/>
     attend.... 
     <lb/>

     Interim Report of the Fisheries Committee: 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Job I have been acting chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Committee during the absence of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown. He has now returned, and as there have 
     <lb/>
     been various comment on this report, I move that 
     <lb/>
     it be referred back to the Fisheries Committee for 
     <lb/>
     further consideration. I ask therefore that the 
     <lb/>
     committee rise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The committee rose and reported progress] 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Chairman This completes the orders of the 
     <lb/>day. I have to inform you that Mr. Hollett and Mr. 
     <lb/>Newell on behalf of the Education Committee 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     informed me this afternoon that the work of the 
     <lb/>
     committee is completed and that presently its 
     <lb/>
     report will be printed and placed before the Steer<lb break="no"/>ing Committee, and will come with the least 
     <lb/>
     possible delay before the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Is there any other matter you wish to discuss? 
     <lb/>
     If not, I will accept a motion to adjourn until such 
     <lb/>
     time as the Steering Committee is in a position to 
     <lb/>
     tell us when we may meet.

                  <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen of <lb/> the National
                  Convention, I should like to draw <lb/> your attention to the copy of the report
                  on educa<lb break="no"/>tion which you will find on your desks this after<lb break="no"/>noon. I might say that this report has been ready <lb/> for some
                  considerable time but it was held up <lb/> because it was believed it would be
                  wiser to await <lb/> other reports which were nearing completion <lb/> before we
                  introduced the one on education, with <lb/> the hope that the public sessions of
                  the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion might be enabled to continue. I might say that
                  <lb/> we experienced some little difficulty at the outset <lb/> in making up our
                  minds as to the proper approach <lb/> of the committee on this question of
                  education; <lb/> the conception of education, as we all know, is <lb/> changing
                  from era to era and it is different in all <lb/> parts of the world. We realised
                  that education <lb/> insofar as this country is concerned, is something <lb/> the
                  form of which is familiar to the whole of our <lb/> people. Why then probe into
                  the merits or <lb/> demerits of the system of education? We felt <lb/> therefore
                  that it would be futile for us to raise that <lb/> point in our report. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Read first page of report]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We felt that we were approaching it in a right 
     <lb/>
     and proper sense. Even on our committee of ten 
     <lb/>
     men, there were various shades of opinion as to 
     <lb/>
     our present educational system. How useless 
     <lb/>
     would it therefore be to start this enquiry by 
     <lb/>
     introducing something which was already con<lb break="no"/>tentious. We feel that a system of education can 
     <lb/>
     only be introduced into any country when you 
     <lb/>
     have the majority of people favouring that sys<lb break="no"/>tem.

            <p>
     We discovered in one place where there were 
     <lb/>
     two-room schools that there were 71 pupils in one 
     <lb/>
     of these schools; one denominational body, when 
     <lb/>
     its numbers reached 21, wanted its own school; 
     <lb/>
     it got the school, thereby reducing it to a one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     room school with one teacher. If one particular 
     <lb/>
     denomination can take its pupils away from a 
     <lb/>
     school where there are two qualified teachers and 
     <lb/>
     can reduce it to a one-room school, that is not a 
     <lb/>
     move in the right direction.

            <p>
     We have in our midst today people who 
     <lb/>
     criticise the amount of money paid teachers under 
     <lb/>
     salaries. Only recently I heard it said that they 
     <lb/>
     were not worth the money they were getting, I 
     <lb/>
     recently met two teachers, one of them a male, 
     <lb/>
     and he told me he receives $55 per month salary 
     <lb/>
     and for board in St. John's he pays $47. The other 
     <lb/>
     receives a salary of $50 and pays $45 for board.

            <p>
     And then we come to paragraph 11, the con<lb break="no"/>clusion, and it is here we expect to get criticism, 
     <lb/>
     and we welcome criticism.

     This is the report, Mr. Chairman and gentle<lb break="no"/>men, which we place before you, and to which 
     <lb/>
     we would like you to give your attention in the 
     <lb/>
     next 24 hours. There are points which you are 
     <lb/>
     bound to bring out which we have not touched. 
     <lb/>
     That is correct and as it should be. We could have 
     <lb/>
     gone back into the history of education, gone 
     <lb/>
     back to the Chinese and Greek and Latin con<lb break="no"/>cepts, but we figured it out that it would do very 
     <lb/>
     little to enhance the cause of education in this 
     <lb/>
     country. We do feel that the economic and finan<lb break="no"/>cial standard of any country is in very great

                  <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have great pleasure <lb/> in rising
                  to move that the Forestry Report as <lb/> tabled be received by the' Convention.
                  Our com<lb break="no"/>mittee has been meeting continuously three times <lb/>
                  weekly since appointed some four weeks ago, <lb/> and have been able to get
                  together some most <lb/> interesting and valuable information relative to <lb/>
                  the forest industries of the island of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and its
                  possession, Labrador. All mat<lb break="no"/>ters referred to in the report, which
                  is covered <lb/> under several headings, have received the closest <lb/> attention
                  of every member of the Committee and <lb/> I am glad to be able to inform the
                  Convention that <lb/> our findings are definitely unanimous. I regret <lb/>
                  however, that owing to our friend Mr. K.M. <lb/> Brown having been ill, he was
                  unable to attend <lb/> all meetings. I want to take this opportunity of <lb/>
                  paying special tribute to Messrs. MacDonald, <lb/> Vincent, Dawe and Cashin, who
                  were the sub<lb break="no"/>committee appointed to draft this report, and who
                  <lb/> have been instrumental in making the report of <lb/> such general interest.
                  I would now request Major <lb/> Cashin to give a review of the entire report for
                  <lb/> the further enlightenment of the delegates... <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, having been <lb/> delegated by the
                  members of the Forestry Com<lb break="no"/>mittee to further explain this report,
                  I feel that it <lb/> will not be thought out of place if I make a few <lb/> brief
                  comments on its contents. I do this, so that <lb/> those delegates who are not
                  members of this <lb/> particular committee may understand the back<lb break="no"/>ground of our work and the objects which we had <lb/> before us in compiling the
                  report. As you will <lb/> have noted, the various phases of the report cover <lb/>
                  a wide range, including pulp and paper industries <lb/> both at Comer Brook and
                  Grand Falls, the pit- <lb break="yes"/> prop industry both in Newfoundland and
                  <lb/> Labrador, the saw mill industry, reafforestation, <lb/> etc. Our studies,
                  which have extended over a <lb/> period of several weeks have included a detailed <lb/>
                  <cb/>
                  
examination of all
                  available facts and statistics, <lb/> and in addition we have availed of the
                  knowledge <lb/> and experience of those members of our commit<lb break="no"/>tee
                  who are particularly qualified to discuss mat<lb break="no"/>ters relating to our
                  forest industries. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     As intimated in our report, we regret that we 
     <lb/>
     did not get all the information which we required 
     <lb/>
     from government sources, and in particular I 
     <lb/>
     refer to my request for the annual financial state<lb break="no"/>ment of Bowaters.<ref target="#fn_01">[2]</ref> The government have also 
     <lb/>
     been unable to furnish us with any survey of 
     <lb/>
     standing timber on the Labrador. But, in all, we 
     <lb/>
     believe that we have managed to include in our 
     <lb/>
     report all pertinent facts and figures necessary for 
     <lb/>
     the making of a fairly accurate estimate of the 
     <lb/>
     present and future prospects of the forestry 
     <lb/>
     resources of our country. In some cases, as you 
     <lb/>
     will notice, we have deemed it advisable to fur<lb break="no"/>nish some historical background. We have 
     <lb/>
     thought this necessary, in order that the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion may more clearly understand just how things 
     <lb/>
     are with us today. I might say, and I feel that I 
     <lb/>
     speak on behalf of the members of our commit<lb break="no"/>tee, that irrespective of our individual political 
     <lb/>
     leanings, we have always kept in mind the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of our being as objectively factual and as 
     <lb/>
     impartial as possible. No attempt has been made 
     <lb/>
     to distort circumstances or exaggerate figures, 
     <lb/>
     and we have only criticised where we conscien<lb break="no"/>tiously felt that such criticism was fully justified 
     <lb/>
     and was in the best interest of the country.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The introductory section gives a general 
     <lb/>
     synopsis of the available and existing timber 
     <lb/>
     resources of our country, the amount of timber<lb break="no"/>land under lease and the principal operators. It 
     <lb/>
     will be noted that by far the greater portion of our 
     <lb/>
     timberlands has been acquired by the two pulp 
     <lb/>
     and paper companies. Whether it was beneficial 
     <lb/>
     or otherwise to have given these two corporations 
     <lb/>
     such a virtual monopoly of our forest wealth, may 
     <lb/>
     be regarded by some as debatable. But certain it 
     <lb/>
     is that we cannot do much about it just now, and

     we must accept the position as we find it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The birth of the pulp and paper industry in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was when the government of the 
     <lb/>
     day under the premiership of Sir Robert Bond 
     <lb/>
     opened negotiations with the Harmsworth inter<lb break="no"/>ests of London, England, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     developing the timber areas in the Exploits Val<lb break="no"/>ley.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> From an original capacity of 200 tons per 
     <lb/>
     day, the intervening years have seen this industry 
     <lb/>
     increased to around 500 tons daily, and I have 
     <lb/>
     been reliably informed that this same company<ref target="#fn_03">[2]</ref>
     <lb/>
     has under consideration the further expansion of 
     <lb/>
     their operations, with the object of further in<lb break="no"/>creasing their production to 700 tons daily. This 
     <lb/>
     envisages a proposition which will distribute 
     <lb/>
     some $8 million dollars in earnings to our people 
     <lb/>
     annually. And so, in looking to the future of our 
     <lb/>
     country we see that we have in this Grand Falls 
     <lb/>
     project a reasonably sure and permanent asset, 
     <lb/>
     which will give the means of a decent livelihood 
     <lb/>
     to thousands of our people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We now come to the other great industrial 
     <lb/>
     development at Corner Brook. This did not start 
     <lb/>
     until nearly 20 years later, and the details of this 
     <lb/>
     undertaking have been adequately outlined in the 
     <lb/>
     report. When the present expansion plans of this 
     <lb/>
     company are completed, it is estimated that the 
     <lb/>
     total annual earnings of Bowater employees will 
     <lb/>
     be in the vicinity of $11 million. We see, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that in these two enterprises alone, New~ 
     <lb/>
     foundland can look to a total annual earning of 
     <lb/>
     around $18 million. This does not include profits 
     <lb/>
     tax paid the government by both companies. It is 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, therefore, that such a source of in<lb break="no"/>come can be regarded as a permanent plank in the 
     <lb/>
     future economic security of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I now come to another matter which has never 
     <lb/>
     been, as far as I am aware, fully explained to the 
     <lb/>
     people since it first became a live issue some 
     <lb/>
     seven or eight years ago. 1 refer to what we know 
     <lb/>
     as the "Gander deal." This matter has been 
     <lb/>
     referred to briefly in the report itself. But, in order 
     <lb/>
     that the Convention may be in a position to 
     <lb/>
     properly appreciate it, I think it advisable to give 
     <lb/>
     you something of the background. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It begins in the year 1927, when the Interna<lb break="no"/>tional Power and Paper Company acquired the 
     <lb/>
     Corner Brook project from the financially sick 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
    
   
           
          
     Newfoundland Power and Paper Co. Limited. At 
     <lb/>
     that time, the International Company was also 
     <lb/>
     interested in developing the Gander areas. As a 
     <lb/>
     result legislation was passed granting certain 
     <lb/>
     concessions to a corporation promoted by the 
     <lb/>
     Reid Newfoundland Company. This corporation 
     <lb/>
     was called the Gander Valley Power and Paper 
     <lb/>
     Co. Ltd., and the property was reputed to contain 
     <lb/>
     some 8 million cords of commercial timber. After 
     <lb/>
     an inspection and survey of the property and 
     <lb/>
     water powers, however, the International Com<lb break="no"/>pany felt that it would not be a sound economic 
     <lb/>
     proposition to develop another pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     mill at Gander. They were definitely interested, 
     <lb/>
     however, in acquiring the properties and incor<lb break="no"/>porating them with the Comer Brook enterprise. 
     <lb/>
     The Reids were of the opinion that the promotion 
     <lb/>
     of another mill was a sound proposition and 
     <lb/>
     continued their efforts to interest other capital. 
     <lb/>
     Finally they succeeded in interesting the Hearst 
     <lb/>
     interests in the construction of a 1,000 ton mill on 
     <lb/>
     the Gander, and approached the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government to guarantee the project to the extent 
     <lb/>
     of $20 million. In addition, they wanted to ac<lb break="no"/>quire further timber limits on the Labrador, as 
     <lb/>
     there was not sufficient wood on the Gander areas 
     <lb/>
     to feed such a mill as was proposed. This was in 
     <lb/>
     1930. I was Minister of Finance at that time, and 
     <lb/>
     together with the late Prime Minister Squires and 
     <lb/>
     the late Sir William Coaker, had several con<lb break="no"/>ferences with the Hearst representatives and the 
     <lb/>
     Reids in New York and Montreal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At that time the pulp and paper industry 
     <lb/>
     throughout Canada and the United States was 
     <lb/>
     beginning to experience reverses brought about 
     <lb/>
     by over-production. I want to point out that the 
     <lb/>
     Hearst interests were the largest consumers of

     newsprint in the world, their publications requir<lb break="no"/>ing some 600,000 tons annually. It is my firm 
     <lb/>
     conviction that Hearst had no sincere intention of 
     <lb/>
     building a paper mill, but was merely bluffing in 
     <lb/>
     order to drive down the price of newsprint fur<lb break="no"/>ther. In addition they were indebted to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian newsprint producers for an amount of 
     <lb/>
     around $8-10 million, and incidentally, it has 
     <lb/>
     only been during the last couple of years that this 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness has been liquidated. The Interna<lb break="no"/>tional Company, at this time, was still interested

     in acquiring the Gander areas for Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     and were prepared to expand that mill if the Reids 
     <lb/>
     would sell the properties. I was informed by one 
     <lb/>
     of the directors of the International Company that 
     <lb/>
     they had made a tentative offer to the Reids for 
     <lb/>
     the Gander areas amounting to some $6 million. 
     <lb/>
     The Reids, however, had faith that the Gander 
     <lb/>
     could be promoted and a mill established and 
     <lb/>
     refused this offer. Negotiations continued for 
     <lb/>
     some time between the Reids and other interests 
     <lb/>
     but nothing materialised. This placed the Reids 
     <lb/>
     in a very awkward position from a financial 
     <lb/>
     standpoint, and they had practically arrived at a 
     <lb/>
     position where they would be forced to sell their 
     <lb/>
     interests to the International Paper Company. 
     <lb/>
     The government of the day, of which Sir Richard 
     <lb/>
     Squires was Prime Minister and Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice, then took a most important step, they imme<lb break="no"/>diately placed writs against the properties and 
     <lb/>
     thus held the properties from being sacrificed to 
     <lb/>
     either the International Company or any other 
     <lb/>
     company. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the early thirties the newsprint busi<lb break="no"/>ness was in a state of stagnation. Prices of news<lb break="no"/>print were falling at an alarming rate because of 
     <lb/>
     the absence of any demand, and long established 
     <lb/>
     mills both in Canada and the United States were 
     <lb/>
     forced to suspend business. At Corner Brook, 
     <lb/>
     feeling the results of the widespread depression 
     <lb/>
     in the newsprint world, operations were severely 
     <lb/>
     curtailed and hundreds of employees were laid 
     <lb/>
     off. Operations continued on a very restricted 
     <lb/>
     scale. It was not until 1937 that there was any 
     <lb/>
     evidence of an increased demand in the 
     <lb/>
     newsprint world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was this same year that the Bowater people 
     <lb/>
     of London, England, sent their agents to Canada 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of acquiring from the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     government timber areas from which to export 
     <lb/>
     raw wood for use in their English mills. Their 
     <lb/>
     advances, however, were turned down by the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec government, and as a result they came to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and secured from the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion government options on certain Labrador 
     <lb/>
     areas. They also acquired options on the Gander 
     <lb/>
     areas, with the distinct idea of constructing a pulp 
     <lb/>
     and sulphite mill in that territory. However, their 
     <lb/>
     principal purpose at that time was the export of 
     <lb/>
     raw wood to Britain. Their survey on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador was completed in the autumn of 1937 
     <lb/>
     and their options were never exercised, because 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     in the meantime they had begun negotiations 
     <lb/>
     with the International Company for the acquisi<lb break="no"/>tion of the mill at Corner Brook, and eventually 
     <lb/>
     closed a deal for the purchase of all the common 
     <lb/>
     stock of the Corner Brook company for a sum in 
     <lb/>
     the vicinity of $5 million, which was $3 million 
     <lb/>
     more than International had paid for this stock ten 
     <lb/>
     years previous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having acquired the Corner Brook mill, the 
     <lb/>
     Bowater people came back to the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government and intimated that it was not 
     <lb/>
     economic to build a mill on the Gander. But they 
     <lb/>
     countered with the proposition, that if they could 
     <lb/>
     acquire the Gander areas and incorporate them 
     <lb/>
     with the Corner Brook company, they would 
     <lb/>
     build a sulphite mill in Corner Brook and, further, 
     <lb/>
     they proposed to export some 130,000 cords of 
     <lb/>
     raw pulpwood annually to their mills in England. 
     <lb/>
     This, in effect, was the "Gander deal." Through 
     <lb/>
     the lifting of these writs, placed on the properties 
     <lb/>
     in 1930-31, Bowaters acquired the Gander areas, 
     <lb/>
     incorporating them with Corner Brook, and be<lb break="no"/>cause of the fact that the Corner Brook company 
     <lb/>
     had a concession given them originally in 1923, 
     <lb/>
     and again in 1927, whereby the annual profits 
     <lb/>
     taxes amounted only to $150,000, we find that 
     <lb/>
     the operations on Gander result in no profits taxes 
     <lb/>
     and that thus the Newfoundland treasury has been 
     <lb/>
     deprived of not less than $750,000 a year in 
     <lb/>
     revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Everyone here this afternoon knows that 
     <lb/>
     public indignation at the time of the passing of 
     <lb/>
     the Gander deal in 1938 was rampant. Meetings 
     <lb/>
     were held in various sections of the country 
     <lb/>
     protesting against the legislation. The Board of 
     <lb/>
     Trade passed resolutions condemning the enact<lb break="no"/>ment, but the Commission government with the 
     <lb/>
     approval of the Dominions Office ignored the 
     <lb/>
     protests and rights of the people, and this ini<lb break="no"/>quitous legislation was passed into law. To show 
     <lb/>
     you that this was not an isolated case, let me give 
     <lb/>
     you one more example of the consistent threat to 
     <lb/>
     our country's resources while they remain under 
     <lb/>
     the control of our present form of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We now come to another phase of the story of 
     <lb/>
     the activities of the Bowater people in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. In 1927, legislation was enacted 
     <lb/>
     whereby it was provided that before any 
     <lb/>
     dividends would be paid on the common stock of 
     <lb/>
     the company, a sum of at least $2.5 million would 
     <lb/>
     have to be available as a surplus in the company's 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="91" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-10-28_Page_0091.jpg"/>

     treasury, which was made to provide additional 
     <lb/>
     security for the Newfoundland government on 
     <lb/>
     their original guarantee of £2 million given the 
     <lb/>
     company at the start of construction in 1923. 
     <lb/>
     However, in December 1943, influence was evi<lb break="no"/>dently brought to bear to secure an amendment 
     <lb/>
     of this legislation. This particular legislation and 
     <lb/>
     its object was published in the daily papers at that 
     <lb/>
     time but no objections were made by an apathetic 
     <lb/>
     public. The legislation was passed by the Com<lb break="no"/>mission government releasing this $2.5 million, 
     <lb/>
     and then we find that in August, 1944, Bowaters 
     <lb/>
     pay dividends to their parent company in 
     <lb/>
     England, and have continued to pay dividends 
     <lb/>
     since, and according to their annual report for 
     <lb/>
     September 30, 1945, they had paid a total in 
     <lb/>
     dividends to the parent company of some 
     <lb/>
     $1,676,250 or around 6% per annum. This divid<lb break="no"/>end could not have been paid without releasing 
     <lb/>
     this security. Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I want 
     <lb/>
     to draw the attention of this Convention to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the original legislation which was passed in 
     <lb/>
     1923, and again in 1927, provided for two New<lb break="no"/>foundland directors on the board of this company 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of guarding the financial interests 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. At the present time there is no 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander on the directorate. The two 
     <lb/>
     directors are the Commissioner for Finance and 
     <lb/>
     a Montreal lawyer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under the provisions of the Gander deal in 
     <lb/>
     1938, the Corner Brook company was permitted 
     <lb/>
     to export some 133,000 cords of wood annually, 
     <lb/>
     but it is compelled to export at least 50,000 cords 
     <lb/>
     on which they pay the treasury 30 cents per cord. 
     <lb/>
     Our report draws attention to the fact that during 
     <lb/>
     the present season 50,000 cords are being ex<lb break="no"/>ported, whilst the sulphite mill at Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     has been closed down for months because of a 
     <lb/>
     shortage of wood, and recently we are informed 
     <lb/>
     that owing to a "dry season" and because of 
     <lb/>
     insufficient wood from the western end of the 
     <lb/>
     island, the mill may have to go on short shift, thus 
     <lb/>
     depriving our men of much needed work. We 
     <lb/>
     show that at least 250 working days have been 
     <lb/>
     lost to the workers at Comer Brook, and that the 
     <lb/>
     total earning power will be reduced by at least 
     <lb/>
     $100,000. If the mill is forced into curtailing its 
     <lb/>
     operations because of shortage of wood, it will 
     <lb/>
     mean further reduction in earning power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I wish the Convention to dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly understand that I am not one of those who <lb/>
                  <cb/> would be a party to obstructing any progressive <lb/> policy which had as
                  its object the profitable <lb/> development of our potential assets. But I say
                  <lb/> unhesitatingly that the concessions granted the <lb/> Bowater corporation
                  under the Gander deal are <lb/> such as would indicate, to me at any rate, that
                  the <lb/> policy of the Commission government is to even<lb break="no"/>tually
                  pass over a wholly disproportionate control <lb/> of Newfoundland to a private
                  corporation. I was <lb/> one of those who supported the original legisla<lb break="no"/>tion which made this project possible, as was my <lb/> fellow
                  delegate Mr. Brown, and also you, <lb/> Mr. Chairman. In viewing this Comer Brook
                  <lb/> development, it must be ever borne in mind that <lb/> the treasury of
                  Newfoundland, the assets of the <lb/> people, is behind this proposition to the
                  extent of <lb/> some $8 million and until such time as that con<lb break="no"/>tingent liability is redeemed, the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland have a
                  prior right as against those who <lb/> have, in this instance, sacrificed our
                  security. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     We find as the result of our investigations that 
     <lb/>
     the Commission government is also open to cen<lb break="no"/>sure in connection with this policy governing the 
     <lb/>
     export of raw pulpwood. It should not be neces<lb break="no"/>sary to emphasise that if we are to receive the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of our forestry resources, we must con<lb break="no"/>serve them. As the report will show you, the 
     <lb/>
     Bowater people were given the right under the 
     <lb/>
     Gander deal to export up to 130,000 cords of raw 
     <lb/>
     pulpwood annually. I regard this as a reckless 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice of our resources and a deliberate depriv<lb break="no"/>ing of our people of labour and earnings. As has 
     <lb/>
     been stated in this report, the sulphite mill at 
     <lb/>
     Corner Brook has been idle for several months 
     <lb/>
     and even the main plant has been forced to curtail 
     <lb/>
     operations because of shortage of wood. In the 
     <lb/>
     face of such a situation, which deprives our 
     <lb/>
     people of their normal earnings, it is tragic to 
     <lb/>
     know that at the same time the government is 
     <lb/>
     permitting thousands of cords of pulpwood to be 
     <lb/>
     exported out of the country to keep outsiders 
     <lb/>
     working, whilst our own men are forced to 
     <lb/>
     remain idle. I figure that we have exported out of 
     <lb/>
     the country during the present season sufficient 
     <lb/>
     raw wood to keep the Bowater sulphite mill in 
     <lb/>
     operation for 250 days, which would mean a 
     <lb/>
     resultant loss in labour to our own people of 
     <lb/>
     around $100,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In addition, I believe it high time that the 
     <lb/>
     government should introduce a comprehensive 
     <lb/>
     and vigorous programme of reafforestation, with 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="92" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-10-28_Page_0092.jpg"/>

     the object of perpetuating our forest wealth. We 
     <lb/>
     must remember that the future of this country 
     <lb/>
     may mean nothing to transients but we are the 
     <lb/>
     trustees, so to speak, of generations to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now we come to saw mills, of which there are 
     <lb/>
     over 800 scattered all over the country, and which 
     <lb/>
     mills produce over 50 million feet of lumber 
     <lb/>
     annually. This industry may seem at first sight of 
     <lb/>
     no great importance, but when it is considered 
     <lb/>
     that they provide an earning power of from $1.5 
     <lb/>
     to $2 million annually, they become worthy of 
     <lb/>
     real consideration. I am informed, however, that 
     <lb/>
     in connection with these mills there are many 
     <lb/>
     millions of feet of lumber sawn on which the 
     <lb/>
     government has not collected or is not collecting 
     <lb/>
     royalties, and I suggest that a more business~like 
     <lb/>
     system of enforcing these regulations should be 
     <lb/>
     inaugurated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the report we have been able to touch but 
     <lb/>
     lightly on the matter of Labrador from the 
     <lb/>
     standpoint of its forest wealth, and even now I 
     <lb/>
     cannot hope to do justice to the possibility of this 
     <lb/>
     possession. It would be well for those who can 
     <lb/>
     only conceive of our country in the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     42,000 square miles of our schoolday geo<lb break="no"/>graphies to let their eyes turn to the north — to 
     <lb/>
     that great unknown, unexplored 110,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles awarded us by the decision of the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council in 1927. As yet, we have only scratched 
     <lb/>
     the surface of this territory, but our search has 
     <lb/>
     brought to light what may one day be regarded as 
     <lb/>
     one of the greatest single deposits of high-grade 
     <lb/>
     iron ore in the western hemisphere. I am, and 
     <lb/>
     have always been convinced, that the potential 
     <lb/>
     riches of the Labrador are beyond our most op<lb break="no"/>timistic dreams and that in that part of our ter<lb break="no"/>ritory alone we have the guarantee of a permanent 
     <lb/>
     national security. Although we have had this ter<lb break="no"/>ritory under our sovereignty since 1927, a large 
     <lb/>
     number of our people seem to act as if they were 
     <lb/>
     unaware of its existence. In view of this it is not 
     <lb/>
     surprising that my fellow delegate, 
     <lb/>
     Rev. Mr. Burry, has found it necessary to make 
     <lb/>
     us Labrador-conscious and to drive home the 
     <lb/>
     point that when we speak of Newfoundland we 
     <lb/>
     must include under that term Newfoundland- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador. But, in speaking of Labrador, there is 
     <lb/>
     a possibility that I may be regarded as being 
     <lb/>
     prejudiced or talking for political reasons. So 
     <lb/>
     then, let me tell you what outsiders and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly the Canadians think of our Labrador. I 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     quote from an article in the November issue of 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Magazine Digest</hi>, which bears the following 
     <lb/>
     title: "America's Steel Mills Saved in Labrador". 
     <lb/>
     Then follows this sub-heading "The most 
     <lb/>
     Fabulous Iron Discovery on the North American 
     <lb/>
     Continent hasjust been made in the Frozen Was<lb break="no"/>tes of Labrador." This article is too long for me 
     <lb/>
     to quote in full, but it indicates that both Canadian 
     <lb/>
     and American manufacturers will find new out<lb break="no"/>lets for their products when Labrador construc<lb break="no"/>tion and development get under way and the dead 
     <lb/>
     iron of Labrador will turn into gold, for exports 
     <lb/>
     of $350 million in iron ore annually are a distinct 
     <lb/>
     possibility. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As stated in the report, the quantity of timber 
     <lb/>
     available on the Labrador is as yet unknown. 
     <lb/>
     However, estimates give it as from 50 to 100 
     <lb/>
     million cords. All this timber is suitable for either 
     <lb/>
     the manufacture of pulp and paper or for export 
     <lb/>
     as pit-props. It has been known for a long while 
     <lb/>
     that there are inviting possibilities for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of a sulphite mill on the southwest coast 
     <lb/>
     in the vicinity of Baie d'Espoir. If such a propo<lb break="no"/>sition should materialise the virgin forests of the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador would ensure a constant and steady 
     <lb/>
     supply of raw material and such a venture should 
     <lb/>
     give additional employment to at least 1,000 men 
     <lb/>
     and an annual payroll of another $1.5 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is admitted that the timber areas of Labrador 
     <lb/>
     are the last available virgin forests on the east 
     <lb/>
     coast of North America, and for that reason it 
     <lb/>
     would be well if the present government would 
     <lb/>
     bear in mind the advisability of hesitating to 
     <lb/>
     make any further concessions, without a definite 
     <lb/>
     assurance that the areas would be developed to 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the country and the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In concluding my comments on the report, I 
     <lb/>
     submit, Mr. Chairman, that the overall picture of 
     <lb/>
     our forest industry is one bright with hope and 
     <lb/>
     encouragement, and a clear denial to those who 
     <lb/>
     would say that our country is lacking in the 
     <lb/>
     fundamentals which go to the making of a rich 
     <lb/>
     and prosperous people. I am aware that we have 
     <lb/>
     other resources and industries which offer as 
     <lb/>
     bright or even a more promising future. As you 
     <lb/>
     will note from the summary of the report, there 
     <lb/>
     are at the present time some 14,000 people 
     <lb/>
     engaged in this industry, with a total earning 
     <lb/>
     power of some $16 million annually. These 
     <lb/>
     figures speak eloquently for themselves; and as 
     <lb/>
     pointed out the future expansion of the pulp and 
     <lb/>

     paper industry envisages an increase in annual 
     <lb/>
    earnings to a total of not less than $20 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>If, Mr. Chairman, the outlook for our forest 
     <lb/>industries is any indication of the future 
     <lb/>
           <cb/>

    

     economic security of the country, then that future 
     <lb/>
     is promising indeed.

                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, the history of <lb/> this island
                  is an unbroken story of struggle. Our <lb/> people's struggle to live commenced on
                  the day <lb/> they first landed here, four centuries and more <lb/> ago, and has
                  continued to this day. The struggle <lb/> is more uneven now than it was then, and
                  the <lb/> people view the future now with more dread than <lb/> they felt a
                  century ago. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     The newer conceptions of what life can be -<lb/>
               <lb/>
     of what life should be — have widened our 
     <lb/>
     horizons, and deepened our knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
     great gulf which separates what we have and are 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     from what we feel we should have and be. We 
     <lb/>
     have been taught by newspapers, magazines, mo<lb break="no"/>tion pictures, radios and visitors something of the 
     <lb/>
     higher standards of well-being of the mainland of 
     <lb/>
     North America; we have become uncomfortably 
     <lb/>
     aware of the low standards of our country; and 
     <lb/>
     we are driven irresistibly to wonder whether our 
     <lb/>
     attempt to persist in isolation is the root cause of 
     <lb/>
     our condition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have often felt in the past, when we 
     <lb/>
     learned something of the higher standards of the 
     <lb/>
     mainland, that such things belonged to another 
     <lb/>
     world, that they were not for us. But today we are 
     <lb/>
     not so sure that two yardsticks were designed by 
     <lb/>
     the Almighty to measure the standards of well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     being; one yardstick for the mainland of the con<lb break="no"/>tinent, another for this island which lies beside it. 
     <lb/>
     Today we are not so sure, not so ready to take it 
     <lb/>
     for granted, that we Newfoundlanders are des<lb break="no"/>tined to accept much lower standards of life than 
     <lb/>
     our neighbours of Canada and the United States. 
     <lb/>
     Today we are more disposed to feel that our very 
     <lb/>
     manhood, our very creation by God, entitles us to 
     <lb/>
     standards of life no lower than our brothers on the 
     <lb/>
     mainland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our Newfoundland is known to possess 
     <lb/>
     natural wealth of considerable value and variety. 
     <lb/>
     Without at all exaggerating their extent we know 
     <lb/>
     that our fisheries are in the front rank of the 
     <lb/>
     world's marine wealth. We have considerable 
     <lb/>
     forest, waterpower and mineral resources. Our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people are industrious, hard<lb break="no"/>working, frugal, ingenious and sober. The com<lb break="no"/>bination of such natural resources and such 
     <lb/>
     people should spell a prosperous country enjoy<lb break="no"/>ing high standards, western world standards of 
     <lb/>
     living. This combination should spell fine, 
     <lb/>
     modern, well-equipped homes; lots of health- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     giving food; ample clothing; the amenities of 
     <lb/>
     modern New World civilisation; good roads; 
     <lb/>
     good schools, good hospitals, high levels of 
     <lb/>
     public and private health; it should spell a vital, 
     <lb/>
     prosperous, progressive country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has not spelt any such things Compared 
     <lb/>
     with the mainland of North America we are 50 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="94" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-10-28_Page_0094.jpg"/>
         
     years, in some things 100 years, behind the times. 
     <lb/>
     We live more poorly, more shabbily, more mean<lb break="no"/>ly. Our life is more a struggle. Our struggle is 
     <lb/>
     tougher, more naked, more hopeless. In the North 
     <lb/>
     American family Newfoundland bears the 
     <lb/>
     reputation of having the lowest standards of life, 
     <lb/>
     of being the least progressive and advanced of the 
     <lb/>
     whole family. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We all love this land. It has a charm that 
     <lb/>
     warms our hearts, go where we will: a charm, a 
     <lb/>
     magic, a mystical tug on our emotion that never 
     <lb/>
     dies. With all her faults we love her. But a 
     <lb/>
     metamorphosis steals over us the moment we 
     <lb/>
     cross the border that separates us from other 
     <lb/>
     lands. As we leave Newfoundland our minds 
     <lb/>
     undergo a transformation. We expect, and we 
     <lb/>
     take for granted, a higher, a more modern way of 
     <lb/>
     life such as it would have seemed ridiculous or 
     <lb/>
     even avaricious to expect at home. And as we 
     <lb/>
     return to Newfoundland we leave that higher 
     <lb/>
     standard behind, and our minds undergo a reverse 
     <lb/>
     transformation. We have grown so accustomed 
     <lb/>
     to our own lower standards and more antiquated 
     <lb/>
     methods and old-fashioned conveniences that we 
     <lb/>
     readjust ourselves unconsciously to the meaner 
     <lb/>
     standards under which we grew up. We are so 
     <lb/>
     used to our railway and our coastal boats that we 
     <lb/>
     scarcely see them; so used to our settlements, and 
     <lb/>
     roads, and homes, and schools, and hospitals and 
     <lb/>
     hotels and everything else that we do not even see 
     <lb/>
     their inadequacy, their backwardness, their 
     <lb/>
     seaminess. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have grown up in such an atmosphere of 
     <lb/>
     struggle, of adversity, of mean times that we are 
     <lb/>
     never surprised, certainly never shocked, when 
     <lb/>
     we learn that we have one of the highest rates of 
     <lb/>
     tuberculosis in the world; one of the highest 
     <lb/>
     infant mortality rates in the world; one of the 
     <lb/>
     highest maternity-mortality rates in the world; 
     <lb/>
     one of the highest rates of beri-beri and rickets in 
     <lb/>
     the world. We take these shocking facts for 
     <lb/>
     granted. We take for granted our lower standards, 
     <lb/>
     our poverty. We are not indignant about them: we 
     <lb/>
     save our indignation for those who publish such 
     <lb/>
     facts, for with all our complacency, with all our 
     <lb/>
     readiness to receive, to take for granted, and even 
     <lb/>
     to justify these things amongst ourselves, we are, 
     <lb/>
     strange to say, angry and hurt when these shock<lb break="no"/>ing facts become known to the outside world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are all very proud of our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people. We all admire their strength, their skill, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
           
     their adaptability, their resourcefulness, their in<lb break="no"/>dustry, their frugality, their sobriety, and their 
     <lb/>
     warm-hearted, simple generosity. We are proud 
     <lb/>
     of them; but are we indignant, does our blood 
     <lb/>
     boil, when we see the lack of common justice 
     <lb/>
     with which they are treated? When we see how 
     <lb/>
     they live? When we witness the long, grinding 
     <lb/>
     struggle they have? When we see the standards 
     <lb/>
     of their life? Have we compassion in our hearts 
     <lb/>
     for them? Or are we so engrossed, so absorbed, 
     <lb/>
     in our own struggle to live, in this country, that 
     <lb/>
     our social conscience has become toughened, 
     <lb/>
     even case-hardened? Has our own hard struggle 
     <lb/>
     to realise a modest competence so blinded us that 
     <lb/>
     we have little or no tenderness of conscience left 
     <lb/>
     to spare for the fate of the tens of thousands of 
     <lb/>
     our brothers so very much worse off than oursel<lb break="no"/>ves? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, in the present and prospective 
     <lb/>
     world chaos, with all its terrible variety of uncer<lb break="no"/>tainty, it would be cruel and futile, not that the 
     <lb/>
     choice is ours, to influence the handful of people 
     <lb/>
     who inhabit this small island to attempt inde<lb break="no"/>pendent national existence. The earnings of our 
     <lb/>
     65,000 families may be enough, in the years 
     <lb/>
     ahead, to support them half-decently and at the 
     <lb/>
     same time support the public services of a fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     size municipality. But will those earnings support 
     <lb/>
     independent national government on an expand<lb break="no"/>ing, or even the present scale? Except for a few 
     <lb/>
     years of this war and a few of the last, our 
     <lb/>
     people's earnings never supported them on a 
     <lb/>
     scale comparable with North American stand<lb break="no"/>ards, and never maintained a government, even 
     <lb/>
     on the pre-war scale of service Our people never 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed a good standard of living, and never were 
     <lb/>
     able to yield enough taxes to maintain the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The difference was made up by borrowing 
     <lb/>
     or grants-in-aid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We can indeed reduce our people's standard 
     <lb/>
     of living; we can force them to eat and wear and 
     <lb/>
     use and have much less than they have; and we 
     <lb/>
     can deliberately lower the level of governmental 
     <lb/>
     services. Thus we might manage precariously to 
     <lb/>
     maintain independent national status. We can 
     <lb/>
     resolutely decide to be poor but proud. But if such 
     <lb/>
     a decision is made it must be made by the 60,000 
     <lb/>
     families who would have to do the sacrificing, 
     <lb/>
     not the 5,000 families who are confident of get<lb break="no"/>ting along pretty well in any case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have, I say, a perfect right to decide that 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="95" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-10-28_Page_0095.jpg"/>

            <fw type="num">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">95</fw>
            
     we will turn away from North American stand<lb break="no"/>ards of living and from North American stand<lb break="no"/>ards of public services, and condemn ourselves 
     <lb/>
     as a people and government deliberately to long 
     <lb/>
     years of struggle to maintain even the little that 
     <lb/>
     we have. We may, if we wish, turn our backs 
     <lb/>
     upon the North American continent beside which 
     <lb/>
     God placed us, and resign ourselves to the meaner 
     <lb/>
     outlook and shabbier standards of Europe, 2,000 
     <lb/>
     miles across the ocean. We can do this, or we can 
     <lb/>
     face the fact that the very logic of our situation 
     <lb/>
     on the surface of the globe impels us to draw close 
     <lb/>
     to the progressive outlook and dynamic living 
     <lb/>
     standards of this continent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our danger, so it seems to me, is that of 
     <lb/>
     nursing delusions of grandeur. We remember the 
     <lb/>
     stories of small states that valiantly preserved 
     <lb/>
     their national independence and developed their 
     <lb/>
     own proud cultures, but we tend to overlook the 
     <lb/>
     fact that comparison of Newfoundland with them 
     <lb/>
     is ludicrous. We are not a nation. We are merely 
     <lb/>
     a medium size municipality, a mere miniature 
     <lb/>
     borough of a large city. Dr. Carson, Patrick Mor<lb break="no"/>ris and John Kent were sound in the first decades 
     <lb/>
     of the 19th century when they advocated cutting 
     <lb/>
     the apron-strings that bound us to the government 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom; but the same love of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, the same Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     patriotism, that inspired their agitation then, 
     <lb/>
     would now, if they lived, drive them to carry the 
     <lb/>
     agitation to its logical conclusion, to take the next 
     <lb/>
     step of linking Newfoundland closely to the 
     <lb/>
     democratic, developing mainland of the New 
     <lb/>
     World. There was indeed a time when tiny states 
     <lb/>
     lived gloriously. That time is now ancient 
     <lb/>
     European history. We are trying to live in the 
     <lb/>
     mid-20th century, post-Hitler New World, We 
     <lb/>
     are living in a world in which small countries 
     <lb/>
     have less chance than ever before of surviving. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We can, of course, persist in isolation, a dot 
     <lb/>
     on the shore of North America, the Funks<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> of the 
     <lb/>
     North American continent, struggling vainly to 
     <lb/>
     support ourselves and our greatly expanded 
     <lb/>
     public services. Reminded continually by radio, 
     <lb/>
     movie and visitor of greatly higher standards of 
     <lb/>
     living across the Gulf, we can shrug incredulous<lb break="no"/>ly or dope ourselves into the hopeless belief that 
     <lb/>
     such things are not for us. By our isolation from 
     <lb/>
     the throbbing vitality and expansion of the con<lb break="no"/>tinent we have been left far behind in the march 
     <lb/>

     of time, the "sport of historic misfortune", the 
     <lb/>
     "Cinderella of the Empire." Our choice now is to 
     <lb/>
     continue in blighting isolation or seize the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity that may beckon us to the wider horizons 
     <lb/>
     and higher standards of unity with the progres<lb break="no"/>sive mainland of America.

            <p>
     I am not one of those, if any such there be, who 
     <lb/>
     would welcome federal union with Canada at any 
     <lb/>
     price. There are prices which I as a New<lb break="no"/>foundlander whose ancestry in this country 
     <lb/>
     reaches back for nearly two centuries am not 
     <lb/>
     willing that Newfoundland should pay, I am 
     <lb/>
     agreeable to the idea that our country should link 
     <lb/>
     itself federally with that great British nation, but 
     <lb/>
     I am not agreeable that we should ever be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to forget that we are Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     with a great history and a great tradition of our 
     <lb/>
     own. I agree that there may be much to gain from 
     <lb/>
     linking our fortunes with that great nation, but I 
     <lb/>
     insist that as a self-goveming province of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion we should continue to enjoy the right 
     <lb/>
     to our own distinctive culture. I do not deny that 
     <lb/>
     once we affiliated with the Canadian federal 
     <lb/>
     union we should in all fairness be expected to 
     <lb/>
     extend the scope of our loyalty to embrace the 
     <lb/>
     federation as a whole. I do not deny this claim at 
     <lb/>
     all, but I insist that as a constituent part of the 
     <lb/>
     federation we should continue to be quite free to 
     <lb/>
     hold to our love of our own dear land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Nor am I one of those, if there be any such, 
     <lb/>
     who would welcome union with Canada without 
     <lb/>
     regard for the price that the Dominion might be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I pledge myself to this House and to this 
     <lb/>
     country that I will base my ultimate stand in this 
     <lb/>
     whole question of confederation upon the nature 
     <lb/>
     of the terms that are laid before the Convention 
     <lb/>
     and the country. If the terms are such as clearly 
     <lb/>
     to suggest a better Newfoundland for our people 
     <lb/>
     I shall support and maintain them. If they are not 
     <lb/>
     of such a nature I shall oppose them with all the 
     <lb/>
     means I can command. In the price we pay and 
     <lb/>
     the price we exact my only standard of measure<lb break="no"/>ment is the welfare of the people. This is my 
     <lb/>
     approach to the whole question of federal union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. It is in this spirit that I move this 
     <lb/>
     resolution today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Confederation I will support if it means a 
     <lb/>
     lower cost of living for our people. Confederation 
     <lb/>
     I will support if it means a higher standard of life 
     <lb/>

     for our people. Confederation I will support if it 
     <lb/>
     means strength, stability and security for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I will support confederation if it gives 
     <lb/>
     us democratic government. I will support con<lb break="no"/>federation if it rids us of Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I will support confederation if it gives us 
     <lb/>
     responsible government under conditions that 
     <lb/>
     will give responsible government a real chance 
     <lb/>
     to succeed. Confederation I will support if it 
     <lb/>
     makes us a province enjoying privileges and 
     <lb/>
     rights no lower than any other province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These, then, are the conditions of my support 
     <lb/>
     of confederation: that it must raise our people's 
     <lb/>
     standard of living, that it must give New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders a better life, that it must give our 
     <lb/>
     country stability and security and that it must give 
     <lb/>
     us full, democratic responsible government 
     <lb/>
     under circumstances that will ensure its success. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, I have given a 
     <lb/>
     statement of my faith, but I do not expect mem<lb break="no"/>bers to support this motion for the reasons that 
     <lb/>
     impel me to do so. Members no doubt have a 
     <lb/>
     variety of reasons of their own, and their support 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution does not at all necessarily imply 
     <lb/>
     agreement with mine. There are many cases to be 
     <lb/>
     made for submitting and supporting this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion quite apart from those I have given here 
     <lb/>
     today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the name of the people of Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     and of thousands of other Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     throughout this island I move this resolution. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that this move will lead to a brighter and 
     <lb/>
     happier life for our Newfoundland people. If you 
     <lb/>
     adopt this resolution, and Canada offers us 
     <lb/>
     generous terms, as I believe she will, and New<lb break="no"/>foundland decides to shake off her ancient iso<lb break="no"/>lation, I believe with all my heart and mind that 
     <lb/>
     the people will bless the day this resolution was 
     <lb/>
     moved. With God's grace let us move forward 
     <lb/>
     for a brighter and happier Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
      </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, I had no intention <lb/>of seconding
                  this motion. I want to make myself <lb/>quite clear at the onset with respect to
                  that. I do <lb/>intend to second it. My purpose in doing so I will <lb/>explain as
                  I go on. I entirely disagree with <lb/>Mr. Smallwood's statements, entirely. I
                  don't in<lb break="no"/>tend to adopt them in any one whit. But the <lb/>motion
                  that he makes is for the acquiring, as far <lb/>as the Convention is concerned, of
                  a fact which <lb/>is actually as important as any fact that we have <lb/>had
                  presented here to us today. It is important for <lb/>
                  <cb/> one reason, that is that we may disabuse our <lb/> minds for once and all of
                  this business of con<lb break="no"/>federation. I do believe that we have to get
                  the <lb/> terms of confederation. I do believe the country <lb/> expects it, and
                  certainly we can hear from the fire <lb/> of Mr. Smallwood's speech that he is
                  going to be <lb/> one person who makes us expect confederation <lb/> as a form of
                  government to be considered. <lb/> Whether good or bad, whether it meets with our
                  <lb/> ideas of the economy of the country or not, it is <lb/> still a fact, and as
                  a fact that we must ascertain, I <lb/> second the motion. It is just as real a
                  fact as that <lb/> we ascertain the report of the Forestry Committee <lb/> today.
                  To me, Mr. Chairman, it is in this class. <lb/> We have heard of St. George's coal
                  fields, most <lb/> of us, all our lives. A lot of us are beginning to <lb/> doubt
                  very much the value of St. Georges' coal <lb/> fields, but we are determined to
                  find out, if we <lb/> can, if they have value. I doubt very frankly if the <lb/>
                  terms that Mr. Smallwood envisages from <lb/> Canada are going to be very much
                  better than we <lb/> got when we were not in nearly as good a posi<lb break="no"/>tion, as when the approach was made before. But <lb/> it is a fact that we have
                  to ascertain these terms, <lb/> and in this spirit I second this motion. I want to
                  <lb/> be understood as not agreeing with Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, and having
                  no wish for confederation. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, I felt solemn <lb/>when I rose in
                  this House to deliver my maiden <lb/>speech on Thursday, September 12, but my
                     feel<lb break="no"/>ings on that occasion were not half so intensely
                  <lb/>patriotic and righteous as they are today in speak<lb break="no"/>ing to the
                  motion introduced by Mr. Smallwood. <lb/>I feel it will be a great surprise to Mr.
                     Small<lb break="no"/>wood, who is quite convinced I am going to <lb/>support
                  his motion, to realise that on the contrary, <lb/>I am strongly opposed to it, on
                  factual, but, more <lb/>important, on moral grounds. In the first place, I
                  <lb/>think his resolution is premature. This Conven<lb break="no"/>tion is a body
                  of Newfoundlanders, elected to first <lb/>consider the financial and economic
                  changes that <lb/>have taken place in this country since 1934, and <lb/>then on
                  the basis of our findings to recommend <lb/>forms of government to be placed
                  before the <lb/>people in a national referendum. The Convention <lb/>was called
                  together and formally opened by His <lb/>Excellency the Governor. After a week or
                  so of <lb/>preliminary discussion, the "shake down cruise" <lb/>so to speak, the
                  Convention as a whole agreed <lb/>that the very best method of going about the
                  first <lb/>part of their task would be to subdivide into <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>
                  <fw type="num">97</fw> committees, each of which would consider a cer<lb break="no"/>tain phase of the country's business and economy <lb/> and place
                  its report before the Convention for <lb/> debate. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     The Convention has been in session now 
     <lb/>
     something over six weeks. The committees have 
     <lb/>
     been working something over four weeks. One 
     <lb/>
     interim report has been referred to its committee. 
     <lb/>
     The first two actual reports, the education and 
     <lb/>
     forestry reports have just this day been submitted 
     <lb/>
     for debate. Yet, it is at this point, that Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, the "self-appointed apostle of confed<lb break="no"/>eration" as he has been called, chooses to 
     <lb/>
     introduce his resolution. In other words before 
     <lb/>
     the Convention has been given even half a chance 
     <lb/>
     to get a true picture of the Newfoundland scene, 
     <lb/>
     it is proposed that we should send a delegation 
     <lb/>
     post-haste to find what Canada will give us if we 
     <lb/>
     are well-behaved and come round as quickly as 
     <lb/>
     possible to Mr. Smallwood's way of thinking. 
     <lb/>
     Yet if the Convention agrees on its findings that 
     <lb/>
     the country is self-supporting, and can continue 
     <lb/>
     to be self-supporting, then there is no necessity 
     <lb/>
     for us to seek aid from anyone. On the other hand 
     <lb/>
     if the findings are negative and assistance must 
     <lb/>
     be sought, then it is sound logic that we may have 
     <lb/>
     to go to the United Kingdom, as well as Canada 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps even the United States. But all this 
     <lb/>
     is still somewhat in the future, and I submit that 
     <lb/>
     the motion is premature — it is in plain everyday 
     <lb/>
     language "jumping the gun." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not propose to go into the constitutionality 
     <lb/>
     of the matter at this stage, for that would be just 
     <lb/>
     as premature as Mr. Smallwood's resolution. But 
     <lb/>
     I would like to make one observation in this 
     <lb/>
     regard. The terms of reference, which are begin<lb break="no"/>ning to look pretty sick as time goes on, have been 
     <lb/>
     stretched, twisted and shrunken to suit every 
     <lb/>
     point of view, so that they may be said to permit 
     <lb/>
     almost anything, and at the same time allow 
     <lb/>
     nothing. On the one hand the Convention has no 
     <lb/>
     powers. It is not a governing body; it cannot 
     <lb/>
     subpoena witnesses to come before it; it cannot 
     <lb/>
     compel public servants to divulge what should be 
     <lb/>
     public information. On the other hand a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention seeks at this stage, in the midst 
     <lb/>
     of the very preliminaries, to endow it with the 
     <lb/>
     sovereign powers of a government to enable a 
     <lb/>
     delegation of its members to go to the capital of 
     <lb/>
     another country and there discuss terms of union. 
     <lb/>
     It is very inconsistent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     At this point I would like to refer to an excel<lb break="no"/>lent paper on the "Political and Financial Im<lb break="no"/>plications of Confederation" which was read 
     <lb/>
     before the Royal Institute of International Af<lb break="no"/>fairs, Newfoundland Branch, by Professor 
     <lb/>
     A.M. Fraser, M.A., of the Memorial University 
     <lb/>
     College on March 15, 1946. Professor Fraser first 
     <lb/>
     declared that since he is not a native-born 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander he would not presume to ap<lb break="no"/>praise the sentiments of the people on this fun<lb break="no"/>damental question and preferred not to express 
     <lb/>
     any personal opinions. His impartial paper dealt 
     <lb/>
     only with the political and financial set-up in the 
     <lb/>
     event that Newfoundland were to ever enter the 
     <lb/>
     confederation. But this he did say: "At the outset, 
     <lb/>
     I would, however say that in my opinion, the 
     <lb/>
     final decision on Confederation, as far as New<lb break="no"/>foundland is concerned, must rest with the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, and that they should be asked 
     <lb/>
     to register that decision only after negotiations to 
     <lb/>
     secure the best offer of terms from Canada have 
     <lb/>
     been completed on their behalf by a sovereign 
     <lb/>
     government of their own choosing. If these 
     <lb/>
     negotiations were to be conducted under any 
     <lb/>
     other auspices the terms secured would be bound 
     <lb/>
     to be suspect, and even if confederation were 
     <lb/>
     achieved in this manner, it would leave a heritage 
     <lb/>
     of discontent, which might well imperil the satis<lb break="no"/>factory operation of the agreement." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are without doubt many eminent con<lb break="no"/>stitutional and legal minds in this country and 
     <lb/>
     outside who will support that opinion. I am a 
     <lb/>
     young man who hopes to spend the rest of his life 
     <lb/>
     in this country and contribute to its betterment, 
     <lb/>
     and when I am as old as Mr. Smallwood is now, 
     <lb/>
     please God, I do not want to be accused of helping 
     <lb/>
     to sell this country up the St. Lawrence. The 
     <lb/>
     public has a short memory, and those who, daz<lb break="no"/>zled by the immediate prospect of temporary 
     <lb/>
     advantages without considering the implications, 
     <lb/>
     wish Newfoundland to enter confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada or any other state on a referendum vote, 
     <lb/>
     would be the first if the deal later went sour to 
     <lb/>
     revile the National Convention, the body that 
     <lb/>
     made possible such political conjuring. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If these arguments against the acceptance of 
     <lb/>
     this resolution, at this particular time, are not 
     <lb/>
     sufficient, and I believe they are, there is one 
     <lb/>
     further objection, the strongest I have to make, 
     <lb/>
     and one which involves, or should involve, a 
     <lb/>
     breach of the privilege of the members of this 
     <lb/>

     assembly. lt will explain why, even if I were 
     <lb/>
     convinced of the regularity of this motion, I could 
     <lb/>
     not in conscience support it. For I would be left 
     <lb/>
     open at any time, and at Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     pleasure, to a charge of complicity.

            <p>
     This may not be the time or place for a little 
     <lb/>
     sermon in morals or ethics, but it is the time and 
     <lb/>
     place, I think for a little speaking of minds on a 
     <lb/>
     matter that concerns both ethics and morals, 
     <lb/>
     especially when today's doctrine of materialism 
     <lb/>
     has crept, it seems, even into our own councils of 
     <lb/>
     state. "Every man for himself and the devil take 
     <lb/>
     the hindmost." It's get what you can for yourself, 
     <lb/>
     and don't be bothered by scruples. Proponents of 
     <lb/>
     this doctrine always make one mistake. They 
     <lb/>
     forget the integrity of the individual conscience; 
     <lb/>
     that because they are clever in duplicity others 
     <lb/>
     may be just as wise in honour; are quite blind to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that some men will not barter that honour 
     <lb/>
     for a nice trip to Ottawa, the bait that was private<lb break="no"/>ly offered me, and goodness knows how many 
     <lb/>
     others, if we supported the motion now before the 
     <lb/>
     house. To put it even more clearly, I was told by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Small-wood, that I was slated to be a member 
     <lb/>
     of the delegation and that I should play ball to see 
     <lb/>
     that this motion was carried.

     The members of this Convention are supposed 
     <lb/>
     to have an open mind. They are supposed to first 
     <lb/>
     examine the country's position to see whether or 
     <lb/>
     not it is self-supporting, and having determined 
     <lb/>

     the people of this country at a national referen<lb break="no"/>dum. Making due allowance for every man's 
     <lb/>
     honest opinion, even at this stage, there is a limit 
     <lb/>
     that should be drawn nonetheless. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One member at the earlier public sessions of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention expressed himself rather strongly 
     <lb/>
     on forms of government and other things, and 
     <lb/>
     was unfavourably criticised. Yet another mem<lb break="no"/>ber, elected on a definite platform, has been as 
     <lb/>
     busy as the proverbial blue tailed fly propagan<lb break="no"/>dising the remainder of the Convention at every 
     <lb/>
     opportunity. Not content with that, he invited a 
     <lb/>
     majority of them to his hotel room, and en<lb break="no"/>deavoured to talk them into supporting his resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. That may be good politics from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's point of view, but when we con<lb break="no"/>sider the nature and purpose of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     and the present stage of its work, I think it is the 
     <lb/>
     lowest kind of political chicanery and that it 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     should be aired on the floor of this Convention. I 
     <lb/>
     am doing my honest best, whatever my personal 
     <lb/>
     opinions, to fairly appraise the situation, and I 
     <lb/>
     resent most strongly the obvious attempt that is 
     <lb/>
     being made to colour conclusions. Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood's antics may provide a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     humorous conversation, but it goes beyond a joke 
     <lb/>
     when even one individual is asked, cajoled or 
     <lb/>
     invited to sell his integrity, to further the cause of 
     <lb/>
     confederation, or any cause at this stage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of Mr. Smallwood's activities, both 
     <lb/>
     inside and outside the Convention, I feel it's time 
     <lb/>
     that we had a show-down. I'd like to know, and 
     <lb/>
     a lot of other people would like to know, who Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is acting for. Is it for himself or for 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government, or simply for his con<lb break="no"/>stituents? He will be hard put to it to convince me 
     <lb/>
     it is simply and solely the latter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For these reasons I do not believe that now is 
     <lb/>
     an opportune time for this resolution to be 
     <lb/>
     brought before this House and debated, and I 
     <lb/>
     would suggest that it be deferred to a date when 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, having themselves got the facts 
     <lb/>
     in relation to Newfoundland, are in a better posi<lb break="no"/>tion to receive it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Mr. Chairman, would it be in order <lb/> to move
                  an amendment to Mr. Smallwood's mo<lb break="no"/>tion? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Certainly you have a right, Mr. <lb/> Penney.
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would <lb/> like to say
                  that I am opposed to Mr. Smallwood's <lb/> motion at this particular time, and I
                  agree with <lb/> the sentiments expressed by Mr. Harrington, but <lb/> to be short
                  and sweet, or sour as the case may be, <lb/> I will put it this way. Because this
                  Convention is <lb/> not yet fully informed on matters affecting the <lb/> economy
                  of Newfoundland I do not understand <lb/> why we should take any action in
                  connection with <lb/> confederation at this time; may I therefore move <lb/> as an
                  amendment to Mr. Smallwood's motion <lb/> that we defer any action on the subject
                  of con<lb break="no"/>federation with Canada for a period of say two <lb/> months.
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ROBE2">Mr. Roberts</persName> I second that motion. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have followed very <lb/> closely
                  the views expressed. I have not prepared <lb/> any special address, but I do think
                  before we <lb/> discuss any forms of government, confederation, <lb/> responsible,
                  or anything whatsoever, that we <lb/> should wait until we have completed the task

                  to build in the future. I am satisfied that <lb/> then we can get down to work in
                  earnest. I came <lb/> here with no fixed views whatsoever, I still <lb/> remain
                  so, and, until I can see the picture of the <lb/> future of the country, I will
                  not decide in favour <lb/> of any form of government Maybe I should go <lb/> as
                  far as to say that I am voicing the sentiments <lb/> of others in this assembly.
                  It is the first time that <lb/> such a gathering has come about, and this as<lb break="no"/>sembly will go down in history and will be <lb/> remembered for
                  what it did accomplish and what <lb/> it did not accomplish in the interests of
                  the masses <lb/> of this country. At this time in the history of our <lb/> country
                  we have to consider the general welfare <lb/> of the masses and not the few. The
                  whole has to <lb/> be considered and not the part. I think that is very <lb/>
                  important. Thank you. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I feel that I cannot let this oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity slip by without making some remarks on <lb/>Mr. Smallwood's statement,
                  wherein he said that <lb/>our people were 100 years behind the times. <lb/>
               </p>

               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I wish to say that during the past <lb/>eight years I
                  have represented at least 5,000 of the <lb/>people of this country. The general
                  labouring <lb/>man in this country is not 100, or even 50 years <lb/>behind the
                  times. This is ridiculous, furthermore <lb/>I will support the idea and the
                  thought that there <lb/>has been a little National Convention held outside
                  <lb/>this place by a few. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> I did not intend at this particular
                  <lb/>time to have anything to say in connection with <lb/>the resolution
                  introduced by my honourable <lb/>friend, Mr. Smallwood. I may say to begin with,
                  <lb/>that whatever reason or whatever sympathy I <lb/>would have with joining
                  forces with Canada, <lb/>Mr. Smallwood has killed it all in his address here
                  <lb/>this afternoon. I also think it is premature; we <lb/>have not gotten though
                  the business of this house <lb/>— the business we were sent here to do. Only two
                  <lb/>committees have reported There was an interim <lb/>report of the Fisheries
                  Committee, which report <lb/>was referred back to them and I would say, for
                  <lb/>the information of the delegates, that the next <lb/>report will be a final
                  one and that will not be for <lb/>some time yet. After all, the fishing industry
                  is <lb/>the greatest industry we have in this country and <lb/>
                  <cb/> we want to get all the available information <lb/> before we present the
                  report. As far as confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is concerned, there is nothing
                  wrong with <lb/> sending a delegation to Canada; that could be <lb/> tolerated,
                  but Mr. Smallwood in his address says <lb/> Newfoundland is so far behind the
                  times. I have <lb/> travelled perhaps as far in Canada as Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood — I could not go any farther in Canada than <lb/> I have been — I have been
                  through Alaska as <lb/> well, and during these travels I learned much <lb/> about
                  Canada and Canadians, and I never thought <lb/> our country and our people were so
                  far in the <lb/> background as Mr. Smallwood says. If that is his <lb/> reason for
                  introducing this resolution, then I do <lb/> not see eye to eye with him. I am not
                  a con<lb break="no"/>federate. If I could be convinced, perhaps I would <lb/> be;
                  but, Mr. Chairman, it will take a lot of con<lb break="no"/>vincing before I cast
                  a vote for confederation with <lb/> Canada. Let us take the eastern provinces and
                  ask <lb/> the man on the street what he thinks of confed<lb break="no"/>eration;
                  many have told us, "We are in now and <lb/> we cannot get out; if we were out, we
                  would never <lb/> go in." Again he referred to health and in par<lb break="no"/>ticular to tuberculosis; I might ask Mr. <lb/> Smallwood if he has ever read a
                  clipping in one <lb/> of the Canadian newspapers in connection with <lb/> the
                  percentage of tuberculosis on the Gaspé coast. <lb/> Perhaps Newfoundland can hold
                  a candle with <lb/> Canada, and Newfoundland is not as far back as <lb/> 100 years
                  behind another country, and I say New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders are not 100
                  years behind other <lb/> people. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I did not say that, I said 50 <lb/>years behind
                  and in some things 100 years. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> Do you believe that? <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> I would not believe you or anyone <lb/>else. You may
                  go down below Cape Chidley and <lb/>find a few Esquimaux who are that far behind.
                  It <lb/>was that kind of talk and the publication of it that <lb/>got us where we
                  are today. Your remarks today <lb/>will go all over Canada, over the world; how
                  can <lb/>we blame people or newspapers for publishing <lb/>things about
                  Newfoundland — calling us Indians <lb/>and Esquimaux when we ourselves are calling
                  <lb/>ourselves Indians. I thought this resolution would <lb/>come in, and 24 hours
                  after he introduced it in the <lb/>house it would be debated. I did not think
                  there <lb/>would be any speeches or addresses given on it <lb/>this afternoon. But
                  Mr. Smallwood's address, I <lb/>do not mind telling you, pierces the hearts of <lb/>

                  have more to say on this matter at some <lb/> future date. I am against
                  confederation as I see it <lb/> today. I came here with an open mind, with no
                  <lb/> preconceived ideas. I did not go to my district and <lb/> preach
                  confederation; I did not preach anything. <lb/> Whatever government is best for
                  the people, that <lb/> is the government I would vote for and I will do <lb/> it

                  else. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I am not wholly in accordance with the <lb/>
                  amendment of Mr. Penney. It is too definite; two <lb/> months' time would be
                  better. Maybe it could be <lb/> a little more elastic. My reason for speaking at
                  <lb/> this time is to introduce something which ought <lb/> to be said at this
                  time, and Mr. Smallwood's <lb/> address gives me the opportunity — that is to ask
                  <lb/> ourselves, before we go any further, does the <lb/> Convention know exactly
                  where it is going, as a <lb/> Convention? Have we given ourselves specific <lb/>
                  directions as to what we ourselves want to do? <lb/> For example, we were
                  presented with the Chad<lb break="no"/>wick-Jones report and we more or less threw
                  it <lb/> out. We gave it scant attention although it was <lb/> formally received.
                  We were presented with a <lb/> reconstruction report which we did not consider
                  <lb/> worthy of discussion, in spite of the fact that <lb/> future policy is
                  involved; and the implication <lb/> covering the introduction of that report is
                  that a <lb/> programme of $60 million be introduced, the <lb/> funds for which
                  would have to be found locally. <lb/> We have not received that although it was
                  laid on <lb/> the table. Later on we were told that the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion
                  must not concern itself with government <lb/> policy in spite of the fact we have,
                  as part of the <lb/> terms of reference, to recommend future forms of <lb/>
                  government. How any man can divorce the two <lb/> in his mind, I do not know. We
                  do not know what <lb/> the national production is, the data is not avail<lb break="no"/>able, how are we then to know if we are self <lb/> supporting? Then
                  we had the Fisheries Report. <lb/> We got so far and had to leave it, as someone
                  said, <lb/> "in mid air", because we did not know what to do <lb/> with it. We got
                  into the bases deal and we did not <lb/> know how to clarify our own position — we
                  did <lb/> not know what to do under the circumstances. <lb/> Then we are presented
                  today with the Education <lb/> Report, for the first time. If I read aright the
                  <lb/> attitude of the Education Committee in this <lb/> respect, they base their
                  report solely on the <lb/>
                  <cb/> economic condition of Newfoundland insofar as <lb/> education is concerned.
                  We shall have to do more <lb/> than that with our reports if we are going to
                  finally <lb/> make up our minds just exactly where New<lb break="no"/>foundland is
                  going in the future. I was expecting <lb/> someone to answer questions like
                  this... <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Are you discussing the Educa<lb break="no"/>tion
                  Report? If so, your remarks are not relevant. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I am trying to show you that the <lb/>committee's
                  interpretation of our terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence were narrower that I
                  think they should be, <lb/>consequently we ought to clarify just what we can
                  <lb/>or cannot do. I am not discussing the Education <lb/>Report, I am giving an
                  indication of the way we <lb/>have or have not interpreted our terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence. Lastly, when we are right in the midst of the <lb/>gathering
                  of facts and before we have made up <lb/>our minds as to where we are going, we
                  have a <lb/>motion placed before us with a resolution of <lb/>approaching another
                  government with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of union. Before we go any farther we
                  ought <lb/>to clarify our minds as to where we are going as <lb/>a Convention. The
                  chairman of the Forestry <lb/>Committee tells us we did not get all the the facts.
                  <lb/>If I have said anything that has not happened in <lb/>this Convention so far,
                  I would like to be brought <lb/>up about it, but the point I am making is this:
                  <lb/>before we can discuss or even think about the <lb/>question of confederation,
                  or asking for the <lb/>terms, we have to decide in our own minds what <lb/>our
                  terms of reference mean and where we are <lb/>going. It is important, to me at
                  least, that we do <lb/>not interpret our terms of reference in too narrow <lb/>a
                  manner. I will support Mr. Penney's motion <lb/>that the matter of confederation
                  be deferred until <lb/>we see fit to deal with it. I might add also that I
                  <lb/>too am looking for the welfare of Newfoundland <lb/>and I would not rule out
                  the possibility at some <lb/>time or other, of going to Canada, but before I do
                  <lb/>that I want to know the facts of Newfoundland; I <lb/>want to go to Canada
                  with a sense of dignity; with <lb/>the feeling that I am a Newfoundlander. I do
                  not <lb/>want to go when we do not know whether or not <lb/>we are
                  self-supporting. We must first of all decide <lb/>where we are going in this
                  matter. <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">101</fw> the motion and once on the amendment — just as <lb/> a
                  matter of guidance? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Strictly, the debate on the first <lb/> question
                  should continue until the termination of <lb/> that debate, when the amendment may
                  be moved <lb/> and on that amendment any member may speak <lb/> again. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In the circumstances in which <lb/> within half
                  an hour of the motion's having been <lb/> moved, an amendment is moved to it?
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to speak against the motion, <lb/> but in
                  case there is any doubt in the mind of my <lb/> friend, Mr. Smallwood, I am not
                  speaking for the <lb/> amendment against the motion. It seems to me <lb/> that I
                  have seen this motion in a different form <lb/> than what was brought before us
                  today. Appar<lb break="no"/>ently there are some discrepancies behind the <lb/>
                  motion, as to who is or is not the proper authority. <lb/> The form in which I saw
                  that motion definitely <lb/> states that His Excellency the Governor be ap<lb break="no"/>proached to make the necessary arrangements to <lb/> assure us
                  whether or not the Government of <lb/> Canada would receive a delegation in order
                  to <lb/> discuss the terms of confederation. The bringing <lb/> in of this motion
                  at this particular juncture in our <lb/> deliberations is so premature as to be
                  positively <lb/> indecent. Before we have had time to consider <lb/> and discuss
                  among ourselves the economic and <lb/> financial position — before we have had
                  time to <lb/> glance over the initial reports brought in, our <lb/> friend Mr.
                  Smallwood flew to Quebec and else<lb break="no"/>where and came back from Canada
                  thoroughly <lb/> prepared to fight this thing to the bitter end with <lb/> the
                  idea that when this Convention was over it be <lb/> committed definitely to
                  confederation. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No! <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I submit it is the truth. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Until I see proof to the contrary, I <lb/> will
                  say it is the truth. Mr. Smallwood has ap<lb break="no"/>proached the members of
                  this Convention and <lb/> offered them this, that and the other thing I <lb/>
                  myself was offered a senatorship. I fail to see how <lb/> any one man in this
                  Convention could, on one <lb/> flying trip, come back with so many portfolios in
                  <lb/> his bag — Minister of Fisheries and Mines and <lb/> so on. I fail to see how
                  any man who has an <lb/> honesty of purpose, who has the public welfare <lb/> of
                  the people of this country at heart, can be <lb/> dancing around this town of St
                  John's, in and out <lb/> of hotels, offering jobs in Canada if we voted for <lb/>
                  <cb/> confederation. I put it to you Mr. Chairman and <lb/> gentlemen, these
                  manoeuvres are positively in<lb break="no"/>decent. We are self-thinking
                  individuals elected <lb/> by our people to come here and thrash out the <lb/>
                  various things at issue. On the other hand, who <lb/> are the appropriate
                  authorities of this country? <lb/> Who are the proper authorities to whom we shall
                  <lb/> appeal as to whether or not we should send a <lb/> delegation to Canada to
                  find out the terms of <lb/> confederation? Here we are, elected by the <lb/>
                  people, and unfortunately we find we have not <lb/> even the right to go into
                  public offices and <lb/> demand certain information. Do you mean to tell <lb/> me
                  that Canada would discuss with an un<lb break="no"/>authorised body the terms of
                  confederation? <lb/> There is a chance that these terms will be even~ <lb/> tually
                  turned down. Do you think that any official <lb/> body in Canada would do anything
                  that would <lb/> make them appear so ridiculous in the eyes of <lb/> their own
                  people? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We might ask. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Do you want us to go to Canada <lb/> with our
                  fingers in our mouths and say, "Please <lb/> Canada, let us in, Mr. Smallwood
                  wants us to go <lb/> in." I submit, the time is not opportune. If I were <lb/>
                  eager to do something to have confederation <lb/> foisted upon this country, I
                  would ask to have the <lb/> motion withdrawn for consideration by the mem<lb break="no"/>bers. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If I may be allowed, I would <lb/> like to
                  speak to the amendment. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Do you want to make a personal <lb/>
                  explanation, if so, you may do so. You also have <lb/> the right, as mover of the
                  resolution, to reply at <lb/> the end of the debate. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Speaking to the amendment, I <lb/> may say that
                  members must not suppose that the <lb/> adoption of the motion means that a
                  delegation is <lb/> appointed or elected to go to Ottawa immedi<lb break="no"/>ately. Members must not suppose that the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of this motion
                  means that the subject of <lb/> confederation and terms and conditions of con<lb break="no"/>federation will be brought into this house within <lb/> the next
                  few days or even the next few weeks. <lb/> Mr. Hollett has touched on the question
                  of who <lb/> are the proper authorities. What would happen is <lb/> that this
                  motion would be forwarded from one <lb/> authority to the other; possibly to His
                  Excellency <lb/> the Governor; possibly from him to the Secretary <lb/> of State
                  for Dominions Affairs in the United <lb/> Kingdom; possibly from him back to His
                     Excel<lb break="no"/><pb n="102" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1946-10-28_Page_0102.jpg"/>

                     Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency to the Commission of Government; pos<lb break="no"/>sibly then from the Commission of Government <lb/> to the Prime Minister of
                  Canada; all of which <lb/> might take a matter of several weeks and in fact <lb/>
                  I believe would take a matter of several weeks; <lb/> so that we might then
                  picture at some future date <lb/> — two or three weeks from now — a reply, <lb/>
                  through you, coming to this house to the effect <lb/> that the Government of
                  Canada will not deal with <lb/> this Convention; or a reply from the Government
                  <lb/> of Canada that they will deal with this Con<lb break="no"/>vention. That
                  would be the next step that this <lb/> Convention would hear about, if the motion
                  is <lb/> adopted. Two or three weeks from now a reply <lb/> would be brought in to
                  us through you, sir, that <lb/> the Government of Canada would or would not <lb/>
                  receive a delegation from this National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. If it would
                  not receive such a delegation, <lb/> then the matter dies so far as this
                  Convention and <lb/> the succeeding national referendum are con<lb break="no"/>cerned. On the other hand, if the Government of <lb/> Canada will receive a
                  delegation of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and to those delegates impart the
                  terms as <lb/> that government saw them, of confederation of <lb/> Newfoundland
                  with Canada, then it would still <lb/> be some time after that word was received
                  before <lb/> the delegation could go. I do not see myself, in <lb/> the nature of
                  things, in the circumstances, how <lb/> any such delegation could actually go
                  before <lb/> some time in December and possibly some time <lb/> in the month of
                  January. By December or by <lb/> January this Convention, we hope, if it is not to
                  <lb/> sit here forever, will have received a number of <lb/> reports from the
                  committees and will have com<lb break="no"/>pleted its debate on some of these
                  reports and will <lb/> probably have them, or nearly all of them, in hand <lb/>
                  and under discussion. These reports are the data <lb/> and facts of Commission
                  government; they are <lb/> the data and facts of responsible government; the <lb/>
                  thing we lack is the facts and data of confed<lb break="no"/>eration. If any
                  gentleman in this House will move <lb/> that we approach the Government of the
                  United <lb/> Kingdom seeking to learn from them what help, <lb/> if any, they will
                  give this country under Commis<lb break="no"/>sion Government, I will support that
                  motion. If <lb/> any gentleman moves that we approach the <lb/> United States, not
                  for federal union, because that <lb/> is not allowed unless we pass a resolution
                     extra<lb break="no"/>legal and extra-constitutional, and that I will not <lb/>
                  support; I will support any motion proposing any <lb/>
                  <cb/> approach to any part of the British Empire or the <lb/> British
                  Commonwealth, and if it is in the best <lb/> interests of the people of this
                  country (and I <lb/> repeat that) to affiliate with Great Britain as <lb/>
                  Northern Ireland is; to affilliate with Timbuctoo <lb/> or Canada if it is in the
                  interest of the people of <lb/> this country, I am for it and I will support any
                  <lb/> such motion. Because I feel that the people of this <lb/> country are fully
                  entitled to have all the facts <lb/> about any kind of government, including
                     Com<lb break="no"/>mission, including responsible, including union <lb/> with
                  Canada or with anyone else. I feel I have no <lb/> right to deny the people those
                  facts; I feel that this <lb/> Convention has no right to deny the people of this
                  <lb/> country the facts about any kind of government <lb/> that is within the
                  British Commonwealth. <lb/>

                  part of the month of <lb/>December we are debating the various reports of <lb/>the
                  above committees, and perhaps carry those <lb/>debates over into the month of

                  <lb/>government and responsible government, be<lb break="no"/>cause that's what
                  these reports are, having then <lb/>done that, we decide rather late, maybe up in
                  the <lb/>winter, that we have none of the facts of con<lb break="no"/>federation.
                  It could be a month or two months <lb/>after we had decided to seek those facts
                  from <lb/>Canada before we got them. It might be up in the <lb/>month or March or
                  April before we have the facts <lb/>of confederation. That is why, sir, I oppose
                  the <lb/>amendment moved by my friend Mr. Penney, on <lb/>the ground that delay,
                  for even a month or two, <lb/>might result in our debating the facts of con<lb break="no"/>federation in March, April or May of next year, <lb/>by which time
                  the Convention should be over and <lb/>forgotten. If we are going to debate it in
                  January <lb/>we have to adopt the motion now, and that's why <lb/>I oppose Mr.

                  am going to ask Mr. Smallwood <lb/>what he meant by what he said in the lobby of

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> I have listened to the speakers <lb/> and I
                  think the great majority of them are not so <lb/> much against this inquiry to
                  Canada, except that <lb/>
                  <cb/> they are against this particular time to send this <lb/> inquiry. I am not a
                  confederate. I am something <lb/> in Mr. Higgins' class. I am not sold on the idea
                  <lb/> of confederation, or on the idea of responsible <lb/> government, nor on the
                  idea of Commission of <lb/> Government, but we have to ask Canada for at <lb/>
                  least particular terms which she is willing to give <lb/> Newfoundland in
                  confederation. Because, <lb/> whether these 45 men like it or not, there are <lb/>
                  people in Newfoundland today who favour <lb/> confederation, and they must be
                  given an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to vote for or against it. Now I come from
                  <lb/> a district where, as Mr. Hollett will agree, we <lb/> were not told to come
                  in here to support any <lb/> particular form of government, but we were told <lb/>
                  to judge for ourselves the suitable form of <lb/> government and put it before our
                  people, so that <lb/> they could select the form of government they <lb/> desired.
                  I think, Mr. Chairman, that there has <lb/> been a good deal of opinion that we
                  are here to <lb/> settle the form of government for Newfoundland. <lb/> We are not
                  in here to choose anything, but we are <lb/> here to consider and discuss, and
                  then finally to <lb/> recommend to the people certain forms of <lb/> government.
                  There has been some reference <lb/> made to terms of reference of the Convention,
                  <lb/> and there is nothing to prevent any member from <lb/> choosing two forms of
                  government to put before <lb/> his people, the people are finally those to make
                  <lb/> the choice. Now then, Mr. Chairman, in speaking <lb/> of this amendment, if
                  this Convention feels that <lb/> it has to get this information from Canada, why
                  <lb/> not do it now? Why wait two or three months, or <lb/> weeks? Get the
                  machinery in motion. Whether <lb/> we like it or not I think we have to get that
                  <lb/> particular information. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> I stand here definitely opposed to <lb/>
                  confederation at the present time, but this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion that Mr.
                  Smallwood has brought in, to my <lb/> mind is one of the most important that has
                  come <lb/> on the floor of this house up to the present time, <lb/> and I feel
                  that I would not be playing fair to my <lb/> district if I did not say a word or
                  two about it. I <lb/> am very well aware that we have many people in <lb/> this
                  country today who believe in confederation. <lb/> They may be right or they may be
                  wrong. I <lb/> personally am opposed to it at the present time. I <lb/> am not
                  prepared to argue the point just at this <lb/> stage. The main fact is that there
                  are many people <lb/> who are supporters of confederation. We must <lb/> remember,
                  sir, that they are Newfoundlanders <lb/>

                  <fw type="dateline">October 1946</fw> like ourselves, and whatever other delegates
                  may <lb/> do I am not prepared to say to that New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, "No,
                  my mind is closed against it, <lb/> closed against federation." I am not prepared
                  to <lb/> say to them that I won't listen to anything con<lb break="no"/>nected
                  with confederation. I am prepared to listen <lb/> to whatever terms can be found.
                  I am not prepared <lb/> to take any attitude against the resolution at the <lb/>
                  present time. I for one cannot see how this Con<lb break="no"/>vention can turn a
                  deaf ear to this resolution. <lb/> Many of our people believe in it. Many others
                  <lb/> who may not yet believe in it now, if they get the <lb/> terms, may yet
                  believe in it. I am not prepared to <lb/> deny them the chance to get the facts.
                  If con<lb break="no"/>federation is to be a possibility in Newfoundland, <lb/>
                  special terms would doubtless be necessary. If <lb/> the Convention should decide
                  that a delegation <lb/> should be sent to Ottawa, I think in all fairness, <lb/>
                  another delegation should be sent to England. <lb/> Certainly there are
                  possibilities of her helping her <lb/> oldest charge, and it is now that we want
                  to find <lb/> this out. If I voted against this resolution I would <lb/>
                  <cb/> be voting against getting facts, so I am voting to <lb/> support it. When
                  this resolution is passed it will <lb/> give us the information we want. Then, and
                  not <lb/> until then, will I make up my mind on this whole <lb/> confederation
                  business, and the people as a whole <lb/> will make up their minds. I do not
                  commit myself <lb/> to this. I do not see how we can do so. This is our <lb/>
                  duty, sir. Let us as members sent here by the <lb/> people perform that duty.
                  <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I was about to rise, sir, to propose <lb/> the

                  there is <lb/> a very real danger that the merits of the question <lb/> under

     Mr. Chairman Orders of the day: Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     committee of the whole on the report of the 
     <lb/>
     Education Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett Before proceeding into committee 
     <lb/>
     of the whole, there was a point raised which was 
     <lb/>
     of very great interest not only to members of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, but to the whole country generally, 
     <lb/>
     and which should be disposed of one way or 
     <lb/>
     another before we go into a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     whole to discuss the reports on education and 
     <lb/>
     forestry. If we could get around to discussing that 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     particular matter and deciding the issue first we 
     <lb/>
     would probably make more progress. I move, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that the discussion on the Education 
     <lb/>
     and Forestry Reports be allowed to stand over, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Newcll be allowed to proceed with his 
     <lb/>
     resolution, and that we resume the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     motion to send a delegate to Canada.

     Motion to send a Delegation to Canada1

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, before Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Newell proceeds would it be in order to ask you, 
     <lb/>
     or alternatively Professor Wheare, to express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the propriety, or rather the authority 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention's sending a delegation to con<lb break="no"/>fer with the Govemment of Canada, assuming 
     <lb/>
     always that the Convention decided to send such 
     <lb/>
     a delegation? I think perhaps it would be quite 
     <lb/>
     helpful to the gentlemen here if we had some 
     <lb/>
     knowledge as to our authority, should the motion 
     <lb/>
     be adopted, to proceed... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Do you refer your question  
     <lb/> <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Smallwood? I will answer if you like. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I would like an 
     <lb/>
     opinion from both of you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman You are not taking any chances! 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Smallwood Quite, sir. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Insofar as my opinion is con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cemed, Mr. Smallwood, I think it is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     competent for the Convention, if it so desires, to 
     <lb/>
     send a delegation to Ottawa, if the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government is prepared to receive such a delega<lb break="no"/>tion, to elicit information as to the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions upon the basis of which the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government may be prepared to consider the
