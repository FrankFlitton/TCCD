     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I move that the first 
     <lb/>item on the order paper be deferred, and draw 
     <lb/>your attention, and the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>the fact that a couple of questions have not been 
     <lb/>answered — one I asked on Friday last in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the Savings Bank, and another one 
     <lb/>asked on November 24. Part of it has been 
     <lb/>answered; and another part has not been 
     <lb/>answered, that is the part relative to the Bank of 
     <lb/>Canada. I am very anxious that we be either 
     <lb/>denied such an answer or given one, because as I 
     <lb/>said on Friday, these two particular matters are of 
     <lb/>the utmost importance, one part on the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Savings Bank, and the other part on 
     <lb/>the Bank of Canada. Our whole discussion rests, 
     <lb/>in my opinion, on these two matters. I would like 
     <lb/>to have the Secretary ask the government whether 
     <lb/>we are going to get these answers or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> With regard to your question 
     <lb/>
     about the Savings Bank, Major Cashin, I am 
     <lb/>
     afraid I will have to assume responsibility be<lb break="no"/>cause for some unexplainable reason it escaped 
     <lb/>
     my attention until this afternoon. It was tabled 
     <lb/>
     Friday, and I missed it, and it was not until this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon that my attention was drawn to it. Im<lb break="no"/>mediately after I called a meeting of the Informa<lb break="no"/>tion Committee, and it will go forward to the 
     <lb/>
     government this afternoon; but its delay is my 
     <lb/>
     fault. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I know we will get it Tuesday or 
     <lb/>
     Wednesday, or we should get it, but the other is 
     <lb/>
     of the utmost importance, and our request has 
     <lb/>
     been absolutely ignored. It was asked on Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 24, and today is January 12, and we have not 
     <lb/>
     received any reply. We have received replies to 
     <lb/>
     other questions regarding Canadian financial 
     <lb/>
     matters, but this particular one has been ignored 
     <lb/>
     so far.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> And your request is that a sup<lb break="no"/>plementary application be directed immediately 
     <lb/>
     to the Governor in Commission? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That the Secretary would com<lb break="no"/>municate with the Government in Commission,

     that is Mr. Carew I take it, the Secretary of the

     been done about these two questions. All he has

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I will move that 
     <lb/>
     motion, but in doing so I would like to get a little 
     <lb/>
     information. The debate on these confederation 
     <lb/>
     terms is coming rapidly to an end, it will come to 
     <lb/>
     an end this week, and I take it that a number of 
     <lb/>
     members in the Convention desire to speak, and 
     <lb/>
     I am wondering just what is the right method, and 
     <lb/>
     the best method, of deciding who may and who 
     <lb/>
     may not speak. Now I took particular notice of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that when Major Cashin gave a nod to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fogwill, he got up to speak, and when Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin gave a nod to Mr. Higgins, Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     got up and spoke. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I rise to a point of order. I never 
     <lb/>
     gave any nod to Mr. Fogwill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You will pardon me, but I saw 
     <lb/>
     him give a nod to Mr. Fogwill, and also to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins. Now what I want to know is this, to 
     <lb/>
     whom is the next nod to be given, after Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins finishes? Is Mr. Cashin to give the nod, 
     <lb/>
     or Mr. Higgins? If Mr. Butt, for example, is to 
     <lb/>
     follow Mr. Higgins, will he wait till Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     gives the nod, or will he watch Major Cashin to 
     <lb/>
     get the nod from him. Well, sir, would he get it  
     <lb/>
     from you? Who is Chairman here? Who decides, 
     <lb/>
     and who does not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I rise to a point of order. This is 
     <lb/>
     entirely immaterial in every way. Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood has no reason under heaven to make such 
     <lb/>
     an assertion. It is entirely improper for him to do 
     <lb/>
     so, and as far as Major Cashin giving me a nod, 
     <lb/>
     if he did I did not see it, and as far as I know he 
     <lb/>
     did not give me a nod.... There is no giving nods 
     <lb/>
     around here. As far as I am concerned there's no 
     <lb/>
     giving nods to people. Mr. Smallwood has been 
     <lb/>
     giving nods himself a long time now. We will 
     <lb/>
     give our own nods. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The position, as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned is just simply this: that the person who 
     <lb/>
     catches my eye gets the floor. I am not supposed 
     <lb/>
     to see anything else, and I don't see anything 
     <lb/>
     else.... All I can simply say is this: that as far as I 
     <lb/>
     know the person who first got my eye was the 
     <lb/>
     person who got the floor, except on one occasion 
     <lb/>
     when Major Cashin and you occupied the floor 
     <lb/>
     simultaneously, and in that particular instance I 
     <lb/>
     feel, Mr. Smallwood, that you have no reason to

            <fw type="num">1100</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
  

     be aggrieved, because if I remember rightly, I 
     <lb/>
     gave you priority over Major Cashin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was speaking now of the 
     <lb/>
     debate in the last few days, and for the next few 
     <lb/>
     days. I was just anxious that any member decid<lb break="no"/>ing to speak should get the chance to speak 
     <lb/>
     without receiving a nod from anyone except from 
     <lb/>
     you as Chairman. I move the house into committee. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Before the House goes into com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole, in connection with this nod<lb break="no"/>ding business, as Mr. Higgins said, Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood has been nodding his head ever since 
     <lb/>this confederation issue was brought in here. It's 
     <lb/>been most atrocious what has been happening. 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood introduced this matter into the 
     <lb/>House, and after every delegate has spoken, in<lb break="no"/>stead of waiting until everyone who had anything 
     <lb/>to say has finished, and then replying right away, 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood has been up contradicting him, 
     <lb/>and consequently this debate has gone on too 
     <lb/>long. It could have been over before now but for 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood, I think that's quite patent to all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is quite patent. As a matter of 
     <lb/>fact on that point standing order 572 puts the 
     <lb/>position thus: "The main difference between 
     <lb/>proceedings of the Committee and that of the 
     <lb/>House is that in the former the member is able to 
     <lb/>speak more than once in order that the details of 
     <lb/>the question or bill may be given the most minute 
     <lb/>examination, or as is commonly expressed, to 
     <lb/>have more freedom of speech, and that argument 
     <lb/>may be used <hi rendition="simple:italic">pro et contra</hi>, so that this un<lb break="no"/>restricted right of debate is not taken advantage 
     <lb/>of to any great extent." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In other words it should not take a 
     <lb/>
     half hour to say "yes" or "no". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If members are not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     do so of their own accord they should be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to abide by the rules of debate. In this 
     <lb/>
     particular instance ... all I can say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, is that before I put the closure motion 
     <lb/>
     I will endeavour to see that you get the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of replying once. Beyond that I am not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to go. Nor will I give you any guarantee, 
     <lb/>
     or any other member, that he will be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     address the Chair at any time because naturally 
     <lb/>
     the person to whom I must give the floor is the 
     <lb/>
     person who catches my eye, whether he is 
     <lb/>
     nodded, or prompted or prodded into doing it by 
     <lb/>
     anyone else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like to draw 
   

            <cb/>
          

     to your attention the fact that we have night 
     <lb/>
     sessions this week. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is my intention, by and with 
     <lb/>
     the permission of the House, and if we have a 
     <lb/>
     quorum, to hold sessions on Monday, Tuesday 
     <lb/>
     and Thursday evenings as previously agreed. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have not got the

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Not permitted by me to speak, 
     <lb/>Mr. Fogwill, it was your right to address the 
     <lb/>Chair. The Chair recognised you, and as far as I 
     <lb/>am concerned you were rightly entitled to the 
     <lb/>floor, or you would not have got the floor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Thank you. I got the floor when I 
     <lb/>
     rose to my feet. As far as this getting the nod, 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Smallwood has accused someone of 
     <lb/>
     giving to me, I think the person who made the 
     <lb/>
     accusation is only trying to make political capital 
     <lb/>
     out of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of 
     <lb/>
     privilege. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Please state your point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I want to refer to what Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     just said. There is an implication behind it, that 
     <lb/>
     someone nods to me, and then I speak. Nobody 
     <lb/>
     in this house or out of it nods to me. The only 
     <lb/>
     person who nods to me is my wife as far as I 
     <lb/>
     know, and when she does, I move! But in the 
     <lb/>
     sense in which Mr. Smallwood has used it, it is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely untrue. Further than that it is a wonder 
     <lb/>
     that I have had the patience that I have been able 
     <lb/>
     to muster the past few weeks. I butted in once and 
     <lb/>
     made a comment and quoted two authorities. The 
     <lb/>
     reply I got was, "All the economists in the world 
     <lb/>
     will look upon that as a childish idea." I pointed 
     <lb/>
     out on another occasion that a thing was man<lb break="no"/>datory, and what comment did I get? "Trash and 
     <lb/>
     nonsense." The only thing I can see is that I must 
     <lb/>
     have been nodding at that time, or there would 
     <lb/>
     have been hell to pay! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not concerned with the 
     <lb/>
     motive or motives which prompt members into 
     <lb/>
     occupying the floor. That is a matter for their sole 
     <lb/>
     concern. I am simply concerned with one thing, 
     <lb/>
     to insure that a member shall occupy the floor at 
     <lb/>
     the time he is fairly entitled to it, and beyond that 
     <lb/>
     I am not going. Therefore it is only a waste of 
     <lb/>
     time to draw my attention to suggested motives 
     <lb/>
     upon which I, for obvious reasons, can make no

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Thank you, sir. Before adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment on Friday, I had been elaborating at some 
     <lb/>
     length on the value of our strategical, geographi<lb break="no"/>cal position, and its particular value to the two 
     <lb/>
     countries immediately adjoining us, the United 
     <lb/>
     States and Canada. I am going to go on from 
     <lb/>
     there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I stated that Canada is as yet, politically, an 
     <lb/>
     immature country. It is only slowly realising its 
     <lb/>
     own individuality. It is not therefore to be ex<lb break="no"/>pected that it would have as clear-cut a policy as 
     <lb/>
     has the United States. Until June, 1940 it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible to secure much attention to arguments 
     <lb/>
     urging that Canada should assume responsibility 
     <lb/>
     for Newfoundland; it was too remote for the 
     <lb/>
     average Canadian to know much about, and since 
     <lb/>
     it was part of the Empire, there was no need to 
     <lb/>
     worry about it. Canada's failure to take any part 
     <lb/>
     in the effort taken in 1933 to put this country on 
     <lb/>
     its feet springs in a large measure from this cause. 
     <lb/>
     So too, in the American bases deal. A nation 
     <lb/>
     conscious of itself and jealous for its future would 
     <lb/>
     have been ready to undertake the complete job in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, rather than to have even the 
     <lb/>
     friendliest of neutrals do it, with political results 
     <lb/>
     still to be determined. Things were moving 
     <lb/>
     quickly in the summer of 1940, and there was a 
     <lb/>
     suggestion of panic about. But even so, the grant 
     <lb/>
     by Great Britain of what is virtually territorial 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty in an island adjacent to Canada, 
     <lb/>
     which was once close to entering the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     confederation, and which administers an impor<lb break="no"/>tant area of the continent (Labrador) that had 
     <lb/>
     been handed over to it by Canada's acquiescence 
     <lb/>
     in a decision of arbitration (1927) largely because 
     <lb/>
     it was all in the family, was a rather extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     proceeding. It was only to be defended because 
     <lb/>
     of the exigencies of the moment, and because it 
     <lb/>
     was felt at the time that the United States was also 
     <lb/>
     one of the family. The Canadian government has 
     <lb/>
     since attempted to recover the situation by the 
     <lb/>
     protocol it secured to the bases agreement of 
     <lb/>
     1941. Paragraph 1 of this protocol is as follows: 
     <lb/>
     "It is recognised that the defence, and as such is 
     <lb/>
     a matter of special concern to the Canadian 
   

            <cb/>
          

     Government".

     I wish at this time to draw your attention to the 
     <lb/>
     answer received by Mr. Hollett to this question 
     <lb/>

     I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask

     Government of the United Kingdom for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of this Convention on the following 
     <lb/>
     point: that is to say, that whereas under the

     America and the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland.

     By confederation Canada is again attempting 
     <lb/>
     to recover the situation in which it finds itself as 
     <lb/>
     a result of the grant of the United States bases, 
     <lb/>
     and as you will appreciate fully, by confederation 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government takes the place of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom government in its dealings with 
     <lb/>
     the United States arising out of the bases deal. 
     <lb/>
     Canada further attempted to repair the damage 
     <lb/>
     done by the grant of sovereignty of part of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to the United States, by the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of Mr. Charles Burchell K.C. as High 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner to Newfoundland, constituting 
     <lb/>
     the first political or diplomatic connection 
     <lb/>
     Canada has had with the island. This office is 
     <lb/>
     being continued and we still have here a High 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner for Canada, as well as a Trade 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner. One of Mr. Burchell's first acts 
     <lb/>
     was the securing of a 99-year lease to the areas at 
     <lb/>
     Goose Bay, and in the same year, 1941, the title 
     <lb/>
     to the land required for the airport at Torbay. I 
     <lb/>
     will say, in fairness to Mr. Burchell, that the 
     <lb/>
     leased land at Labrador is under an entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent agreement than this bases lease... As far 
     <lb/>
     as Goose Bay is concerned Newfoundland cus<lb break="no"/>toms duties apply, and I think we have to thank 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Burchell for that. Gentlemen, that is the 
     <lb/>
     position of the strategic importance of New<lb break="no"/>foundland.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Point of order. Is it in order for 
     <lb/>
     a member of this Convention instead of in a 
     <lb/>
     speech, offering his own words, to copy words 
     <lb/>
     out of a book and read them as though they were 
     <lb/>
     his own? Because I have here in front of me the 
     <lb/>
     very book from which Mr. Higgins in his speech 
     <lb/>
     was quoting word for word, without saying he 
     <lb/>
     was quoting from a book, without naming the 
     <lb/>
     author as he did on Friday. I can quote the words 
     <lb/>
     from page 488, in a book by Mr. MacKay<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref>.... The 
     <lb/>
     point of order, sir, is this: is Mr. Higgins per<lb break="no"/>mitted to parade in the verbal clothing of another 
     <lb/>
     man, without telling the house and the country 
     <lb/>
     that what he is doing is using another man's 
     <lb/>
     words as his own speech? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> May I go on, sir? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
          
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a moment, Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>
     please. The fact that Mr. Higgins used language 
     <lb/>
     identical, or substantially identical, with that 
     <lb/>
     employed by Dr. MacKay may be sheer coin<lb break="no"/>cidence, or it may be plagiarism. I do not know, 
     <lb/>
     and I don't think I should be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     decide.

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I did not quote it exactly, but I did

            <p>
     I am not prepared to say that such a union 
     <lb/>
     would not be a good thing for Newfoundland, but 
     <lb/>
     I do say that before Newfoundland should decide 
     <lb/>
     on such a union the matter would have to be much 
     <lb/>
     more thoroughly investigated than it has been up 
     <lb/>
     to the present time. I believe the delegation that 
     <lb/>
     went to Ottawa has gone a long way in its ex<lb break="no"/>ploratory talks, but I am far from convinced that 
     <lb/>
     it has gone sufficiently far, or was sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     competent to make a recommendation to the 
     <lb/>
     people that federal union with Canada is the best 
     <lb/>
     solution for Newfoundland. I say that quite sin<lb break="no"/>cerely, because if I was convinced that con<lb break="no"/>federation was the best solution for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, no matter what my personal feel<lb break="no"/>ing would be, I would vote for it. At the present 
     <lb/>
     time all I can say is that it has sufficient promise 
     <lb/>
     to bear further investigation. Now as I said ear<lb break="no"/>lier, and at the expense of repetition, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. The union of Canada and Newfoundland ap<lb break="no"/>pears to have prospects of good for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Unless and until the idea has been given a full 
     <lb/>
     and careful exploration by a competent body, it 
     <lb/>
     would not be wise to make a decision to have 
     <lb/>
     federal union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. The only way that this matter should be ac<lb break="no"/>complished is by an elected government having 
     <lb/>
     full powers, and with all the assistance, both 
     <lb/>
     technical and clerical, necessary for such an im<lb break="no"/>portant matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have given this whole idea very careful con<lb break="no"/>sideration, as I know all you gentlemen here 
     <lb/>
     have, and I am honestly and sincerely convinced 
     <lb/>
     that the best interests of Newfoundland require 


<note xml:id="fn_01">[1] R.A. MacKay (ed), <hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland: Economic, Diplomatic, and Strategic Studies</hi> (Toronto, 1946).</note>

     that an elected government of Newfoundlanders, 
     <lb/>
     pledged to undertake this investigation into con<lb break="no"/>federation, is the only proper solution of the 
     <lb/>
     confederation issue. That is my advice to those of 
     <lb/>
     you who feel that confederation is the best solu<lb break="no"/>tion for Newfoundland. However, I want to say 
     <lb/>
     quite emphatically, that I am far from convinced 
     <lb/>
     that we can't do a better job running our own 
     <lb/>
     affairs. You hear the oft-repeated question, "Oh, 
     <lb/>
     we have not the men, where are we going to get 
     <lb/>
     the leaders?" That is nothing else but pure pop<lb break="no"/>pycock. The more contacts I have had with 
     <lb/>
     people outside Newfoundland, the more it makes 
     <lb/>
     me realise that we have in this country ample 
     <lb/>
     material to provide the type of men to do the job 
     <lb/>
     properly. Remember, if we had federal union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada, we would have to provide the men 
     <lb/>
     to go to Ottawa, and to man the provincial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment here, and if we have to get that number of 
     <lb/>
     men, surely we can get the number of men re<lb break="no"/>quired to run responsible government. I see no 
     <lb/>
     reason at all why we have to enter confederation. 
     <lb/>
     We are self-supporting at the present time, we all 
     <lb/>
     admit that, and it is up to us as a people to 
     <lb/>
     continue to be self-supporting. We have been told 
     <lb/>
     that under confederation there would be great 
     <lb/>
     advantages to Newfoundland. That may be so, 
     <lb/>
     but you gentlemen are old enough to know that 
     <lb/>
     you never get something for nothing, and that for 
     <lb/>
     this country to continue its present standard of 
     <lb/>
     living, and to increase that standard, is dependent 
     <lb/>
     primarily on the resources of the country itself. 
     <lb/>
     That is one inescapable fact. If our own resources 
     <lb/>
     are unable to produce a good livelihood for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, then no form of 
     <lb/>
     government is going to do so. That is one basic 
     <lb/>
     fact that nobody can dispute, nobody in this Con<lb break="no"/>vention or out of it. It may be true that some of 
     <lb/>
     our services would be improved, but essentially 
     <lb/>
     the country itself must provide for the people of 
     <lb/>
     the country, and all over the world today you have 
     <lb/>
     people fighting for the right to govern themsel<lb break="no"/>ves. Here in Newfoundland some of us are fight<lb break="no"/>ing against the right to govern ourselves. What 
     <lb/>
     manner of people are we at all? Have we lost the 
     <lb/>
     courage of our forefathers, have we forgotten the 
     <lb/>
     value of our country? Do we want to be pen<lb break="no"/>sioners, to live off the charity of some other 
     <lb/>
     country? Someone has to provide a living for us, 
     <lb/>
     and this at a time when our country is in the 
     <lb/>
     strongest position it has ever been. To my card<lb break="yes"/>
        

            <cb/>
 
playing friends I say we are sitting with a pat 
     <lb/>
     hand, and people want us to throw in the hand and 
     <lb/>
     get a new deal. What absolute nonsense! 
     <lb/>
     Gentlemen, it would be the worst form of mad<lb break="no"/>ness, and the most arrant cowardice on the part 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this country if we don't agree to 
     <lb/>
     assume our own rightful obligation of governing 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. I don't believe the fact can be repeated 
     <lb/>
     too often that the arrangements made with the 
     <lb/>
     British government, by the inauguration of the 
     <lb/>
     Commission government, was that responsible 
     <lb/>
     government would be restored to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     when we were self-supporting, and upon request 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland people. Is this not the first 
     <lb/>
     step? With all my heart and mind I recommend 
     <lb/>
     you to the adoption of that course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Once again I would refer you back to that 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic Charter signed August 12, 1941, by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of Great Britain, at that time 
     <lb/>
     Winston Churchill, and the President of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, the late Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
     <lb/>
     Quoting that paragraph: "They respect the right 
     <lb/>
     of a people to choose the form of government 
     <lb/>
     under which they live, and they wish to see 
     <lb/>
     sovereign rights and self-government restored to 
     <lb/>
     those who have been forcibly deprived of them." 
     <lb/>
     Well, if we have not been forcibly deprived of 
     <lb/>
     self-government, we went very close to that par<lb break="no"/>ticular point. There is an old Latin tag that I 
     <lb/>
     remember, "Wrong is done by force or fraud". If 
     <lb/>
     we did not lose our government by force we lost 
     <lb/>
     it by the wrong of fraud. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would have you consider, in closing, an 
     <lb/>
     article by the late Sir William Allardyce, who was 
     <lb/>
     Governor of Newfoundland in 1924, an article 
     <lb/>
     which is pertinent today:

     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Federal Taxation</hi>. The federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment has authority under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act to levy direct taxes, and sole 
     <lb/>
     authority to levy indirect taxes. At the time 
     <lb/>
     of confederation the former field of taxation 
     <lb/>
     was quite unimportant, but the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of the income tax in 1917 greatly increased 
     <lb/>
     its importance as a source of revenue, until 
     <lb/>
     today the federal government collects about 
     <lb/>
     30% more revenue through direct taxation 
     <lb/>
     than through indirect. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I don't know what you think about that, but it 
     <lb/>
     appears to me that that is the official lie of official 
     <lb/>
     liars, or something like that. You will find out 
     <lb/>
     from 1946 and 1947 the direct taxes of Canada 
     <lb/>
     were $1,155,000,000, and the indirect were 
     <lb/>
     $1,045,000,000. Where does the 30% come in? 
     <lb/>
     There's another answer to this question. I made 
     <lb/>
     a statement standing here over a year ago that we 
     <lb/>
     were signed, sealed and delivered, and that a 5 
     <lb/>
     cent stamp or a taxi fare could bring the terms 
     <lb/>
     into this house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If we will go back to 1946-47 we will find that 
     <lb/>
     the direct taxes of Canada were $1,436,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     and the indirect were $1,122,000,000. I have the 
     <lb/>
     lot, the 1945-46 taxes were $1,453,373,000, and 
     <lb/>
     indirect $821,485,000. I will skip the others, and 
     <lb/>
     we will go back to 1942-43, and we find that the 
     <lb/>
     direct taxes of Canada were $1,378,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     while the indirect taxes were $758,677,000. Now 
     <lb/>
     I don't know much about percentages, when the 
     <lb/>
     time was for me to learn percentages, I was given 
     <lb/>
     a haul hook to try to get a few logs out of the 
     <lb/>
     woods so that I could eat, but there is the position. 
     <lb/>
     This summer, when the Ottawa delegation came 
     <lb/>
     back, mention was made of the lot of work they 
     <lb/>
     had done, and the amount of stuff they brought 
     <lb/>
     back; but if the Black Book is right on the 30% 
     <lb/>
     business, it goes a lot further back because the 
     <lb/>
     difference of $110 million today between the two 
     <lb/>
     don't work out together. I am not going to say any 


            <cb/>
       

     more, but I am going to leave it to you gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     here. I think you have got savvy enough to 
     <lb/>
     remember this: that this was got ready for us, and 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing was worked out so that we would 
     <lb/>
     fall right into the trap. Now I am going to quote 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister Winston Churchill: "I wonder 
     <lb/>
     what manner of men they think we are". Is it 
     <lb/>
     possible that they can push that stuff in print and 
     <lb/>
     shove it down our throats and expect us to believe 
     <lb/>
     it? I said it here to my own men who believe in 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, that it was prepost<lb break="no"/>erous, and it could not be, but it was and is so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now referring back to our first subject — 
     <lb/>
     taxes that our sister provinces are paying today 
     <lb/>
     (if we become a sister province) — that is some<lb break="no"/>thing that I have been trying to get a hold of, so 
     <lb/>
     that I could tell the people of this country the kind 
     <lb/>
     of taxes we are going to get up against when we 
     <lb/>
     change over from what we are today. Now don't 
     <lb/>
     think I am against the kind of taxes they have in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. One thing we found out since we came 
     <lb/>
     here is that the economy of our country is around 
     <lb/>
     $80 million. I don't think it is any more, and I 
     <lb/>
     firmly believe that if our economy were doubled 
     <lb/>
     to $160 million, I would consider this confedera<lb break="no"/>tion very quick, because I think their form of 
     <lb/>
     taxation could be worked on the people, and the 
     <lb/>
     service that it calls for could be given to the 
     <lb/>
     people today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We were brought in here and, as it were, the 
     <lb/>
     confederation issue was thrown into our lap — 
     <lb/>
     everything that would make us understand, a 
     <lb/>
     generation of men without a big lot of schooling, 
     <lb/>
     everything should be put before us so that we 
     <lb/>
     could understand the system of confederation 
     <lb/>
     and what it means. Instead of that we have got up 
     <lb/>
     and painted a rosy picture of "marching up to 
     <lb/>
     Zion" — everything all right. The poor people 
     <lb/>
     don't know anything more about confederation 
     <lb/>
     today than when we came in here. I have been 
     <lb/>
     trying to get it ever since I came in, and thank 
     <lb/>
     God I have got it. This is confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I shall have to refer to localities 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland in comparison with localities 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, to bring my point out, and I hope in 
     <lb/>
     this way to establish a foundation for what I am 
     <lb/>
     trying to bring before the house. It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that we can run this province on so much per 
     <lb/>
     head, $43 per capita. This leaves me in a fault... 
     <lb/>
     Let us review the situation like we should. This 
     <lb/>
     island today is 42,742 square miles, I believe, and

     Labrador 110,000, and we have to spend money 
     <lb/>
     on that too now, with the work started and not 
     <lb/>
     finished; we are going to do this on $14 million 
     <lb/>
     when it is costing us today $30 million. I am not 
     <lb/>
     including today what Canada is going to take 
     <lb/>
     over. What is left to us will cost us $30 million. 
     <lb/>
     What is wrong with everything? I can't remem<lb break="no"/>ber Mr. Smallwood, or any other New<lb break="no"/>foundlander having any experience in provincial 
     <lb/>
     or municipal taxation or spending, so I must look 
     <lb/>
     for it in those provinces that have had it for nearly 
     <lb/>
     100 years, and no doubt through trial and error 
     <lb/>
     have found out the best way to apply it in the way 
     <lb/>
     that will cost the taxpayer the least taxes. So in 
     <lb/>
     looking through the assessment I find that in 
     <lb/>
     many provinces their social service is on a much 
     <lb/>
     higher scale than ours, and the provinces are 
     <lb/>
     paying twice the amount of money which Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is budgeting for, and it does not make 
     <lb/>
     sense to me, for we must face this question in the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book which says that within eight years a 
     <lb/>
     royal commission will be set up, and the question 
     <lb/>
     will be gone into. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think before we consider the question of 
     <lb/>
     confederation at all we should have gone into this 
     <lb/>
     and thrashed it out thoroughly. That would have 
     <lb/>
     been the first step, to get the laws of Canada, their 
     <lb/>
     assessment, their taxation, and it should have 
     <lb/>
     been gone into so that we would know what is 
     <lb/>
     before us in the future. One thing we should have 
     <lb/>
     had was this information, and before our people 
     <lb/>
     vote they too should have it, but it is the last thing 
     <lb/>
     that the powers that be intend that we should 
     <lb/>
     have, so we are faltering along without it. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood made great capital out of belittling 
     <lb/>
     the assistance of the municipal councils in those 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but to look at it from a common sense 
     <lb/>
     point of view, and see what part they play in the 
     <lb/>
     everyday life of our Canadian neighbours, I want 
     <lb/>
     the people to know that in the provinces they play 
     <lb/>
     a leading part. They are well governed, and 
     <lb/>
     without this form we cannot have good govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I only wish our economic system could 
     <lb/>
     stand it, and if I were a praying man I would pray 
     <lb/>
     that day would soon come when we could go into 
     <lb/>
     it in a big way and benefit from it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First they would educate our people how to 
     <lb/>
     govern wisely, give them a sense of respon<lb break="no"/>sibility, for it is the greatest curse of our govern<lb break="no"/>ment in Newfoundland which would be removed 
     <lb/>
     — the curse of one body collecting the taxes and 
   

            <cb/>
         

     another body spending it. People would learn that 
     <lb/>
     the taxes were coming out of their own pocket, 
     <lb/>
     and would realise that they were not to be frittered 
     <lb/>
     away. And last but not least, we would demand 
     <lb/>
     that the taxes be spent for the good of the com<lb break="no"/>munity, and consequently everything would be 
     <lb/>
     better off for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are my convictions. So you see that 
     <lb/>
    although I believe in all there is, yet it is those 
     <lb/>terms, taxes and trade that makes me the anticon<lb break="no"/>federate I am. Now if we had an income to pay 
     <lb/>these taxes without undue hardship, and if we had 
     <lb/>a domestic market in Canada for our products 
     <lb/>whereby we could fill our stomachs with 
     <lb/>Canadian flour and grain feed for our animals, 
     <lb/>then you can pin the maple leaf on my arm right 
     <lb/>away.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Sir, I begin by referring to a 
     <lb/>reply made by Mr. Bradley, member for Bonavis<lb break="no"/>ta East, at one time Chairman of this Convention, 
     <lb/>and also of the Ottawa delegation, to a speech 
     <lb/>made by the Prime Minister of Canada at the first 
     <lb/>meeting of the Newfoundland and Canada 
     <lb/>delegations at Ottawa, on June 25, 1947. I want

     It was a great dream that the founders of 
     <lb/>
     this Canadian union had 80 years ago, when 
     <lb/>
     they foresaw on the northern half of this 
     <lb/>
     continent a vast British nation stretching 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's to Victoria. Two of our own 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders shared that dream and did 
     <lb/>
     what they could to give it birth — Sir Frederic 
     <lb/>
     Carter and Sir Ambrose Shea, who will go 
     <lb/>
     down in history as two of the Fathers of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. Newfoundland did not elect 
     <lb/>
     to enter the new union at that time, but when 
     <lb/>
     we remember that the union itself was very 
     <lb/>
     new, and was not all understood by our 
     <lb/>
     people, and the more important fact that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland did not then enjoy a 
     <lb/>
     democratic franchise or the secret ballot, it is 
     <lb/>
     easy to understand why that first invitation to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to enter the partnership was 
     <lb/>
     rejected. The other rejection was not made by 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland people, for it was not sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to them. That was the occasion, in 
     <lb/>
     1895, when your Dominion was ad<lb break="no"/>ministered by the government headed by Sir 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie Bowell. The failure of that at<lb break="no"/>tempt at federal union of the two countries 
     <lb/>
     was due largely to the hurried nature of the

     explorations and conversations between the 
     <lb/>
     parties, for the conference of 1895 occupied 
     <lb/>
     a mere 12 days. I believe I can say that if the 
     <lb/>
     present discussions come to nothing in the 
     <lb/>
     end by way of effecting federal union be<lb break="no"/>tween us, it will not arise from any repetition 
     <lb/>
     of the inadequate explorations of '95 or from 
     <lb/>
     the undemocratic franchise of '69. We of this 
     <lb/>
     delegation believe it to be our plain duty to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to make as thorough an inves<lb break="no"/>tigation of this whole question as your co<lb break="no"/>operation and forbearance will permit.

            <p>I am sorry Mr. Bradley is not here today; I 
     <lb/>thought he would be by now, but I think it is quite 
     <lb/>in order that, as we draw near to the end of this 
     <lb/>discussion on this great issue which has shaken 
     <lb/>this country and its people to their depths on two 
     <lb/>occasions in our history, as referred to by Mr. 
     <lb/>Bradley, that we should do well to have our minds 
     <lb/>refreshed just a little on the two crises in question

            <p>
     Before the Christmas recess, Mr. Hollett, in a 
     <lb/>
     masterly way I thought, summed up the history 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian confederation from its beginning 
     <lb/>
     with the Quebec resolutions of 1864 down to the 
     <lb/>
     failure of the Dominion-provincial conference a 
     <lb/>
     few years ago, which was held as an outcome of 
     <lb/>
     a famous royal commission. When the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act providing for the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of the British North American colonies was 
     <lb/>
     drawn up, there was a clause in it, and it is still in 
     <lb/>
     it, that allowed for Newfoundland's entry into the 
     <lb/>
     union. Newfoundland representatives attended 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec conference of 1864, when the 
     <lb/>
     framework of the union was set up. Mr., after<lb break="no"/>wards Sir Frederic Carter and Sir Ambrose Shea, 
     <lb/>
     were members of a government which was 
     <lb/>
     favourably inclined to the entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation. Out of this Quebec 
     <lb/>
     conference terms were drawn up as a fair and 
     <lb/>
     equitable basis under which Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     the other colonies might confederate. Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia did 
     <lb/>
     confederate in 1867. Newfoundland was next to 
     <lb/>
     consider the scheme, which was submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     electorate in November of 1869, and turned 
     <lb/>
     down. Manitoba, with a population of a thousand 
     <lb/>
     whites and many thousands of half-breeds, 
     <lb/>
     British Indians, was admitted in 1870, British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia in 1871. Prince Edward Island held 


            <cb/>
      

     aloof till 1873, though a provision for her entry 
     <lb/>
     was written into the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and Saskatchewan were made provinces 
     <lb/>
     in 1905, and it is to be noted that at the time of 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec resolutions these provinces were only 
     <lb/>
     vast unpopulated wildernesses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let's consider first the position of New<lb break="no"/>foundland in relation to the other British colonies 
     <lb/>
     of North America in those far-off days. In 1864 
     <lb/>
     all those colonies were much of a muchness, but 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was in a unique position, as she 
     <lb/>
     has been all through her history. Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     the others were flourishing colonies under the 
     <lb/>
     system of responsible government, which they 
     <lb/>
     had had for several years. Previous to this event, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, Newfoundland was still feeling 
     <lb/>
     her oats as far as her problems were concerned. 
     <lb/>
     She had only won responsible government in 
     <lb/>
     1855, nine years before; she had only been 
     <lb/>
     granted a representative form of government 
     <lb/>
     some 32 years before, while colonies like Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and the rest of them had been enjoying 
     <lb/>
     such institutions for several generations, far back 
     <lb/>
     into the previous century. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The history of Newfoundland up to that time 
     <lb/>
     had been one of repression by the mother 
     <lb/>
     country. The story of retarded colonisation is so 
     <lb/>
     well known now to all of us, or should be, that 
     <lb/>
     there is no need to labour it, but while New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders were loyal to the mother country 
     <lb/>
     they still could not forget the wrong that was done 
     <lb/>
     them, and just ten years before, when the French 
     <lb/>
     had been given concessions on their coast, a great 
     <lb/>
     outcry had been raised, and there was some talk 
     <lb/>
     of joining the United States. Imperial influence 
     <lb/>
     was a touchy point with Newfoundlanders, espe<lb break="no"/>cially when it impinged on their independence so 
     <lb/>
     hard bought and so recently gained, and they 
     <lb/>
     were jealous of it, and they chose their in<lb break="no"/>dividualism, and on that rock confederation 
     <lb/>
     foundered in 1869. There was too much sugges<lb break="no"/>tion of doing what Britain wanted about the 
     <lb/>
     whole matter in Newfoundlanders' eyes, half of 
     <lb/>
     whom at that time were Irish, and full of the 
     <lb/>
     wrongs of Ireland. To show you what I mean: 
     <lb/>
     from the time of the Quebec resolutions, begin<lb break="no"/>ning with the British North America Act, it was 
     <lb/>
     no secret that the British government wanted a 
     <lb/>
     confederation of the North American colonies. 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin referred briefly to that the other 
     <lb/>
     day. That was the whole idea of the Quebec 
  

            <pb n="1107" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1107.jpg"/>

     resolutions. It was to bear out the old adage that 
     <lb/>
     "in unity there is strength", which is not always 
     <lb/>
     so, especially when the union is made up of 
     <lb/>
     groups and forces fundamentally diverse and op<lb break="no"/>posite. The Government of Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     1867, at the time of confederation was, strange to 
     <lb/>
     say, a merchant government. It was led by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Carter, who was strongly pro-confederate. It was 
     <lb/>
     enthusiastic about the proposals submitted, and 
     <lb/>
     which, considering the gap in time, are amazingly 
     <lb/>
     similar to those of the 1895 negotiations and the 
     <lb/>
     proposed arrangements before us today. That 
     <lb/>
     government was ready to consummate the arran<lb break="no"/>gements as had been done in the other colonies, 
     <lb/>
     and which in the case of Nova Scotia almost 
     <lb/>
     provoked a rebellion. But a strong opposition in 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government of this time 
     <lb/>
     fought this move, and amongst other objections 
     <lb/>
     were: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Under union with Canada the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would surrender to a large extent the 
     <lb/>
     power of self-government conferred on them by 
     <lb/>
     the constitutions of 1832 and 1855. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Amongst other rights that would be sur<lb break="no"/>rendered was the all-important one of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     Under the BNA Act the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     claimed the right which they had by law to raise 
     <lb/>
     money within the limits of the Dominion by any 
     <lb/>
     method or system of taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those objections, amongst others, were made 
     <lb/>
     in an amendment to the confederation resolution 
     <lb/>
     moved in this very chamber on the 5 March, 
     <lb/>
     1869. The opposition members strongly urged 
     <lb/>
     that the government should not make any final 
     <lb/>
     irrevocable commitments on the question till it 
     <lb/>
     had been submitted to the electorate in a general 
     <lb/>
     election. Well, that course was adopted, and in 
     <lb/>
     November, 1869, the election was held. It was a 
     <lb/>
     bitter campaign, but not more so than many that 
     <lb/>
     have been fought in Canada on the same question, 
     <lb/>
     and even less so than those that have been fought 
     <lb/>
     in other countries on less fundamental issues. 
     <lb/>
     Charges and counter-charges were the order of 
     <lb/>
     the day, as they have been in every election 
     <lb/>
     campaign, and will be, but the money and in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the many powerful merchants of the 
     <lb/>
     time, who were supporters of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     could not cope with the dynamism and energy of 
     <lb/>
     Charles Fox Bennett, who was leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position. It was a typical election of the time, and 
     <lb/>
     no holds were barred on either side. Of the four 
 

            <cb/>
         

     newspapers of the period, three were confederate 
     <lb/>
     and one was neutral, so it cannot be said that the 
     <lb/>
     people were misled in this regard. Neither is it 
     <lb/>
     fair to state, as Mr. Bradley stated, that New<lb break="no"/>foundland did not enjoy a democratic franchise, 
     <lb/>
     or a secret ballot. Newfoundland enjoyed a 
     <lb/>
     franchise as democratic, and to the same degree 
     <lb/>
     as the other colonies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As for the secret ballot, Mr. Bradley surely 
     <lb/>
     must have known that in 1869 the secret ballot 
     <lb/>
     was unheard of in this part of the world, and not 
     <lb/>
     only in North America but in Great Britain as 
     <lb/>
     well. The secret ballot, as you know, was an 
     <lb/>
     Australian invention, first used in that country in 
     <lb/>
     1856, and the secret ballot is still referred to as 
     <lb/>
     the Australian ballot. Around the process of poll<lb break="no"/>ing great parliamentary fights were waged in the 
     <lb/>
     19th century, and the issue at stake was always to 
     <lb/>
     seek the freedom of the voter from outside in<lb break="no"/>fluences, and honesty in the counting of the votes. 
     <lb/>
     Every election was a time of underground pres<lb break="no"/>sure and interest. One authority says, "Social and 
     <lb/>
     economic interest in more or less organised form, 
     <lb/>
     disturbing constitutional symmetry and advocat<lb break="no"/>ing its equity, threats, intimidation, terrorisation 
     <lb/>
     and victimisation of the most diverse kinds be<lb break="no"/>came operative, and in their obvious indiscrete 
     <lb/>
     forms are forbidden by law everywhere." The 
     <lb/>
     19th century stage relied exclusively upon politi<lb break="no"/>cal parties for their choice of candidates, and even 
     <lb/>
     in many countries for other electoral services and 
     <lb/>
     the distribution of ballot papers. The result of 
     <lb/>
     these tendencies in the United States was the 
     <lb/>
     party boss, the plugging of nominating conven<lb break="no"/>tions with party heelers, the padding of electoral 
     <lb/>
     lists with the names of people who were dead or 
     <lb/>
     non-existent, and the stuffin g of ballot boxes with 
     <lb/>
     illegal votes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now these, Mr. Chairman, as you know, were 
     <lb/>
     exercises of the parliamentary system which have 
     <lb/>
     been largely eradicated today in democratic 
     <lb/>
     countries, but they were practiced in the last 
     <lb/>
     century, when the parliamentary system was in 
     <lb/>
     use in Newfoundland. The election of 1869, in 
     <lb/>
     which the confederate party was annihilated, was 
     <lb/>
     conducted in conformity with similar elections 
     <lb/>
     everywhere in the Anglo-Saxon world, including 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The assertion made in the speech at the 
     <lb/>
     opening of the Ottawa conference last summer, 
     <lb/>
     that the main reason for Newfoundland's failure 
     <lb/>
     to enter confederation in 1869 was due to the

     undemocratic franchise and the absence of the 
     <lb/>
     secret ballot, is hardly fair. It displays an ig<lb break="no"/>norance not only of Newfoundland, but of world 
     <lb/>
     history. South Australia's introduction of the 
     <lb/>
     secret ballot in 1856 did not mean its immediate 
     <lb/>
     application to the rest of the world. England 
     <lb/>
     herself, with her parliamentary government, was 
     <lb/>
     without it until three years after the 1869 election, 
     <lb/>
     and it was introduced into Britain in all par<lb break="no"/>liamentary and municipal elections by the Ballot 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1872, when it spread to America, while up 
     <lb/>
     to 1884 the general practice in the United States 
     <lb/>
     was open voting. After the presidential elections 
     <lb/>
     of that year the Australian ballot system was 
     <lb/>
     extensively adopted. Now I think these things are 
     <lb/>
     relevant to the discussion, otherwise I would not 
     <lb/>
     have gone to the trouble I did during the 
     <lb/>
     Christmas recess, to study and read on this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. If Mr. Smallwood is interested in my sources, 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Encyclopedia Britannica</hi> is one of them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In that election of 1869, nine confederates 
     <lb/>
     were returned and 21 anti.

     more, in the House of Assembly of 30.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> The

     confederate papers of the day screamed about 
     <lb/>
     unfair methods used by their opponents to gain 
     <lb/>
     their seats, but it is a significant fact that New<lb break="no"/>foundland history was made not by confederates 
     <lb/>
     against anticonfederates, but by anticonfederates 
     <lb/>
     against confederates, for in the district of Burin, 
     <lb/>
     Carter and Evans, confederates, were elected by 
     <lb/>
     a matter of a few votes over LeMessurier and 
     <lb/>
     Woods, antis, and a celebrated case arose in 1870 
     <lb/>
     when the Assembly opened, with a question of 
     <lb/>
     who had actually been elected. When the hue and 
     <lb/>
     cry died down, Carter and Evans were sustained. 
     <lb/>
     You can be sure, Mr. Chairman, that if the con<lb break="no"/>federates had any reasonable ground for 
     <lb/>
     suspicion that they had been manoeuvered out of 
     <lb/>
     election by unfair practices, they would be the 
     <lb/>
     first to raise a howl in every district, but as I said, 
     <lb/>
     the only side which did have good grounds for 
     <lb/>
     suspicion of unfair practices was the anticon<lb break="no"/>federate side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now if there is any doubt in our minds that 
     <lb/>
     Britain was pushing confederation in 1869 and 
     <lb/>
     that that fact helped to wreck confederation 
     <lb/>
     plans, here is a little more evidence. On August 
     <lb/>
     25, 1869, nearly three months before that elec<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
       

     tion, the following despatch was received by the 
     <lb/>
     Governor in connection with the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed union, which had been communicated 
     <lb/>
     to the House of Assembly with, as far as I can 
     <lb/>
     learn, none of the ostentatious and rather silly 
     <lb/>
     theatricals which accompanied the reception of 
     <lb/>
     the proposals now under discussion. The 
     <lb/>
     despatches were from Lord Granville, Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State for the Colonies, and said: "I have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed the hope that nothing will occur in New<lb break="no"/>foundland to delay the measures from which I 
     <lb/>
     confidently anticipate advantages to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Government and to the Colony." A 
     <lb/>
     second despatch, sent to the Governor-General of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, said in part: "I believe it is in the interest 
     <lb/>
     of the whole of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Colonies that they should be united under one 
     <lb/>
     government, and Her Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     watches with much interest the successive steps 
     <lb/>
     that are being taken towards the accomplishment 
     <lb/>
     of this great end." That was before the election 
     <lb/>
     was held. And after it was held, when the anticon<lb break="no"/>federate House of Assembly was opened on 
     <lb/>
     February 3, 1870, Governor Hill, in his opening 
     <lb/>
     speech said, amongst other things, with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the question of confederation, "The views of 
     <lb/>
     an enlightened British statesman, and one of the 
     <lb/>
     highest authorities on colonial affairs need no 
     <lb/>
     endorsement from me, for it is quite clear that the 
     <lb/>
     current of opinion and events has strongly set in 
     <lb/>
     towards union, and I firmly trust that nothing will 
     <lb/>
     occur to check, turn or defraud Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     from gliding onward, and that the advance al<lb break="no"/>ready made may be continued until the Colony 
     <lb/>
     joins the Dominion, thus completing the great 
     <lb/>
     end so anxiously desired by the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment." The address in reply, amongst other 
     <lb/>
     things, said, with reference to that paragraph in 
     <lb/>
     the Governor's speech just quoted, "The subject 
     <lb/>
     of the union of this colony with the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada has been largely discussed both within 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     the result has been a settled conviction in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the people that such union would not be 
     <lb/>
     conducive to their essential interests, a con<lb break="no"/>clusion which has manifested itself at the general

     foundland shrink from the idea of linking their 
     <lb/>
     destinies with a Dominion, in the future of which 
     <lb/>
     they can at present see nothing to inspire hope, 
     <lb/>
     but much to create apprehension". Now that last 
     <lb/>
     sentence is important, very important. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those who try to claim that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in 1869 held aloof from con<lb break="no"/>federation only because they fell for a tissue of 
     <lb/>
     lies must be shown, like everybody else, that 
     <lb/>
     there was far more to the reputation of the Carter 
     <lb/>
     government than the fears of sending their sons 
     <lb/>
     away to bleach their bones on the desert sands of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Undoubtedly there was exaggeration on 
     <lb/>
     both sides. There always is and always has been 
     <lb/>
     in election campaigns, as I have pointed out, but 
     <lb/>
     let us consider the nature of the times. The North 
     <lb/>
     American continent was still shaken by the ef<lb break="no"/>fects of the civil war in the United States, and all 
     <lb/>
     sorts of subversive movement was afoot in that 
     <lb/>
     country and in Canada. "The Province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, one of the four which had been inveigled 
     <lb/>
     into adopting the resolution, was regretting it 
     <lb/>
     already ..." says one author, "so much so that on 
     <lb/>
     the 22nd of February, 1868, the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly of Nova Scotia sent an address to the 
     <lb/>
     British Crown, declaring that the Province was 
     <lb/>
     adverse to the measure of Union, and, on an 
     <lb/>
     unsatisfactory reply being received on the 4th of 
     <lb/>
     June the Executive Council sent a further 
     <lb/>
     despatch in which they threatened the possibility 
     <lb/>
     of the Province not only leaving Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     but seceding from the British Empire as well, 
     <lb/>
     observing that there was no change in their politi<lb break="no"/>cal relations which they would not prefer to their 
     <lb/>
     present place in the Confederation". That was 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia's attitude on confederation in 1868. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Prince Edward Island's attitude was plain — 
     <lb/>
     she would stay out. As for British Columbia, as 
     <lb/>
     late as March, 1870, a few months after the '69 
     <lb/>
     election, a speech delivered in the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council said, "The people of this colony have, 
     <lb/>
     generally speaking, no love for Canada. They 
     <lb/>
     care, as a rule, little or nothing about the creation 
     <lb/>
     of another empire, kingdom or republic. They 
     <lb/>
     care little about the distinctions between the 
     <lb/>
     forms of government of Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States". And in that connection, Professor Walter 
     <lb/>
     Sage declared in 1945 that, "In the colonial war, 
     <lb/>
     and even for a time before confederation, 
     <lb/>
     Canadians were unpopular. They were known as 
     <lb/>
     North American Chinamen — a tribute to their 
 

            <cb/>
     

     thrift. They send their money home and do not 
     <lb/>
     spend it so freely as do the open-handed 
     <lb/>
     Americans." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I mentioned too the subversive movements in 
     <lb/>
     the United States and Canada, among which was 
     <lb/>
     the famous Fenian organisation made up of Irish<lb break="no"/>men driven from their homeland, and who were 
     <lb/>
     determined to take a blow at England whenever 
     <lb/>
     and wherever they could. In 1866 they made an 
     <lb/>
     unsuccessful invasion of Canada, a raid it was, 
     <lb/>
     and fought in 1870 from the United States, being 
     <lb/>
     joined by their compatriots in Canada, and in 
     <lb/>
     addition to this movement there was a famous 
     <lb/>
     uprising of the Métis, the French-Indian half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds in Manitoba, under Louis Riel in 1869, 
     <lb/>
     known in Canadian history as "Riel's rebellion"; 
     <lb/>
     add to that dissension and open warfare the 
     <lb/>
     supreme fact that the French Canadians in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, the real Canadians, believed that con<lb break="no"/>federation was an attempt to submerge their iden<lb break="no"/>tity, and although they accepted the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     in principle, were to leave few stones unturned in 
     <lb/>
     after years to my to wreck the union. That was the 
     <lb/>
     union that Newfoundland repudiated, and the 
     <lb/>
     reasons I have given were principally at the bot<lb break="no"/>tom of the mother country's desire why it should 
     <lb/>
     be effected. Confederation was for protection in 
     <lb/>
     the middle of the last century if nothing else. It 
     <lb/>
     was to get the colonies of British North America 
     <lb/>
     under a central government which could be 
     <lb/>
     delegated with the responsibility of defending its 
     <lb/>
     interest against the many internal advances from 
     <lb/>
     races and wolves, and against the external 
     <lb/>
     dangers, principal among which was the growing 
     <lb/>
     republic to the south. Furthermore, at that time 
     <lb/>
     there was little or no communication between the 
     <lb/>
     provinces apart from the few commercial con<lb break="no"/>tacts between the provinces of Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and the Maritimes, but the total value of 
     <lb/>
     trade between them was very small, and between 
     <lb/>
     either Canada or the Maritimes and the farther 
     <lb/>
     west there was practically no commercial 
     <lb/>
     enterprise of any kind, and it was such a hap<lb break="no"/>hazard, loose conglomeration of colonies cover<lb break="no"/>ing a vast and potentially valuable territory, that 
     <lb/>
     made the British government anxious to see them 
     <lb/>
     brought together under a central government. No 
     <lb/>
     wonder, sir, that the anticonfederate party of 
     <lb/>
     1869 was able to convince the electorate that 
     <lb/>
     union would not be conducive to their essential 
     <lb/>
     interest — union with a Dominion in the future

     of which they could see nothing to inspire hope, 
     <lb/>
     but much to create apprehension. Sir, it is not by 
     <lb/>
     the conditions of 1948 that we must pass judge<lb break="no"/>ment on the decision of '69. We must try to see 
     <lb/>
     it as it was, and as they saw it almost 80 years 
     <lb/>
     ago, and be not too sweeping in our judgement, 
     <lb/>
     and endeavour to see the present situation from 
     <lb/>
     every angle, including the question of dollars and 
     <lb/>
     cents, which may seem the most important ques<lb break="no"/>tion to some, but there is more at stake than that. 
     <lb/>

       </p>

            <p>I have pointed out the anxiety with which the 
     <lb/>British government pressed for the confederation 
     <lb/>of the North American colonies, and it is obvious 
     <lb/>that this desire was prompted far more by im<lb break="no"/>perial than colonial interests. The opposition in 
     <lb/>the House of Assembly here after the 1869 elec<lb break="no"/>tions expressed it as their main opinion that con<lb break="no"/>federation had been prevented by first the studied 
     <lb/>determination of some persons of influence to 
     <lb/>oppose the desires of Her Majesty's Government, 
     <lb/>and secondly by the active dissemination of 
     <lb/>Britain, which entirely ignored the true merits of 
     <lb/>the question. And if you want final proof that this 
     <lb/>1869 election was principally brought about by 
     <lb/>imperial planning, listen to what Governor Hill 
     <lb/>said at the closing session of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly in May, 1870: "Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment," he said, "ever awaits the welfare and 
     <lb/>prosperity of her people, and not only approves 
     <lb/>Confederation of Newfoundland with the 
     <lb/>Dominion, but is anxious for its speedy comple<lb break="no"/>tion"; and I, in the light of all the circumstances 
     <lb/>of our history in the 19th century, say that was 
     <lb/>the main rock on which confederation foundered 
     <lb/>— the feeling of coercion that was behind the 
     <lb/>whole movement, the definite pressure that was 
     <lb/>exerted by the Queen's representative in many 
     <lb/>pronouncements, and while the matter of enter<lb break="no"/>ing confederation was in theory a matter of 
     <lb/>choice, it was in fact something of a pressure 
     <lb/>movement, with the realisation that while it was 
     <lb/>being arranged for the colony's protection, it was 
     <lb/>still an end that must be achieved willy nilly.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, was the 
     <lb/>real position as I see it at the close of the 1869 
     <lb/>election, And confederation slept until 1888, 
     <lb/>when due to the efforts of Alfred Morine, a Nova 
     <lb/>Scotian who had adopted Newfoundland as his 
     <lb/>country and gained a reputation here as a lawyer 
     <lb/>as well as a politician, an attempt was made to 
     <lb/>reopen the negotiations, but it fell through, and 
 

            <cb/>
          

     in 1890 the Whiteway government began to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate with the United States for a reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty, and the result was the Bond-Blaine con<lb break="no"/>vention, which never came to anything due to 
     <lb/>
     Canadian interference with the home govern<lb break="no"/>ment; for had not Sir Charles Tupper, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian High Commissioner in London, been 
     <lb/>
     assured by the British government that New<lb break="no"/>foundland would not be allowed to do anything 
     <lb/>
     with the United States until it had been submitted 
     <lb/>
     to his government? There, sir, was the rock on 
     <lb/>
     which confederation foundered again in 1895. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, is it the intention to rise the committee?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> When the House rose this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon I had been speaking on the country's 
     <lb/>
     history from 1869 to 1895, and I had come to a 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the present day situation. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's position has greatly changed 
     <lb/>
     since 1869, and since 1895. In 1927, New<lb break="no"/>foundland gained a possession, the Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     three times as large as itself. Hitherto, she had 
     <lb/>
     been a small island colony whose strategic posi<lb break="no"/>tion, as Mr. Higgins has pointed out, was ignored 
     <lb/>
     until the second World War. Up to that time too, 
     <lb/>
     the United States had not come into its own as a 
     <lb/>
     number one world power. Now the US has as<lb break="no"/>sumed Britain's traditional role in world affairs, 
     <lb/>
     and the US has bases in Newfoundland. Hence it 
     <lb/>
     is now more imperative than ever to get New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation. Hence the state<lb break="no"/>ment that if Newfoundland enters confederation, 
     <lb/>
     Canada will replace Britain as the other party in 
     <lb/>
     the base agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It might well seem that the pressure is on 
     <lb/>
     Britain this time — pressure from Canada. When 
     <lb/>
     Britain made the surrender of self-government in 
     <lb/>
     1933 the condition for financial aid, she knew 
 

            <pb n="1111" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1111.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1111</fw>
           

     that she was getting control of not only the island 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, but the vast area of Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     which only six years before her Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     had awarded to Newfoundland. What her ul<lb break="no"/>timate plans for this island and Labrador were in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of her long-headed statesmen, who can 
     <lb/>
     tell? But the war of 1939-1945 turned the world 
     <lb/>
     upside down. The balance of power shifted to the 
     <lb/>
     New World. England, in desperate straits in 1940, 
     <lb/>
     got 50 over-age destroyers for bases in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and elsewhere, something which 
     <lb/>
     might have been foreseen in 1933, the year that 
     <lb/>
     Hitler came to power in Germany. Canada, too, 
     <lb/>
     must have struck a bargain with the mother 
     <lb/>
     country, not as well-publicised as the base deal. 
     <lb/>
     England's need was Canada's opportunity. The 
     <lb/>
     process of rounding out the Dominion was begun. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>It seems to be a fairly well-known fact that 
     <lb/>while the government of Mr. Churchill was still 
     <lb/>in power, a plan was drawn up for a ten-year 
     <lb/>programme of reconstruction in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>Some sources claim that the return of responsible 
     <lb/>government was also contemplated in conjunc<lb break="no"/>tion with this offer. It is reliably understood that 
     <lb/>Canada interfered, as she did in 1892 at the time 
     <lb/>of the Bond-Blaine treaty. The late Sir John Pud<lb break="no"/>dester, in a meeting of the Public Health and 
     <lb/>Welfare Committee (of which I was a member, 
     <lb/>and Mr. Smallwood and others), stated: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Mr. Smallwood: Bearing on that, what is the 
     <lb/>irreducible minimum? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Sir J.C. Puddester: I made up a list, two years 
     <lb/>ago of what our outlay would probably be. 
     <lb/>When the Goodwill Mission was here they 
     <lb/>talked about a 10-year plan. When they went 
     <lb/>home, they talked a lot about it and Lord 
     <lb/>Cranborne sent for representatives of the 
     <lb/>Commission of Government to go over. 
     <lb/>Emerson, Dunn and myself went over, and 
     <lb/>there were visions of everything. I was asked 
     <lb/>to put down then what I thought we would 
     <lb/>require in our department and the whole thing 
     <lb/>comes to $10 million capital expenditure 
     <lb/>over 10 years. There was also to be a gift of 
     <lb/>$100,000 for 10 years to do construction 
     <lb/>work.

     <lb/>money, they said, "If you have money to give 
   
            <cb/>
           

     Newfoundland, better pay your debts first".

            <p>
     Is it too fantastic, too far-fetched to even suggest 
     <lb/>
     that the Canadian government went a step further 
     <lb/>
     and made aid to Britain contingent on the entry 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland into confederation? And that as 
     <lb/>
     far back as 1941 or 1942, if I might paraphrase 
     <lb/>
     the title of this Grey Book, arrangements were 
     <lb/>
     proposed for the entry of Newfoundland into 
     <lb/>
     confederation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is very significant to my mind, arising out 
     <lb/>
     of the remarks of Major Cashin last week, that 
     <lb/>
     around the period that he says the plan was in<lb break="no"/>stituted, this country became the target for a 
     <lb/>
     barrage of newspaper and other propaganda of 
     <lb/>
     the most one-sided, unfair, and in some cases, 
     <lb/>
     scurrilous type that our people have had to con<lb break="no"/>tend with in many years, the greater part of it 
     <lb/>
     originating in Canada. The general effect of this 
     <lb/>
     propaganda was to convey to the rest of the world 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland was — to quote Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood more than a year ago in this chamber 
     <lb/>
     — "50 years behind the times"; that our people 
     <lb/>
     were a benighted race, and that in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     international decency we should be saved from 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. The obvious inference was that 
     <lb/>
     Canada should be the saviour. Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot help but draw a comparison between such 
     <lb/>
     tactics and those used in Europe just prior to the 
     <lb/>
     second World War by Adolf Hitler. He sang 
     <lb/>
     much the same song. He looked over his borders 
     <lb/>
     at Czechoslovakia, Austria and other lands, and 
     <lb/>
     with variations on the theme, said that these 
     <lb/>
     people should be saved from themselves, and 
     <lb/>
     proceeded to march in and "save them". But then 
     <lb/>
     he was not hampered by the necessity of even 
     <lb/>
     paying lip-service to democracy, like the nations 
     <lb/>
     of the western world must do. So the "capture" 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland had to be achieved by more or 
     <lb/>
     less "peaceful penetration"; by power politics in 
     <lb/>
     the guise of democracy; in the guise of a National 
     <lb/>
     Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, before I proceed to a 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the "Proposed Arrangements for 
     <lb/>
     the Entry of Newfoundland into Confederation" 
     <lb/>
     of 1947, I wish to make one point very clear. I am 
     <lb/>
     not anti-Canadian. Far from it. The suggestion 
     <lb/>
     has been made in some quarters that opposition 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland's entry into union at this stage 
     <lb/>
     is anti-Canadian. That is not so; certainly not in 
     <lb/>
     my case. Anticonfederate, yes. But anti- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian, no! I have as much regard for Canada

     and her achievements as I have for the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Some of the finest people I have known 
     <lb/>
     have been Canadians, or the sons and daughters 
     <lb/>
     of Canadians living in this country. I would like 
     <lb/>
     that to go into the records of this House. Anticon<lb break="no"/>federate, yes; but anti-Canadian, no! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With that general introduction I would like to 
     <lb/>
     pass on to the present proposed arrangements, 
     <lb/>
     and make a few observations on the debate of 
     <lb/>
     those so-called terms which went on from 20 
     <lb/>
     November to 12 December, 1947. I did not par<lb break="no"/>ticipate to any great extent in that debate, for I 
     <lb/>
     realised the magnitude of its implications, and I 
     <lb/>
     confess I felt rather at a loss as it muddled through 
     <lb/>
     the weeks before Christmas. I, for the most part, 
     <lb/>
     sat and listened to the by-play between certain 
     <lb/>
     speakers; and day after day I made notes on 
     <lb/>
     certain aspects of the debate as the House strug<lb break="no"/>gled slowly through the documents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not intend to deal with each of the 23 
     <lb/>
     clauses; many of them I shall only briefly refer 
     <lb/>
     to, for if some members here do not realise their 
     <lb/>
     limitations, I do. Hence, I do not intend to indulge 
     <lb/>
     in academic appraisals of high finance. I shall 
     <lb/>
     leave that involved problem to those better 
     <lb/>
     equipped to deal with it, and go on to considera<lb break="no"/>tions to my mind just as important in a proper 
     <lb/>
     understanding of the confederation issue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Clause 2. "The Province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will include the territory of Labrador defined by 
     <lb/>
     the award of the Judicial Committee of the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council in 1927 as Newfoundland territory." 
     <lb/>
     This clause has raised quite a storm, and that it 
     <lb/>
     will continue to do so is inevitable. We must be 
     <lb/>
     realistic on this question; we must face up to it. 
     <lb/>
     These arrangements, the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     calls them, are supposed to be a "fair and equi<lb break="no"/>table basis" for our entry into the Canadian con<lb break="no"/>federation. We have heard it described as a 
     <lb/>
     federation of nine self-governing provinces with 
     <lb/>
     a central government set above them all. We have 
     <lb/>
     not heard it referred to here as a hybrid nation, 
     <lb/>
     which it is; for Canada is not one nation, but two. 
     <lb/>
     Canada is English and Canada is French; and if 
     <lb/>
     we don't recognise the difference, others do.... It 
     <lb/>
     is now almost a proverb that unless the present 
     <lb/>
     trend is not altered considerably, "Ontario or 
     <lb/>
     Quebec will destroy Canada". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The vexed question of Quebec and our 
     <lb/>
     Labrador cannot be pooh-poohed off, as it has 
     <lb/>
     been here on every occasion it arose, by the 
   

            <cb/>
          

     oversimplification of saying that the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil made a decision in 1927, and though the 
     <lb/>
     heavens fall, it stands. I put this to you, suppose 
     <lb/>
     the Privy Council in some not too distant day 
     <lb/>
     ceases to be the highest tribunal of the British 
     <lb/>
     Commonwealth. We know that the British 
     <lb/>
     dominions are each year becoming more and 
     <lb/>
     more autonomous, more and more self-suffi<lb break="no"/>cient. The King's title which effects his 
     <lb/>
     "dominions beyond the seas" is altered; citizens 
     <lb/>
     of the dominions are now Canadian or Australian 
     <lb/>
     citizens, etc., not "British subjects". In time the 
     <lb/>
     supreme courts of the dominions will no doubt 
     <lb/>
     become the highest courts of law, the highest 
     <lb/>
     tribunals of these dominions.... What then? 
     <lb/>
     Should the Supreme Court of Canada become the 
     <lb/>
     highest tribunal of the Dominion of Canada, su<lb break="no"/>perseding the Privy Council, what is there to 
     <lb/>
     prevent Quebec appealing to that new tribunal, 
     <lb/>
     and in the light of present events, receiving a 
     <lb/>
     reversion of the 1927 decision, in whole or in 
     <lb/>
     part? That is one aspect that has not been touched 
     <lb/>
     upon at all, and I draw it to members' attention, 
     <lb/>
     and to the attention of the country as well. This, 
     <lb/>
     separate and apart from the other excellent argu<lb break="no"/>ments on the possibility of our losing Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     such as the fact that our provincial finances after 
     <lb/>
     the first eight years of union would be in such a 
     <lb/>
     state as to force us to part with some or all of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador as contingent for the receipt of further 
     <lb/>
     federal aid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Clause 3. The public services provided from 
     <lb/>
     time to time by Canada for the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     generally will be extended to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, etc.... There is little need to comment 
     <lb/>
     on this. Canada is only doing what she would do 
     <lb/>
     for any other part of North America that went into 
     <lb/>
     confederation. She would extend the same 
     <lb/>
     facilities to Alaska, if it was a British territory and 
     <lb/>
     wanted to become a province. There is only one 
     <lb/>
     observation necessary to make. If we get those 
     <lb/>
     services, we will pay for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Clause 4. Welfare services presently provided 
     <lb/>
     by Canada, and therefore applicable to New<lb break="no"/>foundland after union pursuant to clause 3, in<lb break="no"/>clude the following... This is the heavy metal of 
     <lb/>
     the confederates. This is why confederation can 
     <lb/>
     be an issue in 1947 when it could not possibly 
     <lb/>
     have been one four years ago when the family 
     <lb/>
     allowance scheme was not in existence. I am not 
     <lb/>
     attacking the family allowance scheme. It is only 
  

            <pb n="1113" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1113.jpg"/>

     in the experimental stage in Canada. It is costing 
     <lb/>
     a fabulous sum. It has yet to prove itself. But at 
     <lb/>
     the moment it is the chief selling point of the 
     <lb/>
     confederates, and its basis is that the people will 
     <lb/>
     get something for nothing. That argument has 
     <lb/>
     been tried in other places besides Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Here is what a semi-official Canadian publication 
     <lb/>
     supplied to the members of this Convention says 
     <lb/>
     in this regard: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The family allowance is a broad raise in 
     <lb/>
     wages for many people. To those of fixed 
     <lb/>
     income, especially those who derive little or 
     <lb/>
     no benefit directly from the bonus, it is quite 
     <lb/>
     injurious. As an example, it has been found 
     <lb/>
     that part-time and other jobs which for 
     <lb/>
     various reasons do not pay fancy sums, are 
     <lb/>
     being turned down by those who regard the 
     <lb/>
     allowance as a convenient dole system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thus it not only encourages unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment, but forces wages up in certain in<lb break="no"/>dustries which in turn raises costs on 
     <lb/>
     manufactured articles. The general public, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, not only pays for the family al<lb break="no"/>lowance, but pays again in increased prices. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The government's estimated $250 million 
     <lb/>
     cost, means that over $20 in extra taxes now 
     <lb/>
     has to be raised for every man, woman and 
     <lb/>
     child in Canada. It has been said that the plan 
     <lb/>
     is economical when it is considered that the 
     <lb/>
     annual expense is only equivalent to two 
     <lb/>
     weeks' average expenditure for war. On the 
     <lb/>
     other hand, the war has put us tremendously 
     <lb/>
     into debt, and it seems reasonable to believe 
     <lb/>
     that family allowances will send us further 
     <lb/>
     into debt. Particularly is this probably in view 
     <lb/>
     of our commitments to heavy post-war ex<lb break="no"/>penditures which have hitherto not entered 
     <lb/>
     into the picture.

     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> The idea was to give some<lb break="no"/>thing for nothing. That is the gist of this article.

     They give the idea that it is a bonus to those in

     <lb/>

     get family allowances" But just how far can the 
  

            <cb/>
           

     rich be soaked? And just how many rich are there 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland to soak? You can soak them to 
     <lb/>
     the limit of the law, and you still won't get a 
     <lb/>
     fraction of the money needed to run the tenth 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     tax, and that goes to the federal government.

     Old age pensions. Everyone agrees with old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions. As I said in the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     Economic Report, what we pay in in old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions is not, should not, be a matter of dollars 
     <lb/>
     and cents, but a matter of conscience and justice. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot wait until we have a surplus to in<lb break="no"/>crease old age pensions, and there should be no 
     <lb/>
     restrictions as to a means test, involving the sign<lb break="no"/>ing away of rights to property or anything else. 
     <lb/>
     When Bill 339 on old age pensions was brought 
     <lb/>
     into the Canadian House of Commons on June 18 
     <lb/>
     last, a few days before our delegation arrived in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, here is what the Leader of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, Mr. Bracken, said: "This government 
     <lb/>
     promised two years ago, in this public document 
     <lb/>
     I have read, a pension plan which would provide 
     <lb/>
     for the elimination of the test... This government 
     <lb/>
     then proposed to eliminate the means test. Now 
     <lb/>
     they are bringing forward a measure which 
     <lb/>
     retains the means test. They promised old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions at 70, all to be paid by the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     They now bring forward a measure in which they 
     <lb/>
     leave 25% of the cost to be paid by the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     And the proposed old age pensions for people 
     <lb/>
     between the ages of 65 and 69, half to be paid by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion and half by the provinces. Yet there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing of that in this bill..." And further on in 
     <lb/>
     the debate, M. J. Coldwell, leader of the Co<lb break="no"/>operative Commonwealth Federation, spoke in 
     <lb/>
     the same strain: "I want to make a plea again this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, for the complete abolition of the 
     <lb/>
     means test. I see no reason whatever for continu<lb break="no"/>ing this humiliating test, which is entirely un<lb break="no"/>necessary. In another act the government has 
     <lb/>
     recognised the validity of not applying the means 
     <lb/>
     test. They have recognised this in connection 
     <lb/>
     with childrens' allowances."

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> spoke of Canadian social 
     <lb/>
     measures as though no other country in the world 
     <lb/>
     had ever heard of them until Canada made the 
     <lb/>
     first move. He referred to Canadian thinking in 
     <lb/>
     these matters, and I might just for the record, 
     <lb/>
     inject here, that whereas old age pensions were 
     <lb/>
     introduced in Canada in 1927, Sir Michael 
     <lb/>
     Cashin in his budget of 1911-12 earmarked a vote 
  

            <pb n="1114" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1114.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1114</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     of $12,000 in connection with an old age pension 
     <lb/>
     scheme which his government was about to in<lb break="no"/>augurate. I say this just to show that our former 
     <lb/>
     governments and public men were not as 
     <lb/>
     benighted as some people would have us believe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the debate on old age pensions the first big 
     <lb/>
     flaw in the Black Books came to light. The figure 
     <lb/>
     set down by the Ottawa delegation for old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions to be paid in the province was $510,000. 
     <lb/>
     In the debate, Mr. Smallwood said the figure 
     <lb/>
     would be increased to $750,000, and actually it 
     <lb/>
     was finally concluded it would be $900,000. This 
     <lb/>
     the province would have to find — almost a 
     <lb/>
     million dollars, almost twice the amount the 
     <lb/>
     delegation first supposed. The $64 question is, 
     <lb/>
     will the province be able to pay it? Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     as a province could pay her old age pensioners 
     <lb/>
     what she liked; $100 a month if she could afford 
     <lb/>
     it, if she could raise the money. There are a lot of 
     <lb/>
     ifs in this business, Mr. Chairman — too many 
     <lb/>
     ifs, ands, and buts. It is too theoretical, too vague. 
     <lb/>
     We have to take too much on spec for my liking, 
     <lb/>
     and with all due respect for Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     integrity, too much on his word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Clause 5 — Here is our big-hearted gift to the 
     <lb/>
     great Dominion. The Railway, the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Hotel, postal-telegraphs, civil aviation 
     <lb/>
     including Gander airport, Customs and Excise, 
     <lb/>
     defence, pensions of war veterans, fisheries, etc. 
     <lb/>
     etc., Canada takes over these. We give them to 
     <lb/>
     her for free. I ask you, is that a bargain for 
     <lb/>
     Canada? Oh, I can hear the sneers about our 
     <lb/>
     "narrow-gauge Newfie express", but it is worth 
     <lb/>
     $72 million, so the Railway officials say. And 
     <lb/>
     even if it is only worth $50 million, it is still a lot 
     <lb/>
     of valuable property. It has been roughly com<lb break="no"/>puted that the public utilities value that Canada 
     <lb/>
     takes over is roughly $150 million, and that"ain't 
     <lb/>
     hay" for a small country like this to have to build 
     <lb/>
     up; and it is a mighty big item of generosity to 
     <lb/>
     hand this over lock, stock and barrel to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada for nothing. If the seven 
     <lb/>
     man delegation to Ottawa had been seven mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the cabinet of an elected government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, they could very well have 
     <lb/>
     demanded some lump sum payment for the hand<lb break="no"/>ing-over of these assets. But they could not do 
     <lb/>
     that; that would be negotiating. And here is 
     <lb/>
     another $64 question — who did the negotiating? 
     <lb/>
     Was there negotiating? How come margarine? 
     <lb/>
     But more of this anon, Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     Now, about the Railway under confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Under the Canadian National Railway, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood read something from the Black Book 
     <lb/>
     that says nothing about the Railway employees. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins came in the next day with the 
     <lb/>
     minutes of a meeting, which word for word was 
     <lb/>
     the same as that found in the Black Book, volume 
     <lb/>
     2, with a significant exception. When this oc<lb break="no"/>curred — members were apparently letting it pass 
     <lb/>
     — I raised a question which was to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     it seemed the delegation was in possession of 
     <lb/>
     information that the Convention was denied. I 
     <lb/>
     had no inkling it would start a 70 minute debate, 
     <lb/>
     but I soon saw I had touched on a sore point. From 
     <lb/>
     the trend the debate has taken all through it seems 
     <lb/>
     there are many sore points. Taxation is certainly 
     <lb/>
     one. Notwithstanding Mr. Smallwood's declared 
     <lb/>
     eagerness to come to grips with this fascinating 
     <lb/>
     subject before Christmas, the truth of it is that it 
     <lb/>
     was scarcely touched on until last week. It has 
     <lb/>
     been continuously shelved since the debate 
     <lb/>
     began on November 20 or earlier. Sometimes the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books are official, sometimes unofficial. 
     <lb/>
     On the matter of the employees of the Railway 
     <lb/>
     under Canadian National, Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     claim is that this inferred reduction of staff is not 
     <lb/>
     in the Black Books, ergo it is unimportant. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot accept this view. These statements are 
     <lb/>
     there in black and white in the files at Ottawa, and 
     <lb/>
     if it is produced and acted on when the tenth 
     <lb/>
     province is sworn in, then what kind of an argu<lb break="no"/>ment is it to say, "It is not in the Black Books"? 
     <lb/>
     The officials will say it is not in the terms either, 
     <lb/>
     that these people should be kept on. And what can 
     <lb/>
     we say? And that goes for more than the Railway. 
     <lb/>
     Then Newfoundlanders are supposed to continue 
     <lb/>
     to run the Railway. Why? Because the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Civil Service Act says, "Employees must be 
     <lb/>
     citizens of the province". But it is stated in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book that administration goes to regional 
     <lb/>
     headquarters at Moncton. Who employs who, 
     <lb/>
     then? Do Newfoundlanders go up to Moncton to 
     <lb/>
     run the Railway, or do the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     people run it? Or does Ottawa send down men to 
     <lb/>
     keep New Brunswick and Newfoundland from 
     <lb/>
     each other's throats? Note well in this regard, 
     <lb/>
     what of the Housing Association with its regional 
     <lb/>
     office somewhere in the Maritimes — does the 
     <lb/>
     same hold? I ask you in all seriousness, what are 
     <lb/>
     we expected to suppose?

     <lb/>
     many representatives there are in the provincial

     <lb/>
     sum of $200,000 to cover these expenses, but has 
     <lb/>
     it been made abundantly clear to many of our 
     <lb/>
     people what that sum represents? I am under the 
     <lb/>
     impression that a considerable number of our 
     <lb/>
     people believe that under confederation they will 
     <lb/>
     be governed from Ottawa only, just as they are 
     <lb/>
     governed now from London. They have not the 
     <lb/>
     faintest idea that there will be a legislature in 
     <lb/>
     between, here in St. John's, almost the same as in 
     <lb/>
     the days of responsible government. Some folk 
     <lb/>
     may not credit this, but it is true. Many of our 
     <lb/>
     people think that by voting for confederation they 
     <lb/>
     are going to eliminate the necessity of having a 
     <lb/>
     local House of Assembly in St. John's. That 
     <lb/>
     explains, for the most part, why we hear so many 
     <lb/>
     people say. "Where are we going to get the men 
     <lb/>
     under responsible government?" Let them 
     <lb/>
     ponder where, then, they are going to get them 
     <lb/>

     Here we have the same stumbling block over 
     <lb/>
     which the confederate plan of 1895 tripped and 
     <lb/>
     came a Cropper. In 1895 Canada could not as<lb break="no"/>sume the entire debt of Newfoundland. When 
     <lb/>
     Britain was asked to bridge the gap, she would 
     <lb/>
     not do so. The negotiations fell through. That is 
     <lb/>
     why confederation was never put to the people of 
     <lb/>
     a bankrupt country in 1895 — the terms were not 
     <lb/>
     generous enough. Yet 50 years after, Canada 
     <lb/>
     expects the National Convention to consider put<lb break="no"/>ting substantially the same arrangements before 
     <lb/>
     the people of a solvent country, to vote themsel<lb break="no"/>ves into a union and start it with a provincial debt 
     <lb/>
     to service — in other words, to hang a millstone 
     <lb/>
     about our necks for life, and our children's necks 
   

            <cb/>
          

     after us. And yet at every turn we are confronted 
     <lb/>
     with headlines about the generous terms that 
     <lb/>
     Canada has offered Newfoundland. The con<lb break="no"/>federates said they will be so generous that we 
     <lb/>
     won't be able to turn them down. Now I ask, 
     <lb/>
     where are the special concessions for New<lb break="no"/>foundland? They are certainly not in the financial 
     <lb/>
     arrangements, and as far as I can see, they are not 
     <lb/>
     in any of the others. All the Grey Book represents 
     <lb/>
     is a mere application of the main features of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian confederation to Newfoundland. No 
     <lb/>
     more, no less. Of course there's margarine, but 
     <lb/>
     more of that later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me put it this way, Mr. Chairman. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     Alaska was a British colony, a British dominion 
     <lb/>
     like Newfoundland. And suppose Alaska wanted 
     <lb/>
     to enter the Canadian confederation. Like New<lb break="no"/>foundland, there would be provision in the RNA 
     <lb/>
     Act. Canada would have all the same services 
     <lb/>
     extended to Alaska as are offered to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. She would get all the promises we are 
     <lb/>
     getting. Canada would also take over all her 
     <lb/>
     assets, her railways, steamships, etc., just as in 
     <lb/>
     clause 8. But Alaska's government, presuming 
     <lb/>
     she had self-govemment as a British dominion, 
     <lb/>
     would say to Canada, "We are a big country; 
     <lb/>
     we're rich; you will have to do better than that. 
     <lb/>
     We want some special concessions." And if 
     <lb/>
     Canada wanted Alaska as badly as she seems to 
     <lb/>
     want Newfoundland, then Alaska would get spe<lb break="no"/>cial concessions. But our delegation could not act 
     <lb/>
     in that way because they had no authority to act 
     <lb/>
     as a government, no authority to bargain, to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate, They just had to take whatever Canada 
     <lb/>
     was prepared to offer. Even if they went beyond 
     <lb/>
     their powers and secured margarine, that was not 
     <lb/>
     a concession for it is in the cards that all Canada 
     <lb/>
     may soon have that particular freedom to 
     <lb/>
     manufacture and sell margarine. That is why the 
     <lb/>
     terms — the so-called terms - do not say we will 
     <lb/>
     get a standard gauge railway, which would be a 
     <lb/>
     special concession. It is left to Mr. Smallwood to 
     <lb/>
     read between the lines and suggest we will get it 
     <lb/>
     some day. That is why Canada will maintain only 
     <lb/>
     a steamship service no better or worse than the 
     <lb/>
     present one on the Gulf. And when the motor 
     <lb/>
     highway is completed, if it is completed and if the 
     <lb/>
     province can afford to complete it, it will include 
     <lb/>
     suitable provision for motor vehicles. Whereas a 
     <lb/>
     special concession would have said, Canada will 
     <lb/>
     complete that road and build a transinsular high<lb break="no"/>

     way and provide a super ferry service, a boat- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     train on the Gulf like the one I spoke of on the 
     <lb/>
     debate on the Transportation Report in 1947. 
     <lb/>
     These are just two examples of real bait to get us 
     <lb/>
     into confederation, something to make it really 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile. But what are we going to get? Mar<lb break="no"/>garine. They are going to let us make and eat 
     <lb/>
     margarine; what generosity! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said, Mr. Chairman, concessions like these 
     <lb/>
     might make it worthwhile, on a financial basis, 
     <lb/>
     to enter confederation. And why not conces<lb break="no"/>sions? We are not bankrupt as in 1895; we are not 
     <lb/>
     a shaky, insecure colony as in 1867. We are 
     <lb/>
     today, in 1947, comparatively well-off with 
     <lb/>
     many of the characteristics of a nation. We 
     <lb/>
     deserve special inducements to get us to forsake 
     <lb/>
     our traditional independence and our economic 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty. But we are not getting them; we are 
     <lb/>
     not even offered them. We are handed something 
     <lb/>
     and told to take it or leave it: "the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada believes that the arrangements go as far 
     <lb/>
     as the government can go under the circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces". The confederates have been preaching that 
     <lb/>
     if we do not take it, then we are doomed and 
     <lb/>
     damned. That is their propaganda. New<lb break="no"/>foundland has no future. her future is built on 
     <lb/>
     sand, she must clutch this Canadian straw or go 
     <lb/>
     down in the financial whirlpool. They are not 
     <lb/>
     arguing for confederation on its merits; they are 
     <lb/>
     trying to press their case by aiming to prove that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is headed for ruin otherwise. 
     <lb/>
     They are apparently blind — conveniently so — 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that as yet Newfoundland has not been 
     <lb/>
     able to ask the United States for any concessions 
     <lb/>
     — concessions, it is needless to point out, that 
     <lb/>
     could only be sought and secured by a sovereign 
     <lb/>
     government of the Newfoundland people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I say again, Mr. Chairman, there should be 
     <lb/>
     special concessions before we should, in our 
     <lb/>
     present position, even consider confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Yet there are none, and they call them generous 
     <lb/>
     terms. I don't know that we have a right to even 
     <lb/>
     call them "terms" — nowhere in any of the docu<lb break="no"/>ments which I have, does the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment call them "terms". The Grey Book is titled 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into Confederation</hi>. Arrangements — 
     <lb/>
     that doesn't mean very much. I can arrange for 
     <lb/>
     you to become a member of my club, but I do not 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that if you accept, you will become its 
     <lb/>
     president. That would have to be a deal of some 


            <cb/>
          

     kind, we would have to agree on terms for that. 
     <lb/>
     We should not be using that word "terms" so 
     <lb/>
     glibly; neither should we be using the word 
     <lb/>
     "generous" in connection with them. They are 
     <lb/>
     not generous, neither should they be. "Fair", yes; 
     <lb/>
     "equitable", yes, if they are (which I doubt); but 
     <lb/>
     "generous" — no! We do not want generosity. 
     <lb/>
     Some of our people may be looking for a handout, 
     <lb/>
     but most of them are not, I believe. As Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin said, Newfoundland's entry into con<lb break="no"/>federation is a going into partnership. Partners 
     <lb/>
     are equals, at least that's how I always understood 
     <lb/>
     it. Partners do not expect generosity from each 
     <lb/>
     other. They expect co-operation. They expect 
     <lb/>
     each other to accept equal responsibilities, 
     <lb/>
     receive equal gains, share equal losses. A partner<lb break="no"/>ship is not one-sided. One partner does not get all 
     <lb/>
     the benefits and the other take all the risks. It is 
     <lb/>
     like marriage, or like marriage is supposed to be. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, there's divorce from marriage in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but not in Newfoundland. We have not 
     <lb/>
     heard much about that yet. But there is no divorce 
     <lb/>
     from confederation — it is final, it is forever. You 
     <lb/>
     cannot try it for ten or 15 years, like Commission 
     <lb/>
     or responsible government, and then change. No, 
     <lb/>
     sir, you are stuck with it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But getting back to partnership and confedera<lb break="no"/>tion between Canada and Newfoundland as an 
     <lb/>
     arrangement between equals, these so-called 
     <lb/>
     terms are, as far as I can see, a one-sided affair. 
     <lb/>
     If anyone is going to benefit from confederation, 
     <lb/>
     it is going to be Canada. We will get a few paltry 
     <lb/>
     millions in family allowances, old age pensions, 
     <lb/>
     and other subsidies which will cease after the first 
     <lb/>
     eight years of union; and Canada will get control 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland and Labrador. There will pass 
     <lb/>
     into her hands the control of one of the most 
     <lb/>
     strategic areas of the earth with all that implies in 
     <lb/>
     these days. What she pays into Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will return in time to her a hundredfold from the 
     <lb/>
     exploitation of that strategic position, and the 
     <lb/>
     tremendous bargaining power that will accrue to 
     <lb/>
     her in dealing with the United States in particular, 
     <lb/>
     by virtue of air bases like Gander and Goose; the 
     <lb/>
     United States bases; the immense iron and 
     <lb/>
     mineral deposits of Labrador. In regard to the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, the Privy Council heard the case on the 
     <lb/>
     boundary in 1926; their judgement was handed 
     <lb/>
     down in 1927, giving Newfoundland 110,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles. Early in 1928, Senator C.E. Tanner 
     <lb/>
     moved the following resolution: "That in the

     opinion of this House, Canada should favourably 
     <lb/>
     consider any proposals that may be made by 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland for union with the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada." Speaking on this resolution, Senator 
     <lb/>
     Rufus Pope said in part, "That territory which has 
     <lb/>
     been awarded to Newfoundland by the decision 
     <lb/>
     given in England on the boundary line, has be<lb break="no"/>come very valuable, and if Canada desires to 
     <lb/>
     possess it, we have no time to lose..." That was 
     <lb/>
     the theme of the whole debate, the value of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, the need for Canada to repossess it. 
     <lb/>
     That was only 20 years ago. The wheel has come 
     <lb/>
     full circle again. Let's not kid ourselves with that 
     <lb/>
     fatuous statement that Canada does not want 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, that we will be a drag on Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The only ones we will be a drag on are ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     when we try to make our little province pay and 
     <lb/>
     make both ends meet, out of the pitifully small 
     <lb/>
     and inadequate revenues left us after the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion has taken over the most lucrative fields 
     <lb/>
     of taxation.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> has made a valiant attempt to 
     <lb/>
     produce a provincial budget for eight years, and 
     <lb/>
     it is as fine a piece of financial juggling as anyone 
     <lb/>
     could wish to marvel at. He rakes the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee from stem to stem for giving a 
     <lb/>
     budget, admittedly based on conjecture, for three 
     <lb/>
     years, and then blithely produces one for eight 
     <lb/>
     years. All through the previous debates Mr.

     Smallwood was the champion of no limit on 
     <lb/>
     future expenditures; there had to be more money 
     <lb/>
     for this and that, for everything, every service of 
     <lb/>
     government. But now he has to cut the provincial 
     <lb/>
     coat to fit the cloth at his disposal, if we enter 
     <lb/>
     confederation; and we find him with a limit on 
     <lb/>
     everything, not for one year, but for eight! And 
     <lb/>
     the trump card for the provincial budget seems to

            <p>
     If we can only manage to struggle through the 
     <lb/>
     first eight years, then everything will be fine. We 
     <lb/>
     will get a royal commission to figure out how 
     <lb/>
     much additional financial help we will need. It 
     <lb/>
     will be plenty, and we will have no collateral, no 
     <lb/>
     security, nothing to exchange for the do-ray-me 
     <lb/>
     except Labrador. So the pressure is put on the 
     <lb/>
     provincial parliament, and they amend the legis<lb break="no"/>lation and alter the boundaries of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, that part of it called Labrador. 
     <lb/>
     That is the consent of the province, and someone 
     <lb/>
     takes over Labrador or part of it, and that some<lb break="no"/>one will be Quebec. I'll stake my life on it. On 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, we may never get that royal 
     <lb/>
     commission. We have heard a lot about what the 
     <lb/>
     Duncan-White Commission did, but how many 
     <lb/>
     commissions did not function? As recently as 
     <lb/>
     1911 a commission of inquiry was set up for 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia to look into the matter of grant<lb break="no"/>ing that province better terms. The commission 
     <lb/>
     was set up, but it never functioned. The letter of 
     <lb/>
     the law may have been followed, but its spirit was 
     <lb/>
     hardly interpreted. Could not this happen in our 
     <lb/>
     case? Remember, Newfoundland would be the 
     <lb/>
     tenth and last province. Once in, anything would 
     <lb/>
     be good enough for her because there would not 
     <lb/>
     be any more prospective customers for the con<lb break="no"/>federation wares. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I just mentioned the provincial budget, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, and now I want to make a few refer<lb break="no"/>ences to a table on page 2, "Probable Revenue 
     <lb/>
     and Expenditure of the Province". Expenditure is 
     <lb/>
     $15,138,775, an annual average for the first four 
     <lb/>
     years. Then the revenue. Note two things - the 
     <lb/>
     word taxation at the very beginning, and the 
     <lb/>
     amount of almost $3.5 million, and the sentence 
     <lb/>
     "New taxation is to be imposed", another million 
     <lb/>
     and a quarter. Total provincial taxation, $4.5 
     <lb/>
     million. It goes up another million in the next four 
     <lb/>
     years. Now I ask the people to note this: the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion has taken the income tax, the customs 
     <lb/>
     revenues, has put excise on liquor and tobacco. 
     <lb/>
     What is left? What remains to permit the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Newfoundland to raise $4.5 million 
     <lb/>
     each year in taxation? Very little that I can see. 
     <lb/>
     There is $750,000 raised on gasoline. That is not 
     <lb/>
     regular revenue as of now, it would be new taxa<lb break="no"/>tion to add to the $1.25 million earmarked in the 
     <lb/>
     budget as new taxation. Almost $5 per person, 
   

            <pb n="1118" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1118.jpg"/>

     almost $25 per family in new taxation, just in the 
     <lb/>
     province. What kind of taxation? Mr. Hollett read 
     <lb/>
     a list of what kind of taxes it can be raised from. 
     <lb/>
     It is all in the Black Books, pages 149 to 153, five 
     <lb/>
     pages of the kinds of taxes that can be levied, 
     <lb/>
     either by the federal or the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments. The province, if it signs the tax agreement, 
     <lb/>
     loses income and corporation taxes and succes<lb break="no"/>sion duties. These are the big ones. The province 
     <lb/>
     is then left with real and personal property, the 
     <lb/>
     gasoline tax and fuel oil tax. Besides the federal 
     <lb/>
     excise on tobacco, the province can levy a tobac<lb break="no"/>co tax also. Then there can be a retail sales tax in 
     <lb/>
     the province, plus the federal sales tax of 8%. 
     <lb/>
     Then the amusement taxes on movies, shows of 
     <lb/>
     any kind, plays, concerts, dances, athletic com<lb break="no"/>petitions and so on. That brings us to (i) on the 
     <lb/>
     list; then there is (j) and that has almost as many 
     <lb/>
     "Other Taxes", as it is called, as the foregoing put 
     <lb/>
     together. Amongst these can be placed the luxury 
     <lb/>
     taxes, or excise taxes, but I won't read them all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Clause 8 is very much the same as clause 5. 
     <lb/>
     Canada takes over the assets of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     freely and without consideration of any kind in 
     <lb/>
     way of reimbursement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next clause I want to comment on briefly 
     <lb/>
     is clause 9 dealing with our accumulated finan<lb break="no"/>cial surplus. Section 3 of this clause reads: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     Now, in the debate before Christmas, when

     Mr. Hickman drew our attention to this restric<lb break="no"/>tion, Mr. Smallwood observed in all seriousness 
     <lb/>
     that it was a pure piece of politics and not to be 
     <lb/>
     taken seriously. Now that struck me so forcibly 
     <lb/>
     that I made a note of it. If the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in a matter as serious as this for New<lb break="no"/>foundland, can be said to be playing politics in 
     <lb/>
     even one section of one clause of this Grey Book, 
     <lb/>
     then is it not open to wider implication that the 
     <lb/>
     whole Grey Book is a pure piece of politics, or 
     <lb/>
     impure, depending on your point of view?

            <p>
     The next clause to which I want to draw to

     your attention is clause 15:

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, I well remember the night 
     <lb/>
     session at which this particular clause was read 
     <lb/>
     and explained. The House was in a good humour 
     <lb/>
     for a change, and there was a lot of joking and 
     <lb/>
     fun generally about this representation, and who 
     <lb/>
     were going to be or could be senators and so on. 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, I did not find that discussion in the least 
     <lb/>
     bit funny, when I considered that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     as the tenth and last province would be repre<lb break="no"/>sented in the Dominion parliament by seven 
     <lb/>
     members out of 265, and in the Senate by six 
     <lb/>
     members out of 96. I confess it did seem like a 
     <lb/>
     joke, but the kind where the other fellow has the 
     <lb/>
     laugh. Why, we could not be much worse off if 
     <lb/>
     we had no representation. How far would we get? 
     <lb/>
     How often would our voice be heard? To bolster 
     <lb/>
     the position, pro-confederates cite a possible 
     <lb/>
     union of Maritime Provinces. It will never come 
     <lb/>
     in our lifetime, probably never come, as long as 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and Ontario look upon such a union as a 
     <lb/>
     possible threat to their sway.

            <p>
     And now, Mr. Chairman, the last clause that I 
     <lb/>
     wish to refer to before a general summing up, 
     <lb/>
     clause 19:

            <p>If anyone thinks that Canada is not bending over 
     <lb/>backwards to make easy the entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation, let him read that 
     <lb/>education clause —- not only read it, but take note 
     <lb/>of the most peculiar position that arose out of the 
     <lb/>debate before Christmas I cannot recall the exact 
     <lb/>day that Mr. Smallwood made, what I consider, 
     <lb/>a revelation. On this matter Mr. Smallwood was 
     <lb/>rather humble, I thought; not only on behalf of 
     <lb/>himself, but of the rest of us as well. I do not recall 
     <lb/>the exact words, but I think the gist of his remarks 
     <lb/>went something like this: now here is this educa<lb break="no"/>tion question — a matter of conscience as the 
     <lb/>Canadian Prime Minister pointed out in his letter 
     <lb/>— something on which Newfoundlanders feel 
     <lb/>very strongly. Now, we in this Convention are 
     <lb/>just a bunch of ordinary fellows, floundering 
     <lb/>through, so to speak —- we're not the heads of the 
     <lb/>denominations, so we cannot be expected to ap<lb break="no"/>preciate the implications of this clause. There<lb break="no"/>fore, if any or all of the heads of the various 
     <lb/>denominations or other high ecclesiastical sour<lb break="no"/>ces see any complications in this clause, they are 
     <lb/>perfectly at liberty to address a letter or some 
     <lb/>other communication to — now I'm not sure if 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood said the Convention or the 
     <lb/>Canadian government, but I believe it was the 
     <lb/>latter, expressing their opinions and suggesting 
     <lb/>changes or alterations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, I ask you, isn't that the 
     <lb/>
     most peculiar position that has arisen in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention in your time? It certainly is in my 
     <lb/>
     time. We are not competent to pass on the merits 
     <lb/>
     of this clause 19, on a matter with which we are 
     <lb/>
     all familiar, education, since we were born. Yet 
     <lb/>
     we are considered to be competent to pass on the 
     <lb/>
     fairness of all the other clauses, including the 
     <lb/>
     most complicated financial arrangements, the 
     <lb/>
     most far-reaching international questions like the 
     <lb/>
     American bases and an international airport, in 
     <lb/>
     fact, on confederation itself — the most crucial 
     <lb/>
     and controversial issue that has faced this country 
     <lb/>
     in nearly two generations. And the very sugges<lb break="no"/>tion itself, that contacts be made inside or outside 
     <lb/>
     this house with the Canadian government to alter 


            <cb/>
       

     that clause in any sense, shape or form would 
     <lb/>
     most assuredly, as far as I am concerned, take on 
     <lb/>
     the aspects of negotiation and nothing else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, on the clause as it stands. It appears to 
     <lb/>
     have covered every angle and stopped all the 
     <lb/>
     loopholes, but before leaving it I would like to 
     <lb/>
     point out that other and similar clauses were 
     <lb/>
     written into the BNA Act on the same matter 
     <lb/>
     when other provinces were being taken into con<lb break="no"/>federation — "taken in" is probably the right term 
     <lb/>
     for it, too. For instance, Manitoba — BNA Act, 
     <lb/>
     section 22 (2)... That was in 1870 when 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba became a province. But what happened 
     <lb/>
     in 1890, 20 years after? The Liberal government 
     <lb/>
     of the day unified the schools in a non-sectarian 
     <lb/>
     system. There was a great stir over it, an appeal 
     <lb/>
     was made to the clause in Manitoba's terms, 
     <lb/>
     especially the section which, in effect, meant that 
     <lb/>
     the federal government could override the 
     <lb/>
     provincial govemment's decision on this matter. 
     <lb/>
     But when the appeal was made, Sir Wilfred 
     <lb/>
     Laurier pointed out that while the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment might by legislation direct the correction of 
     <lb/>
     the grievance, it had no power to intervene in the 
     <lb/>
     administration of education in Manitoba; for 
     <lb/>
     education, after all, was a responsibility of the 
     <lb/>
     province. So that clause to safeguard the separate 
     <lb/>
     denominational schools in Manitoba was not 
     <lb/>
     worth the paper it was written on, anymore than 
     <lb/>
     clause 19 in these so-called terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, sir, I have finished my references to 
     <lb/>
     specific clauses and I wish to make a few 
     <lb/>
     general remarks on the Grey Book. In the first 
     <lb/>
     place, they are not terms of union, as their 
     <lb/>
     proponents are striving so hard to assert. The 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Ottawa had no power to negotiate 
     <lb/>
     terms. Its job was to ascertain if a fair and equi<lb break="no"/>table basis existed for the entry of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     into the Dominion of Canada. Out of their three 
     <lb/>
     month stay came the two Black Books, incom<lb break="no"/>plete as we have discovered, and regardless of 
     <lb/>
     how or when it came, this Grey Book, titled 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Proposed Arrangements for the Entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into Confederation</hi>. The dictionary 
     <lb/>
     defines "arrangement" as the "act of arranging or 
     <lb/>
     putting in an orderly condition, the state of being 
     <lb/>
     so arranged; disposition in suitable form". A very 
     <lb/>
     general definition, and one which fits this Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book very well. It is a nice arrangement of a basis 
     <lb/>
     of union set down in 23 clauses and several 
     <lb/>
     annexes. The dictionary defines "terms", on the 
 

            <pb n="1120" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1120.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1120</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
           

     other hand, as "propositions, limitations or 
     <lb/>
     provisions, stated or offered, as in contracts, for 
     <lb/>
     the acceptance of others and determining the 
     <lb/>
     nature and scope of the agreement". There is a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous difference in the word "terms" and 
     <lb/>
     the word "arrangements". And this Grey Book is 
     <lb/>
     called "arrangements". Nowhere in the whole 
     <lb/>
     business does the Canadian government call it 
     <lb/>
     "terms", nowhere. The Prime Minister's letter 
     <lb/>
     takes great care on this point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Besides the Grey Book, which is not "terms", 
     <lb/>
     and the Black Books which are incomplete and 
     <lb/>
     official or semi-official as the situation arises, 
     <lb/>
     what else do we have to go on? In the debate, 
     <lb/>
     especially before Christmas, explaining these ar<lb break="no"/>rangements, much stress was laid by the pilot of 
     <lb/>
     the report on what so-and—so had said, suggested, 
     <lb/>
     hinted or alluded to at various meetings and ap<lb break="no"/>parently on other occasions. For instance, in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Housing Corporation and the 
     <lb/>
     National Housing Act, it was said that the head 
     <lb/>
     of that Canadian organisation had said that some<lb break="no"/>thing might be worked out, but he did not know 
     <lb/>
     what could be worked out until we were a 
     <lb/>
     province. Again, on the matter of the service on 
     <lb/>
     the Cabot Strait and the matter of a super-feny, 
     <lb/>
     it was stated that on this matter Mr. St. Laurent 
     <lb/>
     had read something from a memo about details 
     <lb/>
     of such a ship, and in this connection Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood had asked Mr. Ballam to tell the 
     <lb/>
     house what he knew or had heard about the car 
     <lb/>
     ferry on the Straits. And Mr. Ballam had risen in 
     <lb/>
     his place to say that he had nothing to say on this 
     <lb/>
     matter, that it was purely an off the record con<lb break="no"/>versation between himself and the high Canadian 
     <lb/>
     official while walking along the street, and that 
     <lb/>
     he did not think it right to make any pronounce<lb break="no"/>ment under the circumstances. And he was quite 
     <lb/>
     right; for if the decision of our people in this 
     <lb/>
     matter of confederation is to be swayed by con<lb break="no"/>jectures made or heard in a conversation on the 
     <lb/>
     streets of Ottawa, then the whole affair has indeed 
     <lb/>
     deed come to a sorry pass. It would seem to me, 
     <lb/>
     from the personal allusions made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood about what will happen when we are 
     <lb/>
     a province, that the Canadian officials were 
     <lb/>
     prepared to promise anything and everything, but 
     <lb/>
     to put nothing very much in writing. There were 
     <lb/>
     many other occasions when similar statements 
     <lb/>
     were made that could be quoted, but I have al<lb break="no"/>ready taken up far more of the time of this house 
  

            <cb/>
       

     than I ever intended at the outset; but the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter is so complicated that the further one 
     <lb/>
     proceeds, the further one is involved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Only one other aspect of the debate remains to 
     <lb/>
     be cemented on. It is in reference to the multi<lb break="no"/>tude of taxes that the Canadian people pay in all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces — to their municipal government, 
     <lb/>
     to their provincial government, and to their 
     <lb/>
     federal government. Mr. Smallwood had 
     <lb/>
     reiterated over and over again that it does not 
     <lb/>
     follow because Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land or any other province has certain taxes that 
     <lb/>
     we have not now, that under confederation we 
     <lb/>
     will still not have them. In other words, we will 
     <lb/>
     be the tenth and last province and we will be a 
     <lb/>
     law unto ourselves. There is an old saying, 
     <lb/>
     whether you do what the Romans do, when 
     <lb/>
     you're in Rome, is a matter of choice. But when 
     <lb/>
     in confederation, you will do as the Canadians do 
     <lb/>
     and it won't be a matter of choice, I can assure 
     <lb/>
     you. Not that the federal government will compel 
     <lb/>
     us to do certain things, raise certain taxes, but we 
     <lb/>
     ourselves will be compelled, we will have to 
     <lb/>
     compel ourselves to raise additional taxation to 
     <lb/>
     try and provide the services that the province 
     <lb/>
     under confederation is required to provide. Yes, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, the CNR may take over the Rail<lb break="no"/>way, but the Province of Newfoundland will not 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to run on a separate track. It will 
     <lb/>
     have to shunt onto the main line on which the 
     <lb/>
     other nine provinces run; and where there is no 
     <lb/>
     precedent in our set-up we will have to take 
     <lb/>
     leaves from their books. To advance the argu<lb break="no"/>ment that Newfoundland and her people will 
     <lb/>
     remain tax-free to the same extent as they are now 
     <lb/>
     under confederation, is the height of false reason<lb break="no"/>ing. It is absurd. Even if we were to take the 
     <lb/>
     figures of Mr. Smallwood' s provincial budget we 
     <lb/>
     would still have to raise more than $1.25 million 
     <lb/>
     in additional provincial taxation, besides that 
     <lb/>
     provided for, in addition to the great amounts that 
     <lb/>
     would find their way from our pockets to the 
     <lb/>
     federal treasury at Ottawa. But other speakers 
     <lb/>
     have proved to my satisfaction at any rate, that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's budget is set at too low a figure 
     <lb/>
     to run the province successfully and make both 
     <lb/>
     ends meet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I wish to refer 
     <lb/>
     to certain other aspects of this whole question 
     <lb/>
     which as yet I have not touched upon in any great 
     <lb/>
     detail, if at all. As I said at the beginning, I realise 
   

            <pb n="1121" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1121.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1121</fw>
          

     my limitations and I have not gone very 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly into the high finance of the question 
     <lb/>
     which has been, in any case, dealt with very 
     <lb/>
     effectively by other speakers. It is argued that we 
     <lb/>
     are too small to stand alone; yet other countries 
     <lb/>
     as small, and smaller, notably Iceland, have done 
     <lb/>
     so; and Iceland is not in half as important a part 
     <lb/>
     of the world as we are, and her position is not as 
     <lb/>
     quarter as strategic as ours; nor does she have 
     <lb/>
     even a fraction of the bargaining power that we 
     <lb/>
     possess. Even though there are 60 to 70 miles of 
     <lb/>
     deep Atlantic water between us and the mainland 
     <lb/>
     at the end that counts most, it is argued that we 
     <lb/>
     are a part of the Canadian mainland, when it 
     <lb/>
     would be equally correct or incorrect to argue that 
     <lb/>
     we are a part of the American mainland. The truth 
     <lb/>
     of the matter is, we are no more an intrinsic part 
     <lb/>
     of the mainland than is England of the continent 
     <lb/>
     of Europe, and I would recall to your attention 
     <lb/>
     how barely 25 miles of water made all the dif<lb break="no"/>ference for England in 1940. The attempt to foist 
     <lb/>
     confederation on us is to ignore the facts of 
     <lb/>
     geography and international politics, which 
     <lb/>
     makes us as much a part of the United States as 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. The men who voted for a delegation 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa on the grounds that they were con<lb break="no"/>cerned with the people's welfare, will not be able 
     <lb/>
     to reconcile their concern for that welfare with 
     <lb/>
     their refusal to vote to send a similar delegation 
     <lb/>
     to the United States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I say then, Mr. Chairman, that it is wrong, 
     <lb/>
     ethically, morally and economically to suggest, 
     <lb/>
     much less to ask our people to vote themselves 
     <lb/>
     into union with Canada on such one-sided arran<lb break="no"/>gements; arrangements which even ram<lb break="no"/>bunctious debates by a crowd of amateurs, for the 
     <lb/>
     most part, have shown up as shot through with 
     <lb/>
     future trouble —— trouble which will involve 
     <lb/>
     ethics and morals and economics and finances. 
     <lb/>
     They, these arrangements, are a one—sided bar<lb break="no"/>gain — which is no bargain at all — and as has 
     <lb/>
     been pointed out by one member of the delega<lb break="no"/>tion, all these arrangements actually provide is a 
     <lb/>
     fair and equitable basis on which a sovereign 
     <lb/>
     government of the Newfoundland people, as<lb break="no"/>sisted by the expert knowledge and staff that this 
     <lb/>
     delegation did not have, could negotiate "terms" 
     <lb/>
     acceptable to the Newfoundland people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Here is Newfoundland, a people voteless for 
     <lb/>
     14 years, coddled for 14 years, not thinking, not 
     <lb/>
     doing the normal political things that all Anglo<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
   
Saxon peoples have won the right to do - 
     <lb/>
     governing their own people, governing themsel<lb break="no"/>ves. At the present stage they are divided as to 
     <lb/>
     whether or not they should take once again that 
     <lb/>
     control of their own affairs and bid farewell to 
     <lb/>
     outside control. Yet while they are in that dilem<lb break="no"/>ma, it is proposed, on the basis of these one-sided 
     <lb/>
     arrangements, to ask them to not only assume 
     <lb/>
     control of their own affairs, yet at the same time 
     <lb/>
     give the complete control, finally and irrevocably 
     <lb/>
     to outside sources, by entering a political union 
     <lb/>
     which may not be the best political or economic 
     <lb/>
     union this country could get. I say to them, make 
     <lb/>
     haste slowly, take one step at a time. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian offer can wait; they've been waiting 
     <lb/>
     since 1864 and another year or two won't hurt. 
     <lb/>
     Decide first whether you wish to reject or retain 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government. If you reject it, then 
     <lb/>
     with a sovereign elected government of your own 
     <lb/>
     choosing you will be able to approach Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the United States, so that if your wish is then 
     <lb/>
     no longer to stand alone, you can be assured that 
     <lb/>
     whichever union you enter, political or economic 
     <lb/>
     or both, it will be the best that can be secured for 
     <lb/>
     yourselves and those who come after you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> Mr. Chairman, if my introductory 
     <lb/>
     comments are just so much water under the 
     <lb/>
     bridge now, I yet cannot refrain from making 
     <lb/>
     reference to them. Some of us, after more than a 
     <lb/>
     year of bickerings, divisions and not too dignified 
     <lb/>
     debates, had fondly hoped that with the passing 
     <lb/>
     of 1947 would come an eclipse of such shortcom<lb break="no"/>ings that would be as permanent as it was total. 
     <lb/>
     Unfortunately such has not been the case, and 
     <lb/>
     1948 brought no angel of light presenting this 
     <lb/>
     assembly with a certificate of freedom from 
     <lb/>
     having such millstones around its neck, and so 
     <lb/>
     the debates meander on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have, sir, watched with growing admiration 
     <lb/>
     your intelligent attempt to keep this Convention 
     <lb/>
     from bogging down in dawdlings and delays. 
     <lb/>
     Some were inescapable, however, and members 
     <lb/>
     have from time to time as self-appointed 
     <lb/>
     proponents of this, and crusading prophets of that 
     <lb/>
     form of government, lost complete sight of the 
     <lb/>
     forest in the minute and precise examination of 
     <lb/>
     their own particular trees. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the discussion statements, speeches, ap<lb break="no"/>parent implications made by members, though 
     <lb/>
     not intended perhaps to do so, have incited bitter 
     <lb/>
     antagonisms that rankle deeply, created ill—will

     and helped defeat the purpose for which this body 
     <lb/>
     was created. Perhaps it is not too much to say that 
     <lb/>
     to the casual listeners-in, it appears to be just so 
     <lb/>
     much shoddy and lingering childishness. This is 
     <lb/>
     regrettable indeed, for to many of us, who have 
     <lb/>
     had and will have no part or parcel of such 
     <lb/>
     sometimes very undignified discussions, is also 
     <lb/>
     attached the lack of decorum which should at 
     <lb/>
     least be ours. I trust I am not being guilty of 
     <lb/>
     tedious repetition, sir, when I make reference to 
     <lb/>
     what you have so many times pointed out, that 
     <lb/>
     the specific mandate of this Convention was 
     <lb/>
     simply to examine into something, and on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of its findings, to make intelligent recom<lb break="no"/>mendations. That something was the financial 
     <lb/>
     and economic condition of Newfoundland. Has 
     <lb/>
     it done that? It has, in my opinion, deteriorated 
     <lb/>
     from the status of a fact-finding body into two 
     <lb/>
     hostile political camps, each apparently led by a 
     <lb/>
     crusading giant in the realms of oratory, and as 
     <lb/>
     the leaders fence and draw, the minor Chieftains 
     <lb/>
     cheer or jeer as the tide of battle ebbs and flows. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Canadian proposals now on the desks 
     <lb/>
     submitted by the head of a sovereign government 
     <lb/>
     to this Convention, have been bandied about 
     <lb/>
     and given many strange names. This, if I may say 
     <lb/>
     so, is hardly good ethics. Either they are good or 
     <lb/>
     they are not good; but perhaps the fiery en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm of the gentleman from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre has unwittingly helped to strengthen 
     <lb/>
     much of the criticism which these proposals have 
     <lb/>
     received. He may have meant well, but as far as 
     <lb/>
     I am concerned, confederation is not the brain<lb break="no"/>child of Mr. J. R. Smallwood, neither is respon<lb break="no"/>sible government the privileged dowry of my 
     <lb/>
     good friend, Major Cashin. It does seem to me, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that the debates and discussions have 
     <lb/>
     developed into a marathon, a rush to ring the 
     <lb/>
     voters' doorbells, a scramble to see who gets 
     <lb/>
     there first with the most. Ironically enough, it 
     <lb/>
     may well be that in the finals, we will have 
     <lb/>
     brought too little much too late. I apologise for 
     <lb/>
     having perhaps generalised too much, but in view 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that my associate, the very able mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Bonavista Centre, has dwelt at great 
     <lb/>
     length with all salient points in both the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books and the Grey Book, I shall content myself 
     <lb/>
     with a brief summing up of some particular 
     <lb/>
     aspects of these Canadian proposals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The chief line of attack of opponents of con<lb break="no"/>federation seems to be the taxation problem. That 


            <cb/>
         

     is proper I suppose, since two of the greatest fears 
     <lb/>
     of our race are death and taxes. Making a fine 
     <lb/>
     speech in his usual very able way, Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     told of taxes on the house, on the boat, on fishing 
     <lb/>
     equipment. Now, it may well be that Mr. Hollett 
     <lb/>
     assumed such taxes would be necessary under the 
     <lb/>
     provincial set-up to pay for cost of government. 
     <lb/>
     Certain it is, that Mr. Hollett had no intention to 
     <lb/>
     tell Newfoundlanders that they were paying taxes 
     <lb/>
     now; for presently at the end of the fiscal year, 
     <lb/>
     the cost of government will have extracted from 
     <lb/>
     our people something in the vicinity of $40 mil<lb break="no"/>lions. Mr. Hollett very properly pointed out that 
     <lb/>
     fishermen may have to pay a tax or license to 
     <lb/>
     operate fishing equipment under confederation. 
     <lb/>
     May I be personal, Mr. Chairman, and get dis<lb break="no"/>trict-minded and be guilty of that Bonavista Bay 
     <lb/>
     provincialism? In 1946 a schooner in which I had 
     <lb/>
     an interest fished in the Province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     There was no tax other than a license fee of $10 
     <lb/>
     per codtrap. Thus the maximum taxes collected 
     <lb/>
     from the schooner amounted to exactly $30.... 
     <lb/>
     Against that, if I could have purchased supplies 
     <lb/>
     in that Canadian Labrador port, the cost of 
     <lb/>
     production of that schooner would have been 
     <lb/>
     reduced by not less than 25%. Furthermore, that 
     <lb/>
     same province pays a bonus to fishermen for all 
     <lb/>
     small boats. That doesn't exist here, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, except in cases of boats 12 tons and up; and 
     <lb/>
     my guess is that 90% of Newfoundland fishing 
     <lb/>
     boats are less than ten tons. The ordinary New<lb break="no"/>foundlander does not need to be told that taxes 
     <lb/>
     are necessary, with that he is not greatly con<lb break="no"/>cerned. What does concern him is this: who will 
     <lb/>
     pay the taxes? Will it be, as it ever was in this 
     <lb/>
     country, placed on the backs of the toiling fisher<lb break="no"/>men. the industrious farmer, least able to bear it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, we must not ask our people to 
     <lb/>
     accept conclusions that are disturbing or fantas<lb break="no"/>tic, or other than those that cool logic would 
     <lb/>
     allow. Mr. Fogwill talked a few days ago of 
     <lb/>
     excise taxes, excise duties, sales taxes, luxury 
     <lb/>
     taxes, presenting an imposing array of figures 
     <lb/>
     which, in my estimation at least, has singled him 
     <lb/>
     out as a topnotcher in mathematics. He pointed 
     <lb/>
     out how an extra $10 million from such sources 
     <lb/>
     would be extracted from Newfoundlanders, and 
     <lb/>
     thus go to enrich to coffers of the government of 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie King. What Mr. Fogwill apparently 
     <lb/>
     forgot in his breakdown of figures and his ob<lb break="no"/>vious concern at their huge dimensions was just 
  

            <pb n="1123" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1123.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1123</fw>
        

     this: that with all the taxes he mentions, the 
     <lb/>
     greater part of the commodities he listed will be 
     <lb/>
     purchased under confederation very consider<lb break="no"/>ably cheaper than they are at present. Let me 
     <lb/>
     illustrate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the Christmas recess I was approached 
     <lb/>
     by a very intelligent fisherman. Walking into my 
     <lb/>
     store, he greeted me with, "Merry Christmas, 
     <lb/>
     profiteer". I had long ago joined "the customer is 
     <lb/>
     always right club", so I couldn't say a thing about 
     <lb/>
     it. In his hand he carried copies of a Montreal 
     <lb/>
     daily and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Maritime Merchant</hi>. "What have 
     <lb/>
     you there?", I asked. "Something for you to carry 
     <lb/>
     back to the Convention", he rejoined, and then he 
     <lb/>
     let loose with a barrage. "Is this correct," he 
     <lb/>
     asked, "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Maritime Merchant</hi> — flour, 98 pound 
     <lb/>
     bag, $4.75 at St. John, New Brunswick?" I tried 
     <lb/>
     to explain the subsidy. He then quoted "Hay, $30 
     <lb/>
     per ton". This was November 8, 1947. "What are 
     <lb/>
     your prices?", he asked. Flour $10; hay $60. He 
     <lb/>
     pointed to a footnote which said a subsidy of $2 
     <lb/>
     had recently been removed from flour; the earlier 
     <lb/>
     price was exactly $2.78. He then quoted retail 
     <lb/>
     prices from page 6 of a Montreal daily — 
     <lb/>
     emperor grapes, 8 cents per pound. "What's your 
     <lb/>
     price?" he asked. "Only 30 cents," I said. I tried 
     <lb/>
     to explain disparity in prices. My only reward 
     <lb/>
     was "swindler", and I might as well have tried to 
     <lb/>
     swim the Atlantic as to convince that fellow. I 
     <lb/>
     trust you will pardon me, sir, for talking about 
     <lb/>
     such mundane things as grocery prices, but since 
     <lb/>
     we all must eat, grocery stores are very important 
     <lb/>
     places, and it is in the grocery stores and fishing 
     <lb/>
     boats that the government of tomorrow will be 
     <lb/>
     decided. Mr. Smallwood may not be a mile and 
     <lb/>
     a year ahead of his noisiest critic, as someone has 
     <lb/>
     written, but if he can intelligently show that con<lb break="no"/>federation means a lowering of the cost of living, 
     <lb/>
     then those big bad wolves with no teeth, called 
     <lb/>
     excise taxes, luxury taxes, etc., just won't scare 
     <lb/>
     anybody, for the ordinary fishing Joe and farming 
     <lb/>
     Jack are not so much concerned with what goes 
     <lb/>
     up the river as they are with how much more 
     <lb/>
     cheaply things will come down the river. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "The 15% tax on transportation will cost this 
     <lb/>
     country $200,000," says Mr. Fogwill. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood explains, and no one has satisfactori<lb break="no"/>ly proven him wrong, that add on that 15% and 
     <lb/>
     transportation will still be very considerably 
     <lb/>
     lower than at present. And since I feel that every 
     <lb/>
     member is concerned chiefly with the most good 
     

            <cb/>
         

     to the masses, he will at least admit that if this is 
     <lb/>
     so, then confederation will mean a big advantage; 
     <lb/>
     for a railway ticket reduced by 2 cents a mile will 
     <lb/>
     mean much to the lumberrnan making five trips 
     <lb/>
     a year to the Millenown hinterland. All this has 
     <lb/>
     been said before in this house, so it is a needless 
     <lb/>
     waste of time to go on expounding this and that, 
     <lb/>
     but I cannot refrain from saying again that char<lb break="no"/>ges that the proposals should be thrown out the 
     <lb/>
     door and other derogatory statements, are al<lb break="no"/>together unfair to our people, and unjust to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention. I may or may not vote for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, but in justice to the good people I have the 
     <lb/>
     honour to represent, and conscious of my duties 
     <lb/>
     as an elected representative of this assembly, I am 
     <lb/>
     going to weigh the issue dispassionately, basing 
     <lb/>
     my conclusions as to its merits or otherwise on 
     <lb/>
     the findings of this Convention, and not at all 
     <lb/>
     upon the pet opinions of some would-be aspirants 
     <lb/>
     to political greatness shouting hysterical hal<lb break="no"/>lelujahs to the skies. I submit, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian proposals should be intelligently 
     <lb/>
     studied by every Newfoundlander. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin and Mr. Higgins recently made 
     <lb/>
     two fine speeches, both of great length and signal 
     <lb/>
     distinction. The Major said, in so many words, 
     <lb/>
     that the Canadians want the Labrador. In this 
     <lb/>
     connection will someone tell me just how many 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders have gotten work in our big 
     <lb/>
     northern dependency? Actually, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     as far as I am aware, Bonavista North sent its first 
     <lb/>
     deputation of labourers this past summer, when 
     <lb/>
     through the kind office of my good friend, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Claude Howse, a number of our fishermen 
     <lb/>
     secured work at Knob Lake with a Canadian 
     <lb/>
     company doing preparatory prospecting in that 
     <lb/>
     area. Major Cashin has already stressed that this 
     <lb/>
     was a Canadian company interested in the 
     <lb/>
     development of Labrador. That, to my mind, 
     <lb/>
     sounds like a very good argument for the affirm<lb break="no"/>ative of the motion. The Major further stressed, 
     <lb/>
     with a rather alarming use of superlatives, the 
     <lb/>
     very awkward position which, in his opinion, 
     <lb/>
     Canada finds herself at the moment. So far as I 
     <lb/>
     am concerned, that was simply the Major's 
     <lb/>
     opinion. I was particularly struck, however, by 
     <lb/>
     his application of the term "immoral" to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian system of family allowance. I am quite 
     <lb/>
     sure that the Major was not at all serious when he 
     <lb/>
     used this, for surely a subsidy of $60 or $70 per 
     <lb/>
     year that will ensure some worried mother the 


            <pb n="1124" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-12_Page_1124.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1124</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
          

     wherewithal to purchase clothing and thus help 
     <lb/>
     in that child's education, cannot be termed im<lb break="no"/>moral... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You cut the educational vote in 
     <lb/>
     your provincial budget. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> Is it immoral because it must be 
     <lb/>
     paid for out of some other form of taxation? Then, 
     <lb/>
     by the same yardstick of measurement, the 
     <lb/>
     Gander airport must be termed a very immoral 
     <lb/>
     business, since tens of thousands of our 
     <lb/>
     countrymen who have never gotten five hours 
     <lb/>
     work, contribute every year their pennyworth of 
     <lb/>
     taxes to help defray the operational deficit. The 
     <lb/>
     same can be said of the Railway. All New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders contribute to the liquidation of its 
     <lb/>
     big deficits, but not all Newfoundlanders travel 
     <lb/>
     by, or directly benefit from its services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Like Mr. Fogwill, the Major stressed the many 
     <lb/>
     taxes on ordinary commodities. He talked of 26 
     <lb/>
     taxes on a pair of shoes. He didn't quote the prices 
     <lb/>
     in Canada and St. John's, Newfoundland... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I could have bought shoes here $3 
     <lb/>
     cheaper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> Somebody told of 52 taxes on a 20 
     <lb/>
     ounce loaf of bread, but failed to add that with the 
     <lb/>
     52 taxes included, that same loaf of bread could 
     <lb/>
     be bought 6 cents cheaper in Canada than it can 
     <lb/>
     be here at the moment. I am not going to stress 
     <lb/>
     any of the points so lucidly explained by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins. Like a learned professor of history, he 
     <lb/>
     took us through a very interesting homily, and he 
     <lb/>
     used very few political catchphrases as did his 
     <lb/>
     well-versed associate, the worthy Major. It was 
     <lb/>
     not difficult, however, to disentangle the percep<lb break="no"/>tion of the lawyer from the prejudices of the 
     <lb/>
     politician, for both ultimately arrived at the same 
     <lb/>
     conclusions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I repeat with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins that the Canadian terms are fair, and 
     <lb/>
     I earnestly recommend them to the intelligence 
     <lb/>
     of every fellow Newfoundlander. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Last year I voted against sending a 
     <lb/>
     delegation on to Ottawa. I did that, sir, because 
     <lb/>
     after a number of months in this Convention, I 
     <lb/>
     became convinced we were not properly con<lb break="no"/>stituted to do a job of that kind. I say now — not 
     <lb/>
     prompted by any person in or out of this house — 
     <lb/>
     that in my opinion, the debate during the last three 
     <lb/>
     or four weeks has shown to my own satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     that I am correct and I was justified in reaching 
     <lb/>
     that conclusion. All through this debate, in spite 
   

            <cb/>
        

     of the fact that I felt myself thoroughly incom<lb break="no"/>petent to deal with a number of matters, I kept 
     <lb/>
     notes of things as they were said both for and 
     <lb/>
     against the proposed arrangements for the entry 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland into confederation. I looked at 
     <lb/>
     those notes a few days ago, and if I were to make 
     <lb/>
     a comment of one minute on every one, I should 
     <lb/>
     certainly be talking from now until the closure 
     <lb/>
     motion. I do not propose to do that because a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of what has been said has already been 
     <lb/>
     referred to by other speakers for and against. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are one or two things to which I would 
     <lb/>
     like specifically to refer, and it will be in the main 
     <lb/>
     connected with my feelings that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should not entrust negotiations of this kind to a 
     <lb/>
     body such as the National Convention. Before I 
     <lb/>
     do that, however, and so that I will not be ir<lb break="no"/>relevant and immaterial, I would like to read the 
     <lb/>
     first clause in the proposed arrangements: "1. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will have, as from the date of 
     <lb/>
     union, the status of a province of Canada with all 
     <lb/>
     the rights, powers, privileges and responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     of a province." It is a plain statement of fact. 
     <lb/>
     Since this debate on confederation and for a time 
     <lb/>
     before it, I have heard that clause turned inside 
     <lb/>
     out and given to me in reverse by a whole series 
     <lb/>
     of derogatory statements destined to loosen the 
     <lb/>
     morale of this country, so that we will be able to 
     <lb/>
     contemplate easily, quietly and very deceitfully 
     <lb/>
     the loss of dominion status, the loss of a political 
     <lb/>
     entity of our own, and easily slide into that of the 
     <lb/>
     baby province of the Dominion of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I find it very difficult and a bit embarrassing 
     <lb/>
     to refer to these things, but I must give expression 
     <lb/>
     to the faith that is in me, regardless of its un<lb break="no"/>popularity in many quarters. It seems very 
     <lb/>
     fashionable today in these quarters to play down 
     <lb/>
     national pride, and I ask members here and 
     <lb/>
     anyone listening in, to remember the last 16 
     <lb/>
     months both in and out of this house. New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, as Major Cashin said the other day, 
     <lb/>
     have always been prone to be overcritical of 
     <lb/>
     themselves. This, I think, is a result of a long 
     <lb/>
     series of incidents in the history of New<lb break="no"/>foundland which has given us the attitude that we 
     <lb/>
     must, in some way, be an inferior people. If you 
     <lb/>
     were to meet the ordinary American, he will 
     <lb/>
     approach you in such a way that you will feel that 
     <lb/>
     he is bragging. Nothing is further from the truth. 
     <lb/>
     The real truth of the matter is that he has known 
     <lb/>
     what it is to be free... We have never allowed

     ourselves to look upon ourselves as true New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders; we are ashamed to tell the cock<lb break="no"/>eyed world we are Newfoundlanders; that we are 
     <lb/>
     equal to any people inside or outside the house. 
     <lb/>
     We are as good as any other people, no better, no 
     <lb/>
     worse. The world today is struggling to get a 
     <lb/>
     government which will be effective in stopping 
     <lb/>
     the excesses of nationalism which led to blood 
     <lb/>
     and tears, but that is no reason why the drive and 
     <lb/>
     morale caused by love of country should be lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of, and treated by many people as a thing to 
     <lb/>
     be scorned and looked upon almost with con<lb break="no"/>tempt. This error is, to my mind, one (and this is 
     <lb/>
     a hard thing for me to say) for which we have to 
     <lb/>
     thank, in large measure, the intellectuals of this 
     <lb/>
     country — this talk about the intellectual and 
     <lb/>
     historic processes driving this country into politi<lb break="no"/>cal union with another country! We are told by 
     <lb/>
     many people that we have no right to expect to 
     <lb/>
     stand on our own feet because we are only a small 
     <lb/>
     group of 300,000 people, as if character and 
     <lb/>
     brains and resources were developed only by 
     <lb/>
     bigness in the world. The whole negative attitude 
     <lb/>
     that I have heard on many occasions, I now 
     <lb/>
     repudiate and deny. There should be a pride in the 
     <lb/>
     things done well in this country, and we have 
     <lb/>
     done them well. If we were not so prone to tell 
     <lb/>
     our young politicians that they have been used, 
     <lb/>
     when they stand to a question of principle; if we 
     <lb/>
     had not been so prone to tell our teachers that they 
     <lb/>
     cannot teach as well as people in other countries, 
     <lb/>
     that our education is not as good and as firmly 
     <lb/>
     rooted as the education system of other countries; 
     <lb/>
     if we had not been so prone to go outside and get 
     <lb/>
     experts, you would have a better country and 
     <lb/>
     more morale than you have today. The negative 
     <lb/>
     approach I repudiate and deny, as it is one of sure 
     <lb/>
     inertia, and also one of eventual death. There 
     <lb/>
     were some scornful remarks made when I hap<lb break="no"/>pened to raise the question of faith in speaking of 
     <lb/>
     the Economic Report. Faith should be an in<lb break="no"/>gredient. People may sneer, but faith is the most 
     <lb/>
     important thing you can have, whether in an 
     <lb/>
     organisation, a family, a country or any unit. You 
     <lb/>
     call it faith in one instance and morale in 
     <lb/>
     another.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to give you another example. When we 
     <lb/>
     were discussing the problems of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in England, I did a lot of study and had hoped I 
     <lb/>
     would have been able to show, in my own per<lb break="no"/>sonal way, the aspirations of Newfoundlanders, 
   

            <cb/>
         

     if at all possible. I know many of my colleagues 
     <lb/>
     felt the same way. The dead hand of officialdom 
     <lb/>
     did not allow it. Once we got outside officialdom 
     <lb/>
     in England, I found they could not understand 
     <lb/>
     why we in this country had such little faith in 
     <lb/>
     ourselves; why we were not taking a bolder hand 
     <lb/>
     in our own affairs than we are taking. I found it 
     <lb/>
     in the printing presses we went to see. I talked to 
     <lb/>
     the printers. I found it outside, in places we went 
     <lb/>
     looking for information. I found it from ex-offi<lb break="no"/>cials of the British government. I found it with 
     <lb/>
     the people with whom I lived. I came back to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and the first thing I had to face as 
     <lb/>
     a Newfoundlander was the dead hand of so many 
     <lb/>
     in this country: "Newfoundlanders cannot do 
     <lb/>
     this. We have no faith in ourselves. We are too 
     <lb/>
     small. We must tie up with some other country. 
     <lb/>
     We must become the tail-end of a kite before we 
     <lb/>
     can go anywhere on our own." I feel deeply about 
     <lb/>
     this. I have felt for many years that the problem 
     <lb/>
     of this country is more morale than it is material, 
     <lb/>
     and I am not neglecting the importance of 
     <lb/>
     material things in this world. I am not thinking in 
     <lb/>
     terms merely of baby bonuses or unemployment 
     <lb/>
     insurance. I am thinking in terms of that drive 
     <lb/>
     which can make us work together as a unit to 
     <lb/>
     bring about a decent standard of living for every 
     <lb/>
     man, woman and child in this country. Call it 
     <lb/>
     vague talk; sneer, call it unreal, if you like —I 
     <lb/>
     have heard it said, "It is sheer idealism to talk that 
     <lb/>
     way." As far as I am concerned, let him who 
     <lb/>
     wants to sneer, sneer. But I cannot leave either 
     <lb/>
     this subject or this Convention without giving 
     <lb/>
     expression to that one thing which I feel, and feel 
     <lb/>
     very deeply, is important to us when we face this 
     <lb/>
     issue either of confederation or return to respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, or any other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. If you were to turn up the <hi rendition="simple:italic">World Report</hi> of 
     <lb/>
     December, 1947, you will find there an expres<lb break="no"/>sion of what Canadians are saying on union with 
     <lb/>
     another country. It is one man's opinion, I will 
     <lb/>
     willingly admit; but in their present difficulties it 
     <lb/>
     is being suggested in many quarters that political 
     <lb/>
     union with the United States would be the easiest 
     <lb/>
     way out of the trade difficulties of Canada in her 
     <lb/>
     present situation. If you would care to look up the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">World Report</hi> you will know what I mean. You 
     <lb/>
     will know also that opposition to this kind of 
     <lb/>
     union has been and is widespread in Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     answer to it is the Canadian citizenship law. A 
     <lb/>
     quotation from that report shows they are afraid

     Canada will become the tail-end of the United 
     <lb/>
     States kite. On that point I think perhaps I have 
     <lb/>
     said enough — a little too loudly, perhaps, and 
     <lb/>
     with a little heat. I was determined I should say 
     <lb/>
     it at some time or other because, for anybody who 
     <lb/>
     wishes to listen to me, I want him to think serious<lb break="no"/>ly about this question of morale as we approach 
     <lb/>
     the problem of the future form of government in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, in 1933 we made an error. It 
     <lb/>
     has not taken me from 1933 to 1947 to realise 
     <lb/>
     that. I said so at the time to an ex-Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     — an English Commissioner — and I do not 
     <lb/>
     think I will be breaking confidence if I say that 
     <lb/>
     he agreed that we had made a mistake on the 
     <lb/>
     grounds that we had gotten ourselves in a mess 
     <lb/>
     and we did not ourselves face up to it. What I am 
     <lb/>
     afraid of, in the approach to this problem, is that 
     <lb/>
     we will do exactly the same thing. There has been 
     <lb/>
     a lot of talk here about the Labrador.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">[Short recess]</hi> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Just before recess I was about to say a 
     <lb/>
     few words about clause 2. That is the one which 
     <lb/>
     deals with Labrador. I was saying we have heard 
     <lb/>
     a lot of talk about Labrador. "It cannot happen to 
     <lb/>
     us", some will say, "it was all settled legally." So 
     <lb/>
     was the case which led to the French fishing 
     <lb/>
     rights of 1857 all settled legally, but as a result of 
     <lb/>
     the willingness of the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     — and I think none was for the party and all were 
     <lb/>
     for the state — Newfoundlanders got together 
     <lb/>
     and fought for the rights of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     citizens, and we got what is termed today, or what 
     <lb/>
     used to be termed, the "Magna Carta of New<lb break="no"/>foundland". It has been referred to on two or three 
     <lb/>
     occasions in this chamber. It reads like this: "The 
     <lb/>
     proposals contained in the Convention having 
     <lb/>
     now been unequivocally refused by the Colony, 
     <lb/>
     they will of course fall to the ground and you [the 
     <lb/>
     Governor] are authorised to give such assurance 
     <lb/>
     as you may think proper that the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     Colony of Newfoundland is regarded by His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government as an essential prelimi<lb break="no"/>nary to any modification of their territorial or 
     <lb/>
     maritime rights."<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> All very legal! What about the 
     <lb/>
     territorial rights given in 1940 at the expense of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? Were we asked to give our con<lb break="no"/>sent to the modification of our territory? The 


            <cb/>
        

     answer, of course, is "no". Here is a point I do not 
     <lb/>
     like. If we ever as much consider that we, as 
     <lb/>
     young Newfoundlanders, should ask, should 
     <lb/>
     think about asking, for concessions of some kind 
     <lb/>
     or another on behalf of our people (this has hap<lb break="no"/>pened to me), we are treated as naive, simple 
     <lb/>
     schoolboys (age, Mr. Bradley!). But not the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State! When we discussed the matter 
     <lb/>
     with him, what he said to us in effect was this: 
     <lb/>
     "There are political considerations why the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the United Kingdom should not 
     <lb/>
     approach the United States on this matter; but 
     <lb/>
     now, if you had your own government, you could 
     <lb/>
     make a try." What is the relevancy of what I have 
     <lb/>
     just said to clause 2? In my opinion, just this: on 
     <lb/>
     paper, that clause is fine. I have no doubt about 
     <lb/>
     it. It is perfectly legal. But in the world of power 
     <lb/>
     politics of the higher level, in the world of big 
     <lb/>
     financial interests, there is only one force that can 
     <lb/>
     put teeth in a clause which looks all right on 
     <lb/>
     paper, and that is the willingness of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, however small we may be in 
     <lb/>
     number, to fight to keep our rights. Now, sir, 
     <lb/>
     when I use the word "fight", I do not necessarily 
     <lb/>
     mean fight physically.... If you look in the world 
     <lb/>
     of nations and power politics today, you will find 
     <lb/>
     there is (to use the new term) a cold war being 
     <lb/>
     fought today between the nations of the world. A 
     <lb/>
     cold war can be fought with material possessions, 
     <lb/>
     and it can also be fought with staying power on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the people. In this connection, I come 
     <lb/>
     back to my first point, which is in my personal 
     <lb/>
     opinion the only thing that could put real teeth in 
     <lb/>
     a clause of this kind. Newfoundland and New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, at some time in our long history, 
     <lb/>
     should be able to stand together and say, "We 
     <lb/>
     have certain rights in this country; we are going 
     <lb/>
     to have those rights; insofar as we have the power 
     <lb/>
     we are going to fight to see we keep them; if we 
     <lb/>
     do lose them we will know we have kept the only 
     <lb/>
     thing which matters, and that is the drive to go 
     <lb/>
     forward in the material and spiritual progress of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I would like to turn to the public services 
     <lb/>
     referred to in clause 3. When the list of federal 
     <lb/>
     services which would apply directly to New<lb break="no"/>foundland was read in this Convention, I confess 
     <lb/>
     that I became a bit angered, not because of the 
  

<note xml:id="fn_03">[1] The famous Lahouchere despatch (26 March 1857) stated that "the consent of the community of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land" was an "essential preliminary to any modification of ... territorial or maritime rights." </note>

     mere reading of that list of federal services, but 
     <lb/>
     because of the exaggeration, the overtone, the 
     <lb/>
     emphasis which was laid upon the reading of that 
     <lb/>
     list. So much so, I felt sure that there were people, 
     <lb/>
     thousands of people in this country who had no 
     <lb/>
     experience in these matters at all, who would feel 
     <lb/>
     that if all these services were applied to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, nothing short of the millennium 
     <lb/>
     would have come. At that time, I injected a note 
     <lb/>
     of doubt and later I made an attempt to find out 
     <lb/>
     just how we would benefit, apart from the purely 
     <lb/>
     financial services which were allotted to these 
     <lb/>
     lists of services before us. I came to this con<lb break="no"/>clusion: we could not possibly benefit very much 
     <lb/>
     materially by the direct application of these 
     <lb/>
     federal services. for the following reasons. Most 
     <lb/>
     of these services are research and consulting ser<lb break="no"/>vices. Secondly, the result of the findings of these 
     <lb/>
     services are open to Newfoundland today and are 
     <lb/>
     being availed of by Newfoundlanders. Take for 
     <lb/>
     example, geology, labour, agriculture. Let us 
     <lb/>
     look at page 19 of the Black Book (volume 2), 
     <lb/>
     the long list of services. The delegation put a 
     <lb/>
     question directly to the Ottawa group: 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Question: Would the agricultural services 
     <lb/>described in the Canadian memorandum 
     <lb/>automatically extend to Newfoundland in the 
     <lb/>event of union? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Answer: One of the services which the 
     <lb/>Department of Agriculture would expect to 
     <lb/>make available to Newfoundland in such 
     <lb/>event, would be the experimental farms ser<lb break="no"/>vice. While the Department is not familiar 
     <lb/>with the present development in this field in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland, they understand that it does 
     <lb/>include a central experimental station. They 
     <lb/>would hope to use such a station in much the 
     <lb/>same way as they use their presently estab<lb break="no"/>lished experimental stations in the various 
     <lb/>provinces of Canada and through this they 
     <lb/>would plan to develop supplementary ser<lb break="no"/>vices, which in Canada take the form of il<lb break="no"/>lustration stations and, where required,

            <p>
     Out of a list of five or six, that was the answer 
     <lb/>
     to that particular question. A little further on, a 
     <lb/>
     question was put on the Canadian Farm Board 
     <lb/>
     loans. The answer was that the loans would be 
     <lb/>
     made available to Newfoundland. On the 
     <lb/>
     mortgage loans, I would not like to see that intro<lb break="no"/>duced into Newfoundland because I am aware of 
     <lb/>
     the fact, through my reading, that those loans and 
     <lb/>
     mortgages on farms in both the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Canada have led, in my opinion, to a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of hardship. I believe we should develop agricul<lb break="no"/>tural services in Newfoundland, and I believe that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland should find the money to develop 
     <lb/>
     these resources without taking mortgages on 
     <lb/>
     people's property. The real point I want to make 
     <lb/>
     is this: in agriculture, all you have is their promise 
     <lb/>
     that one service would apply to Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and that one service we already have, presumably 
     <lb/>
     up to the standard which Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     require at the present time. Then on page 21:

     Prime Minister King gives an explanation of

     military arrangements with the United States; 
     <lb/>
     and when he was just about finished, he was

     Mr. Mackenzie King: The Permanent Joint

     <lb/>Government of Newfoundland on the Board.

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, that is pretty plain as to 
     <lb/>
     their intention. Mr. Higgins said here yesterday 
     <lb/>
     afternoon that every man and every woman in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland feels in his or her heart that if any 
     <lb/>
     international trouble starts, we will be, this time, 
     <lb/>
     in the thick of the fight. If anyone will look at the 
     <lb/>
     publications by the Office of War Information 
     <lb/>
     published in 1940, he will see there that prior to 
     <lb/>
     1940 the American government was well aware 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that Newfoundland was in the possible 
     <lb/>
     path of the approach to the American continent. 
     <lb/>
     He will see it in print and in diagram in the form 
     <lb/>
     of an arrow coming right down straight through 
     <lb/>
     the St. Lawrence. Surely the people to whom 
     <lb/>
     concessions have been given without our con<lb break="no"/>sent, a friendly country who will dominate us to 
     <lb/>
     the extent that they are not in any way to be 
     <lb/>
     charged with anything, even to be given the use 
     <lb/>
     of the roads without having to pay the cost, not 
     <lb/>
     only the license for the number plates that are on 
     <lb/>
     them; surely Newfoundland should in a matter of 
     <lb/>
     this kind have some say and some representation. 
     <lb/>
     I happen to be aware of the fact that a civilian in 
     <lb/>
     an important position in Newfoundland, on more 
     <lb/>
     than one occasion during the last war, had the 
     <lb/>
     courage to protect civilian rights when they were 
     <lb/>
     trying to be usurped by the military, unnecessari<lb break="no"/>ly. I say that a thing like this going into the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books should have been thoroughly aired, and 
     <lb/>
     we in Newfoundland should have been given 
     <lb/>
     something more than has been given. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Right on that point, I come to another made by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Harrington and Major Cashin when they 
     <lb/>
     referred to the number of material things which 
     <lb/>
     Canada would control. These are purely material 
     <lb/>
     things and to me they do not count very much. 
     <lb/>
     Whether Canada controls the Railway, the post 
     <lb/>
     office or other things does not, to me, amount to 
     <lb/>
     very much. I agree with both gentlemen on that 
     <lb/>
     point. But I have to ask myself, and I think we 
     <lb/>
     ought to ask ourselves, in the control of these 
     <lb/>
     things, what are we really giving up? Here is what 
     <lb/>
     we are giving up — any possible advantage or 
     <lb/>
     bargaining power we might get out of our 
     <lb/>
     strategic position. We may not get a thing, but I 
     <lb/>
     for one at least, want to make an effort, or the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country should make an effort in 
     <lb/>
     that behalf. We are giving up communications, 
   
<note xml:id="fn_04">[1] In the Black Books.</note>

     controlled entirely away from this country — 
     <lb/>
     railway, telegraph, control of roads in an emer<lb break="no"/>gency, our government marine fleet, our broad<lb break="no"/>casting corporation. In short, we are giving up the 
     <lb/>
     control of all our essential communications, and 
     <lb/>
     all that might mean to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland if (and God forbid) we should get into 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. We are giving up the control of our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. We are giving up the right to decide on 
     <lb/>
     the question of conscription for ourselves, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that we have down through our history 
     <lb/>
     prided ourselves that we have always turned out 
     <lb/>
     on a voluntary basis enough people to do as 
   

            <cb/>
        

     much, and probably more than our share in the 
     <lb/>
     defence of freedom. We are giving up this too, 
     <lb/>
     the right to fix our own rates of taxation, and on 
     <lb/>
     that I would like to have one word on sales tax 
     <lb/>
     alone. I am not going into the question of taxation 
     <lb/>
     fully. I am going to say one thing on what was 
     <lb/>
     not brought out particularly, the general sales tax; 
     <lb/>
     that is an indirect tax. 
     <lb/>

     ask His Excellency the Governor in Commission 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain from His Majesty's Government the 
     <lb/>
     following information: In the referendum that is 
     <lb/>

     such a referendum will be decided and a future

     the form of government on the ballot which

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I again draw to your attention 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the question regarding the Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada has not been answered. I drew it to your 
     <lb/>
     attention yesterday, and I have asked you to find 
     <lb/>
     out whether or not we're going to get an answer. 
     <lb/>
     If they are not going to answer, let them say so 
     <lb/>
     right here and now. That's number one. Second<lb break="no"/>ly, I asked the question with regard to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Savings Bank. And I just want to say 
     <lb/>
     this, that if I don't get a satisfactory answer to 
     <lb/>
     both of these questions tomorrow, I'm going to 
     <lb/>
     take some other steps. These are questions, 
     <lb/>
     proper questions put on the order paper and if you 
     <lb/>
     ignore them — I don't say the Savings Bank 
     <lb/>
     question is being ignored, because it's only been 
     <lb/>
     there since yesterday, but the other one has been 
     <lb/>
     there since the end of November and has been 
     <lb/>
     deliberately ignored. I want an answer to that 
     <lb/>
     question, even if I have to go so far as to move 
     <lb/>
     the adjournment of this debate.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your question relating to the

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     it yesterday, I requested the Secretary to get in 
     <lb/>
     touch with W. J. Carew, the Secretary to the 
     <lb/>
     Commission government, immediately. He did 
     <lb/>
     so, with what result I'm unfortunately unable to 
     <lb/>
     say at the moment...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> ....I don't want to make any trouble 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention, but if that question is not 
     <lb/>
     answered tomorrow, I'm going to take some 
     <lb/>
     other steps. I'll certainly take steps in connection 
     <lb/>
     with our own Savings Bank. I have all kinds of 
     <lb/>
     information regarding it. It's my job to find that 
     <lb/>
     kind of thing out. I'll have very good information 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the Bank of Canada. But I want the 
     <lb/>
     information officially. Unless they are prepared 
     <lb/>
     to come along with that, I can't see why they 
     <lb/>
     chuck terms at us; they're not prepared to tell us 
     <lb/>
     their financial position.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What was the question on the

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> The one on the Savings Bank was 
     <lb/>
     — there's nothing in the Black Books about it, or

     the Grey Books or any other book — what will 
     <lb/>
     happen to the Newfoundland Savings Bank in the 
     <lb/>
     event of Newfoundland becoming the tenth 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. I know, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     in Canada there's no government savings bank, 
     <lb/>
     none. To date the Newfoundland people have $20 
     <lb/>
     million approximately in that bank ... and the 
     <lb/>
     average rate of interest paid to depositors last 
     <lb/>
     year works out to practically 2.75%. Now if that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Savings Bank is to be abolished, 
     <lb/>
     the only interest that people would get on their 
     <lb/>
     monies in the ordinary Canadian chartered banks 
     <lb/>
     today would be 1.5% and in some instances they 
     <lb/>
     won't get that. Now, what is 2.75% interest on
