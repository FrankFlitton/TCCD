                                          <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, in the absence
                                          of Mr. <lb/> K.M. Brown, who is unfortunately
                                          incapacitated, <lb/> I have been requested as acting
                                          chairman of the <lb/> Fisheries Committee to present an
                                          interim report. <lb/> This is not a complete report, but I
                                          fancy that the <lb/> delegates will nevertheless find it
                                          both interest<lb break="no"/>ing and instructive, and, I
                                          hope, helpful to our <lb/> deliberations. It will give
                                          them a general idea of <lb/> the great importance of the
                                          cold storage industry <lb/> in Newfoundland. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     It gives plenty of food for thought, dealing 
     <lb/>
     mainly with our new industry. Many people in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will agree with the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Committee's View that the future welfare and 
     <lb/>
     happiness of our people depend largely upon the 
     <lb/>
     future development of this industry. Delegates 
     <lb/>
     will find copies on their desks, and it has been 
     <lb/>
     suggested that it is not necessary to have the 
     <lb/>
     report read in full, as it can better be studied by 
     <lb/>
     the delegates at their homes or temporary 
     <lb/>
     quarters before being debated. I would however 
     <lb/>
     like to make a few comments in presenting it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     About five-sixths of the report deals merely 
     <lb/>
     with facts and figures of Newfoundland's cold 
     <lb/>
     storage industry. During the discussions of these 
     <lb/>
     facts it became evident to the members of your 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Committee that the future prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     this industry, and indeed of our country, 
     <lb/>
     depended largely upon future tariff and tax arran<lb break="no"/>gements for entries of our products, especially 
     <lb/>
     those of our fisheries, into the United States of 
     <lb/>
     America, and that until some long-term arrange<lb break="no"/>ments regarding tariffs can be made for years 
     <lb/>
     ahead, it may be difficult to further develop our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries and particularly our cold storage in<lb break="no"/>dustry. People can hardly be expected to make 
     <lb/>
     large capital expenditures for expansion of an 
     <lb/>
     industry until reasonably certain that a definite 
     <lb/>
     market for their products is available, and that it 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
   
   
           
     cannot be suddenly taken away by the imposition 
     <lb/>
     of adverse tariffs. How vulnerable our country is 
     <lb/>
     as regards external tariffs is clearly shown by the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the so-called processing tax which was 
     <lb/>
     enacted by the USA some 10 or 15 years ago, and 
     <lb/>
     which has since then absolutely prevented expor<lb break="no"/>tation of our seal oil to the USA. Prior to this 
     <lb/>
     enactment something like 50 per cent or more of 
     <lb/>
     our seal oil production went to that market. The 
     <lb/>
     enactment discouraged, if it did not help actually 
     <lb/>
     to kill, a valuable industry. Today the world is 
     <lb/>
     literally crying out for fats, under which category 
     <lb/>
     our seal and herring oils come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It naturally occurred to members that the USA 
     <lb/>
     might appreciate our need for some permanent 
     <lb/>
     tariff concessions, in view of the fact that she 
     <lb/>
     herself sought and obtained tariff concessions 
     <lb/>
     and long-term leases from us before erecting her 
     <lb/>
     permanent military and naval bases in New<lb break="no"/>foundland territories. She did this mainly for the 
     <lb/>
     protection of her people, and incidentally for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Great Britain, of Canada, and of the 
     <lb/>
     comparatively insignificant population of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. She asked for, or perhaps demanded, 
     <lb/>
     99 year leases and also freedom from customs 
     <lb/>
     and other taxation of every sort. These conces<lb break="no"/>sions under the serious stress of war times were 
     <lb/>
     granted by our Commission of Government no 
     <lb/>
     doubt at the instance of Great Britain, probably 
     <lb/>
     at the personal request of that greatest of war 
     <lb/>
     statesmen, the Honourable Winston Churchill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Can we blame him, or anyone else, for at that 
     <lb/>
     time overlooking the fact that they were asking 
     <lb/>
     us to concede without any actual consideration, 
     <lb/>
     long period leases of Newfoundland territory and 
     <lb/>
     other concessions which today Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     consider should not have been conceded without 
     <lb/>
     some substantial quid pro quo for the owners? No 
     <lb/>
     doubt our little country, with her small popula<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_x1">1 Volume II:21 1. [Volume II is not in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Confederation Debates</hi> Collection]</note><pb n="69"

            <fw type="dateline">October 1946</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">69</fw>tion amounting to about 300,000 persons, was 
     <lb/>
     looked upon as a mere pawn in the game, which 
     <lb/>
     must be sacrificed to win the war. But I most 
     <lb/>
     strongly affirm that we think differently, and that 
     <lb/>
     we consider we are entitled to some substantial 
     <lb/>
     and permanent consideration in return for the 
     <lb/>
     concessions yielded. Admittedly it was no time 
     <lb/>
     for argument when these bases and concessions 
     <lb/>
     were granted, as the enemy was literally at our 
     <lb/>
     own gates and all statesmen were concentrating 
     <lb/>
     upon the first essential, namely the winning of the 
     <lb/>
     war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not suggest that we have received no 
     <lb/>
     benefit from the occupation of these bases by our 
     <lb/>
     American friends, but I do suggest that we have 
     <lb/>
     received only a temporary benefit and that we 
     <lb/>
     had, and perhaps still have, the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     securing a permanent benefit by means of special 
     <lb/>
     tax considerations in the USA in return for the 
     <lb/>
     concessions granted by us. I think every fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minded person will agree that some reservation 
     <lb/>
     for future consideration might have been made 
     <lb/>
     when the long-term leases of our territory and 
     <lb/>
     freedom from taxation were being conceded 
     <lb/>
     without consultation with the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. For all we know, there may have been 
     <lb/>
     some reservations, but the bald fact remains that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has so far received <hi rendition="simple:italic">no quid pro 
     <lb/>
     quo</hi> for the valuable concessions granted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was with this fact in mind that your Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Committee added to the factual portion of the 
     <lb/>
     report the summary which I will read verbatim, 
     <lb/>
     as it is regarded by the Committee as airing one 
     <lb/>
     of the most important matters affecting the dis<lb break="no"/>cussions and recommendations of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     To sum up the position it seems clear to

            <p>
     1. The future welfare of Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     without doubt mainly dependent upon a free 
     <lb/>
     market for her export products, especially 
     <lb/>
     those from the fisheries.

     3. The strategical position of New<lb break="no"/>foundland as disclosed by conditions arising 
     <lb/>
     out of the recent world war, is of the utmost 
     <lb/>
     importance to the millions of people in the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America and also to those of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and Great Britain, and all these 
     <lb/>
     countries have a definite interest in assisting 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland to improve their 
     <lb/>
     standard of living for the following reasons: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) In the case of Canada the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of a prosperous Newfoundland is of 
     <lb/>
     special interest, owing to the fact that New<lb break="no"/>foundland's imports from Canada amount to 
     <lb/>
     a very large percentage of the total imports 
     <lb/>
     into Newfoundland, whereas unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     she is not in a position to provide in her own 
     <lb/>
     country a market for Newfoundland's chief 
     <lb/>
     exports. It is therefore to the interest of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to help and encourage our export 
     <lb/>
     trade in other directions, in order to retain and 
     <lb/>
     increase her present exports to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Moreover Canada has already 
     <lb/>
     received important concessions from New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (b) Great Britain is obviously anxious 
     <lb/>
     to assist us. In recent years she has supplied 
     <lb/>
     grants-in-aid to Newfoundland, but it is quite 
     <lb/>
     likely she may not be in a position to continue 
     <lb/>
     these in future years. She can assist us in 
     <lb/>
     making better tariff arrangements not only 
     <lb/>
     with the United States of America, but with 
     <lb/>
     other countries. Moreover, it can be borne in 
     <lb/>
     mind that it was with her authority that sec<lb break="no"/>tions of our territory have been ceded to the 
     <lb/>
     USA without any suitable <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (c) In the case of the USA, leases of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland territory for military and 
     <lb/>
     naval bases for 99 years, and at the same time 
     <lb/>
     facilities for free entry without taxation of 
     <lb/>
     any sort of products imported into this 
     <lb/>
     country for use at these bases, were conceded 
     <lb/>
     without any direct <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. It would seem to be extremely impor<lb break="no"/>tant to the people of Newfoundland that 
     <lb/>
     negotiations should be initiated at an early 
     <lb/>
     date with a view to securing favourable trade 
     <lb/>
     arrangements for Newfoundland with the 
     <lb/>
     USA, not only on the basis of reciprocal tariff 
     <lb/>

     concessions, but also as a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi> for 
     <lb/>
     the concessions already granted by way of 99 
     <lb/>
     year leases and free customs entries.

     5. Whilst this report deals mainly with 
     <lb/>
     the cold storage industry in relation to fish<lb break="no"/>eries, sight must not be lost of other New<lb break="no"/>foundland products which are, or may be, 
     <lb/>
     subject to duty and tax restrictions entering 
     <lb/>
     the USA, and which also have considerable 
     <lb/>
     bearing on Newfoundland economy. Among 
     <lb/>
     these may be mentioned: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) Herring and its by-products, such 
     <lb/>
     as herring oil and meal. 
     <lb/>
           

          
     (b) White fish meal. 
     <lb/>
           

            
     (c) Seal oil and seal skins. 
     <lb/>
            

           
     (d) Cod liver oil and common cod oil. 
     <lb/>
           

           
     (e) Salt codfish and all other fishery 
     <lb/>
     products including canned goods. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. Recommendations contained herein 
     <lb/>
     must not be construed as limiting any views 
     <lb/>
     on the subject of tariffs which could be 
     <lb/>
     reasonably put forward in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     other Newfoundland industries, such as lum<lb break="no"/>bering, pulp and paper, and mining.<ref target="#fn_x2">[1]</ref>

     I cannot believe, Mr. Chairman, that great 
     <lb/>
     countries like the USA, Canada, and of course, 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, will fail to realise our viewpoint 
     <lb/>
     and will deny us the opportunity to expand our 
     <lb/>
     important fishery, sealing and other industries to 
     <lb/>
     a point that will enable us to improve our stand<lb break="no"/>ards of living, which have been the subject of so 
     <lb/>
     much destructive comment in the press of all 
     <lb/>
     these countries from time to time. They now have 
     <lb/>
     a chance to help us and I believe they will do so 
     <lb/>
     if properly approached with a direct appeal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot help believing that a round table 
     <lb/>
     conference between authorised representatives 
     <lb/>
     of these three great countries with Newfound<lb break="no"/>land representatives acting entirely in New<lb break="no"/>foundland interests, could not fail to arrive at 
     <lb/>
     some arrangement which would give us the tariff 
     <lb/>
     and tax free concessions which we so urgently 
     <lb/>
     require, to secure for our people by their own 
     <lb/>
     effort a respectable standard of living. It may be 
     <lb/>
     that during our discussions at this Convention of 
     <lb/>
     the forms of government to be recommended, 
     <lb/>
     one of those put forward might be some form of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government sponsored or fostered by 
     <lb/>
     a joint advisory council consisting of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from Great Britain, Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
   
          
     USA, with or without some partial control by 
     <lb/>
     such a council over our financial and external 
     <lb/>
     policy, to help us to keep from running off the 
     <lb/>
     rails This idea is not entirely my own, and I 
     <lb/>
     merely mention it in passing.

            <p>
     I beg to move that the interim report of the 
     <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What is the wish of the
                                                 Conven<lb break="no"/>tion on the subject of the
                                          Chadwick and Jones <lb/> report? <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
                                          <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Chairman, with
                                          your permis<lb break="no"/>sion I would like to trespass
                                          on the time of the <lb/> Convention whilst I make a few
                                          general remarks <lb/> about some of the subjects that have
                                          been before <lb/> the Convention since its opening. It is,
                                          I think, <lb/> expected that every member should make some
                                          <lb/> contribution, no matter how modest it might be,
                                          <lb/> to aid the Convention in its work. That is ex<lb
                                                 break="no"/>pected of us by the country which sent
                                          the Con<lb break="no"/>vention here, and by the people of
                                          the different <lb/> sections who have chosen us to
                                          represent them <lb/> and to speak for them as well as we
                                          can. <lb/>
                                   </p>

            <p>
     No matter what the outcome of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion may be, the section of the country that I come 
     <lb/>
     from will always have to depend almost entirely 
     <lb/>
     on the fisheries. For a great portion of the south<lb break="no"/>west section of Newfoundland the future 
     <lb/>
     economy is a matter of the development on pro<lb break="no"/>gressive lines of the fishing industry. I think 
     <lb/>
     everybody will agree with Mr. Wild when he 
     <lb/>
     says "there is room for considerable development 
     <lb/>
     of the fisheries", and we hope that, no matter what 
     <lb/>
     form of government is to follow the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     the policy outlined by Mr. Wild will be carried 
     <lb/>
     out when he says that "a determined effort will 
     <lb/>
     be made to stabilise prices and to ensure that 
     <lb/>
     primary producers are given a fairer deal than 
     <lb/>
     they often were in the past." If we could feel that 
     <lb/>
     this would be really the policy of the future 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland, no matter what it 
     <lb/>
           
   
       
            <cb/>
            
     might be, it would be good and heartening news 
     <lb/>
     for large numbers of the fishermen throughout 
     <lb/>
     the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to stress that the men from the 
     <lb/>
     district I represent are engaged largely in what we 
     <lb/>
     call the deep sea fishery. This entails greater 
     <lb/>
     hardship than the shore fishing. The men leave 
     <lb/>
     their homes in the dead of winter when storms are 
     <lb/>
     most severe, and the danger and hardship to 
     <lb/>
     which they are subjected earn for them a special 
     <lb/>
     place in our consideration, and a special recogni<lb break="no"/>tion by the government in any future plans for the 
     <lb/>
     development of the fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     There will have to be other means of work for 
     <lb/>
     the people in times outside the fishing season. We 
     <lb/>
     were glad to hear the remarks of the Governor the 
     <lb/>
     other day when he referred to the road from Burin 
     <lb/>
     Peninsula to Terenceville. The people of the 
     <lb/>
     peninsula have been looking forward to this main 
     <lb/>
     highway for many years. Some of the older 
     <lb/>
     people in the district still remember the first 
     <lb/>
     campaign of Sir Edward Morris when he came to 
     <lb/>
     the district nearly 40 years ago. Addressing the 
     <lb/>
     people of Burin, he spoke of the need for this road 
     <lb/>
     to help the development of the Burin Peninsula. 
     <lb/>
     Some people might be inclined to say this was 
     <lb/>
     done for political purposes, but however that may 
     <lb/>
     be, Lord Morris showed great insight into the 
     <lb/>
     future. We hope that in the reconstruction work 
     <lb/>
     of the next few years this important highway will 
     <lb/>
     have a foremost place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Speaking of the election, I would ask that a 
     <lb/>
     date be selected which will enable every voter to 
     <lb/>

     avail of his privilege to cast his vote at this 
     <lb/>
     important time in our country's affairs, and not 
     <lb/>
     one at which many of the people would be absent 
     <lb/>
     from their homes and therefore deprived of this 
     <lb/>
     privilege. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion I feel that every member of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention will do his utmost to justify the hopes 
     <lb/>
     and the wishes of the people of the country who 
     <lb/>
     sent us here. It will not be easy to recommend the 
     <lb/>
     form of government under which future New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders must live, but when the time comes 
     <lb/>
     for the people to make a choice, after hearing 
     <lb/>
     what the Convention has to say, I am sure the 
     <lb/>
     good judgment and the strong commonsense of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders will guide them to make a wise 
     <lb/>
     decision.

                                          <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Any other member wish to
                                          <lb/> speak on this motion? <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have
                                          not as <lb/> yet spoken to this motion on the Chadwick and
                                          <lb/> Jones report. When this report was brought in <lb/>
                                          first the Convention was more or less feeling <lb/>
                                          around, trying to get its feet, and I imagine that <lb/>
                                          this discussion was initiated to get things started <lb/>
                                          here. We had the Chadwick and Jones report, and <lb/>
                                          since then we have had the reconstruction plans <lb/> of
                                          the Commission of Government, the financial <lb/> report,
                                          etc., and now we have enough extraneous <lb/> matter. We
                                          have the Fisheries Report now, the <lb/> first real work
                                          that has been done by this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. The
                                          Education Committee, I understand, <lb/> will have its
                                          report completed very soon, and <lb/> other committees are
                                          ready to come forward too, <lb/> so I would suggest that,
                                          if it meets with the <lb/> approval of the Convention, we
                                          give the Chad<lb break="no"/>wick and Jones report the six
                                          months hoist, and <lb/> get down to our own work as soon
                                          as possible. <lb/>

                                          <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have not
                                                 any<lb break="no"/>thing prepared to say in regards

                                          feel about it. I <lb/> would say, sir, there is nothing in
                                          it we don't <lb/> already know, and therefore I would say
                                          here <lb/> that, as an individual, I am very much disap<lb
                                                 break="no"/>pointed in the report. I remember when
                                          the Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government was
                                          instituted in this <lb/> country it promised two things â€”
                                          political educa<lb break="no"/>tion and economic
                                          development. There is no <lb/> question about it this
                                          Convention is a political <lb/> education, not only for us
                                          assembled here but for <lb/> the country as a whole. In
                                          regards to the economic <lb/> development of this country
                                          the Commission of <lb/> Government has failed utterly.
                                          There has not <lb/> been one major industry established in
                                          our <lb/> country. There has not been one which was <lb/>
                                          plugged. As regards the report I am against it <lb/>
                                          because I see nothing in it that is of importance <lb/> to
                                          us as a people â€” that is the economic develop<lb
                                                 break="no"/>ment of our country. I would not vote
                                          in favour <lb/> of its adoption. <lb/>

                                                 per<lb break="no"/>haps it would be better to wait
                                          until the final <lb/> report of the Fisheries Committee is

                                          comparison. I <lb/> think yours is a very excellent
                                          suggestion. It <lb/> would be a pity to lose sight of the
                                          value of the <lb/> Chadwick-Jones report and it is of

                                          should study it in <lb/> detail, and perhaps have it
                                          debated in detail, in <lb/> the way that Mr. Miller

                                          documents; put it <lb/> up against some other documents,

                                          There was one particular question we put to the <lb/>

     Mr. Job The bait depots are not included.

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett With regard to the amount of capital 
     <lb/>
     invested, did the committee arrive at the amount 
     <lb/>
     invested by the government or did they not? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Job I don't know of any money invested by 
     <lb/>the government. That has certainly not been 
     <lb/>taken into account. There may be in one or two 
     <lb/>places advances made by the government which 
     <lb/>have been paid or partly repaid, but they have not 
     <lb/>been taken into account. These figures are rough 
     <lb/>I must confess, but they are the nearest we can 
     <lb/>get. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett I saw in the estimates where a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount of money had been subsidised by the 
     <lb/>
     government for advances to possible corpora<lb break="no"/>tions. I understood also that a certain amount had 
     <lb/>
     been put out, and it might be suggested that the 
     <lb/>
     committee arrive at the true situation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman The committee will make in<lb break="no"/>quiries into that point, Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Newell Mr. Chairman. in the fourth para<lb break="no"/>graph the wording is a little ambiguous. It reads: 
     <lb/>
     "The frozen blueberry industry was also a very 
     <lb/>
     substantial business and of very definite value to 
     <lb/>
     the country owing to the fact that the cost of 
     <lb/>
     picking was very little ...." As it reads it might 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1Volume II:21 1. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     seem as if the value was of small return to the 
     <lb/>
     pickers, but I am sure that is not the thought of 
     <lb/>
     the Fishery Committee, or is it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job I think that the idea was that the cost of 
     <lb/>
     the picking was small comparatively, and it was 
     <lb/>
     a very worthwhile return to the pickers. I think it 
     <lb/>
     was because the price paid to the pickers was 
     <lb/>
     small in past years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hollett There is another question about bait 
     <lb/>
     sold to fishermen. The report states that "The bait 
     <lb/>
     frozen (squid and herring) was substantial, but 
     <lb/>
     nothing like the present-day volume because the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen were not generally so accustomed to 
     <lb/>
     using the frozen bait as they are now." I don't 
     <lb/>
     believe that, because years ago the only reason 
     <lb/>
     why fishermen did not use frozen bait very 
     <lb/>
     generally was because of the cost, which was 
     <lb/>
     almost prohibitive in view of the amount of 
     <lb/>
     money they received for the fish caught. I was 
     <lb/>
     wondering if the committee would be good 
     <lb/>
     enough to look into the present cost of bait as 
     <lb/>
     supplied to first, our shore fishermen, and second, 
     <lb/>
     our bank fishermen. It is absolutely essential if 
     <lb/>
     our fishermen are to use frozen bait that some 
     <lb/>
     means be found to supply that bait at the least 
     <lb/>
     possible cost. The committee might be able to get 
     <lb/>
     some figures with regard to that.... It is several 
     <lb/>
     years since I had anything to do with fishery 
     <lb/>
     conditions, but in those old days there were a 
     <lb/>
     good many cases of the fall fishing being given 
     <lb/>
     up merely because for that fishery it became 
     <lb/>
     necessary for the banking fleet to procure frozen 
     <lb/>
     bait, and after trying it for a number of years they 
     <lb/>
     discovered that the returns which the individual 
     <lb/>
     fisherman made on that trip were absolutely nil 
     <lb/>
     when they took into consideration the cost of 
     <lb/>
