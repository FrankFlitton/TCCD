     In view of certain statements made by

     Mr. P.J. Cashin, a member of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention, during the proceedings at a 
     <lb/>
     recent case in the Supreme Court, the Broad<lb break="no"/>casting Corporation feels it should have some 
     <lb/>
     assurance from the Convention on its attitude 
     <lb/>
     towards the recording and subsequent broad<lb break="no"/>casting of proceedings of the sessions of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Would you please ascertain the wishes of

     the Convention in this respect and advise us 
     <lb/>
     accordingly.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I presume the intention of this let<lb break="no"/>ter is that the Corporation wishes to know the 
     <lb/>feelings of the Convention with respect to broad<lb break="no"/>casting â€” whether it is our direct wish that the 
     <lb/>broadcasting of the debates be continued or not. 
     <lb/>Speaking for myself, I am sorry that it happened 
     <lb/>at the beginning, butnow that it is here and people 
     <lb/>have been listening in as fully as we feel they 
     <lb/>have been, it might be rather regrettable if it were 
     <lb/>discontinued at this stage.

     <lb/>people in the outports have no chance whatever 
     <lb/>to hear the proceedings of the Convention as far 
     <lb/>as newspapers are concerned. The people in 
     <lb/>St. John's have the daily papers, but the people 
     <lb/>in the outports, if they can't listen in, have no

            <cb/>
          

     people look to the radio for the broadcasting of 
     <lb/>
     what the Convention is doing. I agree with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins too, that I would have voted against 
     <lb/>
     it had it been put to the question, but since it is in 
     <lb/>
     the House I feel it should be continued.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I feel that I would prefer to keep 
     <lb/>
     them in, so that there would be no implication 
     <lb/>
     with respect to a certain case arising out of the 
     <lb/>
     use of it.

     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Our duty here is to survey 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's position. Now in doing that we 
     <lb/>
     must sometimes be ruthless. We must go without 
     <lb/>
     regard to the law. We are not always going to be 
     <lb/>
     free of libel. Are we going to forfeit the right to 
     <lb/>
     give the public this information, or are we going 
     <lb/>
     to forfeit half the issue as far as Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     concerned? Fifty years hence, will it be better that 
     <lb/>
     the people will have gotten our chatter here, 
     <lb/>
     limited and restricted, or will it be better that we 
     <lb/>
     disregard that? We will be at a loss, too, if we 
     <lb/>
     don't get out and talk to our districts, and the 
     <lb/>
     people will be at a loss, but won't we do a better 
     <lb/>
     job if we disregard that and go into the situation 
     <lb/>
     deeply and having fully explored it all, then give 
     <lb/>
     our just opinion on the whole thing? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I notice some remarks have been 
     <lb/>
     made about one of the remarks of a certain mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this Convention yesterday. I don't exactly 
     <lb/>
     know what these references were, but I do know 
     <lb/>
     this: that this Convention was definitely referred 
     <lb/>
     to yesterday as a debating society. If we are 
     <lb/>
     purely and simply a debating society, I think there 
     <lb/>
     is very little room for these microphones here. 
     <lb/>
     That came up, as I remember, in a discussion on 
     <lb/>
     the matter of privilege. We were compared to a 
     <lb/>
     debating society, and had no more privilege than 
     <lb/>
     that. I feel that the presence of the microphones 
     <lb/>
     very certainly informs the general public as to the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings that have taken place. I do feel, 
     <lb/>
     however, that there are occasions when it would 
     <lb/>
     be wise that the prior discussion of certain mat<lb break="no"/>ters, at any rate, should not go out over the air, 
     <lb/>
     but merely the decision arrived at by the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion by a discussion which, in some cases, might 
     <lb/>
     possibly be heated. I don't think that is conducive

     to the well-being of the public. It also retards the 
     <lb/>
     full expression of the individual members of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention as to their ideas on certain things. I 
     <lb/>
     do believe there are occasions when this long- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     suffering public, which was referred to yesterday 
     <lb/>
     by a certain member of the Bar, might be spared 
     <lb/>
     arguments. I do say, as far as a certain member 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention is concerned yesterday, he 
     <lb/>
     said nothing more derogatory about the 
     <lb/>
     microphones than were said by anyone else. I do 
     <lb/>
     think they are serving their purpose provided they 
     <lb/>
     are not monopolised by one or two or a few. I do 
     <lb/>
     think it should be your prerogative to cutout the 
     <lb/>
     broadcasting at certain times. 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I agree with Mr. Hollett. I may say 
     <lb/>that this is the first time I heard of anything 
     <lb/>coming in to find out if we wanted this broadcast<lb break="no"/>ing. It has been here for a long time, and now we 
     <lb/>have a letter asking if we wish to keep it. They 
     <lb/>did not ask us first, and now, as far as I am 
     <lb/>concerned, it can stay here.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I support Mr. Higgins in what he 
     <lb/>said. As the microphones have been here practi<lb break="no"/>cally the full time for every session, I see no 
     <lb/>reason why they should be removed. I think they 
     <lb/>can serve a useful purpose if we, on our part, keep 
     <lb/>as near to the point as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> To bring the matter to a head, I move 
     <lb/>that we request the Broadcasting Corporation, from 
     <lb/>today, to have the microphones in this chamber. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I would like to second that motion. 
     <lb/>If I might speak briefly, there are one or two 
     <lb/>things I would like to point out. First of all, we 
     <lb/>should look at this logically, and not be carried 
     <lb/>away by anything that anyone says here or some<lb break="no"/>where else. If people want to exercise their 
     <lb/>freedom of speech, let them go ahead and do it. 
     <lb/>There are one or two things that appear to me, and 
     <lb/>the first is that broadcasting is about the only 
     <lb/>means of having accurate reporting of what goes 
     <lb/>on here. If we do not broadcast proceedings, the 
     <lb/>only reporting we can rely on is newspaper 
     <lb/>reporting, and they, not being machines, cannot 
     <lb/>give full reports of what transpires here, and the 
     <lb/>people on the outside have to rely on secondhand 
     <lb/>information of what somebody else heard, and 
     <lb/>will not really get a full and accurate report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The other point is this: I feel that if we have 
     <lb/>any reason for refusing to broadcast our proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, in other words if we put the microphones 


            <cb/>
          

     out, I don't see why we should let the public 
     <lb/>
     occupy the galleries. I don't think there is any 
     <lb/>
     necessity for the Convention being conducted in 
     <lb/>
     secret. If it is not being conducted in secret, and 
     <lb/>
     if people care to exercise the privilege of coming 
     <lb/>
     here in person, then I think everybody should be 
     <lb/>
     allowed in through the microphones and broad<lb break="no"/>casting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, whether or not we express ourselves 
     <lb/>
     too fully (it has been argued that some of us do 
     <lb/>
     express ourselves too fully because of the 
     <lb/>
     microphones, and its also been argued that we 
     <lb/>
     don't express ourselves as fully as if they were 
     <lb/>
     not here), I don't think the presence of the 
     <lb/>
     microphones should affect in any way at all the 
     <lb/>
     orderly conducting ofour business. and if we, as 
     <lb/>
     a body of 45 people, are not capable of conduct<lb break="no"/>ing our business in an orderly way in the presence 
     <lb/>
     of the microphones, I don't think we would be 
     <lb/>
     capable of doing it if the microphones were out.... 
     
</p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I wish to support the motion, and 
     <lb/>frankly I do not see any other way that we can 
     <lb/>impart the knowledge that we glean here on the 
     <lb/>affairs of the country to the people, except over 
     <lb/>the radio. I fail to see in what way it excuses us 
     <lb/>from making any fair, full or frank statement in 
     <lb/>this Convention. It definitely does not save us in 
     <lb/>any way, because if we make a libelous state<lb break="no"/>ment, it is still libelous whether the microphones 
     <lb/>are here or not, and the only way that we could 
     <lb/>come out in the open and make statements not for 
     <lb/>the public would be for the Chairman to call a 
     <lb/>secret meeting. I know that the Convention was 
     <lb/>referred to yesterday in a very low manner, but I 
     <lb/>say that the public of Newfoundland can be the 
     <lb/>best judges of that.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like, while we are at it, 
     <lb/>
     to say a word that l have been threatening now 
     <lb/>
     for some time to say, a word of praise for the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who sit here each day in the press box. 
     <lb/>
     I am myself an old newspaper man, and I covered 
     <lb/>
     sessions of this chamber for many many years 
     <lb/>
     and for various governments, and sat in that same 
     <lb/>
     press box, and I know something about the job of 
     <lb/>
     sitting in here, and reporting for the public the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings that go on. I am full of admiration 
     <lb/>
     and respect for the gentlemen who sit in the press 
     <lb/>
     box daily, representing the newspapers and the 
     <lb/>
     radio stations. To my mind the job that the Doyle 
     <lb/>
     News Bulletin<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> does each night is masterly â€” a

     complete, comprehensive and intelligent com<lb break="no"/>pilation of the news of each aftemoon's proceed<lb break="no"/>ings â€” a masterly job. The job done by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Jamieson, not exactly as a newscast but as a 
     <lb/>
     commentary, is a job of which all of us as New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders ought to be proud, proud that we 
     <lb/>
     have a Newfoundlander who turns in a first-class, 
     <lb/>
     finished, professional job of commentary each 
     <lb/>
     night. The gentleman who prepares a broadcast 
     <lb/>
     for VOCM each day, again deserves commenda<lb break="no"/>tion. The same of the men representing the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Eve<lb break="no"/>ning Telegram</hi> and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> â€” fair, 
     <lb/>
     impartial and competent. I think our satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     with the Broadcasting Corporation itself, broad<lb break="no"/>casting the actual proceedings, and our satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion at that being done, ought not to overlook the 
     <lb/>
     splendid service rendered to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland by the gentlemen who sit in the press 
     <lb/>
     box.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have been accused of talking too much. Like 
     <lb/>
     my friend Major Cashin and Mr. Hollett and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bailey and Mr. Fudge and other gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     here, perhaps I talk too much. As a matter of fact 
     <lb/>
     I doubt it. I think that's what we were sent here 
     <lb/>
     for â€” to talk, and think, and study, and carry on 
     <lb/>
     research, and then talk, so that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland can hear. Not just talk nonsense, 
     <lb/>
     but talk about our reports. Ten gentlemen here 
     <lb/>
     were appointed as a Finance Committee They 
     <lb/>
     have spent months digging up the facts about this 
     <lb/>
     country's finances for many year past. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin turned in a splendid job here the other day, 
     <lb/>
     reading that report. What is the good of doing all 
     <lb/>
     that work, if it is not debated and broadcast for 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland? Take this mag<lb break="no"/>nificent report of the Mining Committee. The like 
     <lb/>
     of it has never before been assembled in the 
     <lb/>
     history of this country, and I have readjust about 
     <lb/>
     everything published on mining in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. What is the good of it, if the people 
     <lb/>
     can't hear the debate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While I am at it, Mr. Chairman, I don't think 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country owe any gratitude to 
     <lb/>
     the half dozen people, maybe nine, in the last five 
     <lb/>
     or six months mostly hiding behind a <hi rendition="simple:italic">nom de 
     <lb/>
     plume</hi>, who have written letters to the papers 
     <lb/>
     sneering at the Convention. We talk too much, 
     <lb/>
     etc., and they have not got the brains to know that 
     <lb/>
     that's what we are here for. If they were elected, 
     <lb/>
     and had to come in here, they would have to hold 


            <cb/>
         

     their mouths because they have no brains. That's 
     <lb/>
     all we <hi rendition="simple:italic">can</hi> do â€” talk. We can't order anybody to 
     <lb/>
     do anything. We can only study out our reports 
     <lb/>
     and come in here and debate them. We debate the 
     <lb/>
     reports so that the people of Newfoundland will 
     <lb/>
     know what is going on. There is one other thing. 
     <lb/>
     An old friend of mine in Elliston, Simeon Tucker, 
     <lb/>
     a fisherman since he was born almost, was in 
     <lb/>
     town the other day, and he said, "Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     what we can't understand in Elliston is this: the 
     <lb/>
     way you fellows there in the Convention cross- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     hackle<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> each other." That's an outport expres<lb break="no"/>sion, but they forget two things, first that the 
     <lb/>
     Governor, the day he opened this Convention, 
     <lb/>
     prophesied for us as an old-timer himself in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, he said this, "Now, 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, you will do your work and make your 
     <lb/>
     studies, and your feelings will run high some<lb break="no"/>times, and when men's feelings run deep their 
     <lb/>
     language will sometimes become a bit heated, 
     <lb/>
     and they will be a bit excited". Save me from the 
     <lb/>
     cold-blooded brute whose feelings can't get 
     <lb/>
     worked up, and a man who can't express himself, 
     <lb/>
     or does not express himself with heat and en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm. I would not trust him. Give me a man 
     <lb/>
     like Major Cashin or Mr. Higgins, or Mr. Bailey 
     <lb/>
     or myself, a man that feels a thing in his heart and 
     <lb/>
     gets up and says it. But now the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country are not used to that. What do they think 
     <lb/>
     the House of Assembly was â€” a Sunday school, 
     <lb/>
     where everybody got up and bowed and scraped 
     <lb/>
     and never lost their tempers? Oh no! Is the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons a Sunday school? Oh no! A man 
     <lb/>
     whose name commands respect in this world, the 
     <lb/>
     Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, I myself saw 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Churchill in the House of Commons take up 
     <lb/>
     a book in a row that was going on, take up a book 
     <lb/>
     and fling it across the floor at another man. He 
     <lb/>
     was good and excited.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the first time in their lives, our people have 
     <lb/>
     heard the proceedings of the House broadcast. If 
     <lb/>
     our people could compare our proceedings with 
     <lb/>
     those in the houses of parliament in other 
     <lb/>
     countries, they would say how decent and simple 
     <lb/>
     our debates are. We are a crowd of ordinary 
     <lb/>
     people trying to find out what we can. "Why is it 
     <lb/>
     taking so long?" some say. The Amulree Royal 
     <lb/>
     Commission came'out here and it took them six 
     <lb/>
     months, and they had all kinds of help and ex<lb break="no"/>perts. Their job was not one hundredth as big as

     this Convention's. It took six months to produce 
     <lb/>
     a report not as big as one of our nine reports.... 
     <lb/>
     What is it we are doing? We are doing the biggest 
     <lb/>
     job so far as digging into, finding out and passing 
     <lb/>
     on, ever done in this country. People who ask that 
     <lb/>
     question have not the brains to get out of their 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> When this Convention opened 
     <lb/>
     on September 11 the microphones were here, and 
     <lb/>
     I for one would not like to debar any person from 
     <lb/>
     hearing what was going on in this chamber. If 
     <lb/>
     there is anybody who does not wish to listen to 
     <lb/>
     the broadcasts, all they have to do is switch their 
     <lb/>
     radio over and listen to another programme. 
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I was one of the delegates who said 
     <lb/>I would like to see the microphones thrown out 
     <lb/>of the room.... At the time I made the statement 
     <lb/>in this House, I think we were all kind of upset 
     <lb/>with long-winded speeches and I blamed it on the 
     <lb/>microphones. I would not want the people of this 
     <lb/>country to think I would be a party to depriving 
     <lb/>them of information regarding this Convention. I 
     <lb/>am just as fully for the obtaining of public infor<lb break="no"/>mation for the people of the outports as any other 
     <lb/>delegate in this Convention. One thing, I would 
     <lb/>like to see addresses confined to 15 minutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Butt</persName> I think the people of this country are 
     <lb/>just as much a part of this Convention as the 
     <lb/>actual members sitting here and they are entitled 
     <lb/>to every bit of information they possibly can get. 
     <lb/>The radio was made for this country, as isolated 
     <lb/>as we are.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I had a feeling from the letter that there was 
     <lb/>
     an implication that we ought to soft-pedal our 
     <lb/>
     language. I do not know if that was intended. I 
     <lb/>
     agree with Mr. Smallwood, who already has said 
     <lb/>
     it is up to each individual member, in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with his ability, to say anything he believes and 
     <lb/>
     it is up to each individual to take the risk after<lb break="no"/>wards, if it be treated as not proper. I do feel that 
     <lb/>
     we ought to get a little harder, and consequently 
  

            <cb/>
     

     to speak of the things on our minds regardless of 
     <lb/>
     who likes it or who does not like it. If we get into 
     <lb/>
     a jam, let us take the rap. The sooner the people 
     <lb/>
     get that attitude, the better for the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> I want to go on record as agree<lb break="no"/>ing heartily with Mr, Butt. When I made my 
     <lb/>
     initial speech in support of Mr. Job's motion, I 
     <lb/>
     felt we should speak our minds with due regard 
     <lb/>
     for the rules of procedure and respect for the 
     <lb/>
     Chair, and we should not be awed in any way by 
     <lb/>
     anyone in the House or outside. In broadcasting 
     <lb/>
     at Christmas I said I had no intention of making 
     <lb/>
     an apology for anything said here. We could not 
     <lb/>
     be expected to turn into Roosevelts or Churchills 
     <lb/>
     overnight. Fourteen years we have been without 
     <lb/>
     taking part in politics and it takes time to become 
     <lb/>
     reueducated. I would like to pay tribute to the 
     <lb/>
     various speakers. As for the microphones, I for 
     <lb/>
     one would like to see them stay, particularly as it 
     <lb/>
     would be a wrong time, now as we will soon be 
     <lb/>
     coming to the forms of government, to have them 
     <lb/>
     removed.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I wish to clear up a misunderstand<lb break="no"/>ing that perhaps I wanted to have the 
     <lb/>
     microphones removed. I asked the Convention to 
     <lb/>
     think of two things: one was the removal of the 
     <lb/>
     microphones; the other was just what it would 
     <lb/>
     mean. We may this afternoon be required to 
     <lb/>
     discuss a paragraph of the Mining Report already 
     <lb/>
     read which may be embarrassing to us, to others 
     <lb/>
     or to the country. If we are to do a thorough job 
     <lb/>
     we have to speak fairly and frankly.... There are 
     <lb/>
     things crippling Newfoundland's economic posi<lb break="no"/>tion. If we are going to get up and make pretty 
     <lb/>
     speeches we are not going to get at it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> I wish to support Mr. Higgins'

     respect to the 15 cents tax on horsepower to be

     developed at Grand Falls. We cannot give all the

     We do not know the meaning of "installed horse<lb break="no"/>power." We are going to try and find out from the

     hydroelectric engineer. It may be the term "in<lb break="no"/>stalled" would mean "capable of producing."

     dealing with water-power, and the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     taking away rights from these people who have 
     <lb/>
     not complied with the requirements of the act.... 
     <lb/>
     With respect to the taking of property from 
     <lb/>
     people who have not complied with the necessary 
     <lb/>
     requirements under which they got them, and 
     <lb/>
     reference to which was made in the portion on the 
     <lb/>
     table on water-power, the position is this. Some 
     <lb/>
     years ago there were timber leases on which the 
     <lb/>
     people who had rights had to erect mills. They 
     <lb/>
     did not erect mills, and the government took 
     <lb/>
     action for cancellation of licenses. But the 
     <lb/>
     government had accepted rentals. Upon action 
     <lb/>
     being taken it was ultimately decided by the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council on appeal in the case of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Government vs. Jardine ... that the 
     <lb/>
     condition had been broken, but if after the breach 
     <lb/>
     the government had accepted the rent, then the 
     <lb/>
     government had waived its right to cancel the 
     <lb/>
     leases, and the licenses must continue on that 
     <lb/>
     understanding as long as the rents were paid and 
     <lb/>
     in good standing.<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In respect to expropriation of property, I am 
     <lb/>
     answering from the judgement in Dillon and 
     <lb/>
     others vs. the St. John's Housing Corporation.<ref target="#fn_05">[2]</ref>

     That judgement traces the history and powers of

     Commission of Government; it is excellent reading.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The judgement is very long, gentlemen, but 
     <lb/>
     you understand the situation At that time it was 
     <lb/>
     being argued by counsel for the plaintiffs that the 
     <lb/>
     Housing Corporation had no right to expropriate 
     <lb/>
     the land where the Housing Corporation develop<lb break="no"/>ment is now situated without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     British Parliament through one of the Secretaries 
     <lb/>
     of State, as the property being expropriated was 
     <lb/>
     not the property of British subjects residing in the 
     <lb/>
     colony. I trust, Mr. Harrington, that makes the 
     <lb/>
     point clear?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That is my impression. I will let 
     <lb/>
     you know the proper answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sitting beside you is the Chair<lb break="no"/>man of the National Convention, who was once 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General of Newfoundland, and as such 
     <lb/>
     once instrumental in serving quite a number of 
     <lb/>
     writs on the owners of timber lands, who had 
     <lb/>
     been granted those timber lands on condition that 
     <lb/>
     they would develop them. They had not 
     <lb/>
     developed them, I believe, and they had not met 
     <lb/>
     the conditions, and he issued writs running up to 
     <lb/>
     a value of millions of dollars, one of the biggest 
     <lb/>
     actions ever taken in the history of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I was wondering if we could provoke 
     <lb/>
     him â€” it was a case where a lot of natural 
     <lb/>
     resources had been granted to certain individuals 
     <lb/>
     on certain conditions. They did not develop them, 
     <lb/>
     and he decided to get them back for the Crown. 
     <lb/>
     The government backed him and their licenses 
     <lb/>
     were cancelled.<ref target="#fn_06">[3]</ref> It may not be quite the same 
     <lb/>
     kind of case, but if it were, there is a case where 
     <lb/>
     the government could get them back, and here's 
     <lb/>
     another case where we could not get them back. 
 </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I can only speak from memory 
     <lb/>and my recollection is that the owner of the 
     <lb/>property was a limited company which was 
     <lb/>domiciled in Newfoundland. I believe it was the 
     <lb/>Reid Newfoundland Company, so that any Let<lb break="no"/>ters Patent or Instructions to the Governor would 
     <lb/>have no application. I have also to add that while 
     <lb/>those writs were in fact issued the leases were not 
     <lb/>cancelled. That was prior to the case which went 
     <lb/>to the Privy Council. Beyond that I cannot go, 
     <lb/>because I would be talking politics, and I cannot 
     <lb/>talk politics in this Chair.

     power, would Mr. Higgins be able to tell us about 
     <lb/>
     the scope and cost of the survey which the 
     <lb/>
     government intends to make here, having this 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I am afraid the Mining Committee 
     <lb/>knows very little as to the scope of his work. I 
     <lb/>assume he is not far enough advanced to tell us 
     <lb/>what he proposes to do, but from what little 
     <lb/>information we have, he is going to assess the 
     <lb/>horsepower of each of the rivers in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, whether they are granted or ungranted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Do you know the cost? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> No. He is on a regular salary, and 
     <lb/>I presume whatever help he is going to require, 
     <lb/>plus his salary, will be the cost. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I think it is a very pertinent

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I agree with you, and as you know 
     <lb/>from our report, we comment that we approve of 
     <lb/>such an appointment, and we think it should have 
     <lb/>been made many years ago. Unfortunately, prac<lb break="no"/>tically all the water-power in the country has been 
     <lb/>given away, and in a good many cases for that

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Do I understand that the counsel for

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Yes, they were suing the Housing

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> On the grounds that the plain<lb break="no"/>tiff was local and not foreign?

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That does not come into it. The

            </p>
            <p>There is one section of the Mining Report that 
     <lb/>we started the other day, with respect to the 
     <lb/>Committee's findings on the question of the 
     <lb/>change in the 1938 act and the 1944 act.<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> The 
     <lb/>explanation that was given us for the change in 
  

            <cb/>
        

     the 10 cents per ton of iron ore to the present 
     <lb/>
     arrangement under the 1944 act of 5% of the net 
     <lb/>
     proceeds. Now you will note the comment of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee on page 5 with respect to that ex<lb break="no"/>planation, and so that there will be no doubt I 
     <lb/>
     would like to read that. "Iron ore is the cheapest 
     <lb/>
     metal commodity in the world ore deposits on 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec side of the border." The Committee's 
     <lb/>
     comment on that explanation was this: "Your 
     <lb/>
     Committee does not find itself in a position to 
     <lb/>
     accept this explanation, as we are of the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that even though the company operating the iron 
     <lb/>
     ore deposits may not be actually showing a sub<lb break="no"/>stantial profit, the parent company, that is, the 
     <lb/>
     steel manufacturing company, is actually making 
     <lb/>
     real profit. As far as we can gather, the companies 
     <lb/>
     operating the deposits are merely holding com<lb break="no"/>panies of some large steel manufacturing cor<lb break="no"/>porations."<ref target="#fn_08">[2]</ref> With respect to that comment of the 
     <lb/>
     Mining Committee, I have to inform you that the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Committee are not in full agree<lb break="no"/>ment, consequently it was decided that they 
     <lb/>
     should bring up the matter and, having heard all 
     <lb/>
     the comments and the reasons, you could either 
     <lb/>
     order that section deleted or otherwise. However, 
     <lb/>
     we are not able to go into the full argument on 
     <lb/>
     that right now. When this section was put in we 
     <lb/>
     did not have the Quebec act, which is before you 
     <lb/>
     now. This morning, we had a meeting with the 
     <lb/>
     solicitor of the company, Mr. Eric Cook, K.C., 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Claude Howse and Mr. George Allen. I want 
     <lb/>
     to have the minutes of that meeting before I 
     <lb/>
     debate this particular aspect. I would suggest that 
     <lb/>
     we let it stand at that point till I get the minutes, 
     <lb/>
     and in the meantime the Secretary will continue

     I would prefer that if there are any questions

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before development of the mine is

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I notice it says on page 8:

     "Owing to the short working season, it will take 
     <lb/>
     not less than three years to detemtine the iron ore

     can be made, it is impossible to state when

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> You must remember the date of

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I understand it was sometime ago,

     MacKay's very excellent book<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> on Newfound<lb break="no"/>land he has this to say: "As soon as the new 
     <lb/>
     discovery is developed it might have important 
     <lb/>
     effects for Newfoundland On the one hand it 
     <lb/>
     might provide an important outlet for employ<lb break="no"/>ment on the other hand it may mean reduced

     markets for Wabana." On page 11 your report

     says that it is your opinion that it won't.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We got that opinion from Mr.

     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I wonder if the chairman of the Min<lb break="no"/>ing Committee could enlighten me on the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of this on page 12'? "Negotiations over the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Labrador and Quebec have begun between the

     Canadian and Newfoundland governments and it 
     <lb/>
     is possible that the actual delimiting of the bound<lb break="no"/>ary on the ground may begin in 1947." What is 
     <lb/>
     the meaning of that word "delimiting"? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The boundary has been generally

     <lb/>
     boundary runs through this big ore deposit, so 
     <lb/>
     that we have to have it accurately determined, and 
     <lb/>
     this will be done this year. "Delimiting" means 
     <lb/>
     marking out on the ground the actual boundary.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That would be the height of

     build the railway, or operate it, or both?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It will be a separate company as far 
     <lb/>
     as the legal entity is concerned, but obviously it 
     <lb/>
     will be only for sewing these two companies. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How will that company be af<lb break="no"/>fected insofar as it operates in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Labrador? How would it be affected by the 1944 
     <lb/>act? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is not in any way affected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What rights have they? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> They have no rights under the 
     <lb/>
     1938 or 1944 act to export power for this railway. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But have they got permission 
     <lb/>to develop it? Can they use that water-power, 
     <lb/>without any more legislation, on the railway 
     <lb/>within Newfoundland Labrador? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I believe that for the railway in 
     <lb/>
     Labrador they would have the power to use it, 
     <lb/>
     provided they develop the mine sufficiently to 
     <lb/>
     warrant it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They can only develop the 
     <lb/>
     water-power if they start mining. But if they 
     <lb/>
     develop the mine they can use the water-power 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the railway in Newfoundland- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Labrador, but to use it on the rest of the railway 
     <lb/>
     they have to get a special act? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Suppose a separate company is 
     <lb/>
     formed, a railway company, is it true that it will 
     <lb/>
     be owned by those two mining companies? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I should imagine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But although it is owned by 
     <lb/>
     them, it is a separate company.... I was thinking 
     <lb/>
     of taxation. Often the franchise to run a railway 
     <lb/>
     is worth something to the government that carries 
     <lb/>
     the franchise. Would there be any possibility of 
     <lb/>
     getting out of that railway company taxes that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot get out of the 1938 act and the 1944 act in 
     <lb/>
     regard to mining? Let us suppose, for the sake of 
     <lb/>
     argument, that the government has made a 
     <lb/>
     serious mistake and that where they mighthave 
     <lb/>
     got something out of the 1938 act, under the 1944 
     <lb/>
     act they will get nothing. Now along they come 
     <lb/>
     looking for a franchise to run a railway; would 
     <lb/>
     the government be in a position to re-open the 
     <lb/>
     whole matter of taxation â€” use the application 
     <lb/>
     for the railway to remedy any mistake they made 
     <lb/>
     in abolishing that 10 cents per ton royalty? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Not in my opinion. Remember we 
     <lb/>
     have no knowledge except insofar as Mr. Cook 
     <lb/>
     had told us. I assume that the application is with 


            <cb/>
        

     respect to the export of power to be used on the 
     <lb/>
     balance of the railway not in Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Have they the right to use a 
     <lb/>
     railway in Labrador? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> In my opinion they have the right 
     <lb/>
     to use it in Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They can start a railway now 
     <lb/>
     and no one can stop them, is that the position? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's the particular part that has 
     <lb/>met with a lot of non-agreement among the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Committee. That's part of it. My 
     <lb/>recollection is that they can now run the railway 
     <lb/>on the power of Grand Falls, the railway that's in 
     <lb/>Labrador, but not in Quebec, provided they 
     <lb/>develop the mine enough to haul the ore over the 
     <lb/>railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> But you must first establish the 
     <lb/>
     fact that they have the power to run a railway 
     <lb/>
     there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I am glad Mr. Smallwood raised 
     <lb/>
     that question, because i was going to raise it too, 
     <lb/>
     with a definite object in mind. If this railway is 
     <lb/>
     going to be a transportation company owned by 
     <lb/>
     the mining company and hauling their ore out, the 
     <lb/>
     haulage charges could be very great indeed with 
     <lb/>
     a consequent loss, or very little profit out of the 
     <lb/>
     mining end of it, and our 5% on that might be very 
     <lb/>
     little. I can appreciate that any company going 
     <lb/>
     into an investment or gamble such as this must be 
     <lb/>
     assured of a certain profit but it strikes me that 
     <lb/>
     this quotation referring to Lake Superior was six 
     <lb/>
     cents, which was the low. I notice they don't give 
     <lb/>
     what the high would be. The way it seems it might 
     <lb/>
     be a bit of a red herring drawn across the deal. 
     <lb/>
     The inference that I get from the report is that the 
     <lb/>
     present company could not possibly operate 
     <lb/>
     under the agreement, and they would have to 
     <lb/>
     withdraw if a different form of royalty could not 
     <lb/>
     be worked out. The inference is that they would 
     <lb/>
     not be making the 10 cents profit. Let us assume 
     <lb/>
     that they were going to make 6 cents on it. Further 
     <lb/>
     on, in the letter Mr. Timmins states that there 
     <lb/>
     should be a known quantity of at least 300 million 
     <lb/>
     tons, of which they will take out a minimum of 5 
     <lb/>
     million tons a year. If they take out 30 million 
     <lb/>
     tons they will make a profit of $l8 million over 
     <lb/>
     a period of six years. That, on the original invest<lb break="no"/>ment, would bring it about 1Â¹/â‚‚% profit per year 
     <lb/>
     as a return on their investment. I can't believe 
     <lb/>
     they are going into it with that profit. They have 
     <lb/>
     got to see a return on their investment, and I can't 


            <pb n="507" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-04-18_Page_0507.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">April 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">507</fw>
         

     be persuaded that it will be 1 1/2%. If they made 
     <lb/>
     that $18 million profit based on 6 cents per ton 
     <lb/>
     profit, our portion that would accrue to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland treasury on 5% of the net profit, would 
     <lb/>
     be $900,000 over six years, whereas we would 
     <lb/>
     have got $30 million with 10 cents per ton.... I 
     <lb/>
     don't know what advice the government had at 
     <lb/>
     that time, or whether they could not see far 
     <lb/>
     enough. They made an error of judgement, I 
     <lb/>
     would say, in changing over from that l0 cents 
     <lb/>
     per ton to the 5% basis... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The point is that this transportation company 
     <lb/>
     can be put in a position whereby they can haul the 
     <lb/>
     profits out, and leave the producing company 
     <lb/>
     showing a very small balance and this country 
     <lb/>
     won't benefit from it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> In answering that I would refer you 
     <lb/>
     to the 1938 act, paragraph 39, which you have 
     <lb/>
     before you. I will read it for your benefit... That 
     <lb/>
     answers your question. They have the right to 
     <lb/>
     apply, but subject to such conditions and terms as 
     <lb/>
     to rental, etc., as the government may fix. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's in 1938? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That section of the 1938 act is still 
     <lb/>
     in force. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Clause 7 of the 1944 act. Does 
     <lb/>
     that seem to bear on it? Section I. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> ....That's only over private proper<lb break="no"/>ties, it has nothing to do with obtaining the rights. 
     <lb/>
     That would be where there would be properties 
     <lb/>
     and land over which they put the railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How do we stand then? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> They have the tight to apply to the 
     <lb/>
     government for the right-of-way for a railway, 
     <lb/>
     and the government will grant it on such terms 
     <lb/>
     and conditions as may seem reasonable and equi<lb break="no"/>table. Their application has been made, and I 
     <lb/>
     presume the government is forging what will be 
     <lb/>
     reasonable and equitable terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In the 1944 act, page 5, it 
     <lb/>
     speaks of things on which they are exempt from 
     <lb/>
     customs duty, and the things on which they have 
     <lb/>
     to pay it. Have they got to pay duty on the 
     <lb/>
     railway? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That would be one of its opera<lb break="no"/>tions. In the 1938 act, page 19: "The operations 
     <lb/>
     of the Company referred to shall include only the 
     <lb/>
     following ... transportation of such minerals." 
     <lb/>
     That would be one of the operations of the com<lb break="no"/>pany, and would come under a deduction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> "They shall be exempt for a 
 

            <cb/>
          

     period of 20 years ... in Labrador." All duty free. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It includes railway too if you follow 
     <lb/>on, Mr. Smallwood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> On replacements they can only get 
     <lb/>
     up to 20% of the value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I am going to ask the chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee if he could tell me whether the royalty 
     <lb/>
     on Bell Island ore of 10 cents has been paid all 
     <lb/>
     along and is being paid? My reason for asking is 
     <lb/>
     that it would seem that if Bell Island with its ore, 
     <lb/>
     which is 52%, can stand a royalty, surely this 
     <lb/>
     other ore, which is 62%, can stand it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> There is a limit in Bell Island as to 
     <lb/>
     how much royalty they must pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That's an interesting point, but no 
     <lb/>
     doubt a better basis from a Newfoundland point 
     <lb/>
     of view, would be a definite royalty per ton rather 
     <lb/>
     than a very indefinite 5% on the profit It seems 
     <lb/>
     a pity we don't know where we are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Obviously the 1944 act from the 
     <lb/>
     point of view of the company is very much better 
     <lb/>
     than the 1938 act. They had the best advice they 
     <lb/>
     could get both times. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> On the face of it it seems not very 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory. We don't know what Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     is going to make out of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> That's the point the Mining Com<lb break="no"/>mittee did not agree about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Can you tell us where the disagreement 
     <lb/>
     comes in? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> They are not satisfied that New<lb break="no"/>foundland is getting a good deal on it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> That was the point I was going to 
     <lb/>
     raise, Mr. Chairman. I wonder could you tell us, 
     <lb/>
     do you believe Newfoundland has proper protec<lb break="no"/>tion in the agreement with the Labrador Mining 
     <lb/>
     Company? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I would much prefer to wait until I 
     <lb/>
     can give you all the facts. I am afraid I will not 
     <lb/>
     be able to answer the question. We will either 
     <lb/>
     have to have another session, or we will put it in 
     <lb/>
     a supplementary report. I would not like to give 
     <lb/>
     you my own opinion.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> I did not think you would. I have 
     <lb/>
     been listening to the debate this last several days, 
     <lb/>
     and the impression I have is that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has not got proper protection in the agreement. 
     <lb/>
     The Grand Falls of Labrador is situated in the 
     <lb/>
     heart of unexplored territory believed to contain 
     <lb/>
     precious mineral deposits as well as timber areas, 
     <lb/>
     and is therefore the key to future development.

     To tie up that great potential asset at this time for 
     <lb/>
     a fee of 15 cent per kilowatt hour cannot be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as in the best interests of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, more especially when that great water<lb break="no"/>power may be used to develop the Quebec side 
     <lb/>

     that the Commission of Government did not want 
     <lb/>
     to commit themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I must disagree with you there. 
     <lb/>
     Another member of the Convention made that 
     <lb/>
     statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> He replied. I realised some of the 
     <lb/>
     solicitors putting through the deals were New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders and I was a bit sore; but after hear<lb break="no"/>ing that, we will have to pat him on the back, 
     <lb/>
     because if the Commission did not know what to 
     <lb/>
     charge, the solicitors would have said 5 cents a 
     <lb/>
     horsepower. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> We have nothing to show that the 
   

            <cb/>
            

     Commission did not know what price to fix. 
  
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I did not intend to have anything to 
     <lb/>say on this. I appreciate the point brought out by 
     <lb/>Mr. Hickman, Mr. Job and Mr. Smallwood, that 
     <lb/>the Mining Committee are not all as one on 
     <lb/>certain particular sections. Some of us realise the 
     <lb/>act is not so hot as far as Newfoundland is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. We may be wrong. We are trying to find 
     <lb/>out. We ought to have no further debate until the 
     <lb/>chairman of the Mining Committee is prepared 
     <lb/>to bring in a supplementary report. I appreciate 
     <lb/>the point brought out by Mr. Hickman: if we have 
     <lb/>made a bad deal so far, and any water-power they 
     <lb/>want is to be exported, and we have to issue a 
     <lb/>permit for the railway, there may be something 
     <lb/>to save out of the wreck. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> I agree with Mr. Hollett's remarks. 
     <lb/>
     Maybe we can do justice to this after we get the 
     <lb/>
     minutes of the meeting. It is well for every man 
     <lb/>
     in this house to be thoroughly acquainted with it 
     <lb/>
     all. This 10 cents per ton is objected to, and the 
     <lb/>
     company hopes to pay Newfoundland substan<lb break="no"/>tially well! I will give you a comparison: up to 
     <lb/>
     recently the Newfoundland fishermen were 
     <lb/>
     charged an export tax of $10 per ton on codfish. 
     <lb/>
     How does it compare with 10 cents on iron ore?
     <lb/>

     Report of the Mining Committee:Â¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I propose at this time to give you a 
     <lb/>
     picture of the territory that these particular actsÂ² 
     <lb/>
     refer to, and with which the second part of our 
     <lb/>
     report deals. As you realise, in the introduction to 
     <lb/>
     the railway bill by Mr. Hugessen of Quebec,Â³ he 
     <lb/>
     gave a picture of that area. With your permission 
     <lb/>
     I was going to ask our own senator from Labrador 
     <lb/>
     who was in that area, who was over Grand Falls 
     <lb/>
     and into the mines, if he would give us an account 
     <lb/>
     of the area as he knows it, and any other com- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     merits he would care to give us, so we would be 
     <lb/>
     in a better position to understand it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. Barry ....There are one or two comments I 
     <lb/>
     would like to make before giving that word pic<lb break="no"/>ture. With the rest of the Committee, I took a 
     <lb/>
     serious view of the change that was made from 
     <lb/>
     10 cents per ton royalty to 5% of the net income. 
     <lb/>
     We thought with 10 cents royalty we would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly get a considerable amount. We found they 
     <lb/>
     changed to 5% of net profits, and there are so 
     <lb/>
     many suspicions of how big companies have a 
     <lb/>
     way of manipulating their profits to avoid taxes. 
     <lb/>
     We thought the 5% of the net profits they would 
     <lb/>
     declare would not give us much revenue.
