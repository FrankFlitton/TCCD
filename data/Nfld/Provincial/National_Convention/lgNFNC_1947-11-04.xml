     <lb/>
     you have been constituted as a National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion. It is designed to co-ordinate or correlate all 
     <lb/>
     the reports heretofore tabled respecting the 
     <lb/>
     economic potentialities of the several industries 
     <lb/>
     which the reports are designed to relate. In conse<lb break="no"/>quence, I feel duty bound at this stage to inform 
     <lb/>
     you that, with one exception, forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, any member talking on any point arising 
     <lb/>
     out of any report heretofore tabled, shall be ruled

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I want to say at 
     <lb/>
     the outset everything that I can say complimen<lb break="no"/>tary about this report. I happen to be one who has 
     <lb/>
     a great respect for hard work. Major Cashin, who 
     <lb/>
     wrote this report, is a hard worker, and I take my 
     <lb/>
     hat off to a hard worker any time. Secondly the 
     <lb/>
     report shows this, if nothing else did, that he is a 
     <lb/>
     man of great optimism, and I take my hat off to 
     <lb/>
     him for his great optimism also.... I am afraid that 
     <lb/>
     what I have got to say from this point on is not 
     <lb/>
     very complimentary. But Major Cashin has been 
     <lb/>
     a Minister of Finance. He has introduced three 
     <lb/>
     budgets before, and it won't be a new experience

     to him to find his report criticised.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I call this document a budget, 
     <lb/>
     because that is exactly what it is. It sets out what, 
     <lb/>
     in the opinion of the Committee, will be the 
     <lb/>
     necessary expenditures of the government, and 
     <lb/>
     what, in their opinion, will be the revenues that 
     <lb/>
     the government will get to meet those expendi<lb break="no"/>tures. Now there's this to be said about budgets 
     <lb/>
     in this country: in the period from 1920 to 1932, 
     <lb/>
     we had a number of very notable New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who occupied the position of 
     <lb/>
     finance minister. We had Mr. H. J, Brownrigg, 
     <lb/>
     Sir Richard Squires, Mr. W.H. Cave, Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Crosbie, the Hon. P.J. Cashin, and the Hon. R.C. 
     <lb/>
     Alderdice, and each of them introduced his 
     <lb/>
     budget. Now the difference between their 
     <lb/>
     budgets and this one that the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     has introduced is that those budgets only looked 
     <lb/>
     ahead for one year whereas this budget goes a 
     <lb/>
     lot further than that, because it attempts to 
     <lb/>
     forecast <hi rendition="simple:italic">three</hi> year's expenditure and <hi rendition="simple:italic">three</hi> years' 
     <lb/>
     revenue. If, therefore, it was a hazardous and 
     <lb/>
     dangerous thing for the finance ministers to 
     <lb/>
     forecast for a year, how much more hazardous 
     <lb/>
     and dangerous is it to forecast for <hi rendition="simple:italic">three</hi> years? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us look at just how dangerous it is to 
     <lb/>
     forecast even forcne year. In 1920-21 the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     H. J. Brownrigg made his budget, and he forecast 
     <lb/>
     ...a surplus of $200,000.... But what happened?... 
     <lb/>
     When the year was over he had a deficit of $2.5 
     <lb/>
     million. Well, in the next year Mr. Brownrigg 
     <lb/>
     was not well, so the Prime Minister had to act as 
     <lb/>
     finance minister โ Sir Richard Squires โ and 
     <lb/>
     he brought in his estimate for the next year.... The 
     <lb/>
     forecast he made for 1921-22 was a surplus of 
     <lb/>
     $96,000, but when that year ended they found 
     <lb/>
     that they had a deficit of $867,000.... Well then, 
     <lb/>
     in the next year Sir Richard Squires was finance 
     <lb/>
     minister again. On that occasion Mr. Brownrigg 
     <lb/>
     was in New York, so the Prime Minister brought 
     <lb/>
     down the budget, and what he forecast was a 
     <lb/>
     surplus of $108,000, but when the year was over 
     <lb/>
     he had a deficit of $675,000. In the next year the 
     <lb/>
     finance minister was the Hon. W. H. Cave. He 
     <lb/>
     said that [there would be] ... a surplus of $43,000. 
     <lb/>
     When the year was over they had a deficit of 
     <lb/>
     $1,620,000, so his guess was not very good. Then 
     <lb/>
     in 1924-25 the late Sir John Crosbie became 
     <lb/>
     finance minister, in my opinion one of the best 
     <lb/>
     finance ministers we ever had. Sir John Crosbie 
     <lb/>
     estimated a surplus of $105,000. When the year 
 

            <cb/>
          

     was over it showed a surplus of $347,000.... Then 
     <lb/>
     in 1925-26, Sir John forecast a surplus of 
     <lb/>
     $207,000, and he had a deficit, I am afraid, of 
     <lb/>
     $112,000.... For the year 1926-27 he brought in 
     <lb/>
     an estimate of a surplus of $300,000, and they had 
     <lb/>
     a deficit of $1.6 million instead. Then 1927-28 
     <lb/>
     rolls around, and Sir John made another estimate, 
     <lb/>
     a very large surplus of $845,000, and when the 
     <lb/>
     year was over there was a deficit of $ 1.25 million. 
     <lb/>
     The last year he brought in his budget, 1928-29, 
     <lb/>
     he estimated for a deficit of $268,000. When the 
     <lb/>
     year was over he had the deficit all right, and it 
     <lb/>
     was $1.1 million. The next year was 1929-30, and 
     <lb/>
     the present chairman of the Finance Committee, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. P.J. Cashin, was the minister. I was in 
     <lb/>
     the gallery there and I heard him deliver his 
     <lb/>
     budget speech, and he did it with real gusto and 
     <lb/>
     it was a pleasure to hear him deliver that 
     <lb/>
     speech.... He estimated a deficit of $187,000. He 
     <lb/>
     was the second finance minister to estimate a 
     <lb/>
     deficit, but he was the first finance minister in the 
     <lb/>
     history of Newfoundland who estimated a deficit 
     <lb/>
     and turned up with a surplus of $144,000. That 
     <lb/>
     was his first budget. His next budget was 1930- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     31; he forecast a deficit of $27,000.... When the 
     <lb/>
     year was over he had a deficit of $3,242,000.

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, did it in style no doubt. 
     <lb/>
     Well then, in 1931-32 he estimated a deficit of 
     <lb/>
     $1,456,000, and I suppose he figured, "That will 
     <lb/>
     certainly cover any deficit that we can possibly 
     <lb/>
     have", but when the year was over their deficit 
     <lb/>
     was $4 million. I can't help remembering that in 
     <lb/>
     his first budget Major Cashin, stated to the House 
     <lb/>
     and to this country: "The outlook for the future I 
     <lb/>
     regard as decidedly encouraging", and he lived 
     <lb/>
     to see the greatest deficits that Newfoundland had 
     <lb/>
     ever had in its whole history.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With that dismal record before us of forecast<lb break="no"/>ing the revenues and expenditure for one year at 
     <lb/>
     a time, we should be very careful about accept<lb break="no"/>ing, without close scrutiny, any estimate for a 
     <lb/>
     year, and still more for three years at one time. I 
     <lb/>
     would not have the house under any misap<lb break="no"/>prehension about this. Mr. Brownrigg, Sir 
     <lb/>
     Richard Squires, W. J. Cave, Sir John Crosbie, 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin and Mr. Alderdice were able men. 
     <lb/>
     It was not their fault that they could not estimate 
     <lb/>
     the revenue or the expenditure for a year... They 
     <lb/>
     exercised their very best judgement, but it was 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's fault, because the economy of

     Newfoundland has always been such, that it was 
     <lb/>
     next door to impossible to make a forecast ac<lb break="no"/>curately, realistically, conservatively, for even 
     <lb/>
     one year ahead. We should bear that point in mind 
     <lb/>
     when we consider this budget for three years to 
     <lb/>
     come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I touch on another point. On page 1 of 
     <lb/>
     the report, there is set forth a picture of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, a photograph of Newfoundland of the 
     <lb/>
     last 50 years, all drawn in one short paragraph. 
     <lb/>
     What does it show? It says ... that for the 50 years 
     <lb/>
     which came to an end last month, September 
     <lb/>
     1947, the government spent $500 million, and 
     <lb/>
     took in $496 million, so they had a shortage of $4 
     <lb/>
     million on current account. But this paragraph 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say: "If you deduct from the $500 
     <lb/>
     million that the government spent, $20 million 
     <lb/>
     that the present government spent on capital ac<lb break="no"/>count since 1935, that brings the total expenditure 
     <lb/>
     down to $480 million. Thus, with an expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of $480 million and a revenue of $496 million, 
     <lb/>
     the government showed a surplus of $15 million, 
     <lb/>
     or an average of $300,000 a year for the 50 
     <lb/>
     years." In other words, if this paragraph is cor<lb break="no"/>rect, what it means is this: that for the last 50 years 
     <lb/>
     the government has balanced its budget. More 
     <lb/>
     than that, it has had an average surplus of 
     <lb/>
     $300,000 a year, so it appears that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland came out of it with flying 
     <lb/>
     colours. Then those of us who remember the 
     <lb/>
     1920s, and more of us who remember the 1930s 
     <lb/>
     begin to prick up our ears. We begin to show 
     <lb/>
     some great interest. If the government balanced 
     <lb/>
     its budget and showed a surplus, and we remem<lb break="no"/>ber the unemployment of the 19205, and the 
     <lb/>
     parades of the unemployed, when we remember 
     <lb/>
     the rock sheds, and the "roads-de-luxe", and the 
     <lb/>
     pit-prop cutting schemes, and the riots, and the 
     <lb/>
     dole; when we remember 90,000 of our people 
     <lb/>
     only eight or nine years ago rotting with beri-beri 
     <lb/>
     and TB on the dole, when we remember our 
     <lb/>
     roads, wharves and bridges falling down because 
     <lb/>
     there was not a dollar to spend on them, when we 
     <lb/>
     remember the Gethsemane that our people went 
     <lb/>
     through from 1920 to 1940 roughly, and we are 
     <lb/>
     told that for these 20 years, and another 30 with 
     <lb/>
     them, the government not only balanced its 
     <lb/>
     budget but had a surplus as well, and the people 
     <lb/>
     at the same time rotting in poverty many of them, 
     <lb/>
     we begin to wonder โ does it matter very much 
     <lb/>
     to the people of Newfoundland, the fishermen, 
   

            <cb/>
        

     the miners, the loggers and the railroaders, the 
     <lb/>
     clerks and office workers, teachers, etc., does it 
     <lb/>
     matter much to them if they rot in poverty and the 
     <lb/>
     government balances its budget? ls balancing the 
     <lb/>
     government's budget so very much after all, if the 
     <lb/>
     people can rot in poverty while our budget is 
     <lb/>
     being balanced? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Of course the truth of the matter is that the 
     <lb/>
     govemment's budget was not balanced in those 
     <lb/>
     50 years. What happened was this: from 1920 to 
     <lb/>
     1934 the government never, never once took in 
     <lb/>
     enough money in taxes from the people to pay 
     <lb/>
     theirexpenditures. Never once in the years, What 
     <lb/>
     they did was this: the finance minister would 
     <lb/>
     bring down the loan bill, asking the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly to authorise the government to 
     <lb/>
     authorise him to go out and borrow money and 
     <lb/>
     in the bill the law required that there had to be 
     <lb/>
     stated the purpose for which the money was to be 
     <lb/>
     borrowed. That was one reason why they had to 
     <lb/>
    state some reasons. There was another reason. 
     <lb/>They could not go to the States or Canada or 
     <lb/>England and borrow $5-6 million and tell them 
     <lb/>frankly and honestly, "This is money that we 
     <lb/>can't get out of our people. We can't get enough 
     <lb/>taxes to meet our expenses, so we have to borrow 
     <lb/>so much to make it up." They could not tell them 
     <lb/>that, so they called it "capital account". Always 
     <lb/>it was for capital expenditure. To meet operating 
     <lb/>losses on the Railway, and give relief, to give 
     <lb/>dole to keep people alive, and to balance the 
     <lb/>budget year after year, for 14 years without a 
     <lb/>break.... $50-odd million gone out and borrowed 
     <lb/>to meet the expenditures of the government, the 
     <lb/>ordinary expenditures, or what they used to call 
     <lb/>in those days "current account expenditures". 
     <lb/>That was a word that covered a multitude of 
     <lb/>things that ought not to be called "capital expen<lb break="no"/>diture" at all. They should have been called by 
     <lb/>their proper name. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Well, the report goes on again, still on page 2, 
     <lb/>
     and here's the picture we get: it points out what 
     <lb/>
     our public debt is. It says this โ If we were to 
     <lb/>
     take out present public debt, and take off of it 
     <lb/>
     what we have saved up for sinking fund, and then 
     <lb/>
     take off of what's left what we have in accumu<lb break="no"/>lated surplus, take all that off our public debt and 
     <lb/>
     what we have left is a net debt of $35 million.... 
     <lb/>
     But, they say, that's not so bad, because look 
     <lb/>
     what we have got to go against it. We have got a 
     <lb/>
     Railway that's worth $72 million. Now where did 
   

            <pb n="644" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-04_Page_0644.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">644</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
         

     they get that figure of $72 million? I will tell you, 
     <lb/>
     in fact they say it here. What happened was this: 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation spent weeks before it went 
     <lb/>
     gathering information about Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     amongst that was gathered information about the 
     <lb/>
     Railway, which it got from the manager. One of 
     <lb/>
     the things we knew they would want to know in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa was, "What is your railway worth? What 
     <lb/>
     is the value of it?" So naturally we asked the 
     <lb/>
     manager to give us an inventory.... They gave us 
     <lb/>
     an estimate of $72 million... Remember we made 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland out while we were in Ottawa to 
     <lb/>
     be sitting on top of the world, so we gave them 
     <lb/>
     the estimate of $72 million that our Railway is 
     <lb/>
     worth, but let us not here fool ourselves. If a 
     <lb/>
     Railway has cost millions upon millions upon 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars, taken from the public in taxes 
     <lb/>
     by the government, brought into the public ex<lb break="no"/>chequer and handed over to the Railway to meet 
     <lb/>
     their operating losses, millions upon millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars to meet the operating losses year by year 
     <lb/>
     since we took over the Railway in 1923, and for 
     <lb/>
     two years before that, if we are paying their losses 
     <lb/>
     and they have come to many millions of dollars, 
     <lb/>
     let us not fool ourselves into thinking that our 
     <lb/>
     Railway is actually worth $72 million in cash. I 
     <lb/>
     am afraid you would have ajob to get anybody 
     <lb/>
     to pay that for the Railway, unless you would 
     <lb/>
     undertake to pay the operating loss. They might 
     <lb/>
     do it then for the sake of having the job of 
     <lb/>
     manager. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You say we have $20 million worth of high<lb break="no"/>roads. I happen to believe strongly in highroads, 
     <lb/>
     but when it takes a million a year to keep up those 
     <lb/>
     roads, just barely to keep them up, I am not 
     <lb/>
     willing to accept the figure of $20 million as an 
     <lb/>
     asset against an actual public debt. And then they 
     <lb/>
     put in another $10 million for public buildings 
     <lb/>
     and hospitals, and finally another $10 million for 
     <lb/>
     lighthouses and public wharves and breakwaters 
     <lb/>
     and our telegraph system, making a total of $1 10 
     <lb/>
     million of assets to go against our net liability of 
     <lb/>
     $35 million, showing that we have made a net 
     <lb/>
     gain for the last 50 years, it says, of $75 million, 
     <lb/>
     or, now I quote the exact words, "... an average 
     <lb/>
     annual surplus of$1.5 million" for the last 50 
     <lb/>
     years That is how they arrive at the figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Of course if we want to fool ourselves and fool 
     <lb/>
     others we will let those figures pass, and not 
     <lb/>
     throw any doubt upon them. If we have a Pollyan<lb break="no"/>na optimism, if our motive and our purpose is to 
   

            <cb/>
       

     fool the people of Newfoundland that everything 
     <lb/>
     is rosy, and the government has really balanced 
     <lb/>
     its budget for 50 years, they might answer it 
     <lb/>
     something like the man in gaol, who was visited 
     <lb/>
     by a well-meaning old codger who went in to 
     <lb/>
     cheer him up and said, "Stone walls do not a 
     <lb/>
     prison make, nor iron bars a cage"; and the old 
     <lb/>
     man said, "Well, if they don't, they have got me 
     <lb/>
    pretty well mesmerised." He thought really he 
     <lb/>was in gaol. And if you tell the people that for the 
     <lb/>last 50 years the government has balanced its 
     <lb/>budget, all the people are going to tell you to 
     <lb/>remember the dole years, to remember that only 
     <lb/>eight years ago Labrador fish was worth $3 a 
     <lb/>quintal, and that all our fish and fishery products, 
     <lb/>when we exported them to all the countries of the 
     <lb/>world, were only worth $8 million. Just barely 
     <lb/>eight years ago. Tell people who remember that, 
     <lb/>tell a man that's in Fair Island: 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I was saying, 
     <lb/>
     when the House rose for a short recess, that that 
     <lb/>
     fisherman in Fair Island, Bonavista Bay would 
     <lb/>
     not appreciate at all this rosy and optimistic pic<lb break="no"/>ture of Newfoundland. Nor would the fisherman 
     <lb/>
     in Plate Cove West who says in his letter to me, 
     <lb/>
     "The people here never saw worse times in the 
     <lb/>
     worst years of the depression than they are now. 
     <lb/>
     They are starving slow but sure." And so I could 
     <lb/>
     quote letters from many parts of Bonavista Bay 
     <lb/>
     and from many other bays and many other coasts. 
     <lb/>
     And if you were to tell the fishermen on the north 
     <lb/>
     side of Bonavista Bay, and more especially those 
     <lb/>
     skipper men, who are amongst the finest breed 
     <lb/>
     that this country ever produced, who are finding 
     <lb/>
     it necessary now to sell their schooners and gear 
     <lb/>
     to get enough money to live on after three years 
     <lb/>
     of failure of the Labrador fishery, if you were to 
     <lb/>
     tell them that they have nothing to worry about, 
     <lb/>
     that the last 50 years were good years, and the 
     <lb/>
     next 50 years will be good, they would only laugh 
     <lb/>
     in your face, they would not believe it any more 
     <lb/>
     than I believe it. If you were to tell the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     who came back from the water and from 
     <lb/>
     Labrador this year, only to find that their fish was 
     <lb/>
     not worth a single, solitary dollar in cash, that it 
     <lb/>
     was only a receipt which could not name a price 
     <lb/>
     in many cases, that Newfoundland was on a firm 
     <lb/>
     foundation, these men too would refuse to believe 
     <lb/>
     you, and with every good reason. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I want to pass on to page 6 of the report. 
     <lb/>
     It tells us that the country should have a mercan<lb break="no"/>tile marine. Now I am not going to argue whether 
     <lb/>
     we should or should not, whether we should have 
     <lb/>
     our own local bottoms to do our own foreign 
     <lb/>
     trade. That is a big subject. It has been debated a 
     <lb/>
     good many times, but I want this House to be on 
     <lb/>
     its guard against taking the ipsy-dipsy and unsup<lb break="no"/>ported and unproved word of the Economic Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on this question. I remember an article by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. H.R. Brookes of the firm of Job Bros, a man 
     <lb/>
     who has had a great deal of experience with 
     <lb/>
     shipping, I remember a conversation here be<lb break="no"/>tween Mr. Bailey and the Hon. R.B. Job on this 
     <lb/>
     very question. This is a very, very vexed ques<lb break="no"/>tion, not one on which we can speak glibly. And 
     <lb/>
     yet in comes the Finance Committee, bravely as 
     <lb/>
     though there were never any questions on it, as 
     <lb/>
     though there was only one side to it. It is obvious, 
     <lb/>
     according to them, that we should start a mercan<lb break="no"/>tile marine, and the government should defray, 
 

            <cb/>
           

     should set aside public money to finance a mer<lb break="no"/>cantile marine... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just one point if I may.... I think 
     <lb/>
     in fairness to the compilers of this report I should 
     <lb/>
     again remind you that opinion is merely a matter 
     <lb/>
     of judgement upon which men may reasonably 
     <lb/>
     differ, and I do not feel that in the expression of 
     <lb/>
     an opinion merely that the Committee, or the 
     <lb/>
     chairman of the Committee, should be placed in 
     <lb/>
     the position where they had to defend a mere 
     <lb/>
     question of opinion. If they were making it a 
     <lb/>
     statement of fact, yes. Then, of course, inde<lb break="no"/>pendent corroboration would be necessary to sus<lb break="no"/>tain a statement of fact as opposed to mere 
     <lb/>
     conjecture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I made it as a statement of fact. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Well in that case Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood, will you please... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, it is obviously a state<lb break="no"/>ment of opinion; if it were a statement of fact we 
     <lb/>
     would naturally call for evidence upon the state<lb break="no"/>ment so made; but as in fact it is a statement of 
     <lb/>
     opinion it is very much open to objection. Then 
     <lb/>
     any member of the House may state his opinion 
     <lb/>
     at variance with the Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Quite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If it had been proposed by the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee around the year 1940 or 1941 
     <lb/>
     that the government, out of the public revenues, 
     <lb/>
     should devote certain money to purchase or sub<lb break="no"/>sidise a local merchant marine there would have 
     <lb/>
     been a lot to be said for it, because the shipping 
     <lb/>
     business was on the upward trend and a lot of 
     <lb/>
     money was made out of shipping during the war. 
     <lb/>
     But now the war is over. How much longer can 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee guarantee this country or 
     <lb/>
     the government that it would be a safe investment 
     <lb/>
     to put public money behind the acquisition of a 
     <lb/>
     merchant marine? We know the state of the 
     <lb/>
     world, and what a hazardous thing it would be to 
     <lb/>
     risk public money in the acquisition of merchant 
     <lb/>
     ships, given the lack of knowledge of what is 
     <lb/>
     going to happen in the world.

            </p>

            <p>
     Page 9 deals with Gander airport. I am not 
     <lb/>
     going to discuss Gander. I did that when we 
     <lb/>
     debated Gander, at the time that the Report on 
     <lb/>
     Transportation and Communications was 
     <lb/>
     debated. I think I may fairly say that I happened 
     <lb/>
     to be the one who drew the House's attention to 
     <lb/>
     the situation at Gander, and for that reason I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to go into the details today, but there 


            <pb n="646" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-04_Page_0646.jpg"/>

     are two statements to which I would direct your 
     <lb/>
     attention. "This matter", it says, the matter of 
     <lb/>
     Gander, "was also taken up with the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office by the British delegation on its recent visit 
     <lb/>
     to London. The result effected, as you are 
     <lb/>
     aware, savings to the treasury of the country of 
     <lb/>
     some $500,000." That, as I understand the situa<lb break="no"/>tion, is not at all in accordance with the facts, 
     <lb/>
     which are these: that before the London delega<lb break="no"/>tion went across the Atlantic at all the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government announced that a special 
     <lb/>
     commission was coming from the Ministry of 
     <lb/>
     Civil Aviation in London to inquire into Gander, 
     <lb/>
     and a statement would be made. The statement 
     <lb/>
     was made, namely, that the British government 
     <lb/>
     would absorb two-thirds of the operating loss on 
     <lb/>
     Gander, and the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     would absorb the other third. So it was not the 
     <lb/>
     result of any work or suggestion of the London 
     <lb/>
     delegation whatsoever in any shape or form that 
     <lb/>
     this arrangement was made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The second point is this: "For", it says, "if we 
     <lb/>
     were rid of this airport liability it would effect a 
     <lb/>
     further saving of not less than $750,000 in our 
     <lb/>
     annual expenditure." I don't follow that at all. 
     <lb/>
     The total operating loss at Gander is estimated to 
     <lb/>
     be $750,000, of which $250,000 is to be paid by 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government. Not three 
     <lb/>
     quarters, but one quarter of a million dollars, 
     <lb/>
     unless, in that sentence, the Committee wishes to 
     <lb/>
     convey the thought that the capital expenditures 
     <lb/>
     being made at Gander in the last two years are 
     <lb/>
     going to continue indefinitely, and therefore, 
     <lb/>
     with capital expenditure on the one hand and that 
     <lb/>
     $250,000 on the other it comes to $750,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On page 10 the Committee gives us its es<lb break="no"/>timate of the government's expenditure for three 
     <lb/>
     years to come, and the amount is roughly $25 
     <lb/>
     million. They have brought it from $27.25 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, which they tell us is what the present 
     <lb/>
     government is now spending on ordinary ac<lb break="no"/>count, to roughly $25 million, and they have 
     <lb/>
     brought it down by saving $1.25 million in the 
     <lb/>
     operation of the Railway, $1 million in servicing 
     <lb/>
     the public debt, and $750,000 for Gander. Now 
     <lb/>
     that $750,000 for Gander, just how they get that 
     <lb/>
     I will ask the chairman to explain before the 
     <lb/>
     debate is over, but even allowing for all that it 
     <lb/>
     stands at $25 million. Then we find them estimat<lb break="no"/>ing a revenue of roughly $30 million a year for 
     <lb/>
     the next three years. That would be a surplus of 
  

            <cb/>
         

     $5 million a year. Incidentally, I hope that es<lb break="no"/>timate of a surplus ... is at least a little more 
     <lb/>
     accurate and better founded than the estimates of 
     <lb/>
     all the finance ministers from 1920 to 1932, but 
     <lb/>
     assuming that it is, we then find the Committee 
     <lb/>
     having glorious fun for itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is always fun to spend money, and they start 
     <lb/>
     out to spend that $5 million a year for those three 
     <lb/>
     years. What are they going to spend it on? Addi<lb break="no"/>tional old age pensions โ $600,000 a year for 
     <lb/>
     three years. Fishermen's and mariners' insurance 
     <lb/>
     โ $400,000 a year for three years. Encour<lb break="no"/>agement of tourist traffic by building roads from 
     <lb/>
     Port-aux-Basques to Comer Brook, linking up 
     <lb/>
     Grand Falls and Gander, also Lewisporte with 
     <lb/>
     Gander, total $1 million a year for three years. 
     <lb/>
     Further encouragement and development of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, particularly fresh fish โ $1 million a 
     <lb/>
     year for three years. Local public works โ 
     <lb/>
     $500,000 a year for three years. Mercantile 
     <lb/>
     marine, ... โ $500,000 a year for three years, and 
     <lb/>
     Railway capital expenditure, including rail relay<lb break="no"/>ing of entire system โ $1 million a year for three 
     <lb/>
     years. Total, $5 million a year for three years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now number one, that $5 million is a purely 
     <lb/>
     hypothetical sum of money. It does notexist, only 
     <lb/>
     in a man's mind.... The first question is this: we 
     <lb/>
     spend $600,000 a year on additional old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions for three years. What about the fourth 
     <lb/>
     year? Do you cut it out or stop it? Are you going 
     <lb/>
     to give old age pensions only if you have a 
     <lb/>
     surplus? Must our worn out toilers wait until the 
     <lb/>
     government has a surplus before you increase old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions? Is it something that you think of 
     <lb/>
     only when you have spent all your money, and if 
     <lb/>
     you have everything you can think of, and you 
     <lb/>
     have a bit left over, well then you will give the 
     <lb/>
     worn out toilers a little bit more, out of a surplus, 
     <lb/>
     not an ordinary expenditure at all, but just purely 
     <lb/>
     a surplus? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What are you going to get with $1 million for 
     <lb/>
     three years in building roads?.... $3 million won't 
     <lb/>
     build much more than one quarter of the roads 
     <lb/>
     you are talking about. You are going to spend too, 
     <lb/>
     out of that surplus that we have imagined, on 
     <lb/>
     encouragement of the fisheries, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     the encouragement of the fresh fish industry, $1 
     <lb/>
     million. What will $1 million a year do? You will 
     <lb/>
     have to spend $10 million if you are going to put 
     <lb/>
     the fishery on its feet. What are you going to do 
     <lb/>
     with the people on the north side of Bonavista 



            <pb n="647" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-04_Page_0647.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">647</fw>
          

     Bay when the Labrador fishery is given up alto<lb break="no"/>gether? What will you do with the people in 
     <lb/>
     Greenspond? There is not a Labrador schooner 
     <lb/>
     left. All they can do is go out in the bay with the 
     <lb/>
     boats they have left. You have got to spend mil<lb break="no"/>lions upon millions of dollars if you are going to 
     <lb/>
     save the fisheries of this country. A lot of that is 
     <lb/>
     for the fresh fish industry alone. What about the 
     <lb/>
     salt fishery? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then $500,000 on public works โ a mere flea 
     <lb/>
     bite. Why the breakwater in Bonavista, to repair 
     <lb/>
     that breakwater, will take $500,000, and the 
     <lb/>
     member for Bonavista East says, "Yes, and you 
     <lb/>
     can add another half a million to that". $1 million 
     <lb/>
     for that one breakwater. What about the one in 
     <lb/>
     Bay de Verde? Now you have, if my memory 
     <lb/>
     serves me right, 376 public wharves and slip<lb break="no"/>ways, and you are going to spend $1.5 million for 
     <lb/>
     three years. You would not begin to touch it.... 
     <lb/>
     You are going to fling away half a million for the 
     <lb/>
     mercantile marine โ down the sink, down the 
     <lb/>
     sewer.... You buy your boats at a high price and 
     <lb/>
     sell them two or three years later for half the price, 
     <lb/>
     and lose on them while you are running them. 
     <lb/>
     And you are going to spend $3 million capital 
     <lb/>
     expenditure on the Railway โ about one third of 
     <lb/>
     what needs to be spent, just about one third. If you 
     <lb/>
     turn to the Black Book that we brought from 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa you will find the estimate of the CNR. For 
     <lb/>
     the next year they expect to spend $17 million, 
     <lb/>
     and you are going to spend $3 million to put the 
     <lb/>
     Railway into condition. It just can't be done, just 
     <lb/>
     can't be done... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, may I rise to a point 
     <lb/>
     of order? I understand that these Black Books are 
     <lb/>
     private property to this Convention so far. Has 
     <lb/>
     there been any release by you, sir, to publish 
     <lb/>
     them? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....On that point I have to speak 
     <lb/>
     subject to correction. The impression I gathered 
     <lb/>
     was that the reports were to be distributed to 
     <lb/>
     members and to the press, but not to be 
     <lb/>
     publicised.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You are perfectly correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> If I may intervene, that is not ex<lb break="no"/>actly the position. The documents in question 
     <lb/>
     were distributed to the members of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion on October 10. On the same day copies were 
     <lb/>
     given to the local press and various radio com<lb break="no"/>mentators, and certain other prominent citizens. 
     <lb/>
     Since that time I have noticed that some of the 


            <cb/>
          

     press have been freely commenting on the con<lb break="no"/>tents of these two volumes, and surely it is not 
     <lb/>
     contended that if the press can comment on them 
     <lb/>
     a member of this Convention cannot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now I must ask you to turn to 
     <lb/>
     page 41, and we find this sentence: "Now in 
     <lb/>
     connection with our use of the phrase 'foresee<lb break="no"/>able future', we think we should explain what we 
     <lb/>
     mean. We are conscious of the fact that there may 
     <lb/>
     be delegates who will be satisfied with nothing 
     <lb/>
     less than an absolute gilt-edged guarantee of our

     <choice><sic>solveny</sic><corr>solvency</corr></choice> for the next 20 years.... In our case, 
     <lb/>
     however, we have exceeded the ordinary govern<lb break="no"/>ment budgetary period of one year and made our 
     <lb/>
     estimate on a basis of things as we believe they 
     <lb/>
     will be for the next three years." Now, this report 
     <lb/>
     sets out very frankly, and I take it sincerely, to 
     <lb/>
     give an estimate of our probable revenue and 
     <lb/>
     expenditure per year for the next three years.

     <lb/>
     I beg your pardon again, what they set out to do 
     <lb/>
     is to give it for the "foreseeable future", and then 
     <lb/>
     further on they say that the "foreseeable future" 
     <lb/>
     amounts to three years Not two and a half years, 
     <lb/>
     not three and a half years or four years, but 
     <lb/>
     exactly three years. They say that we should

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will sustain you on that point.

     Unless a member rises to a point of order he is 
     <lb/>
     not to interrupt a speaker when he occupies the 
     <lb/>
     floor, and on that point, Mr. Smallwood, I will 
     <lb/>
     have to sustain you; but in fairness to Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin I must sustain him in that the statement 
     <lb/>
     might be' misleading, since you have not gone on 
     <lb/>
     to read far enough. Will you please read the next 
     <lb/>
     few lines, Mr. Smallwood?

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will read the whole thing from 
     <lb/>
     the beginning. "Our task in the preparation of this 
     <lb/>
     report was in fact, somewhat similar to that of 
     <lb/>
     persons appointed to examine a business con<lb break="no"/>cern. We had to find out if the business was 
     <lb/>
     solvent. We had to examine the assets and 
     <lb/>
     liabilities. We had to see how much it costs to run 
     <lb/>
     the business, and we finally had to satisfy oursel<lb break="no"/>ves that the business would continue to be a 
     <lb/>
     paying proposition in the foreseeable future. 
     <lb/>
     Now in conclusion, with our use of the phrase 
     <lb/>
     'foreseeable future', we think we should explain 
     <lb/>
     what we mean. We are conscious of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     there may be delegates who will be satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     nothing less than an absolute gilt-edged guaran<lb break="no"/>tee of our solvency for the next 20 years before 
     <lb/>
     they will accept the fact that Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting. 'Things are all right now,' they 
     <lb/>
     may say, 'but what of the future?" Now don't 
     <lb/>
     get nervous.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If you don't mind, gentlemen, 
     <lb/>there need to be no exchanges at all. Mr.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> "To such we reply that we do 
     <lb/>
     not know about our future. We do not know what 
     <lb/>
     the future of Newfoundland will be five years 
     <lb/>
     from now, any more than the governments of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, the United States or Great Britain know 
     <lb/>
     how things will be with them five years from 
     <lb/>
     now. All we can do is to follow the example of 
 

            <cb/>
        

     these various governments and plan for the future 
     <lb/>
     in the light of such facts and information as are 
     <lb/>
     presently available. We do what the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     businessman does, who satisfies himself that he 
     <lb/>
     is financially sound and then takes his chance on 
     <lb/>
     the future. Businessmen in this country have been 
     <lb/>
     doing just this sort of thing for over 100 years and 
     <lb/>
     they are still going strong." Now is the Chairman 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that I have read the thing correctly and 
     <lb/>
     completely? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Is the Major satisfied now?

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, I am satisfied now. In view of 
     <lb/>the fact that my friend opposite was trying not to 
     <lb/>read that in order to prove that our statement did 
     <lb/>not prove that... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I can't allow you to draw this 
     <lb/>
     conclusion at all, Major Cashin... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The point I want to make is this: 
     <lb/>
     the Committee sets a period of three years as 
     <lb/>
     being the "foreseeable future". Three years ex<lb break="no"/>actly, and they say that some delegates may ob<lb break="no"/>ject to that, and may want an absolutely 
     <lb/>
     gilt-edged guarantee of Newfoundland's solven<lb break="no"/>cy โ for the next three years? No. The next five 
     <lb/>
     years? No. For the next 20 years? I don't know, 
     <lb/>
     I can't speak for other delegates, and there may 
     <lb/>
     be some who demand an absolute guarantee of 
     <lb/>
     this country's solvency for the next 20 years. I 
     <lb/>
     don't. I am not that unreasonable, but I do insist 
     <lb/>
     that I shall look further ahead than three years. 
     <lb/>
     I think it is my duty so to do. Whether I do it or 
     <lb/>
     not, whether the Finance Committee does it or 
     <lb/>
     not, whether this Convention does it or not, take 
     <lb/>
     this from me, that the people will look ahead 
     <lb/>
     much more than three years when they come to 
     <lb/>
     decide what kind of government they want. I say 
     <lb/>
     not 20 years, nor three years, but eight or ten or 
     <lb/>
     12 or 15 years. I don't know that actually 20 years 
     <lb/>
     is very far to look ahead. We have looked back 
     <lb/>
     for 50 years, and I think we might justly look 
     <lb/>
     ahead to 15 or 20 years, because when we come 
     <lb/>
     to recommend forms of government it will not be 
     <lb/>
     for the next three years. Here is a report which 
     <lb/>
     sets out to give a forecast of what Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will be like in the next three years. If that's all we 
     <lb/>
     have to go by, are we going to say to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people before this Convention ends, 
     <lb/>
     "Look, we have had the report of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee on the economic side, and the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee can see how Newfound<lb break="no"/>land's government can finance itself for the next 


            <pb n="649" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-04_Page_0649.jpg"/>

     three years, and even have a surplus. That's as far 
     <lb/>
     as we can see. Therefore we will recommend a 
     <lb/>
     form of government for three years." Can we do 
     <lb/>
     that? Well, if we do the whole country would 
     <lb/>
     laugh at us. Now remember, I don't expect the 
     <lb/>
     Committee to bring in a budget for three years. I 
     <lb/>
     think you brought it in for two years too many. I 
     <lb/>
     doubt if the Commissioner for Finance, when he 
     <lb/>
     brings down his budget, will be able with any real 
     <lb/>
     accuracy to forecast the government's revenue 
     <lb/>
     and expenditure for just 12 months.... You are 
     <lb/>
     estimating for three years what revenue and ex<lb break="no"/>penditure you will get. On the other side you have 
     <lb/>
     not gone far enough. You have not given the 
     <lb/>
     Convention any kind of picture of what the 
     <lb/>
     general economy is likely to be in the next eight, 
     <lb/>
     ten or 12 or 15 years.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In fairness to the Committee it 
     <lb/>
     is impossible for anyone other than an industrial 
     <lb/>
     economist to make such a forecast. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't think it would be pos<lb break="no"/>sible for an industrial economist, or a statistician 
     <lb/>
     economist that I wanted to get into this country a 
     <lb/>
     few days after the Convention opened, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Convention decided it did not want, and now 
     <lb/>
     I find the Finance Committee saying they recom<lb break="no"/>mended the same thing. Major Cashin said that 
     <lb/>
     he was sick of experts in this country, and he 
     <lb/>
     pointed across the table at Mr. Hollett...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Don't look at me!

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will look at you if I want to. 
     <lb/>
     You are not too big to be looked at.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Gentlemen, please come to 
     <lb/>
     order. Mr. Smallwood will you kindly address 
     <lb/>
     me. However hard I am to look at I still require 
     <lb/>
     you to address your remarks to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, I will do that. Well Mr.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Don't you think so? Those who 
     <lb/>
     say I am long-winded, to them I would say that I

     have heard the chairman of the Finance Commit<lb break="no"/>tee occupy five and six hours of the time of this

     house, and I have heard his late father speak for 
     <lb/>
     something like a day and a half, so if I take up an

     hour, or an hour and a half discussing what is 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the most importantreport brought in here 
     <lb/>
     yet, I am not being so long-winded as I sound.

            <cb/>
          

     it is you are dealing with the productive economy 
     <lb/>
     of this country.... If you don't mind, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, you can continue. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is very pleasant to have both 
     <lb/>you, Mr. Chairman, and Major Cashin encourag<lb break="no"/>ing me to go on. I did not expect to live to see that 
     <lb/>day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not encouraging or dis<lb break="no"/>couraging you. I am saying that you are entitled 
     <lb/>to express yourself if you so desire, and that is the 
     <lb/>right of any other member of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Thank you sir, I will try to be 
     <lb/>serious. If the gentlemen will turn to page 42, we 
     <lb/>come to the crux of the whole business.... We all 
     <lb/>know we have had high revenues in the past few 
     <lb/>years, and the Convention Act tells us that we are 
     <lb/>supposed to pronounce as to whether these high 
     <lb/>revenues are the result of wartime conditions, or 
     <lb/>whether they are normal.... What are we going to 
     <lb/>do Mr. Chairman? Are we going to make a report, 
     <lb/>and if we adopt this report that is what we are 
     <lb/>doing, to Newfoundland and to Great Britain 
     <lb/>along these lines: Before the war we were run<lb break="no"/>ning in the red all the time. We were losing 
     <lb/>money, the government was losing money, 
     <lb/>deficit after deficit, year after year we were sink<lb break="no"/>ing money. From 1920 to 1934 we borrowed over 
     <lb/>$50 million. From 1934 ti11 the war broke out we 
     <lb/>still did not get enough to pay expenses, so the 
     <lb/>British government had to give us a grant-in-aid 
     <lb/>every year to make up our loss. So from 1920 to 
     <lb/>1940 we either had to go out and borrow the 
     <lb/>money to pay our way or get it as a grant-in-aid 
     <lb/>from the old country, but in spite of that the war 
     <lb/>came and our revenues have gone up and up. So 
     <lb/>have our expenditures, but not as high as our 
     <lb/>revenues, and we have had a Surplus. But now we 
     <lb/>want to report to you as follows: that these great 
     <lb/>revenues that have poured in on the government 
     <lb/>since 1940 or 1941, these great revenues are not 
     <lb/>the result of the war, oh no. What are they the 
     <lb/>result of? The growth of our main industries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But what made our main industries grow, if 
     <lb/>they have grown? Which they have not. Our main 
     <lb/>industries have not grown. It is true that at Corner 
     <lb/>Brook they have been installing additional equip<lb break="no"/>ment, which when it is ready to operate will mean 
     <lb/>that that industry has grown. We have, in the last 
     <lb/>few years installed some freezing equipment, 
     <lb/>cold storage equipment, for the fresh fish part of 
     <lb/>our fishing industry, which is only a small part of 
 

            <pb n="650" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-04_Page_0650.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">650</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          

     our fishing industry, remember. We have done 
     <lb/>
     that. What have we done by way of making our 
     <lb/>
     mining industry grow? What have we done by 
     <lb/>
     way of making our main fishing industry grow? 
     <lb/>
     What has happened to make our main forest 
     <lb/>
     industry grow? They have not grown. Their 
     <lb/>
     figures are swollen because prices have gone up, 
     <lb/>
     and they are handling more money just as the 
     <lb/>
     government is handling more money. What made 
     <lb/>
     them grow? The war. And yet we are going to 
     <lb/>
     turn around and tell the British government and 
     <lb/>
     the people that those revenues are not the result 
     <lb/>
     of wartime conditions. Why? Because the war is 
     <lb/>
     over for two years, therefore they cannot be the 
     <lb/>
     result of the war. What kind of logic is that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Is there a man in this Convention today, one 
     <lb/>
     man, who will tell me sincerely and honestly that 
     <lb/>
     the present price of newsprint is not the result of 
     <lb/>
     the war? Is there a man who will tell me that the 
     <lb/>
     present price of fish is not the result of the war? 
     <lb/>
     That the present price of fish oils is not the result 
     <lb/>
     of the war? That the present price of Buchans ore 
     <lb/>
     and Bell Island ore is not the result of the war? Is 
     <lb/>
     there a man who will tell me that? If there is, I 
     <lb/>
     will not believe him, because I know that these 
     <lb/>
     prices are the result of the war, and the wartime 
     <lb/>
     boom. How can we adopt that part of the report, 
     <lb/>
     saying as it does that these inflated revenues of 
     <lb/>
     the government, and of the AND Co., the 
     <lb/>
     Buchans Company, Bowaters, Bell Island and all 
     <lb/>
     the other companies, that these inflated values are 
     <lb/>
     just the ordinary result of the growth of these 
     <lb/>
     industries, and are not the result of wartime 
     <lb/>
     boom? I don't believe it, and I don't believe the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country are going to believe it 
     <lb/>
     either, and I for one will not vote for that report 
     <lb/>
     so long as that section is in it. Not only that 
     <lb/>
     section, but there are several others I would want 
     <lb/>
     taken out before I can support it, because I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe that the report is an accurate, true, fair 
     <lb/>
     account of our country's economy now or in the 
     <lb/>
     years to come. It is neither correct nor fair.... If it 
     <lb/>
     was an honest report, realistic, trying to face the 


            <cb/>
           

     hard facts, it would paint a different picture al<lb break="no"/>together. Not a picture of blue ruin, or of disaster, 
     <lb/>
     any more than of rosy hopeful optimism.... It 
     <lb/>
     should try to paint for the people of this country, 
     <lb/>
     who are looking to us for an honest to God, 
     <lb/>
     truthful statement of how our country shapes โ 
     <lb/>
     their country, not our country. The fishermen 
     <lb/>
     want to know what the future is likely to be before 
     <lb/>
     they cast their votes for some kind of government 
     <lb/>
     next spring. The miners want to know what con<lb break="no"/>ditions are likely to be in Newfoundland before 
     <lb/>
     they go out with an easy heart to vote for some 
     <lb/>
     kind of government. The railroaders want to 
     <lb/>
     know, the loggers want to know, and the 
     <lb/>
     labourers, the teachers and civil servants want to 
     <lb/>
     know, the shop workers, clerks and office 
     <lb/>
     workers want to know, the loggers want to know, 
     <lb/>
     and our decent Newfoundland people want this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, in God's name, to give them a fair 
     <lb/>
     and square picture of how Newfoundland stands 
     <lb/>
     today, and how she is likely to stand in the years 
     <lb/>
     to come before they can go ahead with any kind 
     <lb/>
     of heart and confidence to cast a vote for some 
     <lb/>
     kind of government when the referendum comes 
     <lb/>
     around next spring. That, Mr. Chairman, this 
     <lb/>
     report is not. It is neither fair nor accurate. It is 
     <lb/>
     optimistic and it should not be optimistic. It 
     <lb/>
     should be realistic โ not pessimistic or optimis<lb break="no"/>tic, facing the hard, brutal, real facts, and this 
     <lb/>
     report does not do it, and as such this Convention 
     <lb/>
     should not adopt it, and as such the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland should spurn the report and throw 
     <lb/>
     it out. It is not worth the paper it is written upon.
