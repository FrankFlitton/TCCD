   <!--<p>
     States, and he said, "Yes, the trade is very much 
     <lb/>
     alive to it, and very much on their toes." He 
     <lb/>
     mentions Brazil. Is anyone trying to sell fish in 
     <lb/>
     Brazil? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Yes, as far as I know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, are they trying to sell it 
     <lb/>
     anywhere else? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I don't know, they don't tell me 
     <lb/>
     their trade secrets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, the fresh fish people con<lb break="no"/>centrate too much on the United States. Are they 
     <lb/>
     paying enough attention to other markets? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> You are trying to pin me down to 
     <lb/>
     something I am not prepared to be pinned down 
     <lb/>
     to, and as far as I am concerned I won't be pinned 
     <lb/>
     down. You must remember that going into other 
     <lb/>
     markets costs a great deal of money. They have 
     <lb/>
     already spent a lot of money on advertising, and 
     <lb/>
     these people may not be prepared to go into these 
     <lb/>
     other markets and advertise. It may run into 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands of dollars. I am not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to criticise them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Getting back to fish again. Is 
     <lb/>
     there duty on all fish going into the United States? 
     <lb/>
     We have fillets, turbot, smelts, etc., is there duty 
     <lb/>
     on all of them? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes, but the duty varies on different 
     <lb/>
     sorts of fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I wonder if Mr. Job could tell me 
     <lb/>
     the price of fresh cod fillets in St. John's? I can 
     <lb/>
     tell you, 28 cents per pound. What do you think 
     <lb/>
     of that price? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> A very nice price if you can get it. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am looking at the cost of living of 
     <lb/>the average St. John's man and woman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think if we could sell the fillets here 
     <lb/>
     at cost they would be very glad to do something. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Penney As far as I am concerned the section 
     <lb/>of the report as read is self-explanatory, and I am 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     willing to accept it and move on to other business. 
     <lb/>
     I believe we should think over what kind of a 
     <lb/>
     delegation we are going to send to the United 
     <lb/>
     States to see about our markets for fresh fillets 
     <lb/>
     and other fishery products. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>[The section passed, and the Secretary read the<lb/>next section]<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I suggest we adjourn until tomorrow to 
     <lb/>
     give the members time to master this report on 
     <lb/>
     the salt codfishery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We have not been making much 
     <lb/>
     progress of late, and I suggest to you that since a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of time has been lost as a result of a 
     <lb/>
     shortage of paper, and we have a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     work to do, it would be advisable to hold night 
     <lb/>
     sessions. However, I am entirely in your hands. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hillier I think it would be a good idea, if it 
     <lb/>would not be putting too much on the ladies who 
     <lb/>are reporting the proceedings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I will look after that. I will see 
     <lb/>
     that they are not driven too hard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Jones I think we should have one night to 
     <lb/>
     go over the report and see what we can make of 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It is the most important part of the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Report. There is some justification for 
     <lb/>
     the request. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hillier In view of the fact that the members 
     <lb/>
     received the report only this afternoon, we might 
     <lb/>
     dispose of the night session until tomorrow night. 
     <lb/>
     I make that as a motion 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Before the motion, I would like to 
     <lb/>
     ask Mr. Job or Mr. Ashbourne, did they make any 
     <lb/>
     inquiries whatever into the figures of the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen's insurance scheme in connection with 
     <lb/>
     this country? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes, it is in the report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     Would Mr. Job tell us if that means that to take 
     <lb/>
     a hogshead of salt, say from St. John's on a 
     <lb/>
     government boat to some other place on the coast, 
     <lb/>
     costs as much freight as that hogshead of salt cost 
     <lb/>
     where it was purchased in the first place? 
     <lb/>
      </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Most of the salt is freighted from the 
     <lb/>West Indies by the government boats, and the 
     <lb/>freight is about three times the cost of the salt in 
     <lb/>the West Indies. The freights are tremendously 
     <lb/>high. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You mean that the salt is 
     <lb/>bought in the West indies and freighted to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and the cost of the freight from West 
     <lb/>Indies to Newfoundland is about three times the 
     <lb/>price of the salt in West Indies in the first place? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> I wonder if Mr. Job would tell 
     <lb/>us what the freight is on salt from the West Indies 
     <lb/>to Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I can't tell you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> At the time that we were writ<lb break="no"/>ing this sub-committec report the freight on salt 
     <lb/>was $12 a ton from the West Indies to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and the cost of the salt was about 
     <lb/>$4.02 in West Indies, so that would bring it to 
     <lb/>approximately three times the price. Added to 
     <lb/>that are certain charges for loading and for in<lb break="no"/>surance. Representations having been made to 
     <lb/>the Newfoundland Fisheries Board,<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> an arrange<lb break="no"/>ment has been made whereby there is a rebate 
     <lb/>paid of $1 per hogshead to the importer, in the 
     <lb/>outports particularly. I don't know if that applies 
     <lb/>to St. John's as well, because the cargoes of salt 
     <lb/>to St. John's come in much larger vessels, and 
     <lb/>you can expect a lower rate of freight; I think such 
     <lb/>a large freight rate on the government boats was 
     <lb/>on account of their smaller carrying capacity. 
     <lb/>They go to the West Indies with fish and they 
     <lb/>bring back molasses, and sometimes rum, and 
     <lb/>also bring back salt for the outports.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> Does that mean $4.02 landed 
     <lb/>cost? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> No, that's the rate in the West 
     <lb/>Indies, and there's a rebate of $1 per hogshead. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCA7">Mr. McCarthy</persName> That would be $3 freight ap<lb break="no"/>proximately? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> Yes, but the understanding is 
     <lb/>that the salt must be sold in the outports at $4.75 
     <lb/>per hogshead, which is the same price as in St. 
     <lb/>John's when imported from the West Indies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> On page 7 of the Appendix: 
     <lb/>
     "We appreciate the important work that the New<lb break="no"/>foundland Fisheries Board is performing in its 
     <lb/>
     control over all branches of the fishing industry." 
     <lb/>
     I understand that the Fisheries Board has a 
     <lb/>
     definite policy to keep the exportation of fish in 
     <lb/>
     as few hands as possible. I heard or read some<lb break="no"/>where that the idea was to keep the number of 
     <lb/>
     exporters limited to around 50.... Now if Mr. Job 
     <lb/>
     tells us that that is the policy of the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Board, would he tell us how the Board, or the fish 
     <lb/>
     trade, proposes to deal with small exporters, and 
     <lb/>
     how it proposes to deal with new exporters. How 
     <lb/>
     can a man become an exporter if he is not one 
     <lb/>
     already? In the old days we have had men, we 
     <lb/>
     have one on Water Street today who began as a 
     <lb/>
     fisherman in Bonavista Bay and started a small 
     <lb/>
     shop, and ended up one of the biggest exporters 
     <lb/>
     in this country. If there had been a fishery board 
     <lb/>
     at that time, could he have become one of the 
     <lb/>
     largest exporters in Newfoundland? Then I am 
     <lb/>
     wondering about the co-operative society. Can a 
     <lb/>
     co-operative society, as easily as anyone else, 
     <lb/>
     become an exporter?.... What do they look for<lb break="no"/>ward to, the day when they will succeed in having 
     <lb/>
     perhaps a dozen exporters in the country? Is that 
     <lb/>
     the ideal they are aiming at, a dozen, or 20, or just 
     <lb/>
     one?.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I don't know whether Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>
     can answer that question; I can't because I am not 
     <lb/>
     a member of the Fishery Board, and I don't attend 
     <lb/>
     their meetings. I am sure they are not going to 
     <lb/>
     discourage any man who wants to go into the 
     <lb/>
     thing on a large scale. If the speaker will put his 
     <lb/>
     question into writing I think it might be passed 
     <lb/>
     on to the Fishery Board. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> There is not much that can be 
     <lb/>
     added, except that I believe that at the time the 
     <lb/>
     licenses were given to codfish exporters it was 
     <lb/>
     stipulated that an exporter, to get a license, had 
     <lb/>
     to export up to a certain number of quintals of 
     <lb/>
     fish, a certain minimum for a year or two previous 
     <lb/>
     to the issuing of the license. Any person or co<lb break="no"/>operative who was in a position to export this 
     <lb/>
     quantity of fish — 3,000 quintals I believe it was 
     <lb/>
     — for a year or two before applying for a license 
     <lb/>
     was granted an exporter's license. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> That might be all right, but fol<lb break="no"/>lowing up Mr. Smallwood's point, if he decided 
     <lb/>
     to export fish, how would he acquire a license? 
   

<note xml:id="fn_03">[1] Created in 1936 by Commission of Government to regulate the production and export of fish.</note> 

            <pb n="378" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0378.jpg"/>

     He may not have exported before, but he may be 
     <lb/>
     in the business financially. How can he acquire a 
     <lb/>
     license? Is it restricted to those who do have 
     <lb/>
     licenses arbitrarily? Can a new man get a license 
     <lb/>
     now, not theoretically but practically? 
     <lb/></p>
            

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think they would take a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     view, and if a man can show that he can make 
     <lb/>
     reasonable arrangements I don't think there is 
     <lb/>
     any fixed ruling. I think that during the war they 
     <lb/>
     made these regulations — that a man should be 
     <lb/>
     an exporter of at least 3,000 quintals to get his 
     <lb/>
     license — because they did not want to get into 
     <lb/>
     it men who were exporting three or four quintals, 
     <lb/>
     underselling, and that sort of thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I understood yesterday from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job that the fresh fish industry was at the moment 
     <lb/>
     more or less in the doldrums. I take it therefore 
     <lb/>
     that you, Mr. Job, would not be able to handle 
     <lb/>
     much more fish if conditions remain as they are? 
     <lb/>
     The amount of fish that you caught last year 
     <lb/>
     would be sufficient to supply the markets that you 
     <lb/>
     now have? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would like an explanation of this 
     <lb/>
     part on page 19A: "The Committee agrees that as 
     <lb/>
     many men as possible should be diverted into the 
     <lb/>
     frozen fish trade and other branches of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries with as much urgency as conditions 
     <lb/>
     would seem to indicate." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You missed three important words — 
     <lb/>
     "and will permit". If the market does not permit, 
     <lb/>
     you can't do it. That's the position at the moment. 
     <lb/>
     Unless the fresh fish boards can pay the same or 
     <lb/>
     a better price than the people who are salting their 
     <lb/>
     fish and selling it, they won't get the fish. That's 
     <lb/>
     the position that may occur this year. Last year 
     <lb/>
     we handled around this time a considerable num<lb break="no"/>ber of bankers. This year we are not going to be 
     <lb/>
     able to do that because the conditions are entirely 
     <lb/>
     different, but I think the quantity of fresh fish 
     <lb/>
     processed by the plant will greatly depend on the 
     <lb/>
     price of salted fish as against the price of fresh. 
     <lb/>
     We can't expect to get the fresh fish at a cheaper 
     <lb/>
     price than can be realised by salting it. It will 
     <lb/>
     more or less cure itself, that situation. At the 
     <lb/>
     present time it would seem it is better business to 
     <lb/>
     salt your fish. That situation may change, I hope 
     <lb/>
     it will. It will be a healthy thing to have both the 
     <lb/>
     plants and the salting go on together. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I would like to have this clarified. 
     <lb/>
     As I understand it, all the sales of salt codfish at 
   

            <cb/>
    

     the present time are negotiated by the Salt Cod<lb break="no"/>fish Exporters Association. Is that right? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> Which association is subdivided 
     <lb/>
     into marketing groups. Where you have a group 
     <lb/>
     of exporters who are fairly large handlers, 
     <lb/>
     marketing for a Specific market, they might be 
     <lb/>
     called the Portugal group, the Brazil group, or 
     <lb/>
     whatever it is. When a sale is negotiated by the 
     <lb/>
     Salt Codfish Exporters Association, the members 
     <lb/>
     of the particular groups which will have to make 
     <lb/>
     that sale are given their allocation as to how much 
     <lb/>
     each can ship, and they decide that allocation on 
     <lb/>
     the basis of total production. Now the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in marketing for a small group would be in 
     <lb/>
     providing these allocations. One central agent, if 
     <lb/>
     I may use that term, marketing for a group of 
     <lb/>
     businesses around the country, can count in ad<lb break="no"/>vance on getting their codfish, and is therefore 
     <lb/>
     able to fill in his allocation. For instance he may 
     <lb/>
     have an allocation for 20,000 quintals of fish, and 
     <lb/>
     may have an agreement in St. Anthony for 20,000 
     <lb/>
     quintals, and another in Bonavista for 20,000 
     <lb/>
     quintals, and ifone is not ready he can take it from 
     <lb/>
     the other. Shipping out little bits of fish now and 
     <lb/>
     then would not be satisfactory. I am vague on this 
     <lb/>
     information, which is as I understand it, but I 
     <lb/>
     think the system works very well. The large 
     <lb/>
     groups in St. John's act for the smaller people 
     <lb/>
     outside on a pretty reasonable commission basis. 
     <lb/>
     I don't know what the qualifications are beyond 
     <lb/>
     being able to export a certain quantity. I don't 
     <lb/>
     know if you have to put up a money qualification 
     <lb/>
     or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to licensing, I understand the 
     <lb/>
     situation is that a small merchant, or small group 
     <lb/>
     of fishermen, whatever you have in an outport, 
     <lb/>
     that wishes to pack fish for export, secures from 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Board a license, not a license to 
     <lb/>
     export, but a license to pack for export. Their 
     <lb/>
     agent in St. John's does the exporting, and he has 
     <lb/>
     the licence to export. Before they get that license 
     <lb/>
     their premises have to be subject to inspection by 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Board. Which leads me to another 
     <lb/>
     point. The situation today is this, that if a mer<lb break="no"/>chant is exporting through a large merchant in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's say, his premises may be inspected before 
     <lb/>
     he gets this license to pack for export, but if a 
     <lb/>
     businessman or a group in an outport is merely 
     <lb/>
     putting up codfish which he sells outright to an 
     <lb/>
     exporter in St. John's for a fixed price, his 
   

            <pb n="379" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0379.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">379</fw>
          

     premises do not require any inspection, and I take 
     <lb/>
     it that it is that which is aimed at here: "The 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Fisheries Board inspection ser<lb break="no"/>vice should be extended as soon as possible to the 
     <lb/>
     inspection of fishing vessels and all premises 
     <lb/>
     where fish is handled." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Perhaps Mr. Crosbie, who is more 
     <lb/>
     familiar with Fishery Board regulations than I 
     <lb/>
     am, may be able to answer that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> You don't have to belong to all 
     <lb/>
     groups. You can join a Brazil group, or a Portugal 
     <lb/>
     group, or a West Indies group, but you don't have 
     <lb/>
     to join all of them. You have to put up $1,000. 
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If you had codfish to export to 
     <lb/>three or four markets you would have to join the 
     <lb/>three or four groups, and pay $1,000 to each of 
     <lb/>them, unless you are marketing it all to the one 
     <lb/>agent and then that agent would pay to all groups, 
     <lb/>is that it? Suppose Mr. Crosbie wanted to get a 
     <lb/>lot of co-operative societies operating, all fish 
     <lb/>producers. What is the obstacle, if any, to their 
     <lb/>being able to export their own fish? Has each 
     <lb/>society got to join each group, and pay $1,000 to 
     <lb/>each group? Or is it $1,000 to belong to the Salt 
     <lb/>Codfish Association? Can you explain that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> You have to pay $1,000 to belong 
     <lb/>to each group. That's a deposit. You don't have 
     <lb/>to put it up every season. The past several years 
     <lb/>the return to the country has been high, and that's 
     <lb/>the only way you can control it. You can't set up 
     <lb/>a service to inspect all the people. There has to be 
     <lb/>some control somewhere. I may belong to one 
     <lb/>group and pay $1,000, and there is nothing 
     <lb/>against Mr. Bradley saying to me, "Well now 
     <lb/>Chesley, will you ship out this for me?" And I 
     <lb/>would do so; or someone else may belong to 
     <lb/>another group and ship so much for me. Anyone 
     <lb/>can get a license to pack for export, or he can 
     <lb/>become an exporter himself if he wants to.

     <lb/>
     sell that down in South America at a fair price, 
     <lb/>
     would the Fisheries Board give me a license or 
     <lb/>
     not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Definitely no, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Last year I sold to a firm in New 
     <lb/>
     York five cases of lobster, and this firm also 
     <lb/>
     wanted me to get fish for them. It was possible 
     <lb/>
     for me to send them a sample, and then they sent 
     <lb/>
     to me for 1,000 quintals. I contacted the Fisheries 
   

            <cb/>
          

     Board and I could not sell the fish. This was to go 
     <lb/>
     to South America, and this firm was terribly upset 
     <lb/>
     over the whole thing. If you can produce good 
     <lb/>
     fish and have inspectors to cull it, you should not 
     <lb/>
     be debarred from exporting that fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> At any price? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> No, at a good price, but I was not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to export it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> It must not be forgotten that the 
     <lb/>
     past few years codfish has been scarce and has 
     <lb/>
     been on allocation. Therefore it is natural that the 
     <lb/>
     countries that have been in the habit in the past 
     <lb/>
     of buying our codfish should not have to go short, 
     <lb/>
     and the time is hardly ripe or opportune for get<lb break="no"/>ting new markets; but it is when there is a surplus 
     <lb/>
     of fish, more than our regular customers require, 
     <lb/>
     that's the time we want to get these new markets 
     <lb/>
     opened up, and there will be no trouble for a 
     <lb/>
     person to arrange that through some exporter who 
     <lb/>
     already has a license. My suggestion to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Northcott would be to contact some exporter so 
     <lb/>
     that if there is a surplus of codfish Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     might be able to benefit from that market. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is something that I would 
     <lb/>
     like Mr. Job to tell me. I have been hearing now 
     <lb/>
     for the last couple of years that one of the big 
     <lb/>
     reasons why the fishermen are so much in favour 
     <lb/>
     of the Commission system of government is that 
     <lb/>
     in the spring of the year, before they have 
     <lb/>
     launched their boats, before they have taken the 
     <lb/>
     cod out of the water at all, they know what the 
     <lb/>
     price of fish is going to be the rest of the year, that 
     <lb/>
     sometime in the winter or the spring it is an<lb break="no"/>nounced that the price of fish to the fishermen for 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the year is going to be such and such. 
     <lb/>
     That's been going on for the last two or three 
     <lb/>
     years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You are generally up to date, but you 
     <lb/>
     are a little behindhand there. That is not so in the 
     <lb/>
     last two years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I hope you will see what I am 
     <lb/>
     getting at. How true is it that the fishermen, up to 
     <lb/>
     last year, would know early in the season, before 
     <lb/>
     they began fishing at all, what the price of fish 
     <lb/>
     was going to be? Fishermen before that would get 
     <lb/>
     up to the fall, and Christmas, and perhaps the 
     <lb/>
     middle of the winter, before they found out the 
     <lb/>
     price they were going to get for the fish they 
     <lb/>
     caught last year. All of a sudden an an<lb break="no"/>nouncement is made in the winter or early spring 
     <lb/>
     that the price of fish was to be such and such for 
    

            <pb n="380" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0380.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">380</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw>
          

     the coming season, so that they knew what they 
     <lb/>
     were going to get before they went fishing at all. 
     <lb/>
     And they were very thankful to the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government for that, a wonderful government 
     <lb/>
     that would tell them ahead of time what price they 
     <lb/>
     were going to get, up to a year ago you say. I 
     <lb/>
     would like someone who knows to tell us how 
     <lb/>
     true that is. Was it the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment? This needs to be known. Mr. Job may take 
     <lb/>
     it very lightly, but it is far from being a joke.... 
     <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think it largely happened by the help 
     <lb/>of our friend Mr. Brown He was greatly inter<lb break="no"/>ested in it at that time, and he was able to get the 
     <lb/>trade together, and it was easy enough in those 
     <lb/>days when the demand exceeded the supply; but 
     <lb/>when you are doubtful whether the supply will 
     <lb/>exceed the demand you can't fix it. I don't think 
     <lb/>you could. You ask whether the Commission of 
     <lb/>Government should get the credit for it — not any 
     <lb/>more than the trade and Mr. Brown and the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland Fisheries Board. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What about the Combined 
     <lb/>
     Food Board,<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> did they set the price? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You mean our board?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Oh yes, they had something to do with 
     <lb/>
     it. When you could sell ahead it was easy to 
     <lb/>
     arrange with the fisherman and say, "We think 
     <lb/>
     the price should be so and so." It was an interna<lb break="no"/>tional association. The United States, Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain. I don't know if France was in it or 
     <lb/>
     not.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It may have been a subsidiary of that, I 
     <lb/>
     am not sure. Anyhow it was with a view of 
     <lb/>
     making full distribution of our Codfish where it 
     <lb/>
     was most needed. It was a very easy thing to come 
     <lb/>
     to an arrangement then as to what would be a fair 
     <lb/>
     price to pay the fishermen; we knew what we 
     <lb/>
     were going to get, but now we don't.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How did we know? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Because the contract was made to take 
     <lb/>
     the allocation at a certain price.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am grateful to Mr. Job, and 
     <lb/>
     maybe he would not mind my pursuing the matter 
     <lb/>
     a little further. Is this what happened? When the 
     <lb/>
     war broke out the United States, Great Britain, 
    

            <cb/>
          

     Canada, Newfoundland and some other countries 
     <lb/>
     formed themselves into a Combined Food Board 
     <lb/>
     to regulate all the food there might be, wheat, 
     <lb/>
     fish, vegetables, meat, etc., so that they could 
     <lb/>
     portion out all the food so that no one country got 
     <lb/>
     more than its share.... This board would say to the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Fisheries Board and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     and American fish merchants. "In 1942 we want 
     <lb/>
     so many thousand tons of fish. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     how much can you produce? How much can 
     <lb/>
     Canada produce? How much USA?" They por<lb break="no"/>tioned it out, and fixed the price early in the 
     <lb/>
     season, and the Fisheries Board would be told 
     <lb/>
     what price the fish exporters would be allowed 
     <lb/>
     for their portion, and then when the exporters 
     <lb/>
     knew beforehand, early in the year, maybe 
     <lb/>
     January or February, what the price would be that 
     <lb/>
     they would get for the coming year, they could 
     <lb/>
     call their suppliers in and say to them, "The price 
     <lb/>
    of fish in 1942 will be such and such, and 1943, 
     <lb/>1944 and 1945, etc." Is that what happened? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes, that is what happened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If that is what happened, we 
     <lb/>
     have all been making a mistake in saying, "Thank 
     <lb/>
     God for the Commission of Government." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think they received credit where they 
     <lb/>
     should not have.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I want to know if the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government fixed the price; if they did, 
     <lb/>
     we will give them credit for it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You can give them credit for support<lb break="no"/>ing the board that did it — our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Did the Fisheries Board or the 
     <lb/>
     Combined Foods Board fix it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Our Fisheries Board had a say in it — 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Gushue was the chairman. The Combined 
     <lb/>
     Food Board had all the negotiations? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I think our friend from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre has lost a lot of his perspicacity. I thought 
     <lb/>
     we understood the difference between our market 
     <lb/>
     today and in the old days when it was every man 
     <lb/>
     for himself; he sold his fish where he could, when 
     <lb/>
     he could, for what he could. Under the new 
     <lb/>
     system the fish, as I understand it, is sold by the 
     <lb/>
     Salt Codfish Exporters Association by contracts. 
     <lb/>
     If that is to be continued in future, it is easy to see

     how we can know in advance just about what our 
     <lb/>
     fish will fetch as long as there is a demand for it 
     <lb/>
     — we can make one big contract with the associa<lb break="no"/>tion. We have gone from free enterprise to a

     controlled enterprise system.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> Can Mr. Job tell us how long this 
     <lb/>
     will continue. We are still under Commission

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I cannot tell you anything about it. One 
     <lb/>
     thing it would be fair to say about the Fisheries

     Board, is that they have done wonderful work. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Since when? It has all been done on 
     <lb/>a rising market.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> When the boot is on the other foot, it 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I think there is some mistake. I 
     <lb/>
     believe this price started in 1937 with the FPU 
     <lb/>
     and the fishermen in Bonavista Bay — that is 
     <lb/>
     where this finding out what we were going to get 
     <lb/>
     for the fish started. I think Mr. Brown had some<lb break="no"/>thing to do with it. I have some recollection of 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I do not think it was as far back as that. 
     <lb/>
     I hesitate to say whether you are right or not. If 
     <lb/>
     we had notice of such questions, we could look 
     <lb/>
     up the information. I think it happened during the 
     <lb/>
     war. I do not think there was any fixed price for 
     <lb/>
     fish in the spring of 1937 or 1938. Maybe Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ashboume could tell us something about it? 
     <lb/>
     
     
</p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I cannot remember at that time 
     <lb/>what the procedure was; but as far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I think we have to thank the people for 
     <lb/>the high prices of fish; those who put the money 
     <lb/>here in Newfoundland — the consumers, those 
     <lb/>are the people we have to thank — people who 
     <lb/>were prepared to open up credits in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and give us the money before the fish 
     <lb/>was shipped. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Who were these? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> The people who bought our 
     <lb/>
     fish. The price has been fixed in the past by the 
     <lb/>
     Combined Food Board, but that does not say that 
     <lb/>
     the people had to buy it; but they have been able 
     <lb/>
     to pay the high prices we got for fish this last few 
     <lb/>
     years. I saw in the paper two or three days ago a 
     <lb/>
     notice that codfish would not be under the Com<lb break="no"/>bined Food Board for 1947. As far as the 1946 
     <lb/>
     production is concerned, the Food Control Board 
     <lb/>
     would look after that; I believe within the near 
   

            <cb/>
          

     future probably there will be meetings of the 
     <lb/>
     various groups in Newfoundland in order to try 
     <lb/>
     and formulate a plan for the profitable marketing 
     <lb/>
     of the 1947 catch, and I trust that this will be done 
     <lb/>
     because in the past we realise it has been the 
     <lb/>
     means of stabilising the market. I hope the days 
     <lb/>
     of consigning codfish to Europe, Spain and Italy 
     <lb/>
     is over and we will be able to profitably sell our 
     <lb/>
     fish here and get the money in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     before it leaves our shores. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another matter mentioned by Mr. Newell, 
     <lb/>
     about the Newfoundland Fisheries Board inspec<lb break="no"/>tion — that this should be extended to fishing 
     <lb/>
     vessels and all premises where fish is handled. As 
     <lb/>
     far as I know the Board does not have to inspect 
     <lb/>
     any fishing vessels on the Labrador or on the 
     <lb/>
     Banks. The idea is that it might be advisable for 
     <lb/>
     some fishery inspector to examine these vessels 
     <lb/>
     before they go to the Banks and also see them 
     <lb/>
     when they come back; also Labrador fishing ves<lb break="no"/>sels. Codfish is an article of food for human 
     <lb/>
     consumption and the better the quality the higher 
     <lb/>
     the price we will get. And the more satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     from our buyers, naturally, will be when we give 
     <lb/>
     the best quality of fish. The government is to 
     <lb/>
     inspect the exporters' premises; whether this 
     <lb/>
     would extend to every fisherman's stage, I do not 
     <lb/>
     know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I cannot see that there is any 
     <lb/>
     credit due the Commission of Government any 
     <lb/>
     more than any other government which may have 
     <lb/>
     been in power. It was purely the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     brought about by the war when the supply was 
     <lb/>
     shorter than the demand. They could guarantee to 
     <lb/>
     take any production and could guarantee prices 
     <lb/>
     because it could not be possible to fill the demand 
     <lb/>
     required. But with Norway getting back and 
     <lb/>
     Iceland and Great Britain in the producing and 
     <lb/>
     exporting market — Great Britain was a com<lb break="no"/>petitor in Brazil, in Rio and other places — when 
     <lb/>
     they get back, the supply will be greater than the 
     <lb/>
     demand; and I cannot see any possibility of being 
     <lb/>
     able to continue the setting of prices except 
     <lb/>
     through an international trade agreement. If all 
     <lb/>
     countries can establish a price then perhaps the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen will know what they will get. Until that 
     <lb/>
     agreement is made, I do not see how they can 
     <lb/>
     continue knowing in the spring what they will get 
     <lb/>
     in the fall unless the supply is shorter than the 
     <lb/>
     demand.

     mittee, it is not my intention to keep you long. 
     <lb/>
     Referring to the Commission of Government get<lb break="no"/>ting the credit for the increase in price of fish, that 
     <lb/>
     may be all right; but this has been made possible 
     <lb/>
     by an export fee. Who pays that fee? Does it not 
     <lb/>
     come from the fishermen, to be given the Fishery 
     <lb/>
     Board or the Commission of Government to go 
     <lb/>
     to market and negotiate the price for fish? Taxes 
     <lb/>
     have been collected from fishermen by way of 
     <lb/>
     protection for the trade exporters. The fisherman 
     <lb/>
     has not been taken care of; Mr. Brown for a 
     <lb/>
     number of years was trying to get the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     and the exporters together. Last year there was a 
     <lb/>
     common understanding that a certain price would 
     <lb/>
     be paid; there was no agreement really made. I 
     <lb/>
     understand the fishermen on the average received 
     <lb/>
     about $13.50 a quintal. I am not at all satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with the price the fisherman has been getting. 
     <lb/>
     There is too big a gap between fisherman and 
     <lb/>
     exporter and that gap shall have to be bridged. If 
     <lb/>
     something is not done, in view of what we have 
     <lb/>
     seen happen a year ago, we may find the exporter 
     <lb/>
     becoming a millionaire too soon and the fisher<lb break="no"/>man becoming a beggar too quick. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> It is a fact that during the war 50 
     <lb/>
     cents was taken from all the fish exported from 
     <lb/>
     this country; that was for the price of salt. Take a 
     <lb/>
     hogshead of salt for every ten quintals of fish; the 
     <lb/>
     salt costs the fisherman $11 a hogshead, is that a 
     <lb/>
     fact? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I do not know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOWL2">Mr. Fowler</persName> I contend ten quintals to a hogshead 
     <lb/>
     is a conservative figure. The section of the report 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the salt codfish industry is, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, the most important section of the whole 
     <lb/>
     report, from the point of view of the number of 
     <lb/>
     men employed, which the report shows to be 
     <lb/>
     about 25,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Coming as I do from a district interested in 
     <lb/>
     practically every branch of the salt codfish in<lb break="no"/>dustry, I feel that there is not enough of the kind 
     <lb/>
     of information that the people are expecting from 
     <lb/>
     this report. There is an array of statistics, but these 
     <lb/>
     are published frequently in government bulletins 
     <lb/>
     and in the press and therefore cannot come as a 
     <lb/>
     surprise to many. Now, we have a Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Board, an institution of recent years, but the most 
     <lb/>
     the Committee says about it is that there <hi rendition="simple:italic">is</hi> a 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board and that, in their opinion, it is 
     <lb/>
     doing a good job. They do not tell us how they 
     <lb/>
     arrive at that conclusion. I would like to know the 


            <cb/>
       

     number of personnel of that Board, what it is 
     <lb/>
     costing, and who is bearing the burden of cost. 
     <lb/>
     Are we getting adequate returns for the money 
     <lb/>
     spent, and how? I would like to see set forth the 
     <lb/>
     ways the Board has helped, and plans to help, the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman, merchant and exporter. I understand 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Board is costing around $250,000 
     <lb/>
     annually and an expenditure of this magnitude 
     <lb/>
     warrants more comment and explanation than is 
     <lb/>
     given here. I contend we should be supplied with 
     <lb/>
     copies of the Salt Codfish Act in order to get some 
     <lb/>
     information on the working of the most important 
     <lb/>
     of our industries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the question of rebates on salt, 
     <lb/>
     as far as I understand it the rebate on salt applies 
     <lb/>
     to the man who has salt left over. If a man has 50 
     <lb/>
     hogsheads of salt left over he gets a rebate of 35 
     <lb/>
     cents a hogshead and the man who uses his salt 
     <lb/>
     gets no rebate. If the Fisheries Board had not 
     <lb/>
     entered the picture, what would the landed cost 
     <lb/>
     of salt be? Would it be $11 or $12? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think it would be much higher.

     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> While we are on this salt cod<lb break="no"/>fish business, I have been under the impression 
     <lb/>
     for years that there were branches of foreign

     concerns here, which get a percentage of some 
     <lb/>
     sort on fish going out of the country. Who bears 
     <lb/>
     the brunt of that?

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I have heard a lot of good things 
     <lb/>
     said about the Fisheries Board. in this report we 
     <lb/>
     should have outlined how it was set up. I believe 
     <lb/>
     it was set up under legislation which gave it 
     <lb/>
     power to control the export of fish. It is costing 
     <lb/>
     the country $225,000 a year; it employs 85 
     <lb/>
     people; they have trade representatives abroad; I 
     <lb/>
     presume that these trade representatives sell the 
     <lb/>
     fish and that there are no brokers employed 
     <lb/>
     anymore and these trade representatives in the 
     <lb/>
     various capitals of Europe — such as Portugal, 
     <lb/>
     Spain and Greece — sell the fish; or are the 
     <lb/>
     London brokers we used to have still in business 
     <lb/>
     and get commission on the sale of fish? if this 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board are such wonderful people (and 
     <lb/>
     I do not know anything against them), if they sell 
    

            <pb n="383" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0383.jpg"/>

     the fish, then outsiders should not be paid any 
     <lb/>
     commission. Their representatives abroad are 
     <lb/>
     paid. What are the duties of the Fisheries Board 
     <lb/>
     in the sale of fish? Are they controlling the export 
     <lb/>
     of fish or do they merely employ inspectors who 
     <lb/>
     go around and inspect the quality of fish to go to 
     <lb/>
     the various markets, or do they also sell? Are the 
     <lb/>
     fishery products sold through brokers abroad? 
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> As I understand it, the Fisheries Board 
     <lb/>have handed control over to the trade. The trade 
     <lb/>sets up the various groups and each group con<lb break="no"/>tacts the markets. They sell some through agents 
     <lb/>in various places — Trinidad, Pueno Rico and 
     <lb/>Spain — they go through very much the same 
     <lb/>channels as before, but the Fisheries Board could 
     <lb/>not sell that fish without these people on the spot; 
     <lb/>it would be chaos if they did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Therefore the Fisheries Board has 
     <lb/>nothing to do with the price of fish; they merely 
     <lb/>employ brokers, or allocate a certain amount to 
     <lb/>the Portuguese group or the West Indies group, 
     <lb/>etc.? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> No, they negotiate through these people 
     <lb/>abroad. Mr. Crosbie can tell us about Brazil; sales 
     <lb/>were made through Mr. Crosbie's agents and it

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> To arrange groups is not a very big

     <lb/>excellent job; and we will need it more in times

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not going to say anything 
     <lb/>
     about the Fisheries Board. A little bird whispered 
     <lb/>
     to me that an amount of money — $300,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year — is paid out here in St. John's to two men 
     <lb/>
     or two firms. The two firms are supposed to be 
     <lb/>
     the brokers representing the fish exported from 
     <lb/>
     this country — one handles all the fish going to 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the Atlantic. They get commis<lb break="no"/>sions which amount, in the case of one firm on 
     <lb/>
     Water Street, to $150,000 a year as brokerage. 
     <lb/>
     For doing what? In the last four or five years, 
     <lb/>
     since the Combined Food Board came into being, 
     <lb/>
     the United States, Canada and Great Britain have 
     <lb/>
     taken our whole output of codfish; they have not 
     <lb/>
     had much to do but to pass on the trade papers 
     <lb/>
     and see that the money is deposited in the bank. 
     <lb/>
     The Combined Food Board in Washington, 
     <lb/>
     where Mr. Gushue was a high official, says, "You 
     <lb/>
     can ship so much to Trinidad." The importer in 
     <lb/>
     Trinidad who buys the fish has to put the money 
     <lb/>
     in the bank in advance and this agent is supposed 
     <lb/>
     to see that he does. For that he collects $150,000 
     <lb/>
     a year and is doing it now. The other firm does 
     <lb/>
     the same thing for the fish over in Europe. It was 
     <lb/>
     not a little bird that told me that, it was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Salt Codfish Exporters Association who 
     <lb/>
     told me and he was feeling murderous about it. if 
     <lb/>
     I am driven too far, I will name the firm.... 
     <lb/>
     $150,000 a year, as the Americans say, is not hay. 
     <lb/>
     In the last four or five years no one had to work 
     <lb/>
     to sell fish; all you had to do was to get it.... I think 
     <lb/>
     perhaps that's what Major Cashin was trying to 
     <lb/>
     get at. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I don't think that Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     could name that man or his commission.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well Mr. Chairman, I won't 
     <lb/>
     name him, but it is a well-known fact ... that one 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     that he collects $150,000 hard cash for his ser<lb break="no"/>vices.

            </p>

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> From the trade. In other words, 
     <lb/>
     from the fishermen of this country. The trade 
     <lb/>
     pays him, but the trade gets it from the fishermen. 
     <lb/>
     Then another firm that handles all the fish to 
     <lb/>
     Spain, Portugal, ltaly, England, etc., they also 
     <lb/>
     collect roughly $150,000 cash a year.

     they can receive. I don't know, I am not in the

     would continue allowing it to exist unless they 
     <lb/>
     were getting service for it. One of the concerns 
     <lb/>
     to which our friend was referring is a concern that 
     <lb/>
     has a very large organisation through Spain, Italy, 
     <lb/>
     Greece and Portugal, and I have no doubt they 
     <lb/>
     have very heavy expenditures to keep up. That is

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is what I can't understand. We 
     <lb/>
     have the fishermen getting the fish and the small 
     <lb/>
     man in the outports collecting it, and sending it 
     <lb/>
     in to St. John's. Perhaps he is an exporter, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     not, but all the Codfish Board has to do is allocate 
     <lb/>
     it to the trade —I don't know whether the trade 
     <lb/>
     has anything to do with the Salt Codfish Board 
     <lb/>
     — and the trade has to sell it. Now we find they 
     <lb/>
     don't sell it at all, but some commission agent 
     <lb/>
     here in St. John's who gets $150,000, is that 
     <lb/>
     right? I am not trying to decry the work which the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board has done, but we have to remem<lb break="no"/>ber that they did an excellent job from 1939 up 
     <lb/>
     to the present time when they were selling the 
     <lb/>
     goods and dealing with a rising market, the same 
     <lb/>
     as the Commission of Government during that 
     <lb/>
     period. I think everybody did an excellent job 
     <lb/>
     during that period, because we were winning 
     <lb/>
     hands down. Don't let anybody live in a fool's 
     <lb/>
     paradise. What we must not do is praise up the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board too much or they might think 
     <lb/>
     they are little gods, and sit tight. If they were good 
     <lb/>
     during the war years I feel sure they will be good 
     <lb/>
     during the years to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One thing I would like to refer to is the statis<lb break="no"/>tics which the Committee has given us with 
     <lb/>
     regard to inshore, Labrador Stationers, Labrador 
     <lb/>
     floaters, and deep sea fishing. The average num<lb break="no"/>ber of quintals caught by inshore fishermen was 
     <lb/>
     32 last year, stationers 30 quintals, floaters 61 
     <lb/>
     (these are the men who went down to Labrador 
     <lb/>
     in their own vessels); then we have the deep sea 
     <lb/>
     fishing (referring to bankers on the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast), 122 quintals. If we are going to improve 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries, you have to get each man producing 
     <lb/>
     more fish. If you look at these figures you will 
     <lb/>
     find that you have to make it possible for the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen to get further away from their own 
     <lb/>
     stageheads. They must have ships to enable them 
     <lb/>
     to get further away and get back safely. The 
     

            <cb/>
            

     government of the day, whatever it is, has to see 
     <lb/>
     that each fisherman gets as much fish as it is 
     <lb/>
     humanly possible for him to catch. It is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     useless for us to depend to any large extent on the 
     <lb/>
     inshore fishery. These figures have proved it, that 
     <lb/>
     your banking fleet always got more fish per man, 
     <lb/>
     and thereby made a much better living. I say they 
     <lb/>
     did not make as good a living as they should for 
     <lb/>
     the amount of fish they caught. I don't know who 
     <lb/>
     is to blame, Spain, Portugal, or the St. John's 
     <lb/>
     merchants or whoever, but we must get ready for 
     <lb/>
     that future which is bound to come. You are not 
     <lb/>
     going to be selling fish on a rising market all the 
     <lb/>
     time. We will have at least a short period like we 
     <lb/>
     had after the last war. There is no reason why we 
     <lb/>
     can't, and it is our duty to try to plan to offset that 
     <lb/>
     depression as much as it is humanly possible for 
     <lb/>
     us to do.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are certain recommendations by the 
     <lb/>
     post-war planning committee of the Fisheries 
     <lb/>
     Board. But what are they doing to implement 
     <lb/>
     them? They have a very nice plan laid down for 
     <lb/>
     our committee going to London, about paying 
     <lb/>
     tariffs, but what are they doing about it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> In the middle of page 10 there is a 
     <lb/>
     little statement which I think expresses a whole 
     <lb/>
     lot: "We suggest that consideration be given to 
     <lb/>
     the idea that the codfishery be placed on a cash 
     <lb/>
     basis." The implications of that statement are 
     <lb/>
     very wide indeed. They have their roots right in 
     <lb/>
     the very question that we have here — whether 
     <lb/>
     or not the people of this country can be self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting. I notice they don't suggest to the Nation<lb break="no"/>al Convention how this desirable situation can he 
     <lb/>
     brought about. I don't blame them for not at<lb break="no"/>tempting to answer that, because it is going to be 
     <lb/>
     something of a headache. You can't just snap 
     <lb/>
     your fingers and have it done. I have certain ideas 
     <lb/>
     on the subject myself, which I do not propose to 
     <lb/>
     go into now because they have nothing to do with 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Report, but it seems to me that we 
     <lb/>
     have sometime or other to try to make a picture 
     <lb/>
     in our minds of a Newfoundland which will pro<lb break="no"/>vide a decent standard of living for its people, and 
     <lb/>
     as far as fishermen are concerned this question of 
     <lb/>
     putting our codfishery on a cash basis is very 
     <lb/>
     important from a great many angles. From the 
     <lb/>
     angle ofeconomy, which is enough at the present 
     <lb/>
     time, let us consider what happens when the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman gets credit. I take it most of our salt 
     <lb/>
     codfishery is carried on on a credit basis. As a 
  

            <pb n="385" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0385.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">385</fw>
          

     matter of fact, when the people from my district 
     <lb/>
     read that the Convention is considering putting 
     <lb/>
     the codfishery on a cash basis they will probably 
     <lb/>
     lose all confidence in the Convention from then 
     <lb/>
     on, for the idea of putting it on a cash basis is 
     <lb/>
     blasphemy to them. Let us think of the economy 
     <lb/>
     that would be affected if it were possible to put 
     <lb/>
     the codfishery on a cash basis. Let us say that an 
     <lb/>
     important wholesaler needs credit, I presume he 
     <lb/>
     goes to the bank and gets credit. Presumably he 
     <lb/>
     pays whatever the bank's usual charges are, and 
     <lb/>
     these naturally are tacked on to the cost of his 
     <lb/>
     goods. Now that wholesale merchant has to deal 
     <lb/>
     with a smaller retail merchant somewhere in the 
     <lb/>
     outport, and he has to give this particular man not 
     <lb/>
     only six to ten months credit (because very few 
     <lb/>
     of them are in a position to buy for cash), but in 
     <lb/>
     addition to waiting for payment for his goods he 
     <lb/>
     has to undertake considerable risk as to whether 
     <lb/>
     he will get paid for it or not, therefore the cost of 
     <lb/>
     credit under such circumstances is fairly high. In 
     <lb/>
     turn the smaller businessman, who has secured 
     <lb/>
     credit from the wholesale merchant, lets out these 
     <lb/>
     same goods to your average fisherman, again on 
     <lb/>
     possibly six months credit, and again taking con<lb break="no"/>siderable risk as to whether he shall within six 
     <lb/>
     months or ever be paid for these goods. All these 
     <lb/>
     credit charges have to be tacked on to the cost of 
     <lb/>
     the goods, and must therefore be reckoned when 
     <lb/>
     we are considering the cost of production of salt 
     <lb/>
     codfish, because the cost of living of the in<lb break="no"/>dividual in the primary enterprise must be reck<lb break="no"/>oned in the cost of production. Now if we 
     <lb/>
     consider what all that means to our economy, and 
     <lb/>
     what a difference between prosperity and the 
     <lb/>
     opposite for a great many people in the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry this means, we begin to see just how 
     <lb/>
     important this sentence is: "We suggest that con<lb break="no"/>sideration be given to the idea that the codfishery 
     <lb/>
     be placed on a cash basis". That's a very impor<lb break="no"/>tant point, and I would hate to see it passed over 
     <lb/>
     without due consideration. As I say, the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee did not have the temerity to suggest how it 
     <lb/>
     should be done. It is a pretty tough problem, one 
     <lb/>
     of the main problems of our fishing industry, that 
     <lb/>
     is our codfishery. A great many abuses that exist 
     <lb/>
     today from every side are tied up with the same 
     <lb/>
     thing. A little while ago we were discussing the 
     <lb/>
     supervision of codfish that's going to be ex<lb break="no"/>ported, because if we are going to stay in the 
     <lb/>
     markets we have to have a good quality, and look, 
   

            <cb/>
            

     if a fisherman comes to me, an outpon merchant, 
     <lb/>
     and gets a supply for the fishery and pays for it in 
     <lb/>
     cash, it's no business of mine what kind of cod<lb break="no"/>fish he produces, or whether he produces any or 
     <lb/>
     not —but it's definitely his business He has paid 
     <lb/>
     his account in cash and is depending on the sale 
     <lb/>
     of his codfish to provide himself with a living 
     <lb/>
     through the ensuing months when the fishery is 
     <lb/>
     over. It is to his best interests to produce the best 
     <lb/>
     quality — otherwise he will not dispose of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have never been in the salt codfish business, 
     <lb/>
     but I know a good many who are, and many of 
     <lb/>
     them have reiterated that if a man comes along 
     <lb/>
     who has a credit account of $2-300 and has 60 or 
     <lb/>
     70 quintals of fish to dispose of, and he has the 
     <lb/>
     codfish which is in place of cash, the natural 
     <lb/>
     feeling is to say, "I am sorry I can't take that fish 
     <lb/>
     at the price you want for it." Usually he has been 
     <lb/>
     fortunate enough to get the money for it some<lb break="no"/>where else, and the other man has to whistle for 
     <lb/>
     it. Personally I hate the sound of the words "credit 
     <lb/>
     system", and I think whether or not we can put 
     <lb/>
     our codfishery on a cash basis in the coming years 
     <lb/>
     will determine whether or not the codfishery can 
     <lb/>
     become a paying proposition I congratulate the 
     <lb/>
     Committee on bringing this to the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> The fresh codfish business <hi rendition="simple:italic">has</hi> been on 
     <lb/>
     a cash basis, and one of the things the Committee 
     <lb/>
     had in mind was the possibility that the purchase 
     <lb/>
     of codfish might eventually be made for cash, 
     <lb/>
     which would mean that the plants, or the oper<lb break="no"/>ators, would have to make arrangements for 
     <lb/>
     curing the fish, and then the question arose as to 
     <lb/>
     how much more is it going to cost to cure fish in 
     <lb/>
     that way than when a fisherman cures it himself. 
     <lb/>
     That's a question which requires very careful 
     <lb/>
     consideration, but that would be the ideal sort of 
     <lb/>
     arrangement. It is made a little more encouraging 
     <lb/>
     now by the fact that if you can bring the fish into 
     <lb/>
     one locality you will largely increase the value of 
     <lb/>
     your by-products, especially the offal for fish<lb break="no"/>meal. That's one of the things the Committee had 
     <lb/>
     in mind. It is a very difficult matter, and one that 
     <lb/>
     has to be enquired into. It is easy to put it on paper, 
     <lb/>
     but not so easy to carry it through. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> With regard to the cost, I know one 
     <lb/>
     group who went into this, and it was their es<lb break="no"/>timate that in a great many instances practically 
     <lb/>
     30% to 35% of the cost of consumer goods which 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen used could be charged to credit 
    

            <pb n="386" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0386.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">386</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw>
           

     before it passed to the consumer; a markup on the 
     <lb/>
     original cost of say 25%, and with the cost of 
     <lb/>
     handling, etc,, added on, the percentage of selling 
     <lb/>
     price could not be decided with any degree of 
     <lb/>
     accuracy. But the markup on the cost could be 
     <lb/>
     arrived at with a fair degree of accuracy and 
     <lb/>
     would work out at 25% or over. 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> There is another point too that 
     <lb/>should not be overlooked, that is the stimulus 
     <lb/>that's given to the fisherman as he gets up in the 
     <lb/>morning and goes out realising that for his day's 
     <lb/>catch of codfish, before the evening sun sets, he 
     <lb/>will have the money in his pocket. That's a very 
     <lb/>important thing, and I am rather of the opinion 
     <lb/>that the great production of fresh and frozen fish 
     <lb/>that's been made in Newfoundland the past few 
     <lb/>years has been practically the result of the fact 
     <lb/>that cash has been paid for fresh fish.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Many delegates are going out for a 
     <lb/>rest and it almost looks as if we are getting tired 
     <lb/>of this informative debate and that it ought to be 
     <lb/>soon ended in order to move on to another sec<lb break="no"/>tion. Before we do, I would like to say that to me 
     <lb/>the Fishery Board as constituted today is one of 
     <lb/>the bright sides in the marketing and control of 
     <lb/>the fishery products of Newfoundland. The per<lb break="no"/>sonnel are doing a fine job, and one of the persons 
     <lb/>who had perhaps a great deal to do initially with 
     <lb/>that great undertaking is Mr. Brown. I am sorry 
     <lb/>he is unable to see the job through, at least in the 
     <lb/>House. The fishermen over across our way are 
     <lb/>very pleased and satisfied that things are going 
     <lb/>so well. I congratulate the members of the Fishery 
     <lb/>Committee who so far are giving us a fine report 
     <lb/>and doing a good job.

            <p><persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Before the Convention passes on 
     <lb/>to another section I have some information which

            <p>This guaranteed system was discontinued in

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In 1938-39 the government 
     <lb/>guaranteed the merchants a certain export price 
     <lb/>on small Madeira and Brazil, and on Labrador 
     <lb/>fish. It is a remarkable fact that for that very year 
     <lb/>the total value of codfish exported from New<lb break="no"/>foundland was only $4,190,000, which was less 
     <lb/>than the year before that, when the catch was 
     <lb/>bigger. That's an average of only roughly $4 per 
     <lb/>quintal.... Now in the following year, that would 
     <lb/>be 1940, they guaranteed all did they? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> So the exporters are naturally 
     <lb/>paying a bit firmer price to the fishermen, but in 
     <lb/>that year the catch was 1,208,000 quintals, and 
     <lb/>the value was up to $6.5 million. I can't make that 
     <lb/>up in my mind just now, but it's a bit more; but 
     <lb/>1940 was surely the first year of the great world 
     <lb/>up-swing of prices. The war broke out in 1939, 
     <lb/>but we did at least sell the fish in spite of the 
     <lb/>exchange trouble. What was the position in 
     <lb/>1941? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Apparently the guarantee system

     <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> I do not know what the point of the 
     <lb/>
     discussion is at the moment. It does seem to me 
     <lb/>
     that the action of the Fisheries Board or the 
     <lb/>
     govemmentin guaranteeing a certain price would 
     <lb/>
     tend to set a minimum price to the fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     where if a guarantee is not made, it might well be 
     <lb/>
     less. That is what I gather from this discussion. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It might be more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> It has been proven it could be more. 
     <lb/>
     Take the case of herring — we had an experience 
     <lb/>
     last year, when we could have gotten $2 a barrel 
     <lb/>
     more for the herring had it not been for the action 
     <lb/>
     of the Board. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The report is a well-worded document; long 
     <lb/>
     enough to digest and plain enough for the average 
     <lb/>
     man to understand. Mr. Hollett touched on an 
     <lb/>
     important matter just now, that there should be 
     <lb/>
     more small boats, 15-25 ton boats. I am in accord 
     <lb/>
     with that. I am disappointed as a member of the 
     <lb/>
     Public Health and Welfare Committee over the 
     <lb/>
     little consideration given through the civil re-es<lb break="no"/>tablishment department to the fishermen. We all 
     <lb/>
     know that the fishermen received amounts vary<lb break="no"/>ing from $100 to the top man getting $700. In 
     <lb/>
     View of the fact that the present government is 
     <lb/>
     handing out in the vicinity of over $8 million to 
     <lb/>
     rehabilitate the men from World War II, under 
     <lb/>
     various headings such as back pay, gratuities, 
     <lb/>
     land settlement, university courses and various 
     <lb/>
     other brackets, in a country where the fishery is 
     <lb/>
     still the leading industry, it has received by far the 
     <lb/>
     lesser amount. I cannot find words strong enough 
     <lb/>
     to condemn those responsible for creating such a 
     <lb/>
     scheme. I am not satisfied that this country has 
     <lb/>
     spent or is spending sufficient to modernise the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries. We know there is plenty of room for 
     <lb/>
     more cold storages. I would like to know from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Job whether these 15 quick-freezing plants 
     <lb/>
     are owned by private companies or if the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has any interest in them? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> As far as I know, it is entirely private 
     <lb/>
     enterprise. I do not think the government had any 


            <cb/>
           

     interest as shareholders. They did make certain 
     <lb/>
     advances at one time, comparatively small 
     <lb/>
     amounts. In that connection, Mr. P.H. Dunn in<lb break="no"/>troduced the act whereby loans could be made, 
     <lb/>
     but very little advantage was taken of it. The 
     <lb/>
     loans were not wanted. I think that is one of the 
     <lb/>
     sad features about it — that $4 million was voted 
     <lb/>
     for that purpose and none was used. It was ear<lb break="no"/>marked for loans and people did not want loans. 
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They would rather sell the 
     <lb/>shares? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> They did sell shares and they put in 
     <lb/>their own money. The end of it was that the loans 
     <lb/>were not required. At least part of the trade 
     <lb/>thought it should be earmarked for certain things 
     <lb/>like the development of cold storage. It was simp<lb break="no"/>ly cancelled. It was reduced to something like 
     <lb/>$500,000 and I think it is still available. The 
     <lb/>trouble is, under the act, the government takes no 
     <lb/>risk. The government simply says, "We will vote 
     <lb/>$4 million, anyone who wants a loan may get it 
     <lb/>under certain terms — safe terms to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment." The government should take part of the 
     <lb/>risk. I think there is a great deal to be said for the 
     <lb/>reason they give, they want to safeguard the 
     <lb/>public funds and not make loans without proper 
     <lb/>security, but it does not help the trade. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How would bank credit and 
     <lb/>government credit compare as to the easiness of 
     <lb/>getting loans and time of repayment? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> About the same, I think. We could not 
     <lb/>see any advantage. The interest was perhaps a 
     <lb/>little lower in the case of the government. There 
     <lb/>was no term given. They were extremely par<lb break="no"/>ticular about the matter of titles. There was so 
     <lb/>much exactitude that the people would not be 
     <lb/>bothered; they would rather go to the bank and 
     <lb/>get a loan; if their credit was good, they could get 
     <lb/>it. If you have to mortgage your plant, you do not 
     <lb/>like doing it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> It does not make good reading when 
     <lb/>we have the figure of $l.8 million to be spent on 
     <lb/>300 men for land settlement, and then look at the 
     <lb/>figures given here for I938-l939 of the amount 
     <lb/>of money earned by the fishermen, We are head<lb break="no"/>ing in the wrong direction. I do not think the 
     <lb/>people responsible for this knew anything about 
     <lb/>the fishery other than the experience gained in 
     <lb/>catching a few salmon on the rivers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wonder if the Committee paid sufficient 
     <lb/>
     attention to the smoked fish business. We know 
   

            <pb n="388" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0388.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">388</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> 
<fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw>
           

     that all over Newfoundland there is a consider<lb break="no"/>able amount of smoked fish used for local con<lb break="no"/>sumption. I know the export figures are not very 
     <lb/>
     large. There are quite a number of smokehouses 
     <lb/>
     situated all over this country. These smokehouses 
     <lb/>
     turn out kippers, fillets, salmon, caplin and 
     <lb/>
     various other qualities of fish, being consumed 
     <lb/>
     by the local market largely. 
            </p>

<p>
    <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Are they of sufficiently good 
     <lb/>quality to be exported? </p>


<p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Yes, I have exported them myself as 
     <lb/>much as 25 years ago. There is a market for 
     <lb/>them.... I feel the Committee has done a good job 
     <lb/>and we want to get on with it, but I also feel very 
     <lb/>strongly about this matter of putting the fisher<lb break="no"/>man off with such a small allocation, some as low 
     <lb/>as $100 and $500 each — the top men get $700 
     <lb/>each. Then they turn around and give men who 
     <lb/>want to start farming — very often men who 
     <lb/>know nothing about it — $6,000 to $7,000. I will 
     <lb/>say, as I said before, that time will prove that the 
     <lb/>$6,000 will be more like $10,000. If they had 
     <lb/>given those poor fishermen one of these little 
     <lb/>boats, these fishermen, after they were dis<lb break="no"/>charged, if given that $1,000, plus the bounty, 
     <lb/>could have built their boats and owned them. It 
     <lb/>would have been an asset to the country. I know 
     <lb/>what these men from Bonavista and Trinity are 
     <lb/>up against, they have to go offshore to get their 
     <lb/>fish. I am firmly convinced that if the government 
     <lb/>had spent half that money to rehabilitate the 
     <lb/>fishermen and created a job somewhere else for 
     <lb/>the others, the money would have been spent in 
     <lb/>a better way. I would like to see more cold 
     <lb/>storages and more bait depots all over the 
     <lb/>country. The fishing industry is still the backbone 
     <lb/>of this country. I have been around South 
     <lb/>America, Jamaica and Cuba; there are very few 
     <lb/>cold storages there, they are like ourselves. The 
     <lb/>fresh fish industry is only in its infancy. We have 
     <lb/>not enough sharp-freezing facilities to take care 
     <lb/>of all the fresh fish. I was a firm believer in the 
     <lb/>Fisheries Board, but like all other departments of 
     <lb/>government it has gotten out of control; it is 
     <lb/>costing more than it should for the service 
     <lb/>rendered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:VINC1">Mr. Vincent</persName> For the first hour I thought the 
     <lb/>Fisheries Board was the white-haired boy to the 
     <lb/>fishing industry but some of our associates do not 
     <lb/>seem to think so. I think that Mr. Gushue has done 
     <lb/>a good job. There are a few things to which I 
  
            <cb/>
       

     would call your attention. Appendix B, page 7, 
     <lb/>
     last paragraph: "The matter of inspection is most 
     <lb/>
     essential to insure that high standard of quality." 
     <lb/>
     Did your Committee investigate the culling of the 
     <lb/>
     different grades of saltfish? Is there a specific 
     <lb/>
     yardstick of grading used in Trinity Bay and 
     <lb/>
     another in Bonavista Bay? Or do they all conform 
     <lb/>
     to one hard and fast rule? That is important. I have 
     <lb/>
     an interest in the Labrador salt codfishery. In 
     <lb/>
     1946 a schooner in which I had a large interest 
     <lb/>
     discharged her cargo at a certain firm at St. 
     <lb/>
     John's. I left this Convention chamber one eve<lb break="no"/>ning and went down to the schooner. It was 
     <lb/>
     raining hard. One of my friends across the way 
     <lb/>
     took me down in his car and he remarked it would 
     <lb/>
     be a poor day for handling, inspecting or culling 
     <lb/>
     fish. Arriving at the pier, what do 1 find? 15 or 20 
     <lb/>
     men on the wharf opening barrels and packing 
     <lb/>
     fish. When I went on board I said to the captain, 
     <lb/>
     "It is not a good day for handling fish, is it?" He 
     <lb/>
     said, "Do not say anything, this is coming out 
     <lb/>
     No.1 Labrador — top grade." That is a very 
     <lb/>
     essential article of food and 1 am not going to 
     <lb/>
     stand for the fishermen being blamed for some of 
     <lb/>
     the curing. I was told that one of the inspectors of 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Board was on the wharf that day. 
     <lb/>
     That does not tend to create a good market for our 
     <lb/>
     staple product. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Further to Appendix B, page 11. Here I would 
     <lb/>
     make the accusation that a too trenchant pen, 
     <lb/>
     mayhap, makes the worthy scribe responsible for 
     <lb/>
     the generalities. I am conversant with the inshore 
     <lb/>
     fishery, and I cannot conceive how a fisherman 
     <lb/>
     with his crew of four or five men can carry out to 
     <lb/>
     a trap berth half a load of ice, haul his codtrap, 
     <lb/>
     and bring in, say, ten or 12 quintals of codfish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On page 9 of Appendix B, I find something 
     <lb/>
     rather amusing. I refer to the elderly men 
     <lb/>
     prosecuting the inshore fishery — "Quite a num<lb break="no"/>ber of inshore fishermen are elderly people." This 
     <lb/>
     certainly does not apply to districts of the North. 
     <lb/>
     In Bonavista Bay the prime young men are the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, who consider their calling an 
     <lb/>
     honoured one, and are making a success of it. 
     <lb/>
     
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Your reference to ice — I would like to 
     <lb/>make one remark about that. We had a discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and I must say we were all strongly in favour 
     <lb/>of that, because I have often seen fish coming into 
     <lb/>St. John's, fishermen waiting before they can get 
     <lb/>a chance of landing their fish, and that fish in hot 
     <lb/>weather soon deteriorates. There is no suggestion 
   

            <pb n="389" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0389.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">389</fw>
          

     that they carry a load of ice. But they could take 
     <lb/>
     a certain amount of ice out in hot weather. There 
     <lb/>
     ought to be some way of keeping the fish cool and 
     <lb/>
     not have it exposed to the heat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I have not been a fisherman, but I 
     <lb/>
     know you cannot have ice aboard a trap skiff. 
     <lb/>
     However, I understand the Bank fishermen carry 
     <lb/>
     out ice. In this connection, I think the boats 
     <lb/>
     should have equipment to bleed the fish and make 
     <lb/>
     it in a good state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RYAN4">Mr. Ryan</persName> How does the Committee suggest the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen keep ice over from the previous 
     <lb/>
     winter? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I know there are cases of fishermen 
     <lb/>
     who have erected small ice-houses, and they 
     <lb/>
     secured some sawdust to cover the ice and thus 
     <lb/>
     are able to get it during the summer time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> It is a matter of co-operation and I 
     <lb/>
     expect the co-operatives will fix all that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I would like to ask Mr. Job, does 
     <lb/>
     he know whether the Icelandic or Norwegian

     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I saw an article in the paper where

     the Icelandic government had put up an amount

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That was to assist the building, not to 
     <lb/>
     subsidise. It was used to assist in the promotion

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Page 10 of Appendix B: "The 
     <lb/>
     whole problem of the fisheries is quite complex 
     <lb/>
     and is linked up ultimately with the matter of 
     <lb/>
     subsidies which our competitors have used and 
     <lb/>
     are using to bolster their own production of fish. 
     <lb/>
     This matter always will have to be borne in mind, 
     <lb/>
     as it has a most important bearing on the ability 
     <lb/>
     of one producer to compete for any particular

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I said I was not quite sure. My impres<lb break="no"/>sion is they are not using it at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     These matters will be matters of discussion at the

     remarks of Mr. Newell and of Mr. Ashboume 
     <lb/>
     regarding getting salt codfish on a cash basis. 
     <lb/>
     That is important. It gives fishermen a great in<lb break="no"/>centive when they can get cash instead of waiting 
     <lb/>
     months and months before they can get returns. I 
     <lb/>
     also agree with Mr. Fudge. I am afraid there is 
     <lb/>
     too big a spread between what the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     receive and what the exporters obtain. That is a 
     <lb/>
     question to be gone into thoroughly.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Might I ask Mr. Job if it is not a fact 
     <lb/>
     now that fishermen on bankers are paid on a cash 
     <lb/>
     basis when they come in with a load of fish? They 
     <lb/>
     are not like your fresh fish men that catch the fish 
     <lb/>
     and deposit it on your wharf and get paid for it, 
     <lb/>
     they are fishermen who are co-operative in a 
     <lb/>
     sense. They make fish on a certain share, and I 
     <lb/>
     did understand that when they come in, although 
     <lb/>
     they cannot get all settled up. they can get an 
     <lb/>
     amount reasonably equal to what their share will 
     <lb/>
     come to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I don't know. I know that any fish 
     <lb/>
     landed by the bankers at the fishery premises is 
     <lb/>
     paid for in cash. What the owner does with the 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What particular branch of the salt 
     <lb/>
     codfishery were you trying to get on a cash basis? 
     <lb/>
     Take the shore fisherman. He goes out in his dory 
     <lb/>
     and he brings in his fish and puts it in his own 
     <lb/>
     stage and salts it and washes it, but when he takes 
     <lb/>
     it to his merchant he gets cash for it if he wants 
     <lb/>
     it. There is an act to that effect. What branch is 
     <lb/>
     not on a cash basis? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What branch is on it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I am asking Mr. Job. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You mean if a fisherman salts his own 
     <lb/>
     fish? I think the fisherman should bring his fish 
     <lb/>
     in and sell it as it is, and receive cash for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> But you are talking about the salt 
     <lb/>
     codfishery. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> But even with sailfish the shareman 
     <lb/>
     sells his fish when it is cured. I don't think the 
     <lb/>
     idea was that the fisherman who cures his own 
     <lb/>
     fish should necessarily sell that for cash. I don't 
     <lb/>
     know, but he has generally received some credit 
     <lb/>
     and has to pay for that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> What you mean is that our fishery 
     <lb/>
     should be re-organised to this extent, that all 
     <lb/>
     fishermen should bring in their fish and sell it to 
     <lb/>
     some central market. Well, naturally he would 
     <lb/>
     get cash then. But what particular branch of the 
     <lb/>
     salt codfishery are you referring to there when 
   

            <pb n="390" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-03-25_Page_0390.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">390</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">March 1947</fw>
         

     you say: "We suggest that [it] be placed on a cash 
     <lb/>
     basis?" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I think what was in the minds of the 
     <lb/>
     Committee was central curing stations, where the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen would bring their fish and it would be 
     <lb/>
     salted by someone; an expansion of the cold 
     <lb/>
     storage plants might take care of that. It might be 
     <lb/>
     a curing place for saltfish. I don't know how far 
     <lb/>
     you can carry that, you might have difficulty, but 
     <lb/>
     it would be a great help. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RYAN4">Mr. Ryan</persName> I wonder if Mr. Job would tell us if 
     <lb/>
     they had any success with artificial dryers here? 
     <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> We have had success with them for the 
     <lb/>past 40 years. We have been using them all the 
     <lb/>time. You can go over to our Southside premises 
     <lb/>and see them. Up to the present we have not been 
     <lb/>able to make as good an article of an artificially 
     <lb/>dried fish as you can of a carefully sun—dried fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:RYAN4">Mr. Ryan</persName> The fishermen won't get so well 
     <lb/>paid? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You would save a lot of your West 
     <lb/>
     India fish. I am afraid it is not practical to cure all 
     <lb/>
     fish by artificial drying, because there is no fish 
     <lb/>
     that can be cured as well as the shore fish, which 
     <lb/>
     is sun-dried. I don't think it has ever been done. 
     <lb/>
     We are the only people in the world that are 
     <lb/>
     attempting to make that very fine light-salted, 
     <lb/>
     sun-cured fish. The Norwegian and Iceland fish 
     <lb/>
     is not by any means in the same class as our fine, 
     <lb/>
     merchantable, light- salted cod. It has got a salty 
     <lb/>
     appearance, and the salt comes up on the face of 
     <lb/>
     it. It is preferred in some markets, but no one has 
     <lb/>
     been able to beat our sun-dried fish when it is 
     <lb/>
     properly cured. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RYAN4">Mr. Ryan</persName> But still you recommend the in<lb break="no"/>dividual fisherman not drying his own fish, but 
     <lb/>
     selling it to be dried artificially? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Well, it would give the fisherman his 
     <lb/>
     cash and the ability to go and catch more fish, 
     <lb/>
     especially with those 25 foot boats. I think that's 
     <lb/>
     a very important suggestion, and the government 
     <lb/>
     can help them buy these boats. We are building 
     <lb/>
     some of these boats ourselves, and are going to 
     <lb/>
     put them into trial this year, but there is a good 
     <lb/>
     deal to be done, and I was going to suggest in the 
     <lb/>
     report that the government might build a few of 
     <lb/>
     these boats for each bay, and test them out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I wonder if Mr. Job has read 
     <lb/>
     anything about the new method of artificial 
     <lb/>
     drying?.... It is a sort of tunnel, or cylinder, and a 
     <lb/>
     blast of hot air goes in and dehydrates it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> You will see that at our Southside 
     <lb/>
     premises, we have been using it for five or ten 
     <lb/>
     years.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Job touched on a point a 
     <lb/>
     moment ago about this light-salted fish. We 
     <lb/>
     would not be here today but for the fact of that 
     <lb/>
     light-cured fish. The shortage and high cost of 
     <lb/>
     salt in England compared with the plentiful supp<lb break="no"/>ly and low cost of salt in Spain, Portugal and Italy 
     <lb/>
     350 years ago, that enabled the latter to start a 
     <lb/>
     vessel fishery. They could catch their fish, salt it 
     <lb/>
     on the Banks and bring it home. The English had 
     <lb/>
     to light salt it, and that's why they settled in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in the first place. That's why our 
     <lb/>
     light-salted cure is so famous and unique. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am going to ask Mr. Job this: suppose you 
     <lb/>
     had your choice of having all fish brought by the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen to central curing stations, whether to 
     <lb/>
     be frozen or salt cured, and no fisherman making 
     <lb/>
     his own fish at all, or to go on as we are, where 
     <lb/>
     each fisherman makes his own fish, what does 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Job think would be the best of these two 
     <lb/>
     methods? I think that theoretically the former 
     <lb/>
     would be the better — fishermen merely to be 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, devoting their time almost entirely to 
     <lb/>
     catching. But has Mr. Job considered this side of 
     <lb/>
     it — in normal times when the price is normal, if 
     <lb/>
     a fisherman makes his own fish he is in a sense 
     <lb/>
     getting paid for his own labour and the labour of 
     <lb/>
     his own family for making that fish. That's a very 
     <lb/>
     important point when prices are low. When 
     <lb/>
     prices are high, sell the fish round if you like, but 
     <lb/>
     if the price is down would the merchant taking 
     <lb/>
     that fish and curing it himself pay the fisherman 
     <lb/>
     enough to live on, or might he not be forced to 
     <lb/>
     get the few cents extra by making the fish him<lb break="no"/>self? If he is not making fish time is on his hands. 
     <lb/>
     If the price is low, you try to get fishermen to sell 
     <lb/>
     fish round when he can get more by making the 
     <lb/>
     fish! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That's a question that would have to be 
     <lb/>
     very carefully gone into. No one can tell how that 
     <lb/>
     would turn out. It might prove to be too costly to 
     <lb/>
     cure it. It is being tried to some extent now. There 
     <lb/>
     are plants in the country now that buy the fish and 
     <lb/>
     dry it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Moores, Crosbie, Monroe, etc.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> But as to the experiment of buying it 
     <lb/>fresh and making it altogether in one place, there 
     <lb/>are a lot of things to be considered. The thing is 
     <lb/>that if it could be done you would get the offal. It

     would cost the manufacturer extra to make it 
     <lb/>
     above what the fisherman would do it for.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> But you would have a better cure.

            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> A more regular cure.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> First when we started we could not

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Might I ask Mr. Job if the

     quality of artificially dried fish is as good as fish

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> For certain markets it is. It makes a very 
     <lb/>
     good Madeira fish, but you don't get the light- 
     <lb break="yes"/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I would ask Mr. Job to turn to 
     <lb/>
     page 11 of the Appendix, where your Committee 
     <lb/>
     "see the need of additional staff to investigate 
     <lb/>
     scientifically our fisheries". I was wondering if 
     <lb/>
     you could give us a little detail on that. Has the 
     <lb/>
     Committee gone into the cost, or how many 
     <lb/>
     would be required, or what scientific investiga<lb break="no"/>tion would have to be made over and above what 
     <lb/>
     they are doing today?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> The Committee goes on to say that 
     <lb/>
     a proportion of public money should be spent on 
     <lb/>
     research, and some on the herring industry, but 
     <lb/>
     the Committee did not go into it in any detail. The

     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> On page 3 of Appendix C, talking 
     <lb/>
     about research, it says "Unfortunately in our 
     <lb/>
     country, our government has not had the vision 
    

            <cb/>
           

     or courage to spend large sums of money in 
     <lb/>
     research work on our fisheries." I understood that 
     <lb/>
     some time last year there was some arrangement 
     <lb/>
     made with the Canadian government — I was 
     <lb/>
     wondering if the chairman would clear that up? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> That is correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Two years ago our government 
     <lb/>
     agreed with the Canadian government to make a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of research in the Gulf and around 
     <lb/>
     Canadian shores; but it was not until last fall that 
     <lb/>
     the boats were completed; our government sub<lb break="no"/>scribed $12,000 towards that research. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> How far would $12,000 go?

     Would it get them outside the heads?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I do not know what the Canadians 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yearly?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Yes. My experience in operating 
     <lb/>
     research boats is that $12,000 will last about four 
     <lb/>
     months. When we got the boats we were short of 
     <lb/>
     web to make the seine. I asked a fellow in Van<lb break="no"/>couver to let me have the loan of a seine. I found 
     <lb/>
     I could not get it out of Canada. I asked the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner about sending someone to Canada 
     <lb/>
     to get some more web. He asked me if I knew that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was a small place and did I not 
     <lb/>
     realise there was a shortage of twine. Through 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Gushue, who had met some people in Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa, we got the loan of a seine for which we have 
     <lb/>
     not been charged a penny.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> As far as the $12,000 is con<lb break="no"/>cerned I have here an editorial I wrote on the same

     $12,000 each.

     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I am no expert, nor am I a biologist;

     it took the Icelandic government five years to

     make a complete survey. It may take one to five 
     <lb/>
     years. We have a large area in the Gulf, Bay of

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> On page 4 of the same report: "We 
     <lb/>
     understand that the Icelandic government has 
     <lb/>
     spent somewhere in the vicinity of $800,000, but 
     <lb/>
     we have not heard any figures mentioned for the

     Norwegian government. We are given to under<lb break="no"/>stand the British Columbia govemment, in con<lb break="no"/>junction with the federal government spent

     annually about $300,000 in fishery research". 
     <lb/>
     Has the Committee any authority for that state<lb break="no"/>ment?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> As far as I am concerned, I got it 
     <lb/>
     in Vancouver in 1943 from Major Sullivan and 
     <lb/>
     others interested in the herring fishery. All you 
     <lb/>
     have to do, if you want to check it, is to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board. In connection with the Icelandic 
     <lb/>
     government, we have that information from their 
     <lb/>
     ambassador in the United States.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In Holland, pre-war, they had 
     <lb/>
     265 vessels in their hening fleet alone; it wentoff 
     <lb/>
     during the war; but in 1946 they had 140 vessels, 
     <lb/>
     just after herring. It looks as if we should stop the 
     <lb/>
     codfishery and go in for herring. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> That is part of my argument. There 
     <lb/>
     are fish which have much more value, but that 
     <lb/>
     runs into tremendous amounts of capital. The 
     <lb/>
     Icelandic government realised that they could not 
     <lb/>
     go ahead without government assistance. I think 
     <lb/>
     in Iceland it is state controlled and private capital. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett "To purchase and equip a purse 
     <lb/>
     seiner in British Columbia prior to the war, was 
     <lb/>
     approximately $35,000 and today is about

     $50,000." What was the cost to this country for a

     <lb/>
     Clarenville. She is equipped for purse seining. So 
     <lb/>
     far the government has not been able to say what 
     <lb/>
     the cost will be; they think it is in the vicinity of 
     <lb/>
     $85,000 for 110 tons. Originally, when Mr. Dunn 
     <lb/>
     was here, the government intended building 
     <lb/>
     boats which they would chatter to private con<lb break="no"/>cerns, but when he left, everything was changed. 
     <lb/>
     I certainly would not pay $85,000 for anything of

     110 tons.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> The herring fishery has been a 
     <lb/>
     godsend to this country; it means so much to the 
     <lb/>
     individual fisherman. They all can get a license 
     <lb/>
     to pack. Therefore if you get $3 million for her<lb break="no"/>ring, it means a lot of money spread throughout 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. A fisherman can get an early start 
     <lb/>
     and it makes him independent. I hope if UNRRA 
     <lb/>
     does go out, the Fisheries Board will be able to 
     <lb/>
     get contracts from time to time. Our herring has 
     <lb/>
     gone throughout Europe and we should get some 
     <lb/>
     good markets there. The herring fishery will be a 
     <lb/>
     great thing for this country.

     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> On page 4 of Appendix J: "when 
     <lb/>
     one considers the quantity of herring which I 
     <lb/>
     have found in the Bay of Islands area, coupled 
     <lb/>
     with the experiences gained by the herring 
     <lb/>
     fishery in British Columbia, there is no reason for 
     <lb/>
     any boundary lines and the present prohibiting of 
     <lb/>
     the use of purse seiners in this area should be 
     <lb/>
     abolished." I was wondering, in view of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gammon's report, could it be possible to use 
     <lb/>
     purse seiners unrestrictedly? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I think the position is this. We had 
     <lb/>
     the right to use purse seiners inside Blow-Me- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Down and Liverpool Brook. Last year the fisher<lb break="no"/>men objected and we took the seines out of the 
     <lb/>
     water. Last July an agreement was made between 
     <lb/>
     the Fishermen's Union and the company that for 
     <lb/>
     the present year we would not operate inside 
     <lb/>
     Blow-Me-Down and Liverpool Brook. Actually, 
     <lb/>
     from the legal point of view, you could go ahead 
     <lb/>
     and use the seines if you wanted to. Until last fall, 
     <lb/>
     in the Bay of Islands, no one knew the quantity 
     <lb/>
     there. The fishermen thought the herring moved 
     <lb/>
     out and they had to wait for them to come inside. 
     <lb/>
     Actually, from researches we made, the fisher<lb break="no"/>men were getting a great deal of fish in the 
     <lb/>
     Humber flats; there are large quantities also in 
     <lb/>
     Mclvers. The figure we give is 150,000 tons. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gammon said it should be 450,000. I said that 
     <lb/>
     was too big a joke to give the public.

     duty of the Committee to find out whether our

            <p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The loss has been more than 
     <lb/>
     1/8th of 1%, since 1862. That may be so if you 
     <lb/>
     take the four disasters when 323 lives were lost 
     <lb/>
     and divide that into 250,000 men, that gives you 
     <lb/>
     1/8th of 1%. But you can double that since 1862

     ship's crew has been lost, and what do they get? 
     <lb/>
     The Customs pays the widow $85; the Permanent 
     <lb/>
     Marine Disaster Fund<ref target="#fn_12">[1]</ref> — which has done a 
     <lb/>
     tremendous amount of good work and all credit 
     <lb/>
     is due those responsible for that — from that fund 
     <lb/>
     the widow gets a very small amount, $80 a year. 
     <lb/>
     I am sure that any fisherman going out there, if 
     <lb/>
     he felt there was some security for his wife and 
     <lb/>
     children, would make a much better fisherman 
     <lb/>
     than he would be at the present time. I think it 
     <lb/>
     most important that some sort of scheme be 
     <lb/>
     worked out. Some years ago I took it up with the 
     <lb/>
     government — I sent to Ottawa and got their 
     <lb/>
     fishermen's insurance scheme which applied to 
     <lb/>
     Louisbourg. It was too ambitious for us, so I 
     <lb/>
     asked the government to do something along 
     <lb/>
     those lines. It went in the wastepaper basket. I 
     <lb/>
     think we should do something about fishermen's 
     <lb/>
     insurance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree with Mr. Hollett. I sym<lb break="no"/>pathise with it but for rather a different reason. It 
     <lb/>
     is not so much for the protection of the men 
     <lb/>
     themselves — although Mr. Hollett has said they 
     <lb/>
     would make better fishermen, and probably they 
     <lb/>
     would — but it is for the rehabilitation of the 
     <lb/>
     families when they need it most. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On page 5 you say that the very high cost of 
     <lb/>
     outfitting and repairing ships is caused by a 
     <lb/>
     wrong method of taxation. Would Mr. Job, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Crosbie or Mr. Ashboume tell me one reason why 
     <lb/>
     materials used in the outfitting, manufacturing 
     <lb/>
     and repairing of sealing ships should be imported 
     <lb/>
     free of duty — m one reason that does not apply 
     <lb/>
     equally strongly to the materials imported for the 
     <lb/>
     use of the cod, herring and other fish industries? 
     <lb/>
     If you are going to have free trade in that par<lb break="no"/>ticular branch of our basic industry, why not free 
     <lb/>
     trade in all the other branches? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I can give you one good reason: the seal 
     <lb/>
     fishery is a hazardous speculation. Take this year, 
     <lb/>
     it cost between $30,000 and $45,000 to outfit 
     <lb/>
     each steamer — that has to be hazarded. If you 
     <lb/>
     get no seals you lose the whole thing. You have 
     <lb/>
     paid on that $5,000 or $6,000 duty. When you 
     <lb/>
     take a risk, you want that risk to be cut down as 
     <lb/>
     much as it can be, in order to encourage them to 
     <lb/>
     take the risk. It is not the same with cod fishery. 
     <lb/>
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Suppose you send a ship out 
     <lb/>and it costs $35,000 to outfit her, including 
     <lb/>$5,000 or $6,000 to the government, and she 
  

            <cb/>
    

     comes back clean, what is actually your loss 
     <lb/>
     then?

     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> $35,000 assuming she has consumed 
     <lb/>
     all her stores. She may have a little left — all you

     have left is a small amount of stores; and then you 
     <lb/>
     have the expense of cleaning her up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was reading in either the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Halifax Chronicle</hi> or <hi rendition="simple:italic">Halifax Herald</hi> that two or 
     <lb/>
     three steamers had gone out to the seal hunt this 
     <lb/>
     spring — let us assume that is true — if they have 
     <lb/>
     not gone this year, no doubt they will go in future 
     <lb/>
     years. Say three ships went out from Halifax and 
     <lb/>
     three from St. John's, what is the difference in 
     <lb/>
     cost of prosecuting the seal hunt from St. John's 
     <lb/>
     and prosecuting it from Halifax? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Smallwood is trying to lead me into

     confederation. It would be very much less in 
     <lb/>
     Halifax but they have not got the men to 
     <lb/>
     prosecute the seal fishery; they have got to come 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> We have the men.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I wonder if Mr. Crosbie could tell me 
     <lb/>
     what it would cost per thousand to insure the men 
     <lb/>
     provided the sealers were protected day and 
     <lb/>
     night. This $4 insures them if they are out at 
     <lb/>
     night.... What would be the cost of full coverage, 
     <lb/>
     morning, noon and night? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> $4 is full coverage day or night. I 
     <lb/>
     disagree with Mr. Job over some things. He says 
     <lb/>
     that it would cost less for a ship to prosecute the 
     <lb/>
     seal fishery out of Halifax. From the point of view 
     <lb/>
     of repairs I cannot agree. I had a certain amount 
     <lb/>
     of work done on a Whaler, converting from coal 
     <lb/>
     to oil, and the quotation I got from Halifax was 
     <lb/>
     $25,000 higher than our own dockyard, and that 
     <lb/>
     included duty on the materials. It was quite a 
     <lb/>
     shock to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> How would that compare with 
     <lb/>
     the cost of Canadian ships in Halifax? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I would get the same preference as

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:STAR1">Mr. Starkes</persName> That $4 — is that per trip or per 
     <lb/>
     month? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> That is for a trip. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Does the government compel you to 
     <lb/>
     have these men insured? Or is it voluntary? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> The government does not compel 
     <lb/>
     you, but under the act you are responsible for 
     <lb/>
     payment of $1,000 if anything happens to the 
     <lb/>
     men. For years all of our men have been insured. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> The bank fishermen only get $180. 
     <lb/>I consider their lot just as hazardous as seal 
     <lb/>fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Much more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Therefore I am alarmed at the small 
     <lb/>
     insurance of bank fishermen, compared to the 
     <lb/>
     sealers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> I suggest we leave this report on 
     <lb/>
     insurance until we come to that section. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> ....The point strikes me that 
     <lb/>
     considering the fact that these ships cannot be 
  

            <cb/>
    
used for ordinary purposes, it might be possible<lb/>to employ them in the fresh frozen food business,<lb/>is that possible?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I do not think that a properly built 
     <lb/>
     sealing ship could be equipped to combine with 
     <lb/>
     insulation. Take the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Beothic</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ungava</hi> — it 
     <lb/>
     was the serious competition and they could not 
     <lb/>
     compete, it cost so much more for insurance. We 
     <lb/>
     were paying insurance on an extra $200,000 all 
     <lb/>
     the time and competition was so keen, we found 
     <lb/>
     we had to lie them up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> They were good cargo carriers. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Yes, carried more than 2,600 tons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Any talk of new steamers for 
     <lb/>the seal hunt? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Nothing definite. We are all waiting to 
     <lb/>
     see the results of the sealing survey. 
     <lb/>

     March 26, 1947

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Report of the Fisheries Committee:¹ 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>[The committee passed the section on the seal<lb/>fishery, and then passed on to the section con<lb break="no"/>cerning the whalefishery² and Appendix E³]<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I was wondering if there is any 
     <lb/>fear of overfishing, or whether there is any sign 
     <lb/>of diminution of whales around the coast. I was 
     <lb/>also wondering whether there is any ambergris. 
     <lb/>which is used as a base for highly priced per<lb break="no"/>fumes, and if it is exported, and I was wondering 
     <lb/>if we could get any idea of the value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> As far as we can learn there is no 
     <lb/>
     sign of the diminution of the whales, and they 
     <lb/>
     have got a scientist there the last few years. To 
     <lb/>
     my knowledge there has not been any ambergris. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Is there a tendency towards a 
     <lb/>shortage of whales? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> I would not be sure, but the quota 
     <lb/>
     has been filled this year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> There is an international quota? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> There is an international agree<lb break="no"/>ment, which sets the number of whales that can 
     <lb/>be taken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Do you remember the number? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> In the Antarctic it is 16,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> These figures on page 7 would 
     <lb/>
     seem to indicate that there is no shortage of 
     <lb/>
     whales. There is a steady increase. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> From 1940 to 1942 the Hawke's 
     <lb/>
     Harbour plant was closed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Do you have two steamers there or only 
     <lb/>
     one? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Only one for 1940. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Mr. Crosbie says this is a million 
     <lb/>
     dollar industry, and he anticipates in the future it 
     <lb/>
     will be reduced to $600,000. Why do you an<lb break="no"/>ticipate such reduction if the demand is so great? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Most everyone realises that during 
     <lb/>the next three or four years the price will come 
     <lb/>down. I would not expect to see the price main<lb break="no"/>tained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> It could be maintained if you had a 
     <lb/>
     greater production? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> is it a fact that the Norwegians 
     <lb/>
     have already lowered their price this year? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> True, it has dropped from $550 a
