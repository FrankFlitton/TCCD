     Mr. Ballam Does that mean that we will go over 
     <lb/>
     the summary when we come back?

            <p>Mr. Bailey There seems to be a bit of dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction with the matter before the Chair, and I 
     <lb/>think I voice the sentiments of my colleagues on 
     <lb/>the Committee, that if anything is not clear, we 
     <lb/>will do our best to get information. I honestly 
     <lb/>believe that we have tried to get the information, 
     <lb/>and there is a lot of credit due to Major Cashin in 
     <lb/>that he has tried, but he seems to get up against a

     blank wall. It seems right from the very first, and 
     <lb/>
     I think we are going to find it right straight 
     <lb/>
     through, that the government of this country has 
     <lb/>
     no bookkeeping at all, and sometime of course 
     <lb/>
     you have to start bookkeeping, and until that day 
     <lb/>
     we have to do the best we can. I think it is a pity 
     <lb/>
     that we did not have a National Convention years 
     <lb/>
     ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, how true is it that "in the midst of life, we 
     <lb/>
     are in death." Not many days ago, Mr. Justice 
     <lb/>
     Fox, our Chairman, was amongst us; today, his 
     <lb/>
     Chair is vacant; his soul has winged its way to the 
     <lb/>
     God who gave it and we have laid his earthly 
     <lb/>
     tabernacle beneath the mouldering dust of earth. 
     <lb/>
     Some knew him but a few weeks, since the open<lb break="no"/>ing of this Convention, and yet knew him for his 
     <lb/>
     unfailing courtesy and kindliness, for his 
     <lb/>
     scrupulous fairness, his deep and abiding love for 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     the land of his birth, and his loyalty to this cham<lb break="no"/>ber wherein days gone by he presided as Speaker 
     <lb/>
     with such dignity and ability. Others of us knew 
     <lb/>
     him many years. My own acquaintance with him 
     <lb/>
     dates back to the early days of the present cen<lb break="no"/>tury, when we were youths together in the study 
     <lb/>
     of the law. Even then he impressed me with his 
     <lb/>
     kindliness and consideration for others, with his 
     <lb/>
     broad charity and his aversion to speaking ill of 
     <lb/>
     anyone, with his earnest conception of the 
     <lb/>
     seriousness of life and with his complete freedom 
     <lb/>
     from all unworthy motives. That impression, sir, 
     <lb/>
     has outlived the years and it abides with me still. 
     <lb/>
     I need not here enlarge upon his career: that is a 
     <lb/>
     public document which all may read and one of 
     <lb/>
     which those who loved him best may justly be 
     <lb/>
     proud. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the practice of his profession, he was deeply 
     <lb/>
     sensible of his duty to those whose interests were 
     <lb/>
     entrusted to his care. He was profoundly con<lb break="no"/>cerned about our system of laws, which he 
     <lb/>
     regarded as the greatest bulwark of human 
     <lb/>
     freedom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Three times was he called to the counsels of 
     <lb/>
     his country, and in his native district never did he 
     <lb/>
     suffer a defeat at the hands of the electorate - <lb/> eloquent testimony, indeed, of the place that he 
     <lb/>
     filled in the hearts of his countrymen. Later he 
     <lb/>
     was elevated to be one of His Majesty's judges 
     <lb/>
     of our Supreme Court, where he had scarcely 
     <lb/>

     begun a distinguished career when he was called 
     <lb/>
     to be Chairman of the National Convention. This 
     <lb/>
     latter post, which held no material advantage 
     <lb/>
     whatever for him, I believe he prized most of all. 
     <lb/>
     I said "I believe" — I think I am justified in 
     <lb/>
     saying that <hi rendition="simple:italic">I know</hi>, for I knew the man. And now 
     <lb/>
     that he is gone, the greatest tribute that I can pay 
     <lb/>
     him is to say that, to me, he is now, as he always 
     <lb/>
     was and always will be Cyril Fox, the man. And 
     <lb/>
     yet he is not entirely gone from our midst. His 
     <lb/>
     cheery spirit can still guide us along the paths of 
     <lb/>
     unselfish effort and sound decision. May his clear 
     <lb/>
     intellect and his devoted patriotism abide with us 
     <lb/>
     to the end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have the honour to <lb/> second the
                  motion which has been so very elo<lb break="no"/>quently proposed by my friend,
                  Mr. Bradley. <lb/> There is not very much that I can add. I have <lb/> known Cyril
                  Fox in a personal way for many <lb/> years. I have known him in recent years on
                  the <lb/>
                  <cb/> banks of the river where we spent a week or two <lb/> regularly, and under
                  those circumstances one <lb/> gets to know one's fellow companions. I have no
                  <lb/> hesitation in saying that during those times I <lb/> never knew Cyril Fox to
                  say an unkindly word <lb/> about anyone; I have heard him say very many <lb/> kind
                  words about people and do very kind deeds. <lb/> He was a devoted father and a
                  devoted husband <lb/> and his friends were very, very fond of him. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I do not believe he would wish us to take a 
     <lb/>
     gloomy view of his absence here. I believe he 
     <lb/>
     would like us to feel that he is still with us, 
     <lb/>
     influencing us in our deliberations and helping us 
     <lb/>
     to solve the problems connected with the land 
     <lb/>
     which he loved. Cyril Fox was, to sum up his 
     <lb/>
     character, a true sportsman, a true gentleman and 
     <lb/>
     a true Christian in every sense of those words. I 
     <lb/>
     have the honour to second the motion.

     November 23, 1946¹ 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, I open the meeting 
     <lb/>
     with some ten members absent. I don't know 
     <lb/>
     whether you wish to continue with the meeting 
     <lb/>
     or wait a little. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job How many? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman Ten, sir. By now they should all 
     <lb/>
     be here. Well, if it is your wish, gentlemen, we 
     <lb/>
     will continue. I will ask Mr. Cashin to explain the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of the meeting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, on Thursday after<lb break="no"/>noon the Steering Committee met at the request 
     <lb/>
     of the Commissioner for Home Affairs and 
     <lb/>
     Education, in his office, to discuss the vacancy of 
     <lb/>
     Chairman of the National Convention. Mr. Walsh 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that when the National Convention 
     <lb/>
     Act² was being formed the government had ap- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     preached Judge Fox, asking him whether or not 
     <lb/>
     he would accept the chairmanship of the National 
     <lb/>
     Convention. That was why it was inserted that the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman should be a judge of the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court. Now Judge Fox has passed away, and we 
     <lb/>
     find ourselves without a Chairman, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Walsh wanted to know what idea we had regard<lb break="no"/>ing the future position of Chairman; whether the 
     <lb/>
     delegates would be interested in electing their 
     <lb/>
     own Chairman from the members, or whether the 
     <lb/>
     government would have to appoint one. If the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Convention members desire to elect one of their 
     <lb/>
     own delegates as Chairman of the Convention, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Walsh informed us that he felt that die Con<lb break="no"/>vention Act could be amended to cover it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is really the object of the meeting here 
     <lb/>
     this morning, to ascertain whether or not we, as 
     <lb/>
     delegates, are interested in electing our own 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. That is the sum and substance of what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Walsh told us the other afternoon. Now the 
     <lb/>
     matter is open for discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Butt I don't think that is quite precisely 
     <lb/>
     correct. The idea is to explore the idea, not to limit 
     <lb/>
     it to any one thing. i don't think the government 
     <lb/>
     has given it any real thought. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin Well, I think they have, otherwise 
     <lb/>
     they would not have called us. They want to know 
     <lb/>
     if we will do thejob or ifwe want to throw it over 
     <lb/>
     on them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job If we do not do something they will 
     <lb/>
     have to appoint a judge of the Supreme Court. It 
     <lb/>
     is up to us if we would rather have one of oursel<lb break="no"/>ves or a judge of the Supreme Court. I am not 
     <lb/>
     quite sure if he definitely states that it would have 
     <lb/>
     to be a member of the Convention or not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Cashin No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Job We can make all sorts of suggestions, 
     <lb/>
     and whatever we decide they would try to fall in 
     <lb/>
