               businessmen like Crosbie. I am not saying he

               I expect to see another depression in this 
               <br />
               country. All the ﬁgures and all the talk in the 
               <br />
               world is not going to drive it out of my mind that 
               <br />
               a depression will come upon us before many 
               <br />
               years are over. I do not believe that our present 
               <br />
               earning power is going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continue.</span> In the past 
               <br />
               few years, thanks to the war, our country and our 
               <br />
               people have enjoyed greater prOSperity than they 
               <br />
               ever dreamed of. Some prospered more than 
               <br />
               others, but all shared in the prosperity to some 
               <br />
               extent. I can see the handwriting on the wall —— 
               <br />
               that prosperity is going to pass away. We have 
               <br />
               heard a lot of talk about our terms of reference. 
               <br />
               The most important words in those terms of ref- 
               <br />
               erence to my mind are these: “and bearing in 
               <br />
               mind the extent to which our prosperity is the 
               <br />
               result of the war." That is what we have to bear 
               <br />
               in mind all the time — that our present prosperity, 
               <br />
               such as it is, is the result of the war. The war is 
               <br />
               now over, or almost over, and the cause is 
               <br />
               removed, so the result will pass away <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also.</span> We 
               <br />
               would not be very patriotic if we blinked these
