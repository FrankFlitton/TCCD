               Now Mr. Chairman. Mr. Smallwood criticises

               what he calls “the responsible government 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               confederation upon the basis submitted to the 
               <br />
               National Convention be placed on the ballot. I 
               <br />
               would point out to him that in addition to voting 
               <br />
               that responsible government go on the ballot, we 
               <br />
               have also voted to have Commission of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment placed thereon. We have done that because 
               <br />
               we are being consistent, and demand that the 
               <br />
               British government fulﬁl their pledge to the 
               <br />
               people of this country. After all, it was to the 
               <br />
               people that they pledged their word.

               I shall vote against Mr. Smallwood’s motion 
               <br />

               deliberate attempt? In my opinion, sir, the British

               government and the Canadian government, and 
               <br />

               Do you seriously think, sir, that either Great 
               <br />
               Britain or Canada is deeply concerned about our 
               <br />
               people? Were they ever so concerned in the past? 
               <br />
               Decidedly not. But why, you ask, are they so 
               <br />
               anxious now that we should confederate? The 
               <br />
               answer is quite simple. How else, I ask you, can 
               <br />
               they get American troops off British soil? Under 
               <br />

               Let Mr. Smallwood answer me a few ques-

               tions if there is any doubt left in our minds about 
               <br />
               this imperial policy which the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government would assist. Why was the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion Act worded as it is: “form or fom‘ts”? Why 
               <br />
               was Mr. Smallwood sent to Canada by someone 
               <br />
               shortly after the election? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood He is implying that I was sent 
               <br />
               to Canada. He has no right to do that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Either he is implying it or 
               <br />
               making a statement, I do not know which. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett It is an actual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact.</span> Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               did ﬂy from Gander. I ask him why was he sent. 
               <br />
               He can interpret that how he pleases. Why did he 
               <br />
               call together certain people to a meeting held here 
               <br />
               in St. John’s in August 1946? This was held 
               <br />
               before the Convention met. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It is a lie; a downright, dirty lie. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Why at that meeting was it decided 
               <br />
               to introduce a resolution to send a delegation to 
               <br />
               Canada as soon almost as the Convention was 
               <br />
               opened? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It is a lie. A black and foul lie. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Am I to be interrupted in this way? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I will make a note to deal with 
               <br />
               these matters. I am not going to have these ex— 
               <br />
               changes. I have already warned you. Now Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, please. I have already warned you 
               <br />
               once today, and I am doing it the second time, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               I hope I will not have to do it the third time. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Is that statement to be left on the 
               <br />
               record thatI am a liar? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is a statement thatI am not 
               <br />
               prepared to deal with at the moment. I will inves- 
               <br />
               tigate that, but I will not deal with it at the 
               <br />
               moment, because I have not the facts before me 
               <br />
               to make such an investigation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Can Mr. Smallwood state that 
               <br />
               another delegate is a liar? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Now Mr. Hollett, don’t give me 
               <br />
               any further trouble here this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afternoon.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I will not, sir. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I will advise you not to. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I will ask Mr. Smallwood not to 
               <br />
               give me any further trouble. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I will deal with that later. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I will ask another question, Mr.
