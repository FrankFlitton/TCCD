               <br />
               issues referred to above were left in abeyance 
               <br />
               until the rather sudden appearance of Mr. Job’s 
               <br />
               motion1 which raised all three at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">once,</span> I voted 
               <br />
               against that motion. I am proud of it. I would do 
               <br />
               it again. That motion should have been the one 
               <br />
               that is now before the Convention. If he had given 
               <br />
               any serious thought to the fact that the effective, 
               <br />
               real government of Newfoundland is in the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom, he would have realised that we 
               <br />
               ran the risk, by going to the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, of getting an answer to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques</span> 
               <br />
               tions from the Commission itself and therefore 
               <br />
               limited; or made by the United Kingdom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment through a third party and therefore limiting 
               <br />
               our chances of putting up our case face to face; 
               <br />
               that we may have run the risk of obtaining an 
               <br />
               opinion from the creator of the real government 
               <br />
               which the real government would have found it 
               <br />
               very embarrassing to reverse. Whoever made the 
               <br />
               final decision, we have accepted certain limita- 
               <br />
               tions. Take the case of the reason given for our 
               <br />
               not approaching the United States on the grounds 
               <br />
               of the present international tariff conference. I do 
               <br />
               not accept that suggestion and it is irrelevant. 
               <br />
               There is a clear case to be made for a separate 
               <br />
               negotiation, apart from the multilateral tariff ar- 
               <br />
               rangements whereby we give something for 
               <br />
               something. We have already given something 
               <br />
               and we ought to see what we can do about getting 
               <br />
               something in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">return.</span> There is, however, that little 
               <br />
               phrase Mr. Miller used — “it is doubtful if it 
               <br />
               comes within our terms of reference.“ I am glad 
               <br />
               that the case is not entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closed.</span>

               <br />
               of how we are going to approach this issue. I have 
               <br />
               no doubt it will pass. I have no doubt Great 
               <br />
               Britain will give us all the facts we need. I am 
               <br />

               There is another matter relating to it that has 
               <br />
               something to do with the matter on which Mr.

               think that the statements and the attitude taken by

               this Convention towards that government and its 
               <br />
               associates are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">analogous.</span> Statements which have 
               <br />
               been made throughout the session range all the 
               <br />

               ment is making this year, referring to it as “a

               deliberately planned campaign to bleed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">finan»</span>

               They were not altogether called for. If members

               wish to express their feelings in that way, they 
               <br />
               have a perfect right to do so. I respect their

               <br />
               statements are not called for, and this approach is 
               <br />
               just not the proper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one.</span> I am not building up a 
               <br />
               case for Commission of Government. The kind 
               <br />
               of government which is going to get my vote is 
               <br />
               that in which the Newfoundland people are going 
               <br />
               to get a fair chance. If Commission is not the kind 
               <br />
               of government which the people want, then I am 
               <br />
               going to vote the Commission of Government

               have been to this country; I realise also the errors 
               <br />
               they made; I hope I can see the good with the bad.
