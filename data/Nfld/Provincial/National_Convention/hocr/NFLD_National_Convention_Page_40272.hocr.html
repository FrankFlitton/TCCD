               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, before we go 
               <br />
               into the appendix to the report on posts and 
               <br />
               telegraphs, there is an item that I think I ought to 
               <br />
               pass on to the Convention Yesterday we were 
               <br />
               talking about the subsidy paid by the Department 
               <br />
               of Posts and Telegraphs for the conveyance of 
               <br />
               mail, paid to the Railway. At that time I was not 
               <br />
               informed of the tme situation. I said the amount 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000.</span> It was $150,000 from 1934 on. 
               <br />
               Before that for two or three years it was $217,000 
               <br />
               a year, and before that for quite a number of years 
               <br />
               it was $500,000. Well, on September 1, 1946, a 
               <br />
               new agreement was made between the Post Of— 
               <br />
               free and Railway, setting up an entirely new basis 
               <br />
               for postal subsidy. Up to that time it was a ﬂat 
               <br />
               rate of $150,000, but since September 1 the new 
               <br />
               agreement is, to the Railway 30 cents per mile, 
               <br />
               and to the coastal boats 50 cents per mile. It works 
               <br />
               out, as far as the Post Ofﬁce can estimate it, at 
               <br />
               about $101,000 a year to the Railway, and to the 
               <br />
               coastal boats about $92,000. Then, over and 
               <br />
               above that the Post Ofﬁce has agreed to pay the 
               <br />
               Railway a ﬂat amount of$15,000 a year to handle 
               <br />
               mail in North Sydney and Port-aux—Basques, so 
               <br />
               that the total would be around $210,000 a year. 
               <br />
               We only have the appendix of the report on 
               <br />
               the posts and telegraphs which consists of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report</span> 
               <br />
               from the Secretary of the department. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I was just going to allude to the fact that 
               <br />
               is there not another $100,000 in addition to the 
               <br />
               $210,000 provided by the Finance Department 
               <br />
               for the Railway? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood We are dealing only with posts 
               <br />
               and telegraphs, and there is only this $210,000 
               <br />
               now from that department. Mr. Cashin says, 
               <br />
               “Yes, there is another $100,000 paid the Railway 
               <br />
