               unreasonable assumption of prerogative unto 
               <br />
               myself, since it was written in the bond that what 
               <br />
               I should do was recommend possible forms of 
               <br />
               future government to be put before the people at 
               <br />
               a national referendum. That was what the people 
               <br />
               of my district sent me here to do — to recommend 
               <br />
               possible forms of future government. I ask you to 
               <br />
               note particularly the words, “possible forms”. 
               <br />
               “Possible”, mind you, not impossible, and 
               <br />
               “forms", mind you, not form. “Forms" —— note 
               <br />
               the “s”. A great deal of misunderstanding has 
               <br />
               arisen about that “possible” and that plural; and 
               <br />
               in particular one hears arguments these days that 
               <br />
               for the Convention to have to recommend the 
               <br />
               maximum of possible alternatives would mean 
               <br />
               that we should have to recommend every form of 
               <br />
               government known to man. Carry that sort of 
               <br />
               thing to its logical conclusion, the argument goes, 
               <br />
               and the sky is the limit. The referendum ballot 
               <br />
               should run the gamut of government from aristo- 
               <br />
               cracy to theocracy. However, that is an argument 
               <br />
               calculated merely to confuse the issue. It is rooted 
               <br />
               in either inability or unwillingness to see the 
               <br />
               distinction between recommending for the 
               <br />
               referendum ballot all the possible forms of 
               <br />
               government, and all the forms of government 
               <br />
               possible. In the latter instance the sky would 
               <br />
               indeed be the limit, but it is not to the latter 
               <br />
               enterprise that we are committed. Our concern 
               <br />
               here is with all the possible forms of government, 
               <br />
               and within that compass the alternatives open are 
               <br />
               few. Broadly speaking there are three ways in 
               <br />
               which we are limited in the forms of government 
               <br />
               that we may recommend: we are limited in con— 
               <br />
               science, by tradition and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact.</span> We live in a 
               <br />
               Christian country. There is behind us a long 
               <br />
               Christian tradition; our way of life is Christian to 
               <br />
               the core, and so we are bound in conscience to 
               <br />
               recommend for purposes of the national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referen.</span> 
               <br />
               dum constitutions that will not be in conﬂict with 
               <br />
               Christian ethics. It is consequently not within our 
               <br />
               competency to recommend any of those 
               <br />
               totalitarian forms of government that put the state 
               <br />
               before the individual. This is a free country. 
               <br />
               There is behind us along tradition of the rights 
               <br />
               of all men to life, liberty and the pursuit of 
               <br />
               happiness. Our way of life is democratic to the 
               <br />
               core. We are consequently bound by tradition to 
               <br />

               dum constitutions that are not in conﬂict with the 
               <br />
               democratic ideal. It is consequently not within

               ﬁnally, we live in a British country. There is 
               <br />
               behind us a long and intimate association with the

               <br />
               this time are of a very special kind. As we are all 
               <br />
               aware, the ﬁnal decision as to what will appear 
               <br />
               on the ballot will be made in Downing Street, and 
               <br />

               the structure of the British Commonwealth of 
               <br />
               Nations. I think it unlikely that Downing Street 
               <br />
               would consider for referendum purposes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con“</span> 
               <br />
               stitutions to the contrary. As I see it, we are 
               <br />
               limited in fact. We could recommend union with 
               <br />
               the United States, but I doubt that in Downing 
               <br />
               Street it would receive a second thought, and as 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned quite properly so.

               limit when it comes to recorrunending constitu-

               not all possible forms of government for us, and

               we are limited in conscience, by tradition, and in

               fact to a few alternatives, and in my opinion it is

               our solemn duty to determine among these alter-

               ber of constitutions that we might recommend, 
               <br />
               but not all of them are relevant. Not all of them

               could be superimposed on the economy of this 
               <br />

               them are suited to the temperament of our people, 
               <br />

               as to avoid the recommendation of a multiplicity 
               <br />
               of irrelevant constitutions, which, if they were to 
               <br />
