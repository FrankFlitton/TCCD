               English-speaking nations of the world, namely 
               <br />
               England, Canada and the United States of

               we mean what we say, that we will support every

               <br />
               the same result. Do not let us be deceived in

               thinking that Canada will give us any better terms 
               <br />

               <br />
               With all due consideration I will support the

               Mr. McCarthy I am not going to speak at any 
               <br />
               length to the motion, and certainly not at all on 
               <br />
               confederation, which is not the issue; too much 
               <br />
               has been said for and against that by some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre'</span> 
               <br />
               vious speakers. I wish to make it clear that I am 
               <br />
               not supporting confederation or any other form 
               <br />
               of government at this particular time, but when 
               <br />
               the time comes however I shall favour the form 
               <br />
               of government which I think will best serve New- 
               <br />
               foundland and its people.

               I know there are some Newfoundlanders, few 
               <br />
               though they may be, who are favouring con- 
               <br />
               federation and we owe it to them to obtain all 
               <br />
               information possible on the issue. Whether this is 
               <br />
               sought now or later does not matter a great deal, 
               <br />
               as long as it is available to the Convention when 
               <br />
               committees are finished. Canada, knowing now 
               <br />
               that we do not have to accept, will I think submit 
               <br />
               her best offer. Then our confederates, knowing 
               <br />
               this, will have a better idea whether or not it 
               <br />
               would be wise to vote that way. Therefore, I

               House. Being one of the younger members of this 
               <br />
               Convention and unaccustomed, as many of us 
               <br />
               are, to gatherings of this sort, I have chosen rather 
               <br />
               to listen and learn. But having sat and listened for 
               <br />
               the last two days to the comments and debate on 
               <br />
               the resolution now before the House, I feel com- 
               <br />
               pelled to make some comment. I know, and many 
               <br />
               gentlemen here have stated, that there are people 
               <br />
               in all the districts of Newfoundland and Labrador 
               <br />
               who are expecting that confederation will be one 
               <br />
               of the forms of government which will be 
               <br />
               presented to them at a future referendum, and for 
               <br />
               that reason alone it was inevitable that the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of getting terms from the Canadian governâ€” 
               <br />
               ment should at some time have to come before 
               <br />
               this House. I think we agree on that. The main 
               <br />
               point of the argument at the present time is, it 
               <br />
               seems to me, the time of presenting the resolu- 
               <br />
               tion, which some delegates think was premature. 
               <br />
               But the fact remains that the motion is before the 
               <br />
               House and we have spent three sessions in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               puting and debating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Now what are we going to 
               <br />
               do about it? Are we going to shelve this resolution 
               <br />
               at the present and bring it in at some future date? 
               <br />
               I have come to the conclusion that I will 
               <br />
               support the motion, because if we shelve the 
               <br />
               question now and have it brought in again at some 
               <br />
               future date, we should have all our discussions 
               <br />
               and debates over again which to me seems a 
               <br />
               waste of time, and l have no wish to see this 
               <br />
               Convention prolonged more than is absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary. I would wish this Convention to have 
               <br />
               the facts when they want them and not have to 
               <br />
               wait for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> In making this decision I wish it to 
               <br />
               be clearly understood that l have not been ap- 
               <br />
               proached or influenced by any member of this 
               <br />
               Convention. Let us get the question settled as 
               <br />
               quickly as possible and get on with the real busi- 
               <br />
               ness of finding the facts about our own country. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam Mr. Chairman, 1 have not spoken 
               <br />
               on the resolution before because I did not think it 
               <br />
               necessary to have so many speeches made. If 
               <br />
               every resolution and question that is brought in is 
               <br />
               going to have 45 speeches made on it we are 
               <br />
               going to be here for a very long time yet. The 
               <br />
               resolution now before the Convention is not 
               <br />
               whether we are going to back confederation or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> There is nothing in it about confederation 
               <br />
               except to obtain the facts as to terms with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> 
               <br />
               Those who spoke on the amendment want to get 
               <br />
               the facts too. The only point is to decide whether
