               Mr. Bailey I wonder if we could know What the

               medical services are in those sections where the 
               <br />
               infant mortality rate is so high. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I am not going to mention the 
               <br />
               places where the rates are high — where it is 210 
               <br />
               the medical service is not good, not too plentiful. 
               <br />
               Now the other one -— 145 — the rate is high but 
               <br />
               the medical services are good, and where it is 141 
               <br />
               the medical services are excellent. On the other 
               <br />
               hand there is one part where the rate is the lowest 
               <br />
               in the country and I don’t believe there is a doctor 
               <br />
               there... It is not only the medical services, the 
               <br />
               doctors and nurses, there are a lot of other factors. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller In view of that correction, the fol- 
               <br />
               lowing sentence: “Newfoundland is SOC-400% 
               <br />
               worse off in her rate of infant mortality than the 
               <br />
               countries shown”, we have to accept that with 
               <br />
               some reservation. That conclusion is deﬁnitely 
               <br />
               based on the comparison submitted, and if we 
               <br />
               can’t feel they are really correct I don’t see how 
               <br />
               we can accept those conclusions. There is 
               <br />
               another point, the report is signed by the full 
               <br />
               Committee, and I would like to ask what liberty 
               <br />
               any one person has to make alterations and add 
               <br />
               more thereto. It seems queer no one knows 
               <br />
               whether these ﬁgures are at random or correct or 
               <br />
               what. I don’t think that’s thorough enough for our

               Mr. Newell It seems to me that when errors are 
               <br />
               discovered and corrected in other reports, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               been dam little said about it. It seems today there 
               <br />
               is an attempt being made, because of these errors, 
               <br />
               to sort of throw dust over the rest of the reports. 
               <br />
               I wonder why?
