               and ashes, forever doing the penance of an 
               <br />
               emaciated pauperhood for sins of history that 
               <br />
               were not ours. It needs no more than a glance to 
               <br />
               see that in its essential characteristics the 
               <br />
               economy of Newfoundland has not changed. His~ 
               <br />
               torically our economy has always been an export 
               <br />
               economy. It still is. The dynamics that move our 
               <br />
               economy today are, as always, the production of 
               <br />
               staple products for sale abroad. For the most part 
               <br />
               our production has no vested interest in serving 
               <br />
               our own island. We have to import most of what 
               <br />
               we need, even considerable quantities of 
               <br />
               potatoes. We are geared, after some fashion, to 
               <br />
               serve the world, not to serve ourselves. The 
               <br />
               population upon which the whole market is 
               <br />
               founded is so meager that it does not permit of 
               <br />
               such mass production as would be essential to 
               <br />
               any servicing of ourselves with manufactured 
               <br />
               goods. And so the essential character of our 
               <br />
               economy remains the same; it has not taken upon 
               <br />
               itself any of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">characteristics</span> of an industrial 
               <br />
               economy. Nevertheless, modifications have 
               <br />
               come with the years.

               For years the economy of Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               almost entirely a matter of what came of the 
               <br />
               export of dried salt codﬁsh. When the ﬁshery and 
               <br />
               the world markets were favourable the people ate 
               <br />
               — ﬁsh and brewis; when they weren’t, people 
               <br />
               tightened their belts and ate fish and hoped that 
               <br />
               the winter wouldn’t be too hard. In time the 
               <br />
               economy came to be broadened out at the base to 
               <br />
               the export of other fish besides cod; and still 
               <br />
               further the economy came to be expanded in 
               <br />
               consequence of the export of newsprint and some 
               <br />
               minerals. In comparatively recent years, one or 
               <br />
               two other odds and ends such as blueberries have 
               <br />
               come to be exported; and then the expansion of 
               <br />
               the economy at its base came to an end. We had 
               <br />
               run out of natural resources. Thereafter there 
               <br />
               could be room only for quantitative expansion. 
               <br />
               The export expansion would have to be by way 
               <br />
               of the seams. In the meantime our economy has 
               <br />
               not shown any signs of going out at the seams. 
               <br />
               There have been no indications of middle-age 
               <br />
               spread. Rather has the shape of our economy been 
               <br />
               mostly such as that induced by taking in another 
               <br />
               notch in the belt. 
               <br />

               Any expansion that has materialised since

               affect the economy of the country. Whether that

               <br />
               duration of our time is anybody’s guess. It is not 
               <br />
               impossible that we might have some minor 
               <br />
               developments in asbestos and coal. But whether 
               <br />
               they would make a noticeable impact upon our 
               <br />
               economy is imponderable. Also among the im- 
               <br />
               ponderables, is the impact we may expect the 
               <br />
               development of Labrador to have upon our 
               <br />
               economy. There is reason to think that its 
               <br />
               economic potential is considerable. The pertinent 
               <br />
               question is, injust whose interest is that potential 
               <br />
               to be developed, the people of Labrador or the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland? It seems to me that 
               <br />
               until now the people of Labrador have fared none 
               <br />
               too well at our hand. We haven’t gone out of our 
               <br />
               way to provide them with even minimum public 
               <br />
               and social services. I understand that luxury roads 
               <br />
               of the type of the Topsail Road are few and far 
               <br />
               between down that way. Indeed I understand that 
               <br />
               roads of any type are as few and as far between 
               <br />
               down that way as street lights and railways and 
               <br />
               other public amenities. Come to think of it, in the 
               <br />
               days when we did have responsible government, 
               <br />
               we never even thought it worth our while to 
               <br />
               extend to the people of Labrador the privilege of 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ballot.</span> Indeed, we didn’t get around to giving a 
               <br />
               second thought to Labrador until it seemed as if 
               <br />
               we might get something out of it. It would be 
               <br />
               interesting to know the thoughts of Labradorians 
               <br />
               when they hear some of our political pundits 
               <br />
               raising the roof over the raw deal 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s gotten from somebody or other. 
               <br />
               It must sometimes occur to them that New- 
               <br />
               foundland doesn’t do so badly itself when it 
               <br />
               comes to dishing out raw deals. I have a hearty 
               <br />
               dislike of that mentality that is concerned with 
               <br />
               Labrador only to the extent that it may be ex- 
               <br />
               ploited for Newfoundla‘nd’s advantage. The most 
               <br />
               that we have any right to expect of the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of Labrador is the provision of sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               revenue to support the public and social services 
               <br />
               the Labrador people have every right to expect. 
               <br />
               These we are in any case obligated to provide 
               <br />
               even if Labrador should go undeveloped. If we 
               <br />
               make no effort to provide them then I think that
