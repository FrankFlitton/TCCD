               is a mistake to say a man must be here every day.

               Mr. Jackman What I mean is this —- and I 
               <br />
               thought I made it clear — I did not say he must 
               <br />
               attend, that is not possible, for example, he may 
               <br />
               be sick, The point is that out of respect to the 
               <br />
               Chair and the whole assembly, if a delegate ﬁnds 
               <br />
               it impossible to attend, he could at least telephone

               Mr. Fudge I note the chair of Mr. Ryan of 
               <br />
               Placentia West is vacant. He has a severe cold 
               <br />
               and asked me to tell you that, Mr. Chairman. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It is neither practical nor pos- 
               <br />
               sible, nor is it expected that on every day of 
               <br />
               meeting every member must be here. There are 
               <br />
               bound to be circumstances over which we have 
               <br />
               no control, and whilst we shall all endeavour to 
               <br />
               assemble here and perform our duties, there are 
               <br />
               occasions when we cannot be here. Then again a 
               <br />
               member may have to leave. It is a matter of duty 
               <br />
               for the members to be here and members will 
               <br />
               perform that, but it has to be recognised that there 
               <br />
               are circumstances which may require a member 
               <br />
               to absent himself, he will certainly be excused. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown The only time the papers should 
               <br />
               report absentees is in the event of no quorum. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman Ifit is going to be reported, I am 
               <br />
               of the opinion the names should be published. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I move that the question be now put. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown I second that.

               Mr. Chairman You must consider that would

               some misconstruction be written down as delin-

               we did not have a full membership of the House

               unwarranted slander being cast on a member to 
               <br />

               <br />
               me, Mr. Jackman, if I suggest that maybe you are 
               <br />
               becoming alarmed unnecessarily. No one has any

               <br />
               appreciate what is an undeniable fact, that we 
               <br />
               cannot be here on all occasions. Perhaps you 
               <br />
               would let it remain as a subject of good sense. .
