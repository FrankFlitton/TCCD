               Mr. Chairman Just a minute, Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               please. If it is your intention to appeal my ruling 
               <br />
               to the House that is your right but I remind you 
               <br />
               that you are not permitted to debate and appeal 
               <br />
               from my ruling to the house. I want to make it 
               <br />
               clear that when I met the Steering Committee 
               <br />
               after I had been sworn in there was handed over 
               <br />
               to me rules of procedure... I have sworn that I 
               <br />
               will impartially and fairly preside over the 
               <br />
               deliberations of this room while I am here... 
               <br />
               Unless and until any of the rules of procedure 
               <br />
               handed to me by the Steering Committee are 
               <br />
               repealed, varied, altered or amended by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two»</span> 
               <br />
               thirds of this House, it becomes my sworn duty

               to enforce your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rules,</span> I did not make these rules, 
               <br />
               they were made for me. I shall preside here to 
               <br />
               insure that the rules of debate shall be conducted 
               <br />
               with propriety, and in accordance with the rules 
               <br />
               of procedure...

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Any ruling that I make I shall expect to be 
               <br />
               respected and observed. Unless and until my 
               <br />
               ruling is appealed to and reversed by the House 
               <br />
               as a whole, I propose to act on my rulings as if 
               <br />
               they were judgements of this House. It is the 
               <br />
               constitutional right of any member to appeal my 
               <br />
               ruling, but he must do one of two things: he must 
               <br />
               either abide by my ruling, or else he must appeal 
               <br />
               from it to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House“.</span> I will promptly put any 
               <br />
               appeal from any decisions I may make to this 
               <br />
               House, and of course I must naturally abide by 
               <br />

               any decision reached by the House as a whole. 
               <br />
               Therefore I must say two things: one, while a 
               <br />
               member is addressing the Chair he has no right 
               <br />
               to come between the speaker and the Chair. It is 
               <br />
               in the interest of all you gentlemen that I should 
               <br />
               reserve to you the dignity and respect to which 
               <br />
               you are fairly entitled. That I can only do if by 
               <br />
               and with your sympathy I am permitted to en- 
               <br />
               force the rules, that no member shall rise or 
               <br />
               interrupt a speaker who is addressing the Chair, 
               <br />
               unless and until he rises to a point of order, at 
               <br />
               which time he will be asked to state his point of 
               <br />
               order. A ruling will, if possible, be immediately 
               <br />
               given on that point of order, and then, if he is 
               <br />
               dissatisﬁed with the decision his remedy is to 
               <br />
               appeal to the House as a whole. With that in mind, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, I want to reserve to you the right 
               <br />
               to correct, by way of appeal to the House if you 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, there was noth- 
               <br />
               ing further from my mind than to appeal against 
               <br />
               your ruling... It was my intention merely to say 
               <br />
               that not for a moment had I any thought that in

               distort or falsify any ﬁgures whatsoever.... At no

               doubt about the integrity of that Committee or 
               <br />
               their honesty. I have no doubt that, in copying 
               <br />
               those ﬁgures, they copied them correctly and 
               <br />
               accurately, with the exception of one item which 
               <br />
               I will refer to at some other time; that they just 
               <br />
               took the ﬁgures from the Auditor General’s 
               <br />
               report and copied them, and that is what they put 
               <br />
               in this table.
