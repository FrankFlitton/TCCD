               for argument when these bases and concessions 
               <br />
               were granted, as the enemy was literally at our

               <br />
               received only a temporary beneﬁt and that we 
               <br />

               some reservations, but the bald fact remains that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has so far received no quid pro
