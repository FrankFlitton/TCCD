               Mr. Northcott There is an old but true saying 
               <br />
               that “fools rush in where angels fear to tread.” I 
               <br />
               don’t think we should rush the facts of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion or anything else. These matters are very, very 
               <br />
               important, and I do oppose Mr. Smallwood or 
               <br />
               anyone else trying to railroad this thing through. 
               <br />
               I would like to see these terms, but I certainly 
               <br />
               want to take my time and there are many things 
               <br />
               to be considered before seeking these terms. 
               <br />
               Mr. Dawe I wish to rise and make objection to 
               <br />
               this thing. I understand that the proposed delega— 
               <br />
               tion has already been picked. I do not think that 
               <br />
               we should seek terms with Canada on confedera- 
               <br />
               tion until our natural resources have been proper— 
               <br />
               ly assessed. I am going to ask Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               what he meant by what he said in the lobby of the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Hotel: that if he could find 200 
               <br />
               honest Newfoundlanders he would not advocate 
               <br />
               federal union with Canada. We kneel before God 
               <br />
               and ask His help, but we don’t have to kneel 
               <br />
               before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span>

               Mr. Smallwood I am beginning, sir, to think 
               <br />
               now, the last remarks made by Mr. Dawe make 
               <br />
               me very strongly believe that after all the talk of 
               <br />
               conspiracy here this afternoon there is in fact a 
               <br />
               conspiracy, a diabolical conspiracy originating in 
               <br />
               several sources, a conspiracy to blacken me. 
               <br />
               When a man wants to know if it is true that 
               <br />
               Smallwood said in the lobby of the Hotel “If he 
               <br />
               could ﬁnd 200 honest Newfoundlanders etc.” 
               <br />
               I certainly did not.

               inquiry. 1 am not a confederate. I am something 
               <br />
               in Mr. Higgins’ class. I am not sold on the idea 
               <br />
               of confederation, or on the idea of responsible 
               <br />
               government, nor on the idea of Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, but we have to ask Canada for at 
               <br />
               least particular terms which she is willing to give 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in confederation. Because, 
               <br />
               whether these 45 men like it or not, there are 
               <br />
               people in Newfoundland today who favour 
               <br />
               confederation, and they must be given an oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity to vote for or against it. Now I come from 
               <br />
               a district where, as Mr. Hollett will agree, we 
               <br />
               were not told to come in here to support any 
               <br />
               particular form of government, but we were told 
               <br />
               to judge for ourselves the suitable form of 
               <br />
               government and put it before our people, so that 
               <br />
               they could select the form of government they 
               <br />
               desired. I think, Mr. Chairman, that there has 
               <br />
               been a good deal of opinion that we are here to 
               <br />
               settle the form of government for Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               We are not in here to choose anything, but we are 
               <br />
               here to consider and discuss, and then ﬁnally to 
               <br />
               recommend to the people certain forms of 
               <br />
               government. There has been some reference 
               <br />
               made to terms of reference of the Convention, 
               <br />
               and there is nothing to prevent any member from 
               <br />
               choosing two forms of government to put before 
               <br />
               his people, the people are finally those to make 
               <br />
               the choice. Now then, Mr. Chairman, in speaking 
               <br />
               of this amendment, if this Convention feels that 
               <br />
               it has to get this information from Canada, why 
               <br />
               not do it now? Why wait two or three months, or 
               <br />
               weeks? Get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘machinery</span> in motion. Whether 
               <br />
               we like it or not I think we have to get that 
               <br />
               particular information.

               Mr. Starkes I stand here definitely opposed to

               tion that Mr. Smallwood has brought in, to my

               mind is one of the most important that has come

               district if I did not say a word or two about it. I 
               <br />
               am very well aware that we have many people in 
               <br />
               this country today who believe in confederation. 
               <br />

               personally am Opposed to it at the present time. I 
               <br />
               am not prepared to argue the point just at this 
               <br />
               stage. The main fact is that there are many people 
               <br />
               who are supporters of confederation. We must 
               <br />
               remember, sir, that they are Newfoundlanders
