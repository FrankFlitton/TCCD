               We often hear talk in this country about the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces. We often hear it said that the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces are down and out, poor, up 
               <br />
               against it, and opposed to confederation. Our 
               <br />
               people on the coast get a great laugh out of that 
               <br />
               kind of talk. It is a great joke to them, for they are 
               <br />
               extremely familiar with the Maritime Provinces 
               <br />
               of Canada. I have been told that the people down 
               <br />
               in the Straits, in fact on both sides of the Straits, 
               <br />
               are something like ourselves on the southwest 
               <br />
               coast. Like us they know Canada too, not perhaps 
               <br />
               the same part of Canada that we know so well, 
               <br />
               but a more northerly part. They travel back and 
               <br />
               forth across the Straits to that part of Canada 
               <br />
               which is just across the border, and they know the 
               <br />
               people well, and know what living conditions are 
               <br />
               like, and what prices are, and how much better 
               <br />
               these people live and get along than they do 
               <br />
               themselves. And it is a very interesting fact that 
               <br />
               the people of Labrador and in the Straits of Belle 
               <br />
               Isle are such strong confederates. As Mr. Burry 
               <br />
               has told us, I understand that the entire population 
               <br />
               of Labrador and northern Newfoundland are 
               <br />
               practically unanimously for confederation, and 
               <br />
               are waiting longingly for the day to come to vote 
               <br />
               for confederation.

               It is a cant word in all the district, Mr. Chair— 
               <br />
               man, that the Newfoundland people who know 
               <br />
               Canada best are the strongest confederates. That 
               <br />
               gives you something to think about. Those people 
               <br />
               down north and our people along the coast do not 
               <br />
               look upon Canadians as strangers. They do not 
               <br />
               look upon Canada as a strange country that is 
               <br />
               trying to gobble us up. They do not look upon the 
               <br />
               people of Canada as a people who are taxed to 
               <br />
               death. They know the difference. Of all the 
               <br />
               people on the southwest coast who favour con- 
               <br />
               federation our ﬁshermen are the strongest. The 
               <br />
               merchants too favour confederation. Fishermen 
               <br />
               and merchants are alike in that, but it is the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen who are the strongest of all for it. That 
               <br />
               is because they know how the fishermen live in 
               <br />
               Canada. Our ﬁshermen for many years ﬁshed 
               <br />
               with the Canadian ﬁshermen. They have been 
               <br />
               going up there since long before I was born, in

               anyone in Newfoundland our southwest coast 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen know how the Canadian ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               live, and that is what makes our ﬁshermen such 
               <br />
               strong confederates. If all the ﬁshermen of New- 
               <br />
               foundland could spend one season ﬁshing with 
               <br />
               Canadian ﬁshermen on Canadian vessels, no 
               <br />
               power on earth could hold these men back from 
               <br />
               ﬁghting for confederation.

               Their greatest worry on that coast today is that 
               <br />
               confederation might lose in the referendum. I will 
               <br />
               tell you why. They have been in the habit for 
               <br />
               many years of going up to Canada to work, but 
               <br />
               Canada has been tightening up her immigration 
               <br />
               regulations lately, and what many of our people 
               <br />
               are afraid of is that if confederation is turned 
               <br />
               down that avenue of employment may be closed 
               <br />
               against them. It would be a very bad blow to our 
               <br />
               coast, if that did happen. No matter what we talk 
               <br />
               in this Convention, every man of us knows very 
               <br />
               well that hard times are going to come again to 
               <br />
               this country. They are bound to come, and what 
               <br />
               our people fear is that when hard times come 
               <br />
               again they might ﬁnd themselves bottled up in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, unable to travel freely to Canada 
               <br />
               to earn the dollar that they can’t earn in their own 
               <br />
               country. Many millions of Canadian dollars have 
               <br />
               been earned in this way in the past, and the day 
               <br />
               is coming when we will need the chance to earn 
               <br />
               those Canadian dollars again. But I would not 
               <br />
               have you think that I am advocating confedera- 
               <br />
               tion only because the southwest coast is so 
               <br />
               strongly in favour of it. I am advocating confeder- 
               <br />
               ation because it would be good for the whole 
               <br />
               country, and for all our toilers wherever they may 
               <br />
               live, north, south, east or west. All our people 
               <br />
               may not want to have Canada’s door open to them 
               <br />
               to seek work, when they can’t find it at home, but 
               <br />
               it is not only the chance to work in Canada that 
               <br />
               makes confederation good for Newfoundland. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At the present time, if we want the advantages 
               <br />
               of confederation we have to go to Canada to get 
               <br />
               them. We have to work and live in Canada to get 
               <br />
               them, but if Newfoundland joins up with Canada 
               <br />
               most of those advantages will be brought right 
               <br />
               into Newfoundland itself. Our cost of living will 
               <br />
               come down, and although it may not come down 
               <br />
               quite as low as in Canada, yet it will come down 
               <br />
               a lot. Free trade with Canada will see to that, for 
               <br />
               it is plain common sense that when we take off
