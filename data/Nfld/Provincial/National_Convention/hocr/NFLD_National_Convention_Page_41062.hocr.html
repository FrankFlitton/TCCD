               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I want to reply 
               <br />
               to Mr. Reddy, but there is lots of time if Mr. Hol-

               I congratulate very sincerely upon his wit and 
               <br />
               humour. The point, the one point in the speech 
               <br />
               sir, which I think demands a reply is this: that l 
               <br />
               quarrelled with Major Cashin, the chairman of 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee, and with the members of 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee, for having brought in a 
               <br />
               budget looking three years ahead, and that I then 
               <br />
               am so inconsistent as to bring in one for eight 
               <br />
               years ahead. Now that’s the point of that speech. 
               <br />
               Sir, there is no point in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> There is not a good

               bring in a ﬁrm budget for three years. I have not 
               <br />
               done any such thing. What they said was that each

               <br />
               million a year. Now sir, for any man in this 
               <br />
               Convention or out of it to get up and say that in 
               <br />
               the coming eight years the government of the 
               <br />
               Province of Newfoundland could collect, on an 
               <br />
               average, $5 million a year revenue, $40 million 
               <br />
               in eight years, through taxation, is surely, surely, 
               <br />
               not to be put in the same class as forecasting $30 
               <br />
               million by taxation, $30 million for the next three 
               <br />
               years. Surely there is all the difference in the 
               <br />
               world. I estimate that the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, if we become a province. would need 
               <br />
               to spend in the ﬁrst eight years $ l 20 million; $80 
               <br />
               million of that would come in from sources that 
               <br />
               we know about, that are in the Grey Book. That 
               <br />
               leaves $40 million to get by taxation in eight 
               <br />
               years, an average of $5 million a year. You don't 
               <br />
               have to be a prophet or a ﬁnancier to be quite 
               <br />

               <br />
               lect in taxes $5 million a year. So that the speech

               which Mr. Reddy has just read out is really quite 
               <br />
               without point. it is comparing two things that are
