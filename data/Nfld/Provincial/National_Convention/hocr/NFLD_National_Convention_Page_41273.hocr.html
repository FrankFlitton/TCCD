               <br />
               The frozen ﬁllet ﬁsh industry is mostly New- 
               <br />
               foundland capital, with I believe some AmerlCan 
               <br />
               capital in North Atlantic Fisheries Ltd., in which 
               <br />
               the Hon. R.B. Job, I understand, has a good deal 
               <br />
               of money invested. Fishery Products Ltd, which 
               <br />
               operates a large ﬁlleting industry on the south 
               <br />
               coast, particularly in Burin and Burgeo, owned 
               <br />
               by Mr. Monroe, is Newfoundland capital —— plus, 
               <br />
               and I am subject to correction on this, some 
               <br />
               American capital. As for the herring industry, we 
               <br />
               know that this is all Newfoundland capital with 
               <br />
               the exception of Mr. Crosbie’s herring oil and 
               <br />
               meal plant at Bay of Islands, in which I under— 
               <br />
               stand there is some American capital. As for the 
               <br />
               lobster ﬁshery, seal ﬁshery, squid ﬁshery, there 
               <br />
               is not as far as I know one single Canadian dollar 
               <br />
               invested in one of these enterprises. A few 
               <br />
               months ago a small Canadian ﬁshing venture was 
               <br />
               under way in Bay of Islands, but that is only a 
               <br />
               year or so old, and it is too early to say how it is 
               <br />
               going to develop. The only Canadian dollar that 
               <br />
               Iknow that is invested in the way of industry that 
               <br />
               is giving work to Newfoundlanders, is in the iron 
               <br />
               ore mines of Bell Island. This mining company 
               <br />
               agreed, I believe, in the beginning, to pay an 
               <br />
               export tax on ore if they exported from New- 
               <br />
               foundland. We know that with the exception of a 
               <br />
               very few years this tax was never paid, and the 
               <br />
               story behind it is not very complimentary to that 
               <br />
               particular company. It is a matter of public record 
               <br />
               that the Hollis Walker inquiry unveiled some of 
               <br />
               the manoeuvres of this company, and that is one 
               <br />
               of the darkest pages in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">history“.1</span> It was a 
               <br />
               dirty, despicable deal, where reputations were 
               <br />
               ruined but where this company still continued 
               <br />
               merrily on its way. So we see, gentlemen, that all 
               <br />

               developing old ones is either Newfoundland, 
               <br />

               <br />
               takes us over and develops our resources. Why? 
               <br />
               For the past 50 years every dollar that we have 
               <br />
               had has been in Canadian hands, and any

               gets an experienced captain to take charge. Then 
               <br />
               he selects for his crew experienced men who have 
               <br />
               ﬁshed on the Grand Bank before, and he spends 
               <br />
               some considerable time and money in ﬁtting out 
               <br />

               the hole, and his year is going to result in a loss. 
               <br />
               If you ask that man to select men who would 
               <br />
               determine his economic welfare not for one year, 
               <br />

               <br />
               would give this reponsibility to? Now, as for 
               <br />
               those who went as a delegation to Ottawa — 
               <br />
               Messrs. Bradley, Higgins, Ashboume, Crum-

               these gentlemen are friends of mine, very ﬁne

               men and I have nothing against them... But they 
               <br />
               were no better qualiﬁed to go to Canada on that 
               <br />
               mission than I was, and I know I am not qualiﬁed. 
               <br />
               The selection of these gentlemen was done in a 
               <br />
               matter of minutes on an afternoon 12 months ago. 
               <br />
               Off they went to Canada with little or no equip— 
               <br />
               ment, and to expect these men to come back here 
               <br />
               with the best terms is expecting miracles. In 
               <br />
               short, the men we sent, through no fault of their 
               <br />
               own, were not qualiﬁed to do the job for which 
               <br />
               they were sent. Would you send them on the 
               <br />
               Grand Bank in your ﬁshing schooner? No. They 
               <br />
               were as qualiﬁed to engage in the Grand Bank 
               <br />
               ﬁshery as they were to engage with the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
