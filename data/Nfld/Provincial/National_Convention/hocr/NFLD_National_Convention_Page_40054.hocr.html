               is going to take time, a week or two, or maybe 
               <br />
               three, at least in the case of some of the nine 
               <br />
               committees. Some may be able to report back 
               <br />
               tentatively within a week. The whole point is that 
               <br />
               it seems to me regrettable, unless there can be 
               <br />
               provided in some way to the reporters, who are 
               <br />
               the eyes and ears of the Newfoundland public, a 
               <br />
               daily statement to keep the interest of the public 
               <br />
               continuously alert. I fear that a good beginning 
               <br />
               made at interesting the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will be stopped abruptly for a week or two and 
               <br />
               then, let’s picture it, a committee reports to the 
               <br />
               Steering Committee that it has done a certain 
               <br />
               amount of work and is able to report, tentatively 
               <br />
               at least; the report is brought in and tabled and the 
               <br />
               whole Convention receives it and it goes to the 
               <br />
               individual men to study. It is a case of the whole 
               <br />
               house meeting merely to receive these reports 
               <br />
               and I fear that there is not only a possibility, but 
               <br />
               a probability, that for the next two to four weeks 
               <br />
               the general assembly of the Convention will dis— 
               <br />
               appear with that amount of time lost completely, 
               <br />
               from this one standpoint of keeping the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span>

               foundland public interested and informed... 
               <br />
               There is nothing personal in it, but I am terribly 
               <br />
               impressed by the need to arouse in our New- 
               <br />
               foundland people a continuous and increasing 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Bradley Mr. Chairman, I appreciate to the 
               <br />
               full all my friend Mr. Smallwood has said... I am 
               <br />
               not quite sure that an adjournment, even for a 
               <br />
               month, will so kill public opinion that it cannot 
               <br />
               be immediately revived when we have something 
               <br />
               to lay before them. The brutal fact is that it is not 
               <br />
               physically possible for the whole Convention and 
               <br />
               the nine committees to meet at the same time. 
               <br />
               Obviously we cannot be in two places at once, 
               <br />
               and if we are to obtain some continuity of 
               <br />
               publicity it must be at the expense of the work of 
               <br />
               the various committees, and that must delay the 
               <br />
               completion of that work. Now if the Convention 
               <br />
               thinks that the value of that continuous publicity 
               <br />
               outweighs the value of speed in the working of 
               <br />
               the committees, why of course that is up to them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam I agree with Mr. Smallwood, not 
               <br />
               altogether but to some extent, but as Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               says we must not do anything to keep us here 
               <br />
               longer than necessary. Anything that we can do 
               <br />
               to expedite matters I believe it is our duty to do. 
               <br />
               I was wondering, at the 3 o’clock meeting of the 
               <br />
               committees, if the session could not meet here, as 
               <br />

               there may be some other people who would like 
               <br />
               to place questions, and the longer these are 
               <br />
               delayed naturally the longer we will be waiting 
               <br />
               for the answers.

               Mr. Ballam It is just merely a suggestion... 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman The people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               have waited for almost 14 years, and I feel that 
               <br />
               what they want now is cold, hard facts. Reporting 
               <br />
               over the air and to the newspapers is all right, but 
               <br />
               I feel that what they want is nothing sensational 
               <br />
               at all, just the facts. I feel this is a good move, 
               <br />
               because I don’t see how we are going to get 
               <br />
               anywhere if we are going to meet in full session 
               <br />
               every day like this. I don’t think any of us want 
               <br />
               to be here longer than necessary, I think we 
               <br />
               should get the work done and put the information 
               <br />
               before the members. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett I am somewhat in accord with the 
               <br />
               sentiments of Mr. Smallwood, that it is not pos- 
               <br />
               sible to keep the interest of the public alive if we 
               <br />
               adjourn the assembly for a considerable period, 
               <br />
               and I am wondering if we could compromise a 
               <br />
               little on this plan and have the committees meet 
               <br />
               on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 
               <br />
               and then have the Convention meet on Friday. In 
               <br />
               some instances these committees are going to 
               <br />
               extend over a somewhat long drawn out time, and 
               <br />
               I feel that if we knew that the Convention would 
               <br />
               come in session once a week, it might make up 
               <br />
               for the lack of continuity. I think Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               and all of us would consider this a compromise. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, I agree with the 
               <br />
               remarks of Mr. Jackman. If this Convention ad- 
               <br />
               journs, and meets, say once or twice a week, it 
               <br />
               adjoums in order to give the different committees 
               <br />
               time to get the information that our constituents 
               <br />
               are asking for and need, and I feel sure, sir, 
               <br />
               regardless of the Convention adjourning for a 
               <br />
               week or two, the people are not going to lose 
               <br />
               interest. The people will be informed that the 
               <br />
               Convention is adjourned for a purpose, and that 
               <br />
               the representative they sent to this Convention is 
               <br />
               seeking information for them, and that the infor- 
               <br />
               mation cannot be gotten together while this Con— 
               <br />
               vention sits daily. There must be adjournment, 
               <br />
               and time given the members of the committees in 
               <br />
               order to seek this information which is so vitally 
               <br />
               important to this Convention. I fail to see where 
               <br />
               the citizens of this country can object when they 
               <br />
