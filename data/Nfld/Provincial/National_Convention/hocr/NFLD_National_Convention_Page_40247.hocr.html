               <br />
               maintain it will be high, but while we will not 
               <br />
               have it open in winter, we will have a road across

               I notice Governor Macdonald in his year-end 
               <br />
               talk, spoke of the transinsular highway. The plans 
               <br />
               have been delayed too long. If it is going to take 
               <br />
               from the railway, then that is just too bad. The 
               <br />
               only way a country can be developed is by roads. 
               <br />
               As far as St. John’s is concerned, we do not

               apologise for the money spent; our population is

               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood What has surprised me most is 
               <br />
               the complete silence of members who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do‘</span> not 
               <br />
               come from the Avalon Peninsula. There is one 
               <br />
               paragraph of three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lines:1</span> “Included in this is an 
               <br />

               <br />
               years on the 9.2 miles between St. John’s and 
               <br />
               Topsail, to reconstruct, recondition and pave the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the other members represent have not got condi- 
               <br />
               tions such as they have in the parts I represent. In

               <br />
               your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ankles.</span> There are places where you have to 
               <br />
               leave the road altogether. I wonder what the 
               <br />
               people of Gambo will think when they hear that 
               <br />
               in the past two years $500,000 has been spent 
               <br />
               from St. John’s to Woodstock?2 What for? I do 
               <br />
               not know a great deal aboutthe area, butmy guess 
               <br />
               is that that was done for a few people who have 
               <br />
               country houses out around Topsail, so that they 
               <br />
               can get in their cars and get out there easier. I 
               <br />
               cannot imagine what other reason there could be. 
               <br />
               And the rest of the country is up to its shins in 
               <br />
               bog. I am thinking of the islands down there also

               connection with the transinsular highway, a nice 
               <br />
               scheme, providing we have the money to build it. 
               <br />
               I am very disappointed that no money is to be 
               <br />
               spent on the Northern Peninsula. For 40 years we 
               <br />
               have been wanting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roads,</span> We are very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isolated.</span> 
               <br />
               Instead of a transinsular road they should link up 
               <br />
               the isolated places. In the Bonne Bay area we 
               <br />
               have fared fairly well. During the past ten years 
               <br />
               we have been linked up with Deer Lake and 
               <br />
               Corner <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brook.</span> The distance from Bonne Bay 
               <br />
               north is 125 miles, and 75 miles of that is without 
               <br />
               a harbour. I sent freight out of St. John’s the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               week in November and where is it? At Corner 
               <br />
               Brook. In Clarenville there is a lot of freight for 
               <br />
               that part of the northeast <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Coast.</span> What are the 
               <br />
               people going to do this winter? We are 40 years 
               <br />
               asking for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">road.</span> Do they want the people to 
               <br />
               starve? l have been asked, “What have you got 
               <br />
               there?” We have some of the best salmon rivers. 
               <br />
               I was interested in the tourist trade. One tourist 
               <br />
               came down to Lomond4 to do some fishing and 
               <br />
               had to wait a day to get to the rivers. He was 
               <br />
               paying $25 a day besides other expenses. We 
               <br />
               have some of the best lobster ﬁshing grounds on 
               <br />
               that coast, but there is no way of getting out to it.
