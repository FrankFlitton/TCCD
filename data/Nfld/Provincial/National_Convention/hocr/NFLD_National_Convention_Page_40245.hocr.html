               Mr. Smallwood I think the smartest thing 1

               of the West Coast Labourers’ Union and was 
               <br />

               <br />
               workmen, which was 40 cents an hour. Our union 
               <br />
               secured 58 cents an hour for labourers, and 61 
               <br />
               cents or 64 cents for truck drivers. The labour rate 
               <br />
               is 58 cents in the Humber district. Of course we

               Mr. Jackman Are they paying an equal rate
