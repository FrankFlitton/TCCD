               I know all about the war; I was in one, and sent 
               <br />
               1,000 men to this one. A lot of them did not come 
               <br />
               back to this country which they loved. And they, 
               <br />
               and those that came back, what would they say to 
               <br />
               me ifI got up here every five or ten minutes of

               <br />
               them birth, for which they fought and for which 
               <br />
               they died, and in which today their mothers and 
               <br />
               fathers are weeping? What would they say if I got

               up there today and damned their native land 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, I have no desire in the 
               <br />
               world to play on words in an honest effort to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out the truth of Newfoundland’s position. One or 
               <br />
               two things did arise out of the last speech but one, 
               <br />
               to which I would like to refer. I entirely agree 
               <br />
               with what the member from Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               said if he is basing everything on a monied 
               <br />
               economy. There is, however, another side to the 
               <br />
               picture; that we ought to look for real wealth in 
               <br />
               the community as distinguished from mere 
               <br />
               money wealth. We know that because of the war 
               <br />
               a great deal of the real wealth of the neighbouring 
               <br />
               continent has been torn up and destroyed, thereby 
               <br />
               creating in other parts of the world real wealth 
               <br />
               which was not real wealth until it was begun to 
               <br />
               be exploited and used. For example the Labrador 
               <br />
               iron. Just because the world has used its resources 
               <br />
               in certain parts of the world, its iron ore, the value 
               <br />
               of the Labrador increases because it represents 
               <br />
               real wealth. Money is only a measure of real 
               <br />
               wealth, and I have no doubt that after we get over 
               <br />
               this crazy spending brought about by the backing 
               <br />
               up of surpluses in private hands and government 
               <br />
               hands, or whoever it may be, that we will come 
               <br />
               back to a more normal position, but just because 
               <br />
               America and Canada and other parts of the world 
               <br />
               have turned up some of their real wealth in the 
               <br />
               form of their natural resources, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has become that much richer if we exploit it. For 
               <br />
               example, iron ore. Everything has been brought 
               <br />
               out here to show that the United States’ position 
               <br />
               is entirely different from what it was some years 
               <br />
               ago, and that makes the Labrador position and our

               <br />
               is true in our timber resources. The same may or

               <br />
               concerned that depends entirely upon how we use 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I want to interject just one other word. When 
               <br />
               we were discussing this war economy and our 
               <br />
               peacetime industries we ought to draw a distinc- 
               <br />
               tion which is drawn by every economist. 
               <br />
               Whatever causes this prosperity, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt and I agree entirely with Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               that it was caused by the war, that it was due to 
               <br />
               the war, and after the war is over there is set up a 
               <br />
               peace economy, and that peace economy depends 
               <br />
               to a large extent upon what has happened because 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war.</span> Nevertheless, it is and cannot be 
               <br />
               anything else but a peace economy. Now I have 
               <br />
               no desire to bring other countries into this picture, 
               <br />
               but I think that the Canadian industrial position 
               <br />
               after the last war, because of the last war, got a 
               <br />
               tremendous boom. Part of that industrial boom is 
               <br />
               carried on to peacetime. That is the position I 
               <br />
               think that Newfoundland is in at the present time. 
               <br />
               So therefore there is not much point in seeing 
               <br />
               what actually happened, whether we are now in 
               <br />
               a wartime economy or not. The point is that 
               <br />
               arising out of the war we have a much better 
               <br />
               peacetime economy than we have ever had in the 
               <br />
