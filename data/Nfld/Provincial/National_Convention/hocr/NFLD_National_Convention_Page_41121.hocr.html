               Mr. Cashin When the committee rose yesterday 
               <br />
               afternoon, I was addressing the Convention on 
               <br />
               the issue of confederation. This afternoon, whilst 
               <br />
               it would be my privilege, according to what has 
               <br />
               been going on here lately, to give some “tedious

               When I took my seat yesterday I was discuss-

               ing the Marshall Plan and how it would affect 
               <br />
               Canada. I pointed out that Canada is longing for 
               <br />
               this Marshall Plan to go through in order that she 
               <br />
               may get some very badly needed American dol- 
               <br />
               lars. For this reason, if this plan goes through it 
               <br />
               will involve an expenditure of $7 billion a year, 
               <br />
               a lot of purchases for which might be made in 
               <br />
               Canada, and consequently will give Canada con- 
               <br />
               siderable American funds which she now needs 
               <br />
               so badly. I intend to go on from that part of my 
               <br />
               talk.

               Let us take another look at these proposals. 
               <br />
               Annex IV in the Grey Bookl tells us that the total 
               <br />
               revenue which Canada will expect to obtain from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, if we become a province, is 
               <br />
               slightly over $20 million annually. These ﬁgures 
               <br />
               may be just guesses, otherwise they are 
               <br />
               fraudulent and dishonest.
