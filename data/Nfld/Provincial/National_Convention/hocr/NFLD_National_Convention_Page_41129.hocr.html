               of this pact it was provided that Canada would 
               <br />
               control and maintain all defense locations under 
               <br />
               the Canadian flag. What does this mean? It means 
               <br />
               that all military, naval and air bases in this 
               <br />
               country would be occupied by Canadian forces. 
               <br />
               It would mean that all Americans would be 
               <br />
               evacuated. It would mean that some $3,500 or 
               <br />
               more Newfoundlanders now employed on the 
               <br />
               American bases would be in jeopardy of losing 
               <br />
               their jobs. It would mean that this country would 
               <br />
               be deprived of the very considerable amount of 
               <br />
               American dollars which are now being expended 
               <br />
               and circulated. Of course, such a set-up should be 
               <br />
               highly proﬁtable to Canada, inasmuch as it would 
               <br />
               consist of her receiving a free gift, as it were: after 
               <br />

               to bring the matter to the attention of the 
               <br />
               Canadian government. I regard such an omission 
               <br />
               as evidence of gross neglect and dereliction in 
               <br />
               their duty of protecting and safeguarding the 
               <br />
               interests of Newfoundland. But it would seem 
               <br />
               that as far as Ottawa is concerned, the rights of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland are of no importance whatever in 
               <br />
               this one—sided contract which they have sent to 
               <br />
               us. Why, Mr. Chairman, if there was nothing else 
               <br />
               of an adverse nature, I question whether we have 
               <br />
               not in this instance alone grounds, ample 
               <br />
               grounds, for condemning the Canadian proposals 
               <br />
               and washing our hands of the whole matter. Now, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, if you want to. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If it is agreeable to members we 
               <br />
               will take a recess. 
               <br />
               [Short recess] 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Now Mr. Chairman, before I begin 
               <br />
               to refer in detail to Mr. Smallwood’s proposed 
               <br />
               budget, let us see what is to happen to our ac- 
               <br />
               cumulated surplus. This, according to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, would amount to somewhere in the 
               <br />
               vicinity of $30 million. According to the 
               <br />
               Economic Report it was $40 million, but it is $38 
               <br />
               million now, seeing that the Commission govem- 
               <br />
               ment has seen ﬁt to do away with $2 million. 
               <br />
               However, we will use Mr. Smallwood’s ﬁgures 
               <br />
               and say the accumulated surplus is $30 million. 
               <br />
               Nevertheless, we must remember that with the 
               <br />
               advances made to the Housing Corporation, with 
               <br />
               the inclusion of loans to various ﬁrms for the 
               <br />
               development of the ﬁsheries, with balances owed 
               <br />
               by Great Britain in connection with her account 
               <br />
               for the operation of the Gander airport, together 
               <br />
               with other amounts owed for pensions, etc., our 
               <br />
               accumulated surplus today must be around $38 
               <br />
               million. However, as I said, we will use Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood’s ﬁgure. Take page 3 of the Grey
