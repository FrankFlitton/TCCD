               <br />
               deferred it for 48 hours. It can hardly be alleged 
               <br />
               that the thing was railroaded through and that 
               <br />
               every member was not given sufﬁcient oppor-

               tunity to speak to the business then before the 
               <br />
               Chair. As I intimated on Wednesday and again 
               <br />
               yesterday afternoon, I think I have exercised my 
               <br />
               discretion to the utmost limits. I feel now that the 
               <br />
               time has come when the fate of this motion must 
               <br />
               become the responsibility of the House. Before I 
               <br />
               put the motion, I want to make it clear that it is 
               <br />
               not debatable, not amendable. The House there- 
               <br />
               fore must, accept or reject the motion as is. The 
               <br />
               motion before the Chair is “that the debate on the 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Higgins Before going on to the next order 
               <br />
               on the order paper, I would like to make a sug- 
               <br />
               gestion to you and to the House. It appears fairly 
               <br />
               deﬁnite now that we are going to try and conclude 
               <br />
               our business before the end of this month. That 
               <br />
               would give us very little more than ten clear days 
               <br />
               between now and the end of our sessions. We 
               <br />
               have given no thought or no deﬁnite expressed 
               <br />
               thought to the idea of how we are going to con- 
               <br />
               clude the business of the house - how we are 
               <br />
               going to ﬁnally wind up the Convention, what 
               <br />
               procedure we should take, whether it should be 
               <br />
               by formal report drafted by a committee of the 
               <br />
               House or some other such procedure, or just in 
               <br />
               what form the ﬁnal wind-up should be made. For 
               <br />
               that reason I feel that before we go on to another 
               <br />
               matter, because of the shortness of time, it would 
               <br />
               be advisable in the interests of members and the 
               <br />
               business of the House, if instead of discussing the 
               <br />
               next motion we decided to go into a private 
               <br />
               meeting immediately after we adjourn, if mem- 
               <br />
               bers are agreeable to adjourn, to discuss the 
               <br />
               whole matter. With that idea in mind and with the 
               <br />
               consent of the whole House, I now move that we 
               <br />
               adjourn until Monday or Tuesday and immedi-

               Mr. Chairman I think the point is very well 
               <br />
               taken. As members will recall, section 3 lays 
               <br />
               upon this Convention the duty of making recom- 
               <br />
               mendations. Further than that, standing order 39 
               <br />
               requires members to make a report to the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs on the 
               <br />
               forms of government which, in the opinion of the 
               <br />
               Convention, would be inserted in the referendum 
               <br />
               presumably to take place next spring. The matter 
               <br />
               has given me considerable concern; and while I 
               <br />
               have some ideas about it, I would like to put them 
               <br />
               before members and have an exchange of ideas. 
               <br />
               We have to decide future procedure particularly 
               <br />
               in view of the fact that time is running out. The 
               <br />
               sooner we get at it, the sooner we will know 
               <br />
               where everybody is. The House must decide what 
               <br />
               is going to happen. I associate myself un- 
               <br />
               qualiﬁedly with the view expressed by Mr. Hig~ 
               <br />
