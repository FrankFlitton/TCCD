               Mr. Bailey <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">....One</span> thing I have been wondering, 
               <br />
               and that is what has been done with patients from 
               <br />
               different parts of the island and different hospi- 
               <br />
               tals where they have no care going back to their 
               <br />
               homes. I firmly believe that a lot of spreading of 
               <br />
               the white killer has been done in that way, 
               <br />
               whether through total ignorance or carelessness, 
               <br />
               I do not know. The Northern Rangerl should 
               <br />
               have been a modem ship — she was a ship which 
               <br />
               carried passengers and hospital patients from 
               <br />
               north to south and from south to north. Fishermen 
               <br />
               also travel on that ship. There was a case of a man 
               <br />
               who returned from Belle Isle and shortly after 
               <br />
               two of his girls got sick. Four months before he 
               <br />
               had called in a doctor and who said there was no 
               <br />
               TB. When it was all boiled down, it was found 
               <br />
               that there was a TB patient travelling in the 
               <br />
               steerage with that man. It ended up with ﬁve of 
               <br />
               the family getting TB. There should be a special 
               <br />
               place on the boats where patients from or to 
               <br />
               hospital can be placed. Ifa nurse is travelling with 
               <br />
               them, there should be accommodation for that 
               <br />
               nurse. There have been cases on the Northern 
               <br />
               Ranger where the nurse had to sleep on the table. 
               <br />
               That is one of the greatest crimes against us.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Mr. Bailey has raised the point of TB 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sengers.</span> When I returned from my Christmas 
               <br />
               vacation — you will understand there is only one 
               <br />
               boat on the Placentia Bay route from Lamaline to 
               <br />
               Argentia — at that particular time the boat was 
               <br />
               packed, some sitting on chairs, some lying across 
               <br />
               tables, some walking about the deck, etc. If you 
               <br />
               got a place to lie down for half an hour, you were 
               <br />
               lucky. I had occasion to go down in the second 
               <br />
               class to see someone. The second class was also 
               <br />
               overcrowded. When I went down someone 
               <br />
               remarked, “We have a very sick woman on 
               <br />
               board.” As I walked along I looked just below me 
               <br />
               in a berth, a mere frame of a person. Right down 
               <br />
               there among a crowd of passengers... The boat 
               <br />
               was overcrowded and is nothing but a spreader 
               <br />
               of disease, and to have a patient in that condition 
               <br />
               in the second class among a crowd of passengers, 
               <br />
               I really and sincerely think it is not good 
               <br />
