               <br />
               Bradley’s amendment to the amendment because 
               <br />
               it supplies the missing link to this debate, and let

               <br />
               a position to talk about it intelligently. I am not a

               confederate at the present time, but I would like 
               <br />
               to see all sides of the question brought out. There 
               <br />
               is no harm in putting the machinery in order, and 
               <br />
               if the proper machinery is set up I am sure we can 
               <br />
               make our own time as regards sending a delega-

               <br />
               I support the amendment of Mr. Bradley.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Vardy I feel I would be unreasonably 
               <br />
               prolonging this debate if I spoke lengthily, so my 
               <br />
               remarks shall be as brief as possible. Up to the 
               <br />
               present I am not a confederate. On the contrary, 
               <br />
               I have been accused very many times of being too 
               <br />
               much Newfoundland. But there is one thing I 
               <br />
               shall make clear and that is that I have always 
               <br />
               been big enough to avoid the use of personalities 
               <br />
               and to respect the opinions of all persons, ir- 
               <br />
               respective of their political afﬁliations, although 
               <br />
               time and again I have been misquoted by some of 
               <br />
               my best friends. I support in all earnestness 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley’s amendment to the amendment. 
               <br />
               Mr. MacDonald Mr. Chairman, speaking to 
               <br />
               the original motion here a few days ago I think I 
               <br />
               made a statement thatI would support the motion. 
               <br />
               Since then there have been amendments offered 
               <br />
               by Mr. Penney and Mr. Bradley. The original 
               <br />
               motion made by Mr. Smallwood did not state any 
               <br />
               particular time when all these things were about 
               <br />
               to happen. Mr. Penney’s amendment conveyed 
               <br />
               something like what was known in the old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politi.</span> 
               <br />
               cal days as giving the question the six months’ 
               <br />
               hoist. If that amendment is carried there may 
               <br />
               never be a chance of getting this information now 
               <br />
               sought and this whole debate may have to be gone 
               <br />
               over again... For that reason I cannot support 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney’s amendment. I understand from 
               <br />
               some of the speeches that Mr. Bradley’s amend- 
               <br />
               ment resembles to a certain extent the original 
               <br />
               motion, and it means that this Convention will 
               <br />
               still leave on record that it desires to be fully 
               <br />
               informed on all matters and provides that a 
               <br />
               delegation shall not proceed to Ottawa before 
               <br />
               January Ist, 1947. That gives us something 
               <br />
               deﬁnite and for that reason I will support <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span>

               <br />
               person. I gave my support to Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               motion and my reason therefor. Now the majority 
               <br />
               of delegates have expressed their willingness to 
               <br />
               have a delegation sent to Ottawa and the 
               <br />
               delegates who supported Mr. Penney’s amend- 
               <br />
               ment, without supporting the main question, did 
               <br />
               so only because of the time factor provided; 
               <br />
               others have supported Mr. Bradley’s amendment 
               <br />
               because it offers a compromise and because a 
               <br />
               deﬁnite time is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">set.</span> It is highly desirable that we 
               <br />
               get back to discussions of committees and that

               can only be achieved by a prompt disposition of 
               <br />
               the whole subject matter now before the Chair, 
               <br />
               for my opinion is that this Convention has no 
               <br />
               right to refuse to examine any issue brought 
               <br />
               before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Personally I am willing to explore every 
               <br />
               form of government, including representative, 
               <br />
               responsible and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation.</span> The people of 
               <br />
               Bonavista North want to know the terms, if any, 
               <br />
               that are going to be made with Canada. I cannot 
               <br />
               conceive how any delegate can stand on his feet 
               <br />
               and say we have no right to seek such and such 
               <br />
               terms from Canada. I very much regret, however, 
               <br />
               that there was no trip to Ottawa offered me. But 
               <br />
               this is not the time to discuss transportation or 
               <br />
               such like matters and I reaffirm my obligation to 
               <br />
               the people who sent me here. I am not prepared 
               <br />
               to say whether confederation is good or bad, and 
               <br />
               I resent the statement made that we are 100 years 
               <br />
               behind the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times.</span> I am prepared to examine any 
               <br />
               issue brought in here in the best interests of

               Newfoundland and its people...

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, I rise to agree with 
               <br />
               my colleague from Grand Falls, and to show there 
               <br />
               is no collusion between us. The debate no doubt 
               <br />
               is amusing. First we have a man proposing a 
               <br />
               motion in which he already believed, in fact we 
               <br />
               know he believed in it because he has been tight- 
               <br />
               ing forit for years, and he believes in the principle 
               <br />
               of that motion which was foisted upon us. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins seconded the motion and in the next 
               <br />
               breath he does not agree with it at all. Then 
               <br />
               Mr. Burry stated last week that he agreed with the 
               <br />
               motion, although it was a little premature. This 
               <br />
               afternoon he was supporting the amendment to 
               <br />
               the amendment. My colleague supported 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s motion; now he is supporting 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley’s. Then we have M'r. Ballam alter- 
               <br />
               ing his mind. I think this issue is not one which 
               <br />
