               Mr. Chairman In order to facilitate the House

               Mr. Higgins 1 don’t mind, but Mr. Ashboume is 
               <br />
               the one to do that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I see. Mr. Higgins requested 
               <br />
               whether or not the speciﬁc allowances set forth 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Yes, 72 to 94 both inclusive, 
               <br />
               thank you, as to whether or not, Mr. Ashbourne, 
               <br />
               you would look at these, and state whether or not, 
               <br />
               in your opinion, all or any of these allowances 
               <br />
               would apply to Newfoundland veterans who 
               <br />
               served in World War II. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne I will do the best i can. I think 
               <br />
               in answering the question before us l might say 
               <br />
               that I have here now the data about the rates and 
               <br />

               no pension payable in respect of a child born in 
               <br />

               Canada this has been extended up to May 30, 
               <br />
               1944; and there is one item that I would like to 
               <br />
               bring to the attention of the House — the matter 
               <br />
               of war pensioners’ allowances in Canada: 
               <br />
               Allowances for veterans 60 years of age 
               <br />
               or, if younger, incapable of self-main- 
               <br />
               tenance. A veteran who served in a theatre of 
               <br />
               war; or served in two wars, but not necessari— 
               <br />
               ly in a theatre of war; and who is over 60 
               <br />
               years of age, or if under 60 uncmployable due 
               <br />
               to physical or economic reasons (female age 
               <br />
               55 applies), may receive an allowance. This 
               <br />
               allowance is up to $365 per annum for single 
               <br />
               person, or $730 per annum for married per- 
               <br />
               son, dependent upon ﬁnancial means. A 
               <br />
               veteran may have other income up to $125 
               <br />
               per annum if single or $250 per annum if 
               <br />
               married and still receive full allowance; any 
               <br />
               income in excess of these amounts is 
               <br />
               deducted. In addition, veterans may have up 
               <br />
               to $125 casual earnings per year without 
               <br />
               allowances being reduced and an interest of 
               <br />
               up to $4,000 in the house in which he resides. 
               <br />
               Also up to $25 per year unearned income. 
               <br />
               Maximum payable to childless widow is 
               <br />
               $265 per annum or to widow with children 
               <br />
               $730. Same earnings allowed as for single or
