               <br />

               Mr. Jackman I have listened for the past eight 
               <br />
               or nine days to the arguments pro and con regard— 
               <br />
               ing the Economic Report. First of all, I want to 
               <br />
               put myself on record as agreeing with it. The 
               <br />
               people who made up this report are good New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, out to try and do the best they can 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland. They have no crystal balls to 
               <br />
               peer into the foreseeable future. as the term has 
               <br />
               been bandied around here. In fact there is only 
               <br />
               one country today which possesses that crystal 
               <br />
               ball, and that is Russia. In Russia today they know 
               <br />
               what they are going to do for the next five years. 
               <br />
               I know something about communism. I do not 
               <br />
               agree with it. I believe in democracy, but I do not 
               <br />
               think democracy should be put on the spot just 
               <br />
               because democracy cannot foresee what is going 
               <br />
               to happen in the next year or two. I heard some 
               <br />
               of the critics of this Economic Report refer to our 
               <br />
               ﬁnance ministers of the past and their budgets. In 
               <br />
               1929 I saw people fall out of windows on one of 
               <br />
               the richest streets in the world, in one of the 
               <br />
               richest countries, because of false forecasts... I 
               <br />
               had to walk with 14 million of my brothers in the 
               <br />
               richest country in the world, looking for work. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I want to be very brief. I have no 
               <br />
               wish whatever to retard the session. I want to get 
               <br />
               it over with. I am fed up with so much of what 
               <br />
               has been said here. There has been a lot of hot air. 
               <br />
               Let us get down to facts. I believe that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New:</span> 
               <br />
               foundland is self-supporting. I will go further and 
               <br />
               make the belief stronger, and say that right here 
               <br />
               in this Convention there are men who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satiS&lt;</span>

               tied to put their money into Newfoundland. They

               the people who employ labour today in New-

               Mr. Hollett Just one or two remarks relative to 
               <br />
               something said here yesterday. There was one 
               <br />
               thing said by Mr. Bradley in speaking on the 
               <br />
               Economic Report, he said, “We are not here to 
               <br />
               espouse any particular cause“. I thought we were 
               <br />
               here to espouse the cause of Newfoundland. We 
               <br />
               have heard it from Mr. Bradley, we are not here 
               <br />
               to espouse any particular cause. I would ask 
               <br />
               members of the Convention to note that. Whether 
               <br />
               he was referring to any particular form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment or the welfare of the people, I know not. 
               <br />
               But, according to Mr. Bradley, you must not 
               <br />
               espouse any particular cause. 
               <br />

               Then in his analysis of the ﬁgures brought in 
               <br />
               by the Finance Committee, he did notelect to take 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18974947.</span> He thought it would not be fairto take 
               <br />
               in six years of war when Newfoundland enjoyed 
               <br />
               this false <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">economy,</span> So he put it back seven years, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18904939,</span> and by so doing, instead of working 
               <br />
               out a surplus as the Finance Committee had done 
               <br />
               over that period of years, of $20 million by 
               <br />
               some manipulation or juggling he made out that 
               <br />
               this country had a deficit of $20 million. There 
               <br />
               was one particular statement which I expected 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley to say, but which for some reason he 
               <br />
               did not say. (I wish Mr. Bradley was here today, 
               <br />
               I don‘t want to say anything behind anybody’s 
               <br />
               back.) He did not elect to say anything what— 
               <br />
               socver about a little war fought between 1914 and 
               <br />
               l9l8, which war, up to the present time, has cost 
               <br />
               this country up to $40—50 million. It would have
