               Some of us, sir, have been accused of talking 
               <br />
               politics. Maybe we are. Mr. Bradley, in speaking 
               <br />
               to Mr. Higgins’ motion a few days ago, said that 
               <br />
               before he was elected he regarded the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion as a non-political party, but it had not turned 
               <br />
               out so. I am in accord with Mr. Bradley in that 
               <br />
               statement, but will the confederates get up and 
               <br />
               tell us about the secret gathering in St. John’s in 
               <br />
               August 1946, after Mr. Smallwood’s return from 
               <br />
               Canada, prior to the opening of this Convention? 
               <br />
               Will they tell us about the meeting of these 12 
               <br />
               members of the Convention in the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Hotel in 1946, shortly after the Convention 
               <br />
               opened? Will they tell us of their having Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood read them his speech which was to 
               <br />
               have been delivered on the introduction of the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst confederation deliberation motion? Oh no! 
               <br />
               Do the 12 remember how he was advised not to 
               <br />
               give that political speech, and how he promised 
               <br />
               not to read it? But did he give that speech? I ask 
               <br />
               you gentlemen, did he give it? Oh yes, he gave it, 
               <br />
               and so brought into this Convention political 
               <br />
               controversy which has been present ever since. 
               <br />
               How futile, how silly, to now accuse some of us 
               <br />
               of playing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politics</span> I wonder what you would call 
               <br />
               the speeches which the introducer of this motion 
               <br />
               made? Oh no, not political speeches, just little 
               <br />
               ﬁreside chats, sir. Now I am not blaming Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood for talking politics. He is right in 
               <br />
               doing so. He believes in confederation I take it, 
               <br />
               just as Iwould deny it as being in the best interests 
               <br />
               of this country. As for me, I shall not be satisﬁed 
               <br />
               until every man and woman in this country is a 
               <br />
               politician, and then you may expect good govem~ 
               <br />
               ment, whether it be confederation, responsible or 
               <br />
               Commission or some other form.

               Now, although I cannot conscientiously vote 
               <br />
               for this motion, there is very little doubt in my 
               <br />
               mind but that it will be placed on the ballot. In

               visited my constituency, if you might call it that, 
               <br />
               a couple of weeks ago, and Ibelieve he was asked 
               <br />
               a certain question relative to that very point, if I 
               <br />
               can lay hands on it. No. At any rate I remember 
               <br />
               it very well. He was asked this question a few

               editorial which appeared in one of our evening 
               <br />
               papers on Saturday past, let me say that the 
               <br />
               Convention members who are lined up in favour 
               <br />
               of the restoration of responsible government 
               <br />
               have no fear for the results of the referendum; but 
               <br />
               let me also say that the Convention members who 
               <br />
               have lined up in favour of confederation are 
               <br />
               indeed a sorry, sorry group.

               Now, sometime ago when discussing these 
               <br />
               proposals for union with Canada I outlined brief- 
               <br />
               ly the history of the tax agreement which the 
               <br />
               federal government was endeavouring to reach 
               <br />
               agreement on with the various provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ments, and I wound up by referring to Canada as 
               <br />
               “united in war, but divided in peace”, and that is 
               <br />
               undoubtedly a fact. Only the other day Premier 
               <br />
               Duplessis of Quebec hoisted his provincial ﬂag 
               <br />
               with great fanfare. No longer will the Union Jack 
               <br />
               fly from the Quebec provincial legislature build- 
               <br />
               ing. They will consent to fly it over a side 
               <br />
               entrance however, should the Govemor—General 
               <br />
               consent to visit Quebec. Are these the people 
               <br />
               with whom we are to federate? I realise of course 
               <br />
               that this is a gentle hint to the federal government 
               <br />
               to keep hands off as far as Quebec is concerned, 
               <br />
               but even Quebec cannot break away from con- 
               <br />
               federation is she wanted to, except by force of 
               <br />
               arms. Once we join up with Canada, we join up 
               <br />
               for keeps. We cannot secede. Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               will tell you that we can, but of course he spoke
