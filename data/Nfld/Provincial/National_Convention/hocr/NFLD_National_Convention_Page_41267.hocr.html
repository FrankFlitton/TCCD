               every man, woman and child in Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               liable for $220, and that every man, woman and 
               <br />
               child in Canada is liable for $932. So that if we 
               <br />
               join Canada we cease to have this burden of $220 
               <br />
               around our necks, and we take on a new burden 
               <br />
               of $922 instead. I was surprised some time ago to 
               <br />
               hear the good member for Twillingate attempt to 
               <br />
               say that a change from $220 to $932 was really 
               <br />
               nothing to worry about. Since this Convention 
               <br />
               began I have noted that no man here has shown 
               <br />
               a more scrupulous regard for clearing expendi- 
               <br />
               ture, watching our surpluses and our resources. 
               <br />
               But suddenly the good gentleman blossoms forth 
               <br />
               and goes on a bus, so to speak... Oh, that is a mere 
               <br />
               bagatelle, a per capita tax of $932. Mr. Ash- 
               <br />
               boume attempted to justify it by stating that to a 
               <br />
               big man, or a big business, a big debt is no more 
               <br />
               then a small debt to a small man. That may or may 
               <br />
               not be so. But it is not so if the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland become bigger men, if we enter into 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation</span> We will have to ﬁsh on the French 
               <br />
               Shore, on the Labrador, or if Mr. Ashboume 
               <br />
               wants it nearer home, Twillingate Long Point. 
               <br />
               And the fact that these ﬁshermen are into con- 
               <br />
               federation is not going to put any more ﬁsh in 
               <br />
               their traps. They are still the same ﬁshermen, 
               <br />
               doing the same things as before, and I doubt if 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume or anybody else will pay them 
               <br />
               any more for a quintal ﬁsh in order to pay this 
               <br />
               additional burden.

               And now with respect to the famous baby 
               <br />
               bonus that we’ve heard so much about. The 
               <br />
               Canadian trade index says that it cost Canadians 
               <br />
               annually $25 million in taxes to meet this al— 
               <br />
               lowance. This means that there is on average a 
               <br />
               tax of $20 per person on each man, woman and 
               <br />
               child. If the tax were raised by taking from the 
               <br />
               rich, it might have a Robin Hood justification 
               <br />
               But it is raised as part of the general revenue and 
               <br />
               is collected in part as import duties. The poor pay 
               <br />
               as well as the rich. This baby bonus has good 
               <br />
               features, but like a lot of these things, we would 
               <br />
               ﬁnd out in time it has a hurtful effect as well, and 
               <br />
               all is not gold that glitters. I could go on much 
               <br />
               further with respect to what we would have to pay 
               <br />
               in the shape of taxes if we became part of Canada. 
               <br />
               As I said before, every Canadian I talked to reeled 
               <br />
               off taxes that they have to pay. Every Canadian 
               <br />
               government statistical book I take up is a story of 
               <br />
               taxes and more taxes. I have come to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that as far as I can learn, compared with 
               <br />

               Canadians we don’t know what taxation is. I am 
               <br />

               <br />

               anyone tell you that these come like manna that 
               <br />
               fall from heaven. In a recent issue of Maclean’s 
               <br />
               Magazine, there was quite an article giving the 
               <br />
               statistics of the number of immigrants from 
               <br />
               Europe entering Canada. They are many 
               <br />
               thousands annually. But the article also shows 
               <br />
               that there are more Canadian immigrants enter-

               <br />
               people coming into Canada. If it is the promised

               land that has been described to us, why is it that 
               <br />
               they are leaving Canada in the thousands each 
               <br />

               Mr. Raddy You know, Mr. Chairman, most of 
               <br />
               us in Newfoundland have been born and brought 
               <br />
               up in small harbours, and a mile or so behind the 
               <br />
               harbour are the wide open spaces. All of us during 
               <br />
               our young days have gone into the woods and 
               <br />
               roamed the hills and valleys, picked berries, 
               <br />
               snared rabbits, and caught trout in the ponds. All 
               <br />
               of us that felt that this was our country, our own 
               <br />
               ponds, valleys and rivers. We did not have a fence 
               <br />
               around it, and it was ours to use when we wanted. 
               <br />
               It is a part of that freedom that we have been 
               <br />
               brought up to in Newfoundland. If confederation 
               <br />
               comes, my guess is that all that will change. We 
               <br />
               will have the surveyors from Ottawa who will 
               <br />
               have the boundary lines marked, and like you see 
               <br />
               in Canada, there will be “No Trespassing” signs 
               <br />
               all over the country. The laws governing what 
               <br />
               you can and what you can’t do will be far dif— 
               <br />
               ferent from what they used to be, and what they 
               <br />
               are today. Then you will know that New- 
               <br />
               foundland is ours no longer. I know quite well 
               <br />
               that you cannot put a money value on this sort of 
               <br />
               a thing. Maybe it does not feed a hungry man, but 
               <br />
               nevertheless it is worth a lot. It is well worthwhile 
               <br />
               holding on to. The value of this freedom that we 
               <br />
               have known so long is something that has to be 
               <br />
               decided by the heart and conscience of each of 
               <br />
               us.
