               First, let us consider why Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should have lost responsible government at all. 
               <br />
               Let us ask ourselves why we, of all the British 
               <br />
               dominions, should have suddenly had the control 
               <br />
               of our country taken from the hands of its people 
               <br />
               and passed over to those of outsiders. If we read 
               <br />
               the Amulree Report we will ﬁnd in that docu- 
               <br />
               ment many strange and peculiar statements, 
               <br />
               made by men who had been sent here at the 
               <br />
               instance of the British government, none of whom, 
               <br />
               as far as I have been aware, had set eyes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'on</span> this 
               <br />
               country in their whole lifetime. I found in this 
               <br />
               report many harsh, reckless statements about our 
               <br />
               living and our dead. I found an amazing distortion 
               <br />
               of facts and ﬁgures, obviously all directed to 
               <br />
               justify that ﬁnal condemnation and judgement 
               <br />
               which was to put Newfoundland democracy to 
               <br />
               death and condemn our people to a national 
               <br />
               debtors’ prison for an indeﬁnite term of years. I 
               <br />
               asked myself, could such a harsh judgement be 
               <br />
               justiﬁed? Was there, perhaps, some reasons 
               <br />
               which I could not perceive or understand which 
               <br />
               would justify this pillaging of those political 
               <br />
               liberties for which our forefathers had struggled 
               <br />
               so valiantly and so long and which, for over 80 
               <br />
               years, had made this island of ours the freest land 
               <br />
               in the world? I wanted to know what was the 
               <br />
               underlying reason as to why this should come to 
               <br />
               a disgraceful end on a dark winter’s day in 
               <br />
               February 1934, at the dictates of a handful of 
               <br />

               I asked, “Why did this thing happen to us?” In 
               <br />
               what respect had we been wanting? What had we 
               <br />
               failed to do, or in what qualities were we, as a 
               <br />
               people, so deﬁcient as to disqualify us from 
               <br />
               governing our very own land? Was it that New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders had neither the mental capacity, the 
               <br />
               executive ability or the vision to govern themsel— 
               <br />
               ves? To answer this question, let your minds 
               <br />
               travel with me back through the pages of our long 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               names I need not speak, for these names speak 
               <br />
               for themselves. The records of their greatness are 
               <br />
               ploughed deep into the soil of our national his- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               lives and their actions serve as a denial of such 
               <br />
               an assumption? Well do we know the path they 
               <br />
               travelled was no easy one. No lush revenues nor 
               <br />
               $40 million budget was theirs to make smooth the 
               <br />
               rough paths of the country’s beginnings, to make 
               <br />
               the job of statesmen something within the men- 
               <br />
               tality of intelligent ofﬁce boys. Yet we see them 
               <br />
               in the face of the monstrous handicaps of small 
               <br />
               revenues and a numerically insignificant popula-

               tion, measuring up to their task of being both 
               <br />
               pioneers and statesmen. To them there was the 
               <br />
               task of not merely having to run a country, they 
               <br />
               had first to build one. And the fact that we sit here 
               <br />
               representing some 325,000 people is perhaps the 
               <br />
               best evidence that they succeeded and built better 
               <br />
               than they knew; that out of the harsh wilderness 
               <br />
               of the past they had hewn the solid foundation of 
               <br />
               our present, our mines, forests, ﬁsheries, roads, 
               <br />
               and railway. For every single industry that we 
               <br />
               have with us today, we have to look back in 
               <br />
               thanks and lay our tribute on the honoured graves 
               <br />
               of these great Newfoundlanders of the past. Ex- 
               <br />
               ecutive ability, you say -—— leadership, capacity to 
               <br />
               run a country! Why, if these giants of the past 
               <br />
               were here today and were asked to take over this 
               <br />
               country and look after it and its people, they 
               <br />
               would regard it as mere child’s play. And at the 
               <br />
               same time they would smile at us, half in pity, 
               <br />
               half in contempt, at the timidity and fear which 
               <br />
               some of us express when asked to face up to the 
               <br />
               responsibility of running our own house. No, sir, 
               <br />
               the records of our people just won't bear out the 
               <br />
               truth of those who say that we are not now, nor 
               <br />
               were we in the past, capable of running our own 
               <br />
               affairs. Our history gives the denial, written in 
               <br />
               letters too large and too brilliant to make any such 
               <br />
               statements acceptable to the minds of real New-

               because we lacked these things that we lost our

               government? Again let us look at the record: we

               ﬁnd that if there is anything for which we New-
