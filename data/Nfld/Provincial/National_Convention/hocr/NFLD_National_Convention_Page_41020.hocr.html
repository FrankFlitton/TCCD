               Now I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a

               prophet, and when I was born I was not given the 
               <br />
               gift of second sight. I cannot see through a stone 
               <br />

               ﬁgures which I have tabled today I am not

               based these ﬁgures upon common sense, and

               <br />

               Sir, what I have done is this. I have divided the 
               <br />
               public ﬁnances of this province, if we become a 
               <br />
               province, into two classes: on the one side expen- 
               <br />
               diture, and on the other hand what money the 
               <br />
               government is likely to take in year by year to 
               <br />
               meet these expenses. 1 have done something else. 
               <br />
               Ihave taken a period of eight years for both... My 
               <br />
               reason for that is that one clause of the terms 
               <br />
               offered by the Government of Canada provides 
               <br />
               that within eight years of union that government 
               <br />
               will appoint, not might, or may, but will appoint 
               <br />
               a royal commission for the purpose of looking 
               <br />
               into our ﬁnancial condition; that it will examine 
               <br />
               and reassess our financial position to learn 
               <br />
               whether the subsidies from the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada are large enough or not; whether we can 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 772 185 1309 1874">

               go on for more years into the future with the same 
               <br />
               subsidies, or whether these would need to be 
               <br />
               increased. As. therefore, our whole ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               position would be reviewed and reassessed 
               <br />
               within eight years of union, I hold that at the least 
               <br />
               we must see our way clear to balancing our books 
               <br />
               and breaking even for eight years at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least....</span> 
               <br />
               Therefore my ﬁgures are based upon a period of 
               <br />
               eight years, and I have gone a step further; I have 
               <br />
               taken the eight years and divided them in two, 
               <br />
               having therefore two periods of four years each, 
               <br />
               and the house will see, as we go on, the reason 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why.</span>
