               Mr. Butt There is a question of principle in- 
               <br />
               volved. Instead of making a recommendation, we 
               <br />
               should appoint our own Chairman now. We are 
               <br />
               in session; this has come up. It is a question of 
               <br />
               principle and dignity. We ought to have the right 
               <br />
               to appoint our own Chairman and we ought to 
               <br />
               decide whether the Chairman is to have the right 
               <br />
               to vote. We go back to the Commission and say, 
               <br />
               “We want the right to carry on ourselves.” If you 
               <br />
               trace back the history of the Convention, it is a 
               <br />
               parliament of disabilities. One of the rights of 
               <br />
               parliament is that it can make legislation. We are, 
               <br />
               in effect, a minor parliament. Is not that right, 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley?
