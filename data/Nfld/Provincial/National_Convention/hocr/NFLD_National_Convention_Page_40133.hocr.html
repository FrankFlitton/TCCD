               Mr. Brown A few days ago I spoke brieﬂy in 
               <br />
               connection with the resolution now before this 
               <br />
               house. I felt at that time, as I do today, that that 
               <br />
               resolution was premature. It was brought in 
               <br />
               before the receipt of committee reports which 
               <br />
               would show just what the ﬁnancial and economic 
               <br />
               position of this country is. I have been wondering 
               <br />
               to myself the reason why Canada has not sent a 
               <br />
               delegation here, instead of this Convention send- 
               <br />
               ing a delegation to Canada, if Canada wants 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and there is no doubt she does 
               <br />
               want to annex Newfoundland... 
               <br />

               I remember quite well, sir, and so do you when 
               <br />
               members from the government of the day went 
               <br />
               to Quebec, trying to sell the Labrador to the 
               <br />
               Quebec government. I can name the men if 
               <br />
               necessary; I think the Prime Minister was one of 
               <br />
               them, and they, in the ﬁnal analysis, offered to 
               <br />
               sell Labrador to the Quebec government for $15 
               <br />
               million, and the Quebec government turned it 
               <br />
               down, thinking that in the ﬁnal analysis the Privy 
               <br />
               Council of England would award Labrador to 
               <br />
               Quebec, or to Canada. They would not take over 
               <br />
               Labrador, or what we claimed we owned of it, for 
               <br />
               $15 million. Now we have a resolution before 
               <br />
               this House asking us to send a delegation to 
               <br />
               Canada to get the terms, and I presume if neces- 
               <br />
               sary become part and parcel of Canada. Canada 
               <br />
               wants Labrador, and she wants Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Perhaps the Dominion government is not so in- 
               <br />
               terested, or the people at Ottawa, but the Quebec 
               <br />
               government is, and wants Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               thinks today, Mr. Chairman, that Labrador 
               <br />
               should never have been ceded to Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               I have seen a lot happen in this assembly, and so 
               <br />
               have you, sir, and I don’t know today who is the 
               <br />
               father of this House, whether it is you or myself. 
               <br />
               You were elected in 1919, 1923, 1924, and I was

               <br />
               without a defeat, and I have seen many hard and 
               <br />
               rough times in this House. This is a famous

               <br />
               to tell this House that I was not one of them. I left 
               <br />
               politics after all these years associated with the 
               <br />
               public life of the country a shade worse off than 
               <br />
               when I entered it. I defy any department of the 
               <br />
               government in Newfoundland to turn up a piece 
               <br />
               of paper that I had black-leaded in my name and 
               <br />
               to say that I spent a dollar in my life of govern- 
               <br />
               ment money. I never have, although I had 
               <br />
               authority to spend up to $40,000 and got licked 
               <br />
               after all. I have never done it, Mr. Speaker, and I 
               <br />
               feel that I have been a fairly honourable member 
               <br />
               of this House. At times I was unruly and had to 
               <br />
               take my seat. I submitted to your ruling, sir, but 
               <br />
               once I remember distinctly when I balked for a 
               <br />
               little while and you told me you would have me 
               <br />
               removed from the House, and I asked you, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, what man in the House could remove 
               <br />
               me, and you told me you would have me re- 
               <br />
               moved. I looked down at my old friend the late 
               <br />
               Robert Walsh, and he was about 90 years old, and 
               <br />
               I said, “Would you like to take that job on Mr. 
               <br />
               Walsh?”, and he said, “No”. I have seen times in 
               <br />
               this House when men could have got money and 
               <br />
               plenty of it, and I distinctly remember on one 
               <br />
               occasion when there was a bill on the table before 
               <br />
               this House, and I, with three others, when all the 
               <br />
               other members of the opposition were against us, 
               <br />
               we stood our ground and defied this House on 
               <br />
               every corner, and three of these members are here 
               <br />
               today. Mr. Bradley, Mr. Ashboume and myself, 
               <br />
               and another man that’s not in this House today. 
               <br />
               Am I right or wrong, Mr. Bradley?

               was brought before the Steering Committee, sir, 
               <br />
               and you know it, and we passed this resolution, 
               <br />
               but when brought into this House it was a dif- 
               <br />
               ferent resolution entirely. It may have meant the
