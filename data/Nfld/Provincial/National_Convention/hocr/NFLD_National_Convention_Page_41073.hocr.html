               <br />

               men that Canada can produce. These are their

               <br />
               Drew and all the others. These men came

               consideration of the terms which have been

               Now when we look at these documents which 
               <br />
               have been brought back from Canada by the 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation, it will be well for us first to 
               <br />
               refer to the letter of Prime Minister King, in 
               <br />
               which he says that he was of the opinion that the 
               <br />
               questions to be discussed with the delegation are 
               <br />
               of such complexity and of such signiﬁcance for 
               <br />
               both countries that it is essential to have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com»</span> 
               <br />
               plete and comprehensive exchange of informa- 
               <br />
               tion, and a full and careful exploration by both 
               <br />
               parties of the issues involved, so that an accurate 
               <br />
               appreciation of the position may be guaranteed 
               <br />
               on each side. There was one gentleman who fully 
               <br />
               appreciated the signiﬁcance of Newfoundland's 
               <br />
               entering into union with Canada. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Well, what did our delegation do? We have 
               <br />
               some idea now of what they did. They got 
               <br />
               together certain facts and figures here before they 
               <br />
               went to Ottawa, put them together and went off 
               <br />
               to Ottawa, only to discover that these things 
               <br />
               which were brought back to us from Canada had 
               <br />
               been prepared months before they went up there. 
               <br />
               That to me looks very funny. The proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ar.</span> 
               <br />
               rangements, as 1 stated before, are set forth in the 
               <br />
               document, the Grey Book, and Mr. King, Prime 
               <br />
               Minister King again says, “I feel I must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">em&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               phasise that as far as the financial aspects of the 
               <br />
               proposed arrangements for union are concerned, 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada believes that the ar- 
               <br />
               rangements go as far as the government can go 
               <br />
               under the circumstances.” The government could 
               <br />
               not readily contemplate any change in those ar- 
               <br />
               rangements, so what you have, you have in the 
               <br />
               Grey Book, and Prime Minister King says there 
               <br />
               is to be, as far as he can see, no change what-
