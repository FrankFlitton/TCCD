               <br />
               deliberately prolonging it. It is about time we got 
               <br />
               down and did some work. When we started, we 
               <br />
               made mistakes. I am here today steering this

               <br />
               it, it is a report, not a piece of legislation. It is a 
               <br />
               waste of time, right from the beginning. When 
               <br />
               reports are made in this assembly, I take it these 
               <br />
               reports are solid. One report came in here, there 
               <br />
               were discrepancies in it and we have not heard 
               <br />
               anything about it since; hundreds of thousands 
               <br />
               lost to the government, dishonesty in some 
               <br />
               department. We were given a document to say 
               <br />
               “keep it mum” that is what it amounts to. There 
               <br />
               was supposed to be an inquiry. They are experts 
               <br />
               with the lime brush, covering up someone. I do 
               <br />
               not need to be covered up. Now as far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, I think I have made it clear to Mr. 
               <br />
               MacDonald the situation with regard to the $35

               <br />
               is. The comment I want to make is this: the

               Economic Report makes a very simple and a very 
               <br />
               plain statement, namely, that our surplus is $35

               Telegram said on Saturday last. As a citizen of

               <br />

               <br />
               Department of Finance, suspecting, as I did, that 
               <br />
               $35 million was not a correct statement of the 
               <br />
               surplus. I asked them if they would tell me what, 
               <br />
               in their belief, in their belief, is the surplus of the 
               <br />
               Government of Newfoundland. They said yes, 
               <br />
               they would tell me. Idon’t mind saying I saw Mr.
