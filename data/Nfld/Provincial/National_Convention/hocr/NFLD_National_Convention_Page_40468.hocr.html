               won’t be bringing children into the world every

               year and every second year of their lives. Mothers 
               <br />
               of the future will be prepared, because I don’t 
               <br />
               believe it is possible, especially where a woman

               <br />

               <br />
               15 or 20 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">children.</span> I believe the time has come

               when not only the medical service can be 
               <br />
               broadened, but that education should be started 
               <br />

               <br />
               then we will have a healthy population. It is 
               <br />
               impossible not to have a high rate going out when 
               <br />
               we have so many coming in. That’s what’s wrong

               Mr. Smallwood ....I don’t think the Committee 
               <br />
               would mind if I say that these statistics were 
               <br />
               compiled by me. All the members of the Public 
               <br />
               Health Committee were given their work to do.... 
               <br />
               This particular table, which Mr. Hollett‘s eagle 
               <br />
               eye detected so quickly, was this: this is the 
               <br />
               original script.1 I would like to put myself right 
               <br />
               with him. Idon’t want you to think I was a Hitler 
               <br />
               or a Judas. It was discovered that some of the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures were wrong and they were corrected by 
               <br />
               me with a pen, here they are up here, but they 
               <br />
               were not corrected all the way down to the bottom 
               <br />
               of the column. I would be willing to stake my life, 
               <br />
               it is the only error in this mimeographed copy, 
               <br />
               because the error was not corrected in the original 
               <br />
               copy. You will ﬁnd all the other tables correct I 
               <br />
               am reasonably sure. I have lived in this country 
               <br />
               long enough to expect that my word would be 
               <br />
               taken on something or other, but over further 
               <br />
               there is another table here where Canada shows 
               <br />
               up very badly in comparison with New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and that is in the matter of maternity. 
               <br />
               Look at page 6 in the report, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               maternity death rate 3.7, Canada 4. That is quite 
               <br />
               a bit worse, quite a difference. Now I did not 
               <br />
               change it there, or try to twist it there. The same 
               <br />
               comparison runs all through the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report“.</span> I am not 
               <br />
               such a fool as to make a thing like that deliberately. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I am sorry I raised that point. I had 
               <br />
               no knowledge that Mr. Smallwood had anything
