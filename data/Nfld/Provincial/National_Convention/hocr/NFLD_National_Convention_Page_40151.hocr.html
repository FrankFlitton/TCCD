               I tried this afternoon to point out to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asv</span> 
               <br />
               sembly that political speeches had nothing to do 
               <br />
               with the question, and that the merits or demerits 
               <br />
               of confederation had nothing to do with this 
               <br />
               debate. The question was whether or not we 
               <br />
               would go seeking information at an opportune 
               <br />
               time... Should the motion be shelved, the Con- 
               <br />
               vention would have to start all over again when 
               <br />
               it had the facts concerning the ﬁnancial and 
               <br />
               economic condition of this country, and my effort 
               <br />
               is for the purpose of clariﬁcation to try and pin 
               <br />
               down the issue until we get something done and 
               <br />
               find out where we are.... I propose the following 
               <br />
               amendment: that the words after “That” in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst line of Mr. Penney’s amendment be stricken 
               <br />
               out and that the words “and shall not proceed to 
               <br />
               Ottawa before January I, 1947” be inserted in the 
               <br />
               original motion after the word “Newfoundland" 
               <br />
               at the end of the third paragraph. 
               <br />

               This strikes out the indeﬁniteness which com- 
               <br />
               pletely ﬁlls Mr. Penney’s amendment and it adds 
               <br />
               to the original motion something which effects 
               <br />
               what Mr. Penney desires —— a reasonable delay 
               <br />
               before the delegation goes to Ottawa. It means 
               <br />
               that the machinery be put in motion at once so 
               <br />
               that the facts would be available when required. .. 
               <br />
               The whole object is to appoint a delegation and

               allow it to work in Newfoundland until the time 
               <br />
               would present itself to proceed to Canada. And

               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, can you inform the

               Convention by what date this House will have to 
               <br />
               ﬁnish its business in order to have a referendum 
               <br />
               in the spring or a referendum in the fall?

               Mr. Chairman I imagine that in order to have a

               <br />
               this Convention would have to ﬁnish by the end 
               <br />
               of January or sometime in February, 1947. If it is 
               <br />
               desired to have a referendum in the autumn of 
               <br />
               1947, then the business of this Convention should 
               <br />
               ﬁnish by the end of May or early in June. It has 
               <br />
               to be remembered that the recommendations 
               <br />
               from this Convention will have to go to the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government after having ﬁrst 
               <br />

               <br />
               Affairs, and from the cabinet will be presented to 
               <br />
               Parliament, say in the form of a White Paper, to 
               <br />
               be considered by the House of Commons and 
               <br />
               then by the House of Lords. These are opinions
