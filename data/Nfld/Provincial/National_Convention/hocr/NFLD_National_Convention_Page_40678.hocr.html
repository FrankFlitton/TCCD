               And this whole paragraph deals with a matter 
               <br />
               which aroused intense and bitter interest amongst

               <br />
               the people in this country today believe that the

               Smallwood, when this matter was brought up in 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee we had considerable dis- 
               <br />
               cussion on it. Some of us felt that we shouldn’t 
               <br />
               inject it into the report at all. But we had busin- 
               <br />
               essmen, mind you, associated with this Commit- 
               <br />
               tee. We discovered that in many instances our 
               <br />
               own businessmen right here in the city of St. 
               <br />
               John’s were paying more money for labour than 
               <br />
               was being paid to similar labour on the various 
               <br />
               military bases. We were also in touch with some 
               <br />
               labour leaders and we had one gentleman on our 
               <br />
               Committee familiar with the situation, who told 
               <br />
               us deﬁnitely that direct or indirect instructions 
               <br />
               had been given the Americans when they started 
               <br />
               work, particularly at Argentia, that the rate of pay 
               <br />
               wasn’t to be above 30 or 35 cents an hour; and 
               <br />
               that afterwards, these various labour organisa- 
               <br />
               tions got together and approached the govem— 
               <br />
               ment and they got the rate of pay jacked up to 
               <br />
               another 5 or 10 cents an hour. I think that’s what 
               <br />
               my memory tells me. Now it is generally known 
               <br />
               all over the country that at that time there were

               Canadians and Americans brought down here 
               <br />
               and put on jobs, and paid much more money for 
               <br />
               similar work than Newfoundlanders. l have 
               <br />
               talked with men repeatedly who told me that they 
               <br />
               were working for the Americans in Argentia and 
               <br />
               could have got more money, but the bosses on the 
               <br />
               jobs told them, “Your own government tells us 
               <br />
               not to pay you any more than this for doing such 
               <br />
               a job." That was quite prevelant. It was general 
               <br />
               knowledge throughout the country that that was 
               <br />
               the case. We didn’t bring in the Commissioner of 
               <br />
               Public Utilities for instance, and ask him about it 
               <br />
               because we knew the ﬁrst thing he’d tell us, after 
               <br />
               our experience with him in the connection with 
               <br />
               the Gander airport, that he wasn’t here when this 
               <br />
               was done. And that would end that. It was in the 
               <br />
               days of Sir Wilfred Woods that all this thing was 
               <br />
               done by the Department of Public Utilities. And 
               <br />
               there’s labour men in this House today more 
               <br />
               familiar with what happened in this respect than 
               <br />
               I am. I have repeatedly stated and broadcast over 
               <br />
               the air, and it hasn’t been contradicted yet by the 
               <br />
               government or by anyone else, that this was done 
               <br />
               to keep down the cost for the Americans and for 
               <br />
               the Canadians at the expense of the labouring 
               <br />
               man in Newfoundland. And I’m still of the same 
               <br />
               opinion that it was done for that purpose. Some 
               <br />
               say that it was done in order to protect certain 
               <br />
               business interests in the country. Now all these 
               <br />
               points are ones that should not be brought up here 
               <br />
               at the present time or we’re going to be ﬁghting 
               <br />
               about businessmen getting preference from the 
               <br />
               government, but the facts are that the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion government did actually do that. They gave 
               <br />
               the instructions and unfortunately many of these 
               <br />
               contractors are gone out of the country now and 
               <br />
               we couldn’t corroborate it by their personal 
               <br />
               proof. The rates of pay paid the Americans and 
               <br />
               the Canadians, if they had been paid to the New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, we figured that another 25% in 
               <br />
               earning power would have accrued to our people 
               <br />
               which they were deprived of because of this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">action.</span> With regard to the economy of the 
               <br />
               country, I can’t see how it would hurt it for this 
               <br />
               reason, that it would have given these men 
               <br />
               another $10 — 15 million which they would be 
               <br />
               able to spend, which would create proﬁts for 
               <br />
               those who were in business, and revenue for the 
               <br />
               country. I’d like Mr. Smallwood to explain what 
               <br />
               he knows about it, and I think that Mr. Fudge and 
               <br />
               other gentlemen here know more about it than I
