               Going on to another statement by Roosevelt 
               <br />
               about four freedoms, you cannot have political 
               <br />
               freedom without economic freedom. And given 
               <br />
               the latter, people would be less hesitant about 
               <br />
               taking over their political responsibility. 
               <br />
               Roosevelt’s freedoms are passive freedoms: 
               <br />
               freedom from want, freedom from fear, etc. I 
               <br />
               prefer an active freedom. Freedom to —- freedom 
               <br />

               <br />

               I feel the Convention’s discussions have not 
               <br />
               gone deeply enough into the roots of things. 
               <br />
               There are inequalities which stand in the way of 
               <br />
               economic and political freedoms, and in the way 
               <br />
               of social justice. I wonder if it is not time we 
               <br />
               examined our methods and attitudes. The attitude 
               <br />
               taken in economic matters will go far in deter- 
               <br />
               mining the action taken in political matters. Old 
               <br />
               age pensions and ﬁshermens’ insurance are not 
               <br />
               enough. They are only salve where surgery is 
               <br />
               needed. The Convention’s search for political 
               <br />
               constitutions will be ineffectual if it is not allied 
               <br />
               to a desire for social justice, and an economic 
               <br />
               set-up more in keeping with the principles of 
               <br />
               Christian democracy.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I maintain that how we think about these mat- 
               <br />
               ters will determine our choice of a constitution. 
               <br />
               We must take chances on the future, but our job 
               <br />
               is to reduce those chances as much as we can. 
               <br />
               Neither optimism or pessimism will get us 
               <br />
               anywhere. We must know where we stand. It is a 
               <br />
               grand thing to walk with your chin up, but we 
               <br />
               must have our feet on the ground. If I have a 
               <br />
               criticism, it is that I have wondered if our feet 
               <br />
               were planted on the ground.

               I have tried today to get outside of the political 
               <br />
               issue. I have considered it, if not as an anarchist, 
               <br />
               than as one who is not interested in any particular 
               <br />

               In the early days we heard a lot about an open

               <br />
               thing. ButI say now that I do have an open mind 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I must apologise to the people for the

               barrage of words from the National Convention, 
               <br />

               this country is in a sound economical position.

               Full justice cannot be given to our position 
               <br />
               without considering the epoch we live in. Much 
               <br />
               can be done for a country to solve its internal 
               <br />
               problems, but this has a limit. For example, the 
               <br />
               first blow to our economy was a revolution in 
               <br />
               Brazil, then sanctions against Italy. Both of these 
               <br />
               contributed to our economic state. If one studies 
               <br />
               history then one will see that whenever there is a 
               <br />
               war there is a surge forward in human endeavour. 
               <br />
               War and revolution bring men to their best, and 
               <br />
               make them see clearly. If we had had a war near 
               <br />
               our shores maybe we would see clearer. Today’s 
               <br />
               events are the greatest leap forward the world has 
               <br />
               ever seen, and the future is bright. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Notwithstandl</span> 
               <br />
               ing what our pessimists say, that wave of progress 
               <br />
               will reach us here in Newfoundland. The 
               <br />
               Americans are spending billions of dollars on the 
               <br />
               Marshall Plan, and we should keep this in mind. 
               <br />
               You should examine the conduct of the United 
               <br />
               States, and ask why they care about people 
               <br />
               thousands of miles away. In the 1920s the US 
               <br />
               withdrew into itself and left Europe in a slum of 
               <br />
               poverty and discontent, in which fascism grew. 
               <br />
               But that is not happening now because great 
               <br />
               minds are working against that, because we are 
               <br />
               all in the front lines now. The world has learned 
               <br />
               that it has to help itself. And the beneﬁt of that 
               <br />
               will come to Newfoundland. There cannot be 
               <br />
               another world depression, and that‘s the reason 
               <br />
               that I know government revenue will stay up.

               Ask ourselves the question and think deeply

               <br />
