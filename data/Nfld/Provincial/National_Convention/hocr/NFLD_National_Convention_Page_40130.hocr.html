               support it. The people of this country, whom we 
               <br />
               represent, the people of Fogo district, whom I 
               <br />
               personally represent, expect when the time 
               <br />
               comes to be given the real facts, they want to 
               <br />
               know if this country is self-supporting at this 
               <br />
               moment, if it is likely to be so in the future. In 
               <br />
               short they want to know just where we stand as a 
               <br />
               country. They also want to know about forms of 
               <br />
               government, whether it be Commission govern- 
               <br />
               ment, responsible government, confederation or 
               <br />
               any other form, and we have got to give it to them. 
               <br />
               Whether we like it or not, there are thousands of 
               <br />
               people who think that confederation is the best 
               <br />
               thing that could ever happen in this country. 
               <br />
               Perhaps it is, I don’t know, nobody knows, and I 
               <br />
               therefore consider it our duty to ﬁnd out. When 
               <br />
               the terms of confederation are made known those 
               <br />
               who are now favouring it may be turned against 
               <br />
               it; on the other hand, the terms may be such that 
               <br />
               every man and woman in this country may 
               <br />
               demand it. Who are we to dictate to these people 
               <br />
               whose servants we are? There are people who say 
               <br />
               they are Newfoundlanders and will not be a party 
               <br />
               to selling this country up the St. Lawrence River. 
               <br />
               It’s not a question of selling the country to 
               <br />
               anyone, it’s just a matter of doing a job we were 
               <br />
               sent here to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> I am also a Newfoundlander, and 
               <br />
               when I say that, I am proud of it — I mean it. 
               <br />
               Together with thousands of others I freely gave 
               <br />
               six of the best years of my life in the service of 
               <br />
               my country. I am not going to lower myself by 
               <br />
               asking somebody where they were in the last war 
               <br />
               or any other war; it’s none of my business, I leave 
               <br />
               that to the dictates of their own consciences. But 
               <br />
               that is beside the point.

               <br />
               ulterior motive behind those opposing it. Is it 
               <br />
               possible that those who are opposing the seeking 
               <br />

               <br />

               political castle of dreams and bring it tumbling 
               <br />
               around their ears? The people of this country 
               <br />
               have been bluffed and hoodwinked long enough, 
               <br />
               it’s about time they were given some of the cold

               hard facts, whether it suits our own personal, 
               <br />
               selﬁsh desires or not. The people have never had 
               <br />
               a chance to live half-decent lives, but in spite of 
               <br />
               that there are those who would have us believe
