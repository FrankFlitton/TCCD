               I take you back to September 2, 1940: France 
               <br />
               had fallen in June, and Great Britain stood alone 
               <br />
               against the might of Hitler’s Germany. The 
               <br />
               people of North America realised their danger, 
               <br />
               should Britain fall; they consulted the British 
               <br />
               government and began to look to their own defen- 
               <br />
               ses. On the above-mentioned date, the Marquis 
               <br />
               of Lothian wrote to Mr. Cordell Hull, and told 
               <br />
               him that in View of the interest of His Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government in the national security of the United 
               <br />
               States, and their desire to strengthen the ability of 
               <br />
               the United States to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperate</span> with the other 
               <br />
               nations of the Americas in the defense of the 
               <br />
               western hemisphere, that His Majesty’s Govem~ 
               <br />
               ment would secure the grant to the United States 
               <br />
               freely and without consideration for the lease of 
               <br />
               naval and air bases on the Avalon Peninsula and 
               <br />
               the southern coast of Newfoundland. The agree- 
               <br />
               ment for this lease was signed on 27 March l94l, 
               <br />
               and accompanying this agreement, and forming 
               <br />
               part of it was a letter from Mr. Winston Churchill 
               <br />
               to Mr. Winant. It has such significance that I give 
               <br />
               it in full to refresh your memories: “...it is the 
               <br />
               intention of the Government of the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               prior to the 16th February 1934, the words ‘the 
               <br />
               government of the United Kingdom‘, wherever 
               <br />

               <br />
               Churchill’s mind, at that date, but that we would 
               <br />
               eventually resume our former status?....

               <br />
               more natural, than that the future status of New—

               <br />
               “Would it not be better”, some might say, in view 
               <br />
               of this mutual defence pact which, by the way, 
               <br />
               was signed a few days ago, “if Newfoundland

               <br />
               now an international issue; hence the Convention 
               <br />

               <br />

               parliament cannot legislate on a new question of 
               <br />
               vital importance without a mandate from the 
               <br />
               people. It was the breach of this mandate which 
               <br />
               gave us Commission of Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Alder-

               government some way out of our difﬁculties, but 
               <br />
               he further assured the people there would be no

               a question of vital importance to the British
