               There is one other thing that I should like to 
               <br />
               add. In the manner of his chairmanship, Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley can well afford to wait with'equanimity 
               <br />
               for the verdict of history, and undoubtedly the 
               <br />
               most charitable thing to do about the incident that 
               <br />
               provoked his resignation is also to wait for the 
               <br />
               comment of history. The fullness of time has a 
               <br />
               way of arriving at conclusions into which the 
               <br />
               emotionalisms that harry in the heat of the day do 
               <br />
               not enter. And I feel that could he but foresee it, 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley would ﬁnd much cause for satisfac- 
               <br />
               tion in the verdict which history will pass upon 
               <br />
               his chairmanship. For purposes of such record of 
               <br />
               the incident on Friday, October 10, which may be 
               <br />
               preserved for the amazement of our posterity, I 
               <br />
               should like to make the statement that throughout 
               <br />
               the days of his chairmanship, Mr. Bradley did act 
               <br />
               with impartiality, honour, and dignity — and that 
               <br />
               he always had my conﬁdence.

               I was a member of the Committee responsible 
               <br />
               for the report that is now before us. The report 
               <br />
               makes a summary of what we did finally agree 
               <br />
               upon as the facts of our national ﬁnancial posi- 
               <br />
               tion. Itcould not be expected that all the members 
               <br />
               of the Committee would agree as to the personal 
               <br />
               conclusions they would draw from the facts set 
               <br />
               forth. So I have to say that I cannot subscribe 
               <br />
               without question to the conclusion Major Cashin 
               <br />
               intimated in yesterday’s debate that he had come 
               <br />
               to, namely, that the country is self-supporting 
               <br />
               again. I regret that I have once again to voice in 
               <br />
               this Convention a disagreement with Major 
               <br />
               Cashin. I have a high regard for the Major, in 
               <br />
               particular his consistency of purpose in pursuing

               <br />
               sincerity. I have always believed that when the 
               <br />
               Major spoke he was calling a spade a spade, 
               <br />
               according to his own lights. It so happens that I 
               <br />
               have done exactly the same thing. And since our 
               <br />
               lights have been different. our disagreements 
               <br />
               have been inevitable. I would that it had been

               otherwise.

               I know that taken all in all. I have been a very 
               <br />
               disagreeable person at this Convention, and in 
               <br />
               consequence, I have come to be called everything 
               <br />
               from a communist to a confederate. A con- 
               <br />
               federate I gather is something that not even the 
               <br />
               grace of God could raise to the level of the depths 
               <br />
               of degradation. 1 do think that attaching ulterior 
               <br />
               motives to my actions has been rather un- 
               <br />
               charitable. I fail to see how insisting upon the 
               <br />
               importance of three square meals a day has made 
               <br />
               me a communist, any more than insisting upon 
               <br />
               hearing the terms of confederation has made me 
               <br />
               a confederate, and in any case, irrespective of 
               <br />
               what popular misconstructions may have been 
               <br />
               put upon my views and upon my conduct, 1 have 
               <br />
               the personal satisfaction of knowing that I have 
               <br />
               always acted according to the dictates of my 
               <br />
               conscience. If that has been improper, I prefer it 
               <br />
               that way. And so I have come to the making of 
               <br />
               this statement as a consequence of my examina- 
               <br />
               tion of our ﬁnances and economy. WhatI have to 
               <br />
               say will not be well received, for it is not the 
               <br />
               popular view. I know that again I shall be thought 
               <br />
               of as seeking to further some dark design that I 
               <br />
               am supposed to entertain. But a man should not 
               <br />
               be turned aside from the statement of what he 
               <br />
               believes to be true because he knows that he may 
               <br />
               be misrepresented or misconstrued. This state- 
               <br />
               ment is as objective an appraisal of our material 
               <br />
               national position as I am qualiﬁed to make

               Our ﬁrst purpose here is to consider and dis- 
               <br />
               cuss the changes that have taken place in the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial and economic situation of the island 
               <br />
               since 1934. Before I pass on to consider such 
               <br />
               changes, permit me to point out that there is 
               <br />
               somewhat of a difference between the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               and the economic. It is a difference of which 
               <br />
               many appear to be unaware, or prefer to ignore. 
               <br />
               At any rate, there is much confusion of the two, 
               <br />
               with the ﬁnancial being taken to indicate that our 
               <br />
               economy is in good shape. Two examples will 
               <br />
               serve to illustrate what I mean. Take the matter
