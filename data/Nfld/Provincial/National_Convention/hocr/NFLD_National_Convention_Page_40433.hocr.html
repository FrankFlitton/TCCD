               Mr. Hollett Therefore the government is going 
               <br />
               to spend $15 million for the ﬁsh plant. I can see 
               <br />
               no advantage to the saltﬁsh trade. You talk of

               green, fresh ﬁsh —- I would like for someone to

               point out some ﬁshing places along that road. 
               <br />
               Mr. Starkes I agree with Mr. Job. There are 
               <br />
               several other places where roads are important - 
               <br />
               e.g. Green Bay. There it is four miles from the 
               <br />
               plant to the sea; if the road was made passable by 
               <br />
               truck, the men in Shoal Cove could send ﬁsh to 
               <br />
               the plant. I do not agree with one road only, Burin

               <br />
               Mr. Monroe gave us was that he cannot get in

               touch with the plant except by steamer; and it is 
               <br />
               necessary for him to get in contact daily; and the

               <br />
