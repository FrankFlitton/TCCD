               <br />
               showing why I am not voting for this motion. I

               wish to explain that irrespective of any of the 
               <br />
               reasons which I have named, my main reason for 
               <br />
               being against it is because it is a violation of the 
               <br />
               1933 agreement, and I refuse to be a party to the 
               <br />
               violation of that agreement. In one of the early 
               <br />
               sessions of this Convention, delegate K. M. 
               <br />
               Brown of the district of Bonavista South, told you 
               <br />
               he had in his possession a letter which, if publish— 
               <br />
               ed, would kill this confederation issue absolutely 
               <br />
               and forever. I too have had access to a document 
               <br />
               which, if I were at liberty to publish, would show 
               <br />
               this country that a concerted plot, an international 
               <br />
               plot, was being hatched as far back as 1941...

               if placed after “Confederation with Canada", 
               <br />
               should that be on the ballot paper. Incidentally, 
               <br />
               Iscariot had the decency to hang himself. Would

               refer you to the BNA Act, 1867, and I think the 
               <br />
               answer is to be found there quite clearly and 
               <br />
               distinctly. Section 92: “In each province the 
               <br />
