               Mr. Burry Before the debate begins, I would 
               <br />
               like to point out an error in the Daily News report 
               <br />
               of yesterday aftemoon’s debate. I refer to what 
               <br />
               was said by Mr. Smallwood when he was speak- 
               <br />
               ing of the infant mortality rate in Labrador. As 
               <br />
               you will recall he pointed out that there were 
               <br />
               several districts in Newfoundland and Labrador 
               <br />
               which had a high rate, other districts had a low 
               <br />
               rate. He mentioned one district where medical 
               <br />
               services were not up to the highest and yet that 
               <br />
               district had a very low infant mortality. He said 
               <br />
               there was a member in the Convention repre- 
               <br />
               senting that district. Apparently the reporter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> 
               <br />
               cluded that that district was Labrador. He refers 
               <br />
               to it in the write-up: “In Labrador where the infant 
               <br />
               mortality is lowest, medical facilities are almost 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nil.”</span> There are two errors. The district where the 
               <br />
               infant mortality rate is lowest is not Labrador — 
               <br />
               I wish it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were.</span> Also, describing the medical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ser«</span> 
               <br />
               vices in Labrador as almost nil is just not the way 
               <br />
               to describe them. I do not want to give you the 
               <br />
               impression that we are satisﬁed in Labrador with 
               <br />
               the medical services we have. I do not suppose 
               <br />
               any part of the island is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisﬁed.</span> But we do have 
               <br />
               medical services. As you will recall, it was 
               <br />
               pointed out that there are three hospitals; we have 
               <br />
               a motor ship travelling up and down the coast 
               <br />
               during the summer. We have a nursing station at 
               <br />
               Forteau, there was a new institution put up there 
               <br />
               last year. Some of our people are also in close 
               <br />
               proximity to the RCAF in Goose Bay and we get 
               <br />
               medical services from these people, and supplies 
               <br />
               too. Missionaries in the north, while not graduate 
               <br />
               doctors, have some training along those lines and 
               <br />
               have given good service. All in all, our medical 
               <br />
               services are not too bad in Labrador. I would like 
               <br />

               Let us take the report section by section. In the 
               <br />
               health section we find the department has done 
               <br />
               an enormous amount of good by bringing the 
               <br />
               total number of hospitals in this country to 39 plus 
               <br />
               nine nursing stations. The General Hospital is 
               <br />
               now one of the best in North America, both as to 
               <br />
               building, equipment and skill. There is a shortage 
               <br />
               of nurses, due partly to so many of our girls 
               <br />
               joining the Canadian services or obtaining more 
               <br />
               remunerative employment elsewhere, but in the 
               <br />
               main because of the refusal of the department to 
               <br />
               step up the beginner’s salary in proportion to the 
               <br />

               It means a real sacriﬁce today for a girl to 
               <br />
               spend three years in training, which in reality is 
               <br />
               three years hard work and not going to school as 
               <br />
               some would suggest. Owing to the serious dearth

               of trained nurses, instead of being in a lecture-

               <br />
               to study when they should be resting. I realise this
