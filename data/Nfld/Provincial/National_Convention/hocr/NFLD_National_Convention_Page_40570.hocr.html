               discussed by the delegation. As the discussions 
               <br />
               proceeded, the impression created with some of 
               <br />
               us was that these two members of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion had been summoned to London to give the 
               <br />
               Dominions Secretary information which he 
               <br />
               might not have, and for the further purpose of

               trying to inﬂuence the United Kingdom ofﬁcials 
               <br />
               on matters of great importance to our country 
               <br />
               which came up for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion,</span> It was not uncom- 
               <br />
               mon to see considerable whispering take place 
               <br />
               when questions of serious importance were put 
               <br />
               to Lord Addison. I personally cannot but think 
               <br />
               that these two gentlemen, and I refer to the two 
               <br />
               members of the Commission government, un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly used their inﬂuence and efforts tojus-

               tify the actions of the Commission during the past 
               <br />
               six or seven years. What I have just said, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I believe. I would go so far as to

               that Newfoundland today needs no ﬁnancial help
