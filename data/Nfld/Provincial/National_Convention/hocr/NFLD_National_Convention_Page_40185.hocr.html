               I know they varied considerably, depending on

               the ability of the woodcutters. Could you give us

               and the reason is because the men have better

               Mr. Fudge There is another thing I would like 
               <br />
               to mention — forest ﬁres. I remind the delegates 
               <br />
               that when you take into consideration the number 
               <br />
               of men working in the companies’ woods during 
               <br />
               the summer months, and compare the number of 
               <br />
               tires, you will be surprised to hear that very 
               <br />
               seldom do we get a ﬁre caused by woodsmen. 
               <br />
               There was only one year that we had two ﬁres 
               <br />
               and there is, at times, anywhere from 5,000 to 
               <br />
               6,000 men engaged in the forest industry and I 
               <br />
               should say most of those men make little fires to 
               <br />
               boil their kettles and get their lunch twice a day, 
               <br />
               and it is remarkable to see how careful the 
               <br />
               woodsman is in protecting the forest. We should 
               <br />
               not forget them when bringing in this report. 
               <br />
               [There was some discussion of the section on 
               <br />
