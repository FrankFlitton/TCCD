               the past few days an election has been held 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland for the purpose of con~ 
               <br />
               stituting an assembly. The position of 
               <br />
               Canada is still as it has been stated on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion in this House. If the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland come to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that they would be happy to throw in their lot 
               <br />
               with Canada, their representations will be 
               <br />
               given most earnest and sympathetic con— 
               <br />
               sideration. But it has been said on more than 
               <br />
               one occasion in this House that this is some- 
               <br />
               thing concerning the inhabitants of the old 
               <br />

               corned here as cordially as we can welcome

               them. I believe there are many Canadians 
               <br />
               who feel that it would be to the mutual ad- 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. St. Laurent was followed immediately by 
               <br />
               Mr. John R. MacNichol, an Opposition member, 
               <br />
               who said: “If and when Newfoundland should 
               <br />
               send delegates to Canada to discuss the question 
               <br />
               of the entry of Newfoundland to Confederation, 
               <br />
               which I for one favour, I would strongly urge that 
               <br />
               no effort be made or no suggestion advanced to 
               <br />
               detach Labrador from Newfoundland.” Mr. Mac- 
               <br />
               Nichol said he had been in Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               knew how strongly Newfoundlanders felt on this 
               <br />
               point. Mr. St. Laurent expressed his agreement. I 
               <br />
               think, Mr. Chairman, we may feel quite sure that 
               <br />
               Canada would receive a delegation from this 
               <br />
               house and impart any terms that she was willing 
               <br />
               to offer. Their only policy in this whole matter is 
               <br />
               that it must be the Newfoundland people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them»</span> 
               <br />
               selves who shall express a wish for confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. Canada simply won’t accept Newfoundland 
               <br />
               unless the Newfoundland people express a wish 
               <br />
               for it. The Newfoundland people cannot express 
               <br />
               a wish for it until they know the terms, and that’s

               the Gallup poll held in Canada this summer a big

               So now, Mr. Chairman, we know all the fac- 
               <br />
               tors but one. We know that it is lawful for the 
               <br />
               Convention to send the delegation to Ottawa. We 
               <br />
               know that Ottawa will receive the delegation, and 
               <br />
               receive it cordially. We know that the opposition 
               <br />
               party will not oppose it. We know that the 
               <br />
               Canadian people will not oppose it. The only 
               <br />
               thing we still don’t know is what the New- 
               <br />
               foundland people want. We don’t know whether 
               <br />
               they want confederation or not — and we’re not 
               <br />
               going to know until they vote in the referendum. 
               <br />
               All we can do is get the terms and conditions and 
               <br />
               that’s all this resolution calls for. The rest can 
               <br />
               very safely be left to the people; once they know 
               <br />
               the terms, they’ll know how to make up their 
               <br />
               minds all right, never you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fear.</span>

               I am sorry, in a way, that when the committees 
               <br />
               were set up five weeks ago we didn’t set up ten 
               <br />
               committees instead of nine. While nine commit- 
               <br />
               tees were getting the facts about Commission 
               <br />
               government and responsible government, the 
               <br />
               tenth committee could have been getting the facts 
               <br />
               about confederation. However, it isn’t too late by 
               <br />
               any means. We can adopt this resolution and then 
               <br />
               the machinery can start. Word will finally come 
               <br />
               back to us saying very definitely whether Canada 
               <br />
               will receive the delegation, and the delegation 
               <br />
               itself could leave in December or early in 
               <br />
               January, for Ottawa. They’d probably be back in 
               <br />
               ten days or a fortnight, with the terms, and then 
               <br />
               the terms will be before us when we come around 
               <br />
               finally to discussing forms of government. If we 
               <br />
               think the terms are good, we‘ll be able to recom- 
               <br />
               mend that confederation on those terms be put 
               <br />
               before the people in the referendum. If we don’t 
               <br />
               think they’re worth putting before the people, We 
               <br />
               don‘t have to put them before the people. It’s the 
               <br />
               people who’ll decide. They’ll have the last word, 
               <br />
               and the only word that counts. If we ever enter
