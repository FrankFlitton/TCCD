               Now, as far as the terms are concerned, the 
               <br />
               terms laid down in this Grey Book that has been 
               <br />
               so much talked of, I ﬁnd myself agreeing with my 
               <br />
               colleague from the Ottawa delegation, Mr. Hig- 
               <br />
               gins, when he says that they are the best possible 
               <br />
               terms that Canada could offer. Of course, he 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed it by saying “under the conditions." I 
               <br />
               can put in that qualiﬁcation also but I do not 
               <br />
               consider the circumstances as unfavourable as 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins does. It is true that we did not have 
               <br />
               a battery of experts with us in Ottawa, it is true 
               <br />
               we were not experts ourselves, it is true we did 
               <br />
               not have any of the civil servants which we tried 
               <br />
               to obtain before we went, but were denied. If we 
               <br />
               had had these civil servants with us, I feel sure 
               <br />
               that we would not have spent three months in 
               <br />
               Ottawa. But while we weren’t experts ourselves, 
               <br />
               and while we didn’t have civil servants with us, 
               <br />
               make no mistake about it gentlemen, we had the 
               <br />
               facts about this country. Members of this delega- 
               <br />
               tion who don’t like confederation can say a lot of 
               <br />
               things to deny that, but I want to tell you that we 
               <br />
               had facts, the facts about this country; and we had 
               <br />
               men on that delegation who could present these 
               <br />
               facts. We had men who were very capable of 
               <br />
               presenting the facts. I don’t claim to be one of 
               <br />
               them. I took a small part, as faithfully as I could. 
               <br />
               And what is just as important, we had men of 
               <br />
               goodwill. We had men with a good spirit backing 
               <br />
               them, and men who gained the respect of the 
               <br />
               federal government officials in Ottawa. With 
               <br />
               that, with the facts before us, and with goodwill, 
               <br />
               we made what I consider to be the right and 
               <br />
               proper approach. We laid the facts before them. 
               <br />
               And together, in an atmosphere of respect for one 
               <br />
               another, and in an atmosphere of trust and sin— 
               <br />
               cerity, we worked out a plan whereby New~ 
               <br />
               foundland might ﬁt into the federal system of 
               <br />
               government and operate as the tenth province.

               Now it’s been said that we didn’t get good 
               <br />
               terms; we didn’t get the financial end of it very 
               <br />
               generous. But in my estimation, take it for what 
               <br />
               it’s worth, we got just as good terms as we could 
               <br />
               possibly get, recognising the fact that the federal 
               <br />

               <br />
               to come in on certain terms, and if we had been 
               <br />
               given more generous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms...</span> It wouldn’t be fair 
               <br />
               for the federal government to go too far to give 
               <br />
               us special services, special concessions when 
               <br />
               they have to consider that there are other mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the family who have to live within the 
               <br />
               family. To go in at all, we must go in on equal 
               <br />
               terms, and we are going to need to go in with 
               <br />
               these terms. I’m not convinced that, these are not 
               <br />
               generous terms under the circumstances. I think 
               <br />
               they are generous terms; what is worrying me is 
               <br />
               whether the Parliament of Canada will ratify 
               <br />
               these terms or not. And I wonder if they do not 
               <br />
               feel that they are so generous that perhaps they 
               <br />
               will not be ratiﬁed. But I feel that they will, they 
               <br />
               are generous, and I would pay a lot of attention 
               <br />
               to the arguments that Mr. Butt made here so ably 
               <br />
               this afternoon. If I were thinking that New- 
               <br />
               foundland under federal union to be an ideal 
               <br />
               place, one which will have after union unlimited 
               <br />
               prosperity, I would pay a lot of attention to the 
               <br />
               arguments being made. But I don’t see that it can 
               <br />
               be an ideal state, or that we will have unlimited 
               <br />
               prosperity. I don’t see the road ahead of us as too 
               <br />
               straight, with too many roses. I feel that we have 
               <br />
               a hard uphill climb to make. We have got a hard 
               <br />
               country to live in. We haven’t got the natural 
               <br />
               resources that other countries have, don’t let us 
               <br />
               kid ourselves. We’re not too generously supplied 
               <br />
               with natural resources, and the means of making 
               <br />
               them a good living. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It’s</span> going to be a hard job for 
               <br />
               us to do it. But I am of the opinion that we can do 
               <br />
               it better within the federal system of Canada, than 
               <br />
               we can do it on our own. I agree with Mr. Butt, 
               <br />
               when he raised his voice in the interest of the 
               <br />
               morale of our people and all that, but there’s a 
               <br />
               limit to it. And our people will have the morale 
               <br />
               and the spirit, and respect for themselves, when 
               <br />
               they ﬁnd that they’re getting somewhere. I feel 
               <br />
               that we’ll get somewhere under confederation, 
               <br />
               and our people’s respect for themselves will be 
               <br />
               forthcoming when they see that. That’s all I have 
               <br />
               to say on that line. I would like to reply, though, 
               <br />
