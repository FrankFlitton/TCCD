               per annum than contained in the Black Book. 
               <br />
               This deﬁciency was made up by the fact that the 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation forgot to include in their ex-

               If we peruse these estimates what do we ﬁnd? 
               <br />
               We ﬁnd that at least 1,200 civil servants will be 
               <br />
               laid off from work, but Mr. Smallwood tells us 
               <br />
               that once we become a province these people who 
               <br />
               have been dispensed with provincially will be 
               <br />
               employed in other departments of the federal 
               <br />
               government established in Newfoundland. In 
               <br />
               fact, he went so far as to say that an additional 
               <br />
               1,000 people would be required to administer the 
               <br />
               affairs of the Canadian federal government. This 
               <br />
               to my mind was a wild and incorrect statement, 
               <br />
               and there is no evidence contained in any of the 
               <br />
               documents to show that this will occur. Rather do 
               <br />
               I hazard the opinion, my personal opinion, that 
               <br />
               many hundreds of our civil servants would be put 
               <br />
               on the unemployed list. In the estimates for 
               <br />
               Public Health and Welfare as contained in the 
               <br />
               Black Book we are told by the OttaWa delegation 
               <br />
               that an amount of $4,767,000 will be sufﬁcient. 
               <br />
               However, Mr. Smallwood has increased this by 
               <br />
               another half million dollars. 
               <br />

               Now let us survey the various departments 
               <br />
               which would have to be financed by the province 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland should our people decide that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would unite with Canada. What 
               <br />
               do we ﬁnd? We ﬁnd that the following depart- 
               <br />
               ments would be those over which the control of 
               <br />
               expenditure would come within the scope of the 
               <br />
               province: Education, Justice, Natural Resources, 
               <br />
               Public Works, Public Health and Welfare, the

               Liquor Control, Home Affairs and provincial 
               <br />
               treasury. All these departments, according to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, would involve an annual expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of approximately $15.5 million. Let us see
