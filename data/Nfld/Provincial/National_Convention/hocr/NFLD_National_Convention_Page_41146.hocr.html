               Mr. Cashin Before I proceed, I want to say that

               I understand His Excellency the Governor is 
               <br />
               leaving for England tomorrow on ofﬁcial busi— 
               <br />

               <br />
               cy with all respect, in view of the statements I 
               <br />
               made yesterday, that before he returns to resume 
               <br />
               ofﬁce as representative of His Majesty, he might 
               <br />
               ask the United Kingdom government to let us 
               <br />
               know why Great Britain failed to carry out its 
               <br />
               obligation or contract with the people of New-

               Newfoundland government and the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom in 1933.... There are others besides 
               <br />
               myself who think that this Convention which has 
               <br />
               been going on for some time — two and a half 
               <br />
               years ago I said this Convention was a farce and 
               <br />
               there are others now who have come to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con‘</span> 
               <br />
               clusion that I was right. This Convention has been 
               <br />
               a failure and some have appealed to the govern— 
               <br />
               ment to have it called off. I would suggest there- 
               <br />
               fore, with all due respect, that His Excellency 
               <br />
               ascertain from the United Kingdom government 
               <br />
               during his visit why they have not carried out this 
               <br />
               agreement. In View of the fact that this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion has been termed a failure, the 1933 actshould 
               <br />
               be carried out.

               Speaking again on taxation in Canada at the 
               <br />
               present time, I notice Mr. Smallwood pointed out 
               <br />
               that practically all the taxes are paid by Ontario.

               a right to pay these taxes direct and indirect 
               <br />

               present time the DOSCO people have adopted a

               As I said, with regard to direct taxation, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has not told us how these taxes are to 
               <br />
               be collected or from what source. No one has told 
               <br />
               us how they expect to collect these monies. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has not told us. Why? Because there 
               <br />
               shall be extra taxation to go on. Every man, 
               <br />
               woman and child will be taxed; an extra <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">38-10</span>

               million will have to be inﬂicted and do not let

               tmyone fool you to that effect. Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               stated on occasions that the wealthy will have to 
               <br />
               pay this taxation. I think I heard him one time say 
               <br />
               that Mr. Job and Mr. Crosbie and some others, 
               <br />
               because they are merchants, they will have to pay

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I know; but I did not say it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin You are banking on the baby bonus. 
               <br />
               Next thing, you will have a baby farm. I say to 
               <br />
               you, that the rich will pay their share, but the 
               <br />
               ordinary man and woman of this country will, in 
               <br />
               the final analysis, pay all these taxes. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood in his abortive budget has not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indi»</span> 
               <br />
               cated in what way these taxes will be collected. 
               <br />
               He has refused to do this, because he has been 
               <br />
               trying to convey to the country that there will be 
               <br />
               no such thing as additional taxation, when he 
               <br />
               knows quite well that there will be. Plenty of it. 
               <br />
               There are many kinds of direct taxation; property 
               <br />
               tax, which could be imposed on people owning 
               <br />
               property and homes. There is education tax, 
               <br />
               whereby people in the various outports would 
               <br />
               have to pay the increased cost of education for 
               <br />
               their children. There is also sales tax in force in 
               <br />
               some provinces, which means that every time one 
               <br />
               makes a purchase of goods in any store, one 
               <br />
               would have to pay a provincial sales tax. In 
               <br />
               Quebec it is 4%. If you want to buy a present, you 
               <br />
               have to pay 25% luxury tax. If you want to buy 
               <br />
               an alarm clock, you have to pay 25%. There is 
               <br />
               such a thing as a hospital tax effective in Canada, 
               <br />
               a 5% hospital tax in Quebec. There are many 
               <br />
               forms of direct taxation, many of which will have 
               <br />
               to be imposed on our people in order to collect 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$840</span> million a year in provincial taxes in order 
               <br />
               to balance the provincial budget. I move that the

               committee rise.
