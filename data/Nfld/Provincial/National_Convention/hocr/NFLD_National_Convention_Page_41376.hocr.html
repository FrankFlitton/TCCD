               <br />
               that category. It is obviously restricted. You can

               of the British government to say that no others 
               <br />

               I draw these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters,</span> sir, to your attention. 
               <br />
               They are for your consideration. They are your 
               <br />
               responsibility and not mine. For my part1 am here 
               <br />
               to vote for those forms which I think should be 
               <br />
               submitted to the people, and to refuse to vote for 
               <br />
               those forms which I consider should not be so 
               <br />
               submitted; but Ihave no right whatever, under the 
               <br />
               Convention Act, to ask the British government to 
               <br />
               keep any form off the ballot paper, either directly 
               <br />
               or inferentially, and that is the effect of this 
               <br />
               resolution. As to the forms of government for 
               <br />
               which I shall vote, the form which I shall support 
               <br />
               at the referendum, that is an entirely different 
               <br />
               question. I am not bound to disclose my political 
               <br />
               views to this Convention, or to anybody unless I 
               <br />
               so desire, and I shall not do so this afternoon. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have only to say in conclusion that I favour 
               <br />
               the submission of both Commission of Govem— 
               <br />
               ment and responsible government to the people, 
               <br />
               but I do not favour a resolution which attempts to 
               <br />
               exclude everything but these two; and that is what 
               <br />
               this resolution does attempt to do. I consider that 
               <br />
               it is framed, not to put the two forms it mentions 
               <br />
               upon the ballot paper, so much as it is to keep all 
               <br />
               others off. I shall vote against the resolution, sir. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to this 
               <br />
               motion, so ably proposed by Mr. Gordon Higgins 
               <br />
               KC, and also very admirably seconded by Mr. 
               <br />
               Reuben Vardy. I might say, sir, at the outset, that 
               <br />
               I agree wholeheartedly with this motion made 
               <br />
               and I shall attempt to prove in a few moments 
               <br />
               why I believe it.

               There are one or two things I would like to 
               <br />
               mention, and the ﬁrst is that I have been very 
               <br />
               greatly impressed by the spirit of the debate on 
               <br />
               this motion and secondly, very greatly impressed 
               <br />

               by the quality of the various speeches which have 
               <br />
               been delivered. There is just one thing I want to 
               <br />
               say in connection with the remarks made by my 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Keough, yesterday I believe. Mr. 
               <br />
               Keough apparently wishes to establish himself 
               <br />
               and Mr. Newell as the two people, alone of all 
               <br />
               this Convention, whose wish and desire and hope 
               <br />
               is for three square meals a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day.</span> So far as I can 
               <br />
               gather they are convinced that the other 42 or 43 
               <br />
               members of this Convention don’t give a tinker’s 
               <br />
               cuss as to what happens to the man on the bill of 
               <br />
               Cape St. George. Both Mr. Keough and Mr. 
               <br />
               Newell are workers in the co-operative move- 
               <br />
               ment, and I therefore cannot understand either of 
               <br />
               them thinking that nobody else in this Conven— 
               <br />
               tion cares for what they term the underdog. He 
               <br />
               said yesterday, and I quote as nearly as I can, that 
               <br />
               “If the ﬁsherman or the poor farther or the poor 
               <br />
               whatnot in this country could obtain his three 
               <br />
               square meals a clay, little did he worry as to the 
               <br />
               man at the seat of government getting away with 
               <br />
               a draft.” Now that is a very false philosophy, and 
               <br />
               I am surprised that any man who is supposed to 
               <br />
               be a leader in a co—operative movement should 
               <br />
               ever express it. “If you can get your three square 
               <br />
               meals all right, don’ t worry about the fellows who 
               <br />
               are ruling over you." That is the opinion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exv</span> 
               <br />
               pressed by Mr. Keough, and Mr. Keough is a 
               <br />
               friend of mine, and I sincerely hope he made a 
               <br />
               mistake and said something he did not intend to 
               <br />
               say. It is an absolutely false philosophy that you 
               <br />
               are going to make dumb, driven cattle of our 
               <br />
               people, or any other people. Is that all you want, 
               <br />
               to be fed and left alone like animals? I sincerely 
               <br />
               hope not, and I hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Keough and Mr. Newell 
               <br />
               will tell the people that in addition to being fed 
               <br />
               three square meals a clay, and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mugeup</span> at night, 
               <br />
               in addition to that they will teach our voters to 
               <br />
               think, and that they have to take an interest in the 
               <br />
               men that they send to rule over them. I hope they 
               <br />
               will not forget <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that...</span> 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I had planned and had set out to prove 
               <br />
               the very thing, the very statement which has just 
               <br />
               been read by my friend Mr. Bradley. Some of the 
               <br />
               things which Mr. Bradley said [do not agree with,

               absolutely correct, and that is that once having

               <br />
               endeavour to prove it. First, I am going to speak

               from a text — not scripture —- and I want to quote
