               Mr. Smallwood Well Mr. Chairman, I’m afraid 
               <br />
               that if Major Cashin thinks that he put more 
               <br />
               information into his Finance Report than we had 
               <br />
               about the Railway in our Transporation Report, 
               <br />
               he’ll have to check it all over again. There’s a 
               <br />
               thousand times more information about the rail- 
               <br />
               way system in our report than there is in the 
               <br />
               Financial Report, and that’s what you’d expect... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Now order, gentlemen, 
               <br />
               please... I suggest we proceed on the assumption 
               <br />
               that however bad or however good it may be, the 
               <br />
               members put their all into it, and to me it’s a very 
               <br />
               imposing document, and I’ll need to hear a great 
               <br />
               deal of argument before I can conclude other- 
               <br />
               wise. But I don’t think it’s proper at this juncture 
               <br />
               to make any comment upon the amount of work 
               <br />
               which may have put in by any of the individual 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Sir, I agree completely with

               Mr. Chairman Gentlemen, please bear in mind 
               <br />
               that opinion is a matter of judgement upon which 
               <br />
               men might reasonably differ. A man can be quite 
               <br />
               erroneous but still honest in the expression of his 
               <br />
               opinion. Any opinion that any member draws 
               <br />
               from any document tabled in this house isn’t 
               <br />
               necessarily dishonest because he may be er- 
               <br />
               roneous in the conclusions to which he arrives. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Now at the point at which 
               <br />
               Major Cashin interrupted me I was trying to 
               <br />
               show the total expenditure of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government from 1900 to 1947 each year. And I 
               <br />
               put in those figures everything they spent, 
               <br />
               whether it was on ordinary, special, reconstruc- 
               <br />
               tion, capital or any other account, the total of it 
               <br />
               each year. And Major Cashin arose to point out 
               <br />
               that I was lumping them altogether, all the expen— 
               <br />
               ditures, and in reply to that I say yes, that’s 
               <br />
               exactly what I have done — the total amount 
               <br />
               they’ve spent every year is the figure that I’ve got 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down...</span> Sir, you wouldn’t remember, because it 
               <br />
               was before your time in this Convention, but I 
               <br />
               moved that the Convention desired to get the

               Mr. Cashin No, about $38 million, I suppose.

               produced forthe year? Is it 20%, 30%, or 40%?....

               wealth produced by the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               this year? He doesn’t know. I don’tknow. No one 
               <br />
               knows. Every other country knows this. The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance, when he brings in his budget, can 
               <br />
               safely take say 12% of the total wealth produced 
               <br />
               in his country for the year in taxation, and that 
               <br />
               won’t be too heavy a burden on the people of his 
               <br />
               country, or it may be 15%. but he knows exactly 
               <br />
               what percentage he can safely take in taxes out of 
               <br />
               the total wealth produced in a year. Now we

               haven’t got that in Newfoundland because we
