               are reasonably correct, reasonably realistic, it 
               <br />
               would mean that in the first four years of union 
               <br />
               — no, I have got to go a step further -— if these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures are reasonably correct and if the federal 
               <br />
               government’s figures of their revenue are 
               <br />
               reasonably correct $20 million that they would 
               <br />
               collect from us, and $4.5 million that the provin- 
               <br />
               cial government would collect from us, would 
               <br />
               give us a total of $24.5 million for the first four 
               <br />
               years of union —— per year that is — $24.5 million

               grand total taxation on the Newfoundland people,

               <br />
               tion of $75 on the average. It does not mean that

               every child and every infant and every man and 
               <br />
               woman, boy and girl would pay $75, but on the 
               <br />
               average it would be a per capita taxation of $75
