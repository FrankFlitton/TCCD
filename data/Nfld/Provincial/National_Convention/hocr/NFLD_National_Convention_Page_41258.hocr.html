               Mr- Crosbie As I have it here, sir, Mr. St. 
               <br />
               Laurent stated that it could be provided in terms 
               <br />
               of union, that the ﬁshery legislation in force in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland remain in force. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well, hasn’t that been pro- 
               <br />
               vided‘! 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie Not necessarily and speciﬁcally, 
               <br />
               no. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well it‘s not only that law, but 
               <br />
               all laws stay as they are until altered. And as to 
               <br />
               altering them, we have the statement there that 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries trade can be reassured, the Fishery 
               <br />
               Board and the ﬁshery regulations will not be 
               <br />
               abolished. Clear as daylight... Maybe for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Crosbie’s beneﬁt, Mr. Ashboume wouldn’t mind 
               <br />
               reading the whole minute, it’s a minute of a 
               <br />
               plenary session. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne “Mr. St. Laurent stated that it 
               <br />
               could be provided in the terms of union that 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries legislation presently enforced in New- 
               <br />
               foundland would remain in force until amended 
               <br />
               or repealed by the appropriate legislative 
               <br />
               authorities. The federal government would not be 
               <br />
               disposed to interfere with the system presently in 
               <br />
               effect in Newfoundland unless it proposed to 
               <br />
               introduce legislation which would represent an 
               <br />
               improvement over present regulation; and there- 
               <br />
               fore would not be likely to repeal Newfoundland 
               <br />
               legislation in order to remove a regulatory system 
               <br />
               which has proven beneﬁcial. The Newfoundland 
               <br />
               ﬁshing industry might reasonably be informed 
               <br />
               that it need anticipate nothing prejudicial in this 
               <br />
               respect as a result of union with Canada.” 
               <br />
               Now, sir, I would like to read certain excerpts 
               <br />
               from the Fisheries Prices Support Act, 1944.... 
               <br />

               accordance with the regulations of the 
               <br />
               Governor in Council, have authority to 
               <br />
               prescribe from time to time prices at which 
               <br />
               the Board may purchase ﬁsheries products; 
               <br />
               (b) to purchase directly or by means of agents 
               <br />

               product on inspection meets standards as to 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I wonder if Mr. Ashboume 
               <br />
               would permit me just for a moment. Does Mr. 
               <br />
               Ashboume, and do the other members of the 
               <br />
               delegation, recall how it was pointed out that 
               <br />
               under that very subsection that Mr. Ashboume 
               <br />
               has just read, where the Fish Prices Support 
               <br />
               Board of Canada may set up commodity boards, 
               <br />
               that the Newfoundland Fisheries Board might 
               <br />
               well be a commodity board of the Fish Prices 
               <br />
               Support board? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin If it is changed to a ﬁsh prices 
               <br />
               commodity board, it won’t be allowed to function 
               <br />
               like it does now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Function, actually function as 
               <br />
               now within the Fish Prices Support Board. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Yes, Mr. Chairman, I maintain 
               <br />
               that that is the idea. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The Fish Prices Support Board 
               <br />
               is federal and it may appoint other boards 
               <br />
               throughout Canada. In the case of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, we already have a board, the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Board could be the commodity board for New- 
               <br />
               foundland under the Fish Prices Support Board 
               <br />
               of Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Mr. Chairman, as far as I can 
               <br />
               gather in Canada they are most favourably im- 
               <br />
               pressed by what the Newfoundland Fisheries 
               <br />
               Board has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accomplished.</span> And as has already 
               <br />
               been related by Mr. Crosbie, they sent a delega-
