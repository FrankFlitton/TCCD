               teachers' salaries, the only thing I can say is this: 
               <br />
               is the government paying scab wages for one of 
               <br />
               the most important professions in the country? 
               <br />
               After all, teachers start off when they ﬁrst leave 
               <br />
               home to go to school; and schoolteachers should 
               <br />
               be considered among the most important profes- 
               <br />
               sional people we have. I beg to make a motion 
               <br />
               that this Convention go on record and recom- 
               <br />
               mend to the Commission of Government that 
               <br />
               they raise the basic wages for teachers, even if we 
               <br />
               have to bring the higher-ups down. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has mentioned that it is possible 
               <br />
               when we get plenty of goods on the market again, 
               <br />
               prices will come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down.</span> Even if that does happen, 
               <br />
               still the teachers are not getting a decent living 
               <br />
               wage, and by asking for an increase on the basic 
               <br />
               rate, that will give them a little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further</span> increase 
               <br />
               when the buying power of the dollar increases. I 
               <br />
               beg that the Education Committee recommend to 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government an increase in 
               <br />

               [know there are many people thinking and saying 
               <br />
               that $3.5 million is a lot of money to be spending 
               <br />
               on education in this country, and are wondering 
               <br />
               if we are getting adequate returns for such a large 
               <br />
               sum. 1 think every cent of this money is well 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spent,</span> Up to ten or 15 years ago many of our 
               <br />
               outport schools were scarcely fit to herd cattle in, 
               <br />
               and in such buildings we compelled our children 
               <br />
               to spend ﬁve or six hours a day. These schools, 
               <br />
               if you can call them such, were poorly lighted, 
               <br />
               poorly ventilated, poorly furnished, and inade— 
               <br />
               quately staffed. No wonder the Department of 
               <br />
               Public Health and Welfare in its investigations 
               <br />
               found such a large percentage of our school 
               <br />
               children’s eyesight defective, brought about 
               <br />
               chiefly by eye strain. Many of these schools 
               <br />
               contained long benches, in which five or six 
               <br />
               children sat with no support to their backs, and 
               <br />
               with chests cupped in in order to reach the desk 
               <br />
               which was either too high or too low, and in this 
               <br />
               posture they generally sat through the period. Is 
               <br />
               it any wonder that we have such a high percent- 
               <br />
               age of TB in this country? I am sure we all agree 
               <br />
               and are pleased to know that the Department of 
               <br />
               Education is taking steps to remedy this evil as 
               <br />
               quickly as possible with the grants at its disposal. 
               <br />
               I said that the schools were understaffed. I will 
               <br />
               give you an example from my own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experience,</span> I 
               <br />
               once taught, or tried to teach, in a school with 
               <br />
               over 100 pupils enrolled with no assistance. I was 
               <br />
               not only supposed to teach the lower grades, but 
               <br />
               expected to prepare primary, preliminary, inter- 
               <br />
               mediate and associate grades as well. Is it any 
               <br />
               wonder, Mr. Chairman, that I am standing here 
               <br />
               today after going through such an ordeal for three 
               <br />
               years? I am glad to say that these conditions do 
               <br />
               not exist at the present time, thanks to increased 
               <br />
               educational grants. It has been said that all our 
               <br />
               government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">departments</span> are overstaffed, be that 
               <br />
               as it may. In my experience with the Department 
               <br />
               of Education, I am sure this does not apply. Every 
               <br />
               person employed there is giving faithful service 
               <br />
               for the salary which he or she receives. In refer- 
               <br />
               ence to teachers, it has been often said that they 
               <br />
               have a good job, only having to work for five 
               <br />
               hours a day. I say it is a noble job, trying to mould 
               <br />
               the minds and characters of boys and girls, in 
               <br />
               order to fit them to take their place in the com- 
               <br />
               munity in which they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">live,</span> It is a noble work, and 
               <br />
               teachers should be better paid for the work they 
               <br />
               are trying to perform. But if a person thinks a
