               <br />
               that union with Canada under these terms would 
               <br />
               lose us all control over these resources in 
               <br />
               Labrador, and all control over where we may ship 
               <br />
               our products, and it would be only a matter of 
               <br />
               time before we would be reduced to the status of

               <br />
               put this country into confederation? If I were the

               only man in this country, sir, who was against

               <br />
               against the motion. The same evening paper I 
               <br />
               referred to before, sir, states that we men of the 
               <br />
               Convention were not required to advise upon any 
               <br />

               refer to this, because a good many people are 
               <br />
               lately thinking the same thing. I believe you will

               agree that section 3 of the act is quite clear on that

               point. I believe it states clearly that we are to 
               <br />
               make recommendations. How else can we make
