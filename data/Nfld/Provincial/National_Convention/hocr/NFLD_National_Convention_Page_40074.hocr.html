               Job. I have knowu <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mri</span> Wild since he ﬁrst came 
               <br />
               to this country. We had many good tiffs; there 
               <br />
               were times when he was perhaps wrong and there 
               <br />
               were times when he was critically correct; but I 
               <br />
               have always found him co-operative and he did 
               <br />
               the best he could in his way, and he did a fairly 
               <br />
               good job. Let us wish him bon voyage and hope 
               <br />
               that he and his good wife reach the homeland

               Mr. Wild I deeply appreciate your kind wishes 
               <br />
               and I can assure you it has been a great pleasure 
               <br />
               to me to come here and meet you. I am sorry I 
               <br />
               have not been able to tell you more or spend 
               <br />
               longer with you. I was in Newfoundland from 
               <br />
               1934 to 1938 and when I was asked to come back 
               <br />
               again in 1944, I gladly did so. I think, as Mr. Dunn 
               <br />
               says, Newfoundland gets in your blood. I can 
               <br />
               assure Mr. Job that when I go back I shall have 
               <br />
               the welfare of Newfoundland in my heart and 
               <br />
               shall be willing to do anything I can do. I hope 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will put up a good show in the 
               <br />
               tariff negotiations, and even though you are a 
               <br />
               small country, the very fact that you are small is 
               <br />
               all the more reason that you perhaps can put 
               <br />
               something across I do hope that the deliberations 
               <br />
               of the Convention will go forward with the same 
               <br />
               promise shown in the last two weeks. I do wish 
               <br />
               you the very best success in your efforts.
