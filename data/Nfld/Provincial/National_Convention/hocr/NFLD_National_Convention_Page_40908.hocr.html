               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I move item 2 
               <br />
               on the order paper, and in doing so, I would like 
               <br />
               to make a brief explanation. A few days ago in 
               <br />
               the debate on this order in committee of the whole 
               <br />
               arather heated exchange, at least on my side, took 
               <br />
               place between Mr. Higgins and myself. I got 
               <br />
               angry, as the Convention may recall, and in the 
               <br />
               course of my remarks said, “All right, let’s have 
               <br />
               a showdown, and the whole story will come out". 
               <br />
               I don’t know the exact words I used, but I con- 
               <br />
               veyed the impression that there was a story to 
               <br />
               come out. There was nothing out of the way. I 
               <br />
               was not referring to anything that happened in 
               <br />
               Ottawa, and did not even have that in my mind. I 
               <br />
               was thinking of something altogether different, 
               <br />
               andI would like that to be thoroughly understood 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It is clear therefore you never 
               <br />
               intended to convey the impression that there was 
               <br />
               room for the slightest doubt upon the integrity 
               <br />
               and character and efﬁciency of Mr. Higgins. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I was not referring to that at all. 
               <br />
               I may go so far as to say this, that the delegation 
               <br />
               in Ottawa were the best possible friends. We 
               <br />
               worked together, we collaborated, each man did 
               <br />
               his work, and his fair share, and there was no bad 
               <br />
               feeling. Mr. Higgins and I worked together on 
               <br />
               several things that the other members of the 
               <br />
               delegation did not work on, on the matter of 
               <br />
               housing for example, because Mr. Higgins hap-
