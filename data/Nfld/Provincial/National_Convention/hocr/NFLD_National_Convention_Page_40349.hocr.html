               <br />
               ment is concerned. Where you ﬁnd quotation 
               <br />
               marks in the report, they are nearly always from 
               <br />
               that memorandum. Before we start to discuss the 
               <br />
               report, I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Gillis for 
               <br />
               I know he wished, at times, that the Dickens had 
               <br />
               us. Having examined this document we 
               <br />
               proceeded to get certain facts about imports and 
               <br />
               local production. We then got government ex- 
               <br />
               penditure ﬁgures, and when we thought we had 
               <br />
               a rough picture of agriculture in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               we then got from government ofﬁcials and out- 
               <br />
               side sources, evidence; and this evidence we used 
               <br />
               for checking and cross—checking our own 
               <br />
               opinion. The result you will find in the report 
               <br />
               before you. The Committee was careful not to 
               <br />
               make the value of agriculture either too much or 
               <br />
               too little. It would be fair to say we viewed the 
               <br />
               prospects in agriculture in the future with much 
               <br />
               greater enthusiasm than would appear from the 
               <br />
               report itself. There is one section on the 
               <br />
               demonstration farm which may suggest that the 
               <br />
               Committee did not put much value on the farm. 
               <br />
               That would be incorrect. All we wished to convey 
               <br />
               was the fact that for one reason or another, the 
               <br />
               farm did not appear to us to be used as much as 
               <br />
               it should, in the interests of agriculture as a 
               <br />
