               Too much time is devoted to talking about the 
               <br />
               problem of Newfoundland and not enough ener- 
               <br />
               gy applied to ﬁnding a solution. The prophets of 
               <br />
               gloom assert we are eternally on the edge of an 
               <br />
               abyss; that nothing can be done; that we have no 
               <br />
               future - as though no other country ever had a 
               <br />
               problem. What is this fantastic problem of New— 
               <br />
               foundland? We speak the same language; we 
               <br />
               enjoy religious freedom; we have no persecuted 
               <br />
               minorities; we do not want to make war on 
               <br />
               anybody to gain more living space. In this 
               <br />
               modern day our ﬁshery resources are virtually 
               <br />
               untapped; we have forests; we have minerals; we 
               <br />
               are a hard-working and good-living people. 
               <br />
               Where then is the problem? It is nothing more or 
               <br />
               less than ourselves; we will not trust ourselves to 
               <br />
               ourselves and so we trust ourselves to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others.</span> 
               <br />
               That is not a problem <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> it is a state of mind that 
               <br />
               only mutual trust and a belief in our own integrity 
               <br />
               can overcome.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Part of that state of mind is our readiness to 
               <br />
               take the line of least resistance. It is so much 
               <br />
               easier to assume that nothing can be done than to 
               <br />
               actually try to accomplish some end. It brings to 
               <br />
               mind the phrase of an anonymous writer: “The 
               <br />
               reason some men do not succeed is because their 
               <br />
               wishbone is where their backbone ought to be.” 
               <br />
               Is that part of our problem? Do we spend too

               <br />
               why we feel we cannot run our country, because 
               <br />
               we haven’t the backbone, and so we turn it over

               <br />
               think that the root of our problem is spiritual; not 
               <br />
               in the religious sense, but in the sense that means 
               <br />
               enthusiastic, mettlesome, animated with a belief 
               <br />
               and a flaming desire to make Newfoundland a 
               <br />
               better home, and Newfoundlanders a name to 
               <br />
               conjure with among all men. We are still a 
               <br />
               pioneer country, and we need the pioneer spirit, 
               <br />
               unafraid to blaze new trails, cross new frontiers, 
               <br />
               and look ahead to far horizons of achievement.
