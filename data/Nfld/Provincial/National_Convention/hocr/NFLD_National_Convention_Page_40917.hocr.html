               Mr. Burry I would like to make myself clear on 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point.</span> When I accepted these minutes and 
               <br />
               other information in those envelopes marked 
               <br />
               “Secret”, I accepted them as secret, but not with 
               <br />
               the understanding that it was to be kept away 
               <br />
               from this Convention. It was a convenience 
               <br />
               agreed among us that it should be done that way, 
               <br />
               and we were to receive ofﬁcial documents when 
               <br />
               we left; and these are the ofﬁcial documents. I 
               <br />
               have read them through, and I have my secret 
               <br />
               information and minutes, and I have read these 
               <br />
               through, and there is nothing in that secret infor- 
               <br />
               mation that is not embodied in these documents 
               <br />
               here, if not word for word, certainly in the spirit 
               <br />
               of it. I accepted the secret information with the 
               <br />
               understanding that it would be given to us ofﬁ- 
               <br />
               cially, and we were to take back to this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion ofﬁcial documents that we would agree upon 
               <br />
               as a result of our meeting there. There is nothing 
               <br />
               in the secret documents that I would not have this 
               <br />
               Convention receive. If I had known that I would 
               <br />
               not have accepted them. When I went to Ottawa 
               <br />
               I went there to do my best, and to bring back 
               <br />
               everything that went on there, as far as I could 
               <br />
               possibly do it. Ihave done it, sir, in these ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               documents, and l have nothing whatever to hold 
               <br />

               Mr. Hickman I am glad that this point was 
               <br />
               brought up. I was going to ask why they were left 
               <br />
               out, but I don't have to ask <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now,</span> Mr. Smallwood

               has said that what was in the Black Book, the

               ofﬁcial handout from the Canadian government,

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               was selected by the Canadian government, and I 
               <br />
               can quite understand why some paragraphs may 
               <br />
               have been left out. The Canadian government 
               <br />
               would not select something that would not look 
               <br />
               very good to some Newfoundlanders. I brought 
               <br />
               up that question yesterday, and asked Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood if there was any assurance or any 
               <br />
               guarantee that if the Canadian National Railway 
               <br />
               took over our Railway that they would retain the 
               <br />
               same number of employees that we have working 
               <br />
               today. Mr. Smallwood said that there was no 
               <br />
               assurance, and possibly there would not be. I can 
               <br />
               quite see that, but, as Mr. Fogwill just pointed 
               <br />
               out, when I asked him this question, and ifhe had 
               <br />
               this information in front of him, why could he not 
               <br />
               have answered me and told me that? As it says 
               <br />
               here: “This looks to be an undue number in 
               <br />
               relation to the size of the operation." If that's the 
               <br />
               opinion of the officials who constitute the 
               <br />
               government and from whom the cabinet take 
               <br />
               their ﬁndings, it may be that they might say, “We 
               <br />
               will cut this staff 25%, and lay 90 or 100 men 
               <br />
               off.“ I asked that yesterday, and I don’t see why 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood could not have brought that out. 
               <br />
               It would have satisﬁed me. I heard nothing about 
               <br />
               it until Mr. Higgins brought it up today. I don’t 
               <br />
               want to say too much, but it doesn‘t seem right to 
               <br />
               me the way some things are going. Twice Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood was reading words there that were 
               <br />
               not in the report, and if we are going to have the 
               <br />
               report...
