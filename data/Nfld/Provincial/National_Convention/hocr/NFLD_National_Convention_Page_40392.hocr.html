               considered by the Steering Committee before

               <br />
               several meetings, and the result is the motion now 
               <br />

               This really is not my motion. It is the motion 
               <br />
               of the Steering Committee, but I was asked by the 
               <br />
               Chairman to bring the matter before you as it 
               <br />
               arose out of a motion which came before you on 
               <br />
               the 28th, and which was unanimously passed. 
               <br />
               May I refer you back again to the last clause of 
               <br />
               the original motion, which states “that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Steer»</span>

               ing Committee be requested to prepare a detailed 
               <br />
               statement”. I think the Committee will agree that 
               <br />
               it would have been very difficult to make such a 
               <br />
               detailed statement....

               I feel, and I think the Steering Committee 
               <br />
               agrees, that one reason why we did not detail 
               <br />
               these various headings is probably this: that there 
               <br />
               are questions in these various headings here 
               <br />

               Majesty’s Government in England. At the mo-

               whom we represent, but I am quite sure that the 
               <br />
               people of this country do not want us to disclose 
               <br />
               to the world at large the various questions that 
               <br />
               will have to be asked under the various headings 
               <br />
               in the motion before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you.</span> There will be pertinent 
               <br />
               questions asked His Majesty‘s Government by 
               <br />
               any delegation that may proceed from here and 
               <br />
               I am sure that every member will agree that the 
               <br />
               very questions which we are to put to His 
               <br />
               Majesty’s Government should not be public to 
               <br />
               the world at large at the present time. The answers 
               <br />
               to these questions which the delegation will bring 
               <br />
               back will, in due course, be published to the
