               the question be deferred until the delegation 
               <br />
               comes back from England. What right have we

               to believe that any delegation will be permitted 
               <br />
               to go to Canada? All we do know is that the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government is going to see if the 
               <br />
               English government will receive a delegation, 
               <br />
               and what happens there will certainly have a 
               <br />
               bearing on the delegation’s going to Canada — 
               <br />
               if it is necessary. As I see it, it is doubtful whether 
               <br />
               our terms of reference permit a delegation to go 
               <br />
               to Canada at all. I have looked into the matter and 
               <br />
               I am prepared to believe that to be the case and I

               Mr. Chairman If these editorials are calculated 
               <br />
               in any way to prejudice the debate, Icannot allow

               them to be read. The Daily News has no seat in

               Mr. Crummey I state it as my own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viewpoint.</span> 
               <br />
               “On the third point of the Job resolution an 
               <br />
               answer has been made that is quite unequivocal 
               <br />
               and substantiates the position that the negotiation 
               <br />
               of terms of union with Dominion of Canada is 
               <br />
               between governments. 0n the question of steps 
               <br />
               to establish economic or ﬁscal relationship the 
               <br />
               position is that it is doubtful if the matter comes 
               <br />
               within the terms of reference.” That is exactly my 
               <br />
               position. I am not prepared to vote for the motion 
               <br />
               before the House. Do the members think the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada would risk the chance of 
               <br />
               holding themselves up to ridicule by giving to a 
               <br />
               wholly unauthorised body terms of union, when 
               <br />
               nobody is assured that Dominions Ofﬁce will 
               <br />
               allow it to be put on the ballot paper? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. McCarthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, when the debate 
               <br />
               on this resolution started it was not my intention 
               <br />
               to make a speech. It is not my intention to do so 
               <br />
               now. But since a lot of delegates seem to be 
               <br />
               explaining why they are going to vote for the 
               <br />
               resolution or against it, I think that maybe I 
               <br />
               should make my position clear also. I am going 
               <br />
               to vote for the motion and in doing so want to 
               <br />
               make it clear that I am not necessarily for con- 
               <br />
               federation; that is something upon which I shall 
               <br />
               make up my mind if and when we hear the terms. 
               <br />
               In the issue now before the Convention I am 
               <br />
               concerned only that the people of this country

               should not be restricted in their choice. I stand 
               <br />
               with Mr. Keough that it is important for the

               <br />
               expecting to hear them; to have a chance to vote

               they so wish; to vote for responsible government

               I do not want to see them restricted in their choice 
               <br />
               in any way. And so, I stand to support the motion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Roberts After the impassioned speeches 
               <br />
               made here by quite a number of the delegates, I 
               <br />
               will not delay the House long with my feeble 
               <br />
               remarks. Some time ago I voted against a motion 
               <br />
               such as this, not that I thought it should not have 
               <br />
               been made, but because I thought it premature. 
               <br />
               This time I do not think it premature and I am 
               <br />
               going to support the motion. I will give you a brief 
               <br />
               history of the political life of St. Barbe district, 
               <br />
               known as the forgotten northwest coast, forgotten 
               <br />
               not only by Commission of Government but by 
               <br />
               all responsible governments; and although I 
               <br />
               would at the moment vote for return of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responc</span> 
               <br />
               sible government, I would not bind myself to it if 
               <br />
               I saw a better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">form.</span> The man who runs for mem- 
               <br />
               ber in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> Barbe district on a responsible ticket 
               <br />
               will have to be a superior gentleman to be able to 
               <br />
               convince these people that responsible govern— 
               <br />
               ment will be the cure-all for their ills. As far as I 
               <br />
               can gather, and I know a good deal about the 
               <br />
               political feelings of our people, Commission of 
               <br />
               Government with all their mistakes would get a 
               <br />
               substantial vote in St. Barbe, on account of the 
               <br />
               founding of the co-operative societies which 
               <br />
               have played a large part in the economic well- 
               <br />
               being of our people, as well as the building of 
               <br />
               hospitals and roads in the Bonne Bay end of the 
               <br />
               district. These things came during the tenure of 
               <br />
               the Commission, not responsible government. 
               <br />
               On the other hand, our people have had so much 
               <br />
               contact with Canada from the days of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               settlers up to the present, that quite a bond of 
               <br />
               friendship has grown up between our two 
               <br />
               peoples, and I have no hesitation in saying quite 
               <br />
               a number ofour people would vote for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confedera‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion, terms or no terms. I have received since I 
               <br />
               came here letters and telegrams from quite a 
               <br />
               number of respectable and intelligent people 
               <br />
               from all parts of the district asking me to vote to 
               <br />
