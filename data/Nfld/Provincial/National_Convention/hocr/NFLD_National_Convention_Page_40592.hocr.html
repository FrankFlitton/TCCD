               well explained to you by other members who 
               <br />
               have spoken. With regard to the base deals we did 
               <br />
               have a very extended conversation and it was 
               <br />
               admitted by the Chairman, “Yes, we made the 
               <br />
               base deals, we had to save our lives and keep our 
               <br />
               ships from sinking. We never would have done it 
               <br />
               but for that.” In other words Lord Addison admits 
               <br />
               that these base deals would not have been made 
               <br />
               had it not been that they wanted to save their 
               <br />
               lives. We have no kick about the base deals as far 
               <br />
               as granting them to the United States at that time 
               <br />
               is concerned, but we do have a kick when Great 
               <br />
               Britain gives away our land for 99 years without 
               <br />
               any saving clause whatever. Go back to the 
               <br />
               Treaty of Versailles when most of our northern 
               <br />

               <br />
               when concessions regarding our lobster ﬁshery 
               <br />
               were given to USA,2 and come down to this war 
               <br />
               and you get another piece given away. Why, for 
               <br />
               70 years responsible government fought for that 
               <br />
               which Great Britain gave away freely and 
               <br />
               without concession.

               make anyone weep, I don’t know what is. Let me

               quote you section 3 of the Convention Act: “To

               <br />
               our memorandum: “Most of the items to which 
               <br />
               you refer have already been raised with the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom Government...” That is excel— 
               <br />
               lent news. I am proud of our Commission govern— 
               <br />
               ment to think that they raised all these points, 
               <br />
               probably before this Convention was ever 
               <br />
               thought of, according to that we have been berat- 
               <br />
               ing the Commission of Government just a little 
               <br />
               too much. All matters you gentlemen have raised 
               <br />
               here, they have been taking over to Lord Addison 
               <br />
               and the Dorninions Ofﬁce, and they have been 
               <br />
               pressing them very hard for concessions for this 
               <br />
               country. I ask you gentlemen to reconsider your 
               <br />
               views on Commission of Government. 1 am sure 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood will agree with me on that. He 
               <br />
               says: “I have throughout been as helpful as I can 
               <br />
               be. I do not however regard it as the function of 
               <br />
               this delegation to debate with me questions of the 
               <br />
               policy of the Newfoundland government in cur- 
               <br />
               rent administrative and other issues, or seek to 
               <br />
               negotiate trade arrangements between the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government and the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland.” Now I want you to study and 
               <br />
               read that again, and if you can show me any 
               <br />
               criticisms of the Commission of Government or 
               <br />
               the government of Great Britain, then there is 
               <br />
               something wrong with my eyesight. We did say 
               <br />
               we could not understand the attitude of the Com- 
               <br />
               mission on the matter of interest-free loans, but 
               <br />
               if that’s a criticism, I don’t know what criticism 
               <br />
               means. We could not understand their attitude. Is 
               <br />
               that criticism? No. We wanted an explanation of 
               <br />
               why a thing that would save the people $400,000 
               <br />
               could not be put into effect.
