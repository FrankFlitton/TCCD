               Mr. Cashin In connection with asking that a

               <br />
               many matters, I think it is time we stopped people 
               <br />
               coming telling us what we can do. We have two 
               <br />
               gentlemen, members of this Convention, one of 
               <br />

               <br />

               strangers to show us what we can ourselves do. 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt I think Major Cashin misunderstood 
               <br />
               the resolution. The motion is for a ‘statistician’ 
               <br />
               economist, not a ‘political’ economist. I doubt if 
               <br />
               there is a competent statistician-economist in this 
               <br />

               <br />

               manufacturer in the country and by cajolery got
