               how much that would affect us here in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Three of the provinces disclaimed the 
               <br />
               entire philosophy of the Dominion plan in that it 
               <br />
               would eventually destroy the autonomy of the 
               <br />
               provinces and hence the whole idea of federation. 
               <br />
               Many other objections were brought forward by 
               <br />
               individual provinces. All their objections gave an

               When later the per capita rate of grant was 
               <br />
               raised which brought the Prince Edward Island 
               <br />
               grant from the Dominion government up to $22 
               <br />
               per capita, Premier 1. Walter Jones of that 
               <br />
               province insisted that it would still leave the 
               <br />
               province $1 million short of what it would need. 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia said also that such a per capita grant 
               <br />
               would be far from sufficient. Premier Drew 
               <br />
               stated that its acceptance by the Province of On- 
               <br />
               tario would result in a $15 million deﬁcit per 
               <br />
               year. Premier Duplessis compared the small sum 
               <br />
               which Quebec would receive with the large sums 
               <br />
               collected out of the province by Dominion taxa- 
               <br />
               tion in recent years. Douglas of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               stated that a subsidy based on population was 
               <br />
               unscientiﬁc and that there was no relationship 
               <br />
               between population and needs — and so it was 
               <br />
               with all the provinces. Said Ontario’s premier,

               It was evident to the Dominion government that

               their proposals would not be acceptable, and so

               want you to know that under this tax agreement 
               <br />
               the subsidy which we shall get depends on two 
               <br />
               variable things. It depends on increase in popula— 
               <br />
               tion, and it depends on the gross national product 
               <br />
               of Canada —— two variables, and 1 shall point out 
               <br />
               to you laterjust how they did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vary.</span> Under this 
               <br />
               proposal PEI was to receive $2 million in l947, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia $l0 million and New Brunswick 
               <br />
               $7.5 million. The Dominion government was 
               <br />
               also prepared to allow the provinces to make tax 
               <br />
               levies on mining and logging <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">operations.</span> Further, 
               <br />
               the Dominion government was prepared to seek 
               <br />
               an amendment to the constitution so as to enable 
               <br />
               the provinces to levy an indirect tax on retail 
               <br />
               sales. It also would allow the provinces to tax 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">property.</span> They also were prepared to pay part of 
               <br />
               the burden of health services, to the extent of 40 
               <br />
               cents per head of population. Assuming that we 
               <br />
               were a province that would amount to about 
               <br />
               $l20,000. When we remember that our health 
               <br />
               estimates for this year are approximately $6 mil- 
               <br />
               lion we can see how insignificant such help 
               <br />
               would be to us. They would take care of old age 
               <br />
               pensions and grant some unemployment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assis</span> 
               <br />
               tance. Altogether this was a much better offer, but 
               <br />
               still the provincial premiers decided they could 
               <br />
               not agree. Nor did they agree. 
               <br />
               The Premier of Ontario claimed that in 1945 
               <br />
