               <br />
               I do not intend to introduce it with a long talk, 
               <br />
               because after it has been read it will be only a 
               <br />
               matter of duplication. I would like to point out 
               <br />
               that, with respect to local industries, pulp and 
               <br />
               paper, mining, ﬁsheries and forestry have their 
               <br />
               own committees, so consequently we could not 
               <br />
               touch on those and had to conﬁne ourselves to the 
               <br />
               smaller or secondary industries. We did not have 
               <br />
               any statistics or sources of information whatever. 
               <br />
               We tried several channels but could not get any- 
               <br />
               thing on which to base our report. That presented 
               <br />
               quite a difﬁculty with the result that the report is 
               <br />
               not as complete as if there had been a statistical 
               <br />
               department of the government which had kept 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures over a number of years, and which 
               <br />
               could have given us comparative ﬁgures. This is 
               <br />
               a disappointment to the Committee, and perhaps 
               <br />
               to you too. The Committee worked very hard, and 
               <br />
               everything possible was done. You will see now 
               <br />
               that we have had a job in collecting a lot of that.

               protective tariffs, and that is why I asked Mr.

               Hickman why these three things were put 
               <br />
               together. You will probably remember 22 years 
               <br />
               ago I made my House of Assembly debut on 
               <br />
               protective tariffs, and one of these industries was 
               <br />
               tobacco. That’s one particular fault I ﬁnd with 
               <br />
               this report; it does not show the protective tariff 
               <br />
               these industries have. I agree in principle they

               <br />
               bringing my mind back 20 years, and at that time 
               <br />
               they had watered their stock several times. That 
               <br />
               means that if they put in $100 and they were 
               <br />
               getting 15% on it, then the next year, if they 
               <br />
               watered it and made those shares worth $200, that 
               <br />
               would mean that they were getting 30% on their

               pay a 20% dividend on their common stock, they 
               <br />
               would “water” that and give two shares for one. 
               <br />
               I am not particularly opposed to protective tariffs, 
               <br />
               but this company has $550,000 a year in protec- 
               <br />
               tive tariffs, and I think the people of this country 
               <br />
               should know, and also the members of this Con— 
               <br />
               vention. What is the use of this Convention if we 
               <br />
               can’t get these facts? Here we have it borne out 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—«</span> three companies gang up and say, “We won’t 
               <br />
               give the facts". I did not intend to speak on this, 
               <br />
               but I saw here that they had 218 employees 
               <br />
               between the three of them, and they pay $400,000 
               <br />
               wages that is about $1,700 on average. Now some 
               <br />
               of our other industries that belong to New- 
               <br />
               foundland and have protection, pay much more 
               <br />
               on an average than these people do to their 
               <br />
               employees. They are also paying 45% dividends 
               <br />
               on their stock. This is fact and it should be known. 
               <br />
               The protection has been increased by the Com- 
               <br />
               mission government. I am sorry that we have not 
               <br />
               got a copy of the tari ff here, so that we could work 
               <br />
               it out. I think I gave some statistics to some
