               <br />
               shape of things to come in this 20th century. In

               to think of providing the public services to in 
               <br />

               Labrador by Newfoundlanders for the Avalon 
               <br />
               Peninsula. Then it must be remembered that the 
               <br />
               mid-19th century was a nice, cozy time in which 
               <br />
               to be alive. Every day in every way, things were 
               <br />
               getting better and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better.</span> Mankind was going to 
               <br />
               move right straight ahead to the conquest of the 
               <br />
               universe. The spirit of laissez-faire was a 
               <br />
               broadened world. Economic liberalism was the 
               <br />
               order of the political day. The best government 
               <br />
               was the government that governed least. The role 
               <br />
               of government and the economy was consciously 
               <br />
               kept down to the minimum. God was in his

               heaven, all was going to be all right with the 
               <br />
               world. The British nation would see to that. And 
               <br />
               so in the brave new world of 1855 responsible 
               <br />
               government looked like a safe enough bet, even 
               <br />
               if there was only half a million dollars to pull and 
               <br />
               haul on.

               For over 60 years, from 1855 to 1919, we 
               <br />
               managed to make both ends meet. True, we had 
               <br />
               often to scrape the bottom of the barrel to do so. 
               <br />
               In the years when there was a margin to the good, 
               <br />
               it was meager; and once or twice the budget went 
               <br />
               into deﬁcit. But by and large for 60-odd years we 
               <br />
               managed to keep our heads above water. In the 
               <br />
               economic sphere, however, almost every time the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery failed, a lot of people nearly starved to 
               <br />
               death. Dole was not something unheard of until 
               <br />
               the days of Commission. Substantial expenditure 
               <br />
               on relief of the able-bodied poor had to be in-

               <br />
               responsible government. And the first eight years 
               <br />
               of the 1860s were among the grimmest of our 
               <br />
               history. Once indeed, even in the financial 
               <br />
               sphere, it was touch and go, during the bank crash 
               <br />
               of 1894. Involved in the crisis was the Union

               suddenly found itself with a first magnitude 
               <br />

               <br />
               foundland government went to Britain with its 
               <br />
               hat in its hands. But Britain wanted to set up a 
               <br />
               royal commission of inquiry as a condition of a 
               <br />

               <br />
               wouldn‘t have that. And so it turned around and 
               <br />
               went to Canada with its hat in its hands. But 
               <br />
               Canada wouldn’t bid high enough. Canada 
               <br />
               pinched the pennies and lost the tenth province.

               Bond ﬁnally negotiated the long-term loan in

               <br />

               <br />
               upon it ~— the role of chasing around with its hat 
               <br />
               in its hands in a frantic effort to borrow enough 
               <br />
               to carry on We were to see the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government in that role again, practically all 
               <br />
               during the period from 1920 to 1933, the period 
               <br />
               when we didn’t manage to make both ends meet. 
               <br />
               During those 13 years we incurred 11 budget 
               <br />
               deﬁcits, and borrowed $57 million. In other 
               <br />
               words, we went behind at an average rate of $4.8 
               <br />
               million per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> And so we came at last to the 
               <br />
               end of our ﬁnancial tether and passed into the 
               <br />
               hands of a glorified receivership. Even the 
               <br />
               receivership couldn’t do anything to achieve 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial stability, and budget deﬁcits continued
