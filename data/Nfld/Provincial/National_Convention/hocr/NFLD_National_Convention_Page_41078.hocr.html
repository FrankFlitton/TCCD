               surplus for current expenditure, which apparently 
               <br />
               is the intention of some of the members of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Where then will they get the $2.5 million? 1 have 
               <br />
               hinted where you are going to get it, and where

               Let us take a look at the estimates of an 
               <br />
               expenditure of $14.5 million. Take a look at their 
               <br />
               proposed expenditure for Education. The es- 
               <br />
               timates for Education this year in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               are $3,622,300. Now what has the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation done? Mind you, I suppose the people 
               <br />
               in Canada believe that they acted in good faith 
               <br />
               when they took this ﬁgure. What have they done? 
               <br />
               They have lopped off $5 14,000, and reduced the 
               <br />
               estimate to $3,107,700. Again it has been stated 
               <br />
               that the surplus will take care of the construction 
               <br />
               of these ﬁgures and education. In other words, 
               <br />
               they say, “We won’t build these new schools, we 
               <br />
               shall stop all new reconstruction on account of 
               <br />
               education.” Let education remain stagnant for the 
               <br />
               next three years, and indeed for the next 12 years 
               <br />
               if need be. Our whole education plans for the 
               <br />
               future are out. After all, are not our teachers 
               <br />
               already receiving much more than they are in 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island? Gentlemen, as you know, 
               <br />
               our educational authorities were budgeting for $4 
               <br />
               million next year in order to bring our teacher 
               <br />
               salary scale on a par with that in Nova Scotia. So 
               <br />
               if we are honest as to the needs of the education 
               <br />
               of our children, rather than take off $514,000 we 
               <br />
               must add on; and I submit a further $900,000 
               <br />
               must be added to the $3.1 million suggested by 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation, and no doubt accepted in 
               <br />
               good faith by the Canadians to whom they talked.

               Now take a look at what they have estimated

               put it to you, gentlemen, that is not generally done

               in the provinces of Canada today. but let us 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that $514,000, and we still have left $801,400 to

               take care of the most necessary reconstruction.

               passing I ask you to note that they have cut out 
               <br />
               $4 million of reconstruction, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3.5</span> million of 
               <br />
               which consists of the construction of roads, 
               <br />
               bridges and buildings These things are our 
               <br />
               responsibility as a province. Must we, for this 
               <br />
               union with Canada, forego all hopes of further 
               <br />
               extending our roads? 1 have pointed out the posi— 
               <br />
               tion of the surplus. I wonder how many people in 
               <br />
               this country today earn good money on road 
               <br />
               building and repairing? That would have to stop. 
               <br />
               Our confederate friends will deny them that. Ifit 
               <br />
               is right to build roads and bridges at this stage in 
               <br />
               our history to open up our country, then it is 
               <br />
               wrong for us, as individuals sent in here by our 
               <br />
               people, to consider these matters. It is wrong for 
               <br />
               us even to think of confederation at this time, for 
               <br />
               we shall not be able to get the money to do this 
               <br />
               work, to build the roads and other things. 
               <br />
