               govemment’s revenue for them. They’re agents 
               <br />
               for the government, collecting the govemment’s 
               <br />
               revenue... That’s indirect taxation. That’s cus— 
               <br />
               toms duties. That’s how the system works, and 
               <br />
               that’s one of the biggest reasons why the people 
               <br />
               of this country are suffering the way they are 
               <br />
               today from the high cost of living, and always did. 
               <br />
               You can take note of this fact, Mr. Chairman, the 
               <br />
               higher the prices go in the countries we buy the 
               <br />
               goods from, the worse this position becomes. I 
               <br />
               told you what happens when the article costs 
               <br />
               $100 abroad, and the profit is made on the duty, 
               <br />
               but if the price goes way up, say to $150 in the 
               <br />
               States or Canada, then the duty is no longer $20 
               <br />
               but $30, and the proﬁts made on the duty are no 
               <br />
               longer what they were in the ﬁrst case, but that 
               <br />
               much higher, half as high again. The higher the 
               <br />
               prices in the countries we import from, the more 
               <br />
               duties we pay, and the more proﬁts we pay on the 
               <br />
               duties, and so it goes until the ordinary man can’t 
               <br />
               live at all. His dollar shrinks and shrinks and 
               <br />
               shrinks. It’ll buy less and less all the time. And 
               <br />
               who feels it worst of all? The poorest of the poor. 
               <br />
               Not the family that can afford two or three motor 
               <br />
               cars, or a couple of trips away every year, or life 
               <br />
               insurance policies running up to a $100,000, or 
               <br />
               even $2—300,000, not the family that can send its 
               <br />
               children to school in Canada, England or the 
               <br />
               States, certainly not the family that can afford to 
               <br />
               spend $4-5,000 a year just on ordinary household 
               <br />
               expenses, because to such a family another few 
               <br />
               hundreds or even another thousand a year won’t 
               <br />
               make or break them. No, it’s the family that has 
               <br />
               to watch every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent.</span> The family that has to stretch 
               <br />
               the last penny, that has to go without and never 
               <br />
               knows anything year in and year out but penny~ 
               <br />
               pinching economy. They’re the people who feel 
               <br />
               the pinch where it hurts most — in their 
               <br />
               children’s stomachs and on their children’s 
               <br />
               backs. The great majority of our population, 
               <br />
               those tens of thousands of our people who ache 
               <br />
               and yearn for a square deal and don’ t know where 
               <br />
               to turn for it, those are the people who will be 
               <br />
               helped by confederation. Oh yes, confederation 
               <br />
               will tax them too. But not in the same way ——- not 
               <br />
               so heavily, not so harshly and above all not so 
               <br />
               unjustly.

               Mr. Chairman, this is the ﬁfth week since this 
               <br />
               debate began, and for all of that time we‘ve been 
               <br />
               discussing and debating the details of these con- 
               <br />
               federation terms. I am afraid that more than once 
               <br />

               we haven’t been able to see the forest for trees. 
               <br />
               We’ve wrangled and disputed so much over the 
               <br />
               details that we’ve failed altogether to give the 
               <br />
               people an intelligent picture of the whole thing in 
               <br />
               the round. It would be useful therefore, if before 
               <br />
               this debate closes, I should try to give a general 
               <br />
               picture of confederation as these terms describe 
               <br />
               it. The ﬁrst fact is that confederation means that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would join the family of 
               <br />
               Canadian provinces. Where there are nine 
               <br />
               provinces now, there would be ten if we joined 
               <br />
               up. Newfoundland would have all the rights, 
               <br />
               powers, privileges and responsibilities of a 
               <br />
               province of Canada. We’d no longer be on our 
               <br />
               own -— no longer would we be trying to paddle 
               <br />
               our own canoe, trying to get along by our own 
               <br />
               unaided efforts. We’d be part of the family of 
               <br />
               Canadian provinces The second fact is that the 
               <br />
               Province of Newfoundland would consist of 
               <br />
               152,000 square miles, 42,000 square miles in the 
               <br />
               island of Newfoundland and 110,000 square 
               <br />
               miles in our territory of Labrador. Labrador as 
               <br />
               deﬁned by the award of the Privy Council in 1927 
               <br />
               would be part and parcel of the Province of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and the boundaries separating 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NewfoundlandLabrador</span> from Quebec-Labrador 
               <br />
               could never be changed except with the full free 
               <br />
               consent of Newfoundland. The third fact is that 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada would take over our 
               <br />
               entire external public debt — the debt of $60-odd 
               <br />
               million we owe in Great Britain. Canada would 
               <br />
               relieve us of this debt and would pay the yearly 
               <br />
               interest on it, and would pay it off when it fell 
               <br />
               due. Newfoundland would be left with a public 
               <br />
               debt of around $6 million, which amount we 
               <br />
               really owe to ourselves. That is, it’s an internal 
               <br />
               debt borrowed by our government from people 
               <br />
               here in Newfoundland. The interest on it would 
               <br />
               go to the people in Newfoundland. 
               <br />

               The Government of Canada would take over
