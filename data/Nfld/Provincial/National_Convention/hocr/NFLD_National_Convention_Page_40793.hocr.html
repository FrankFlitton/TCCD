               The Comrrtission of Government have 
               <br />
               given consideration to this request. Section 3 
               <br />
               of the act sets forth the duty and function of 
               <br />
               the Convention, and empowers the making 
               <br />
               of recommendations to His Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government in the United Kingdom as to 
               <br />
               possible forms of future government to be put

               as to the forms of government to be put

               government that, as in the case of committees 
               <br />

               <br />
               having power to make decisions, members of

               the Convention who hold a minority view on

               their recommendations go forward from the 
               <br />
               Convention. It is therefore difﬁcult to see
