               Mr. Smalle Mr. Chairman, we adjourned

               on Thursday last with the thought that today we

               <br />
               Newfoundland, should we become a province of 
               <br />
               Canada. It was understood that I would bring in 
               <br />
               today some ﬁgures and statistics that might indi- 
               <br />

               tures of the provincial government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. On the revenue side I have not, as yet, 
               <br />
               had the figures mimeographed. I have them here 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion of the revenue side they will be 
               <br />
               mimeographed and placed on the desks of the 
               <br />
               members. I ought to make one or two points clear 
               <br />
               before we come to an examination of the expen— 
               <br />
               diture table. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The first point is this: that confederation does 
               <br />
               not mean that Canada would take Newfoundland 
               <br />
               over and run it, because Canada is a federal union 
               <br />
               of nine provinces - Newfoundland would make 
               <br />
               the tenth. A federal union, wherever it does exist 
               <br />
               in this world, means only a sharing or dividing of 
               <br />
               responsibilities and powers; so that confedera— 
               <br />
               tion would mean that the powers which our 
               <br />
               government now has would be divided. We 
               <br />

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_16" title="bbox 950 789 1494 1817">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               would have some powers, and the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada would have some, and the respon- 
               <br />
               sibilities and burdens our government now has 
               <br />
               would be divided. Our government would carry 
               <br />
               some of the burdens and the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada would carry some. Now, confederation 
               <br />
               may or may not be a good thing for this country. 
               <br />
               One thing, however, is fairly clear, that if there 
               <br />
               are advantages from confederation for the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, confederation is still not a 
               <br />
               good thing if the government of the Province of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is not able to pay its way. Or put 
               <br />
               it this way: we might get many advantages from 
               <br />
               confederation. These advantages might be con- 
               <br />
               siderable, but they will all fall by the way if the 
               <br />
               government of the province is not able to collect 
               <br />
               enough revenue to pay the cost of those things 
               <br />
               which the government of the province would still 
               <br />
               have to do, even with confederation. Not only 
               <br />
               that, the government of the province must be able 
               <br />
               to pay its way without imposing too great a 
               <br />
               burden of taxation on the people; without costing 
               <br />
               the people too much in taxes; and again without 
               <br />
               stinting on those public services, which the 
               <br />
               government of the province would have to 
               <br />
               carry... The government of the province would 
               <br />
               still have its public services to render to the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland. Confederation, there- 
               <br />
               fore, to be of real benefit, must not only give the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland certain advantages and 
               <br />
