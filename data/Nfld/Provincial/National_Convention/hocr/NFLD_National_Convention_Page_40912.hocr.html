               <br />
               Mr. Harrington <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,,..Mr.</span> Higgins has quoted 
               <br />
               from some documents, the greater part of which 
               <br />
               we have before us; some sections we did not 
               <br />
               have. Apparently, as far as I can make out, these 
               <br />
               sections are in the possession of other members 
               <br />
               of the delegation. If that is the case in connection 
               <br />
               with the Railway, have members other sections? 
               <br />
               Ithink that is a fairly serious matter. We had quite 
               <br />
               a fuss a while ago about another delegation that 
               <br />
               went to London; some members were in posses- 
               <br />
               sion of certain information, others were not, and 
               <br />
               it was agreed that it be produced. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If you send a delegation 
               <br />
               anywhere and they bring back any information, 
               <br />
               surely it belongs to members. if there are excerpts 
               <br />
               which should be in these Black Books for our 
               <br />
               beneﬁt and for the beneﬁt of the country, I think 
               <br />
               we should have them all. There may be in exist- 
               <br />
               ence some supplementary documents orinforma- 
               <br />
               tion not generally in possession of members. If 
               <br />
               that is so, we would like to get it for members. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The position is this: there was 
               <br />
               a committee of the Ottawa delegation appointed 
               <br />
               to meet with a committee from the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada to discuss the question of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Railway, with a view to ﬁnding out 
               <br />
               what problems would be brought up if the railway 
               <br />
               system were to be taken over by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government. That Canadian committee consisted 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Transport, Mr. Chevrier; 
               <br />
               Deputy Minister of Transport, Commander Ed— 
               <br />
               wards; the Vice—President of the Canadian Na- 
               <br />
               tional Railways, the President of the Clarke 
               <br />
               Steamship Company and other officials. We 
               <br />
               handed over to them what information we had 
               <br />
               about the Railway. They asked for still more and 
               <br />
               we sent back to Newfoundland and got that infor— 
               <br />
               mation. With all the information we had given 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman I am not interested as to what the

               delegations; what I am interested in dealing with 
               <br />
               is the point raised by the member for St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">John’s</span> 
               <br />
               West, Mr. Harrington, in which he expresses the 
               <br />
               fear that because we have already discovered in 
               <br />
               the possession of one or more members some 
               <br />
               information which has not been generally made 
               <br />
               available, there may be other such information, 
               <br />
               and he raised the question, quite properly, 
               <br />
               whether such information is to be made available 
               <br />
               to members. The point I would like you to address 
               <br />
               yourself to is whether there is in the possession 
               <br />
               of that Ottawa delegation information in any 
               <br />
               form which has not been made available. If so, 
               <br />
               have you any objection to this information being 
               <br />
               made available to members, and if so. why so? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It is exactly on that point that I 
               <br />
               am addressing you. I do not know any other way

               Railway and steamship experts having been 
               <br />
               given what information we could give them, then 
               <br />
               made on their own a study of our railway and 
               <br />
               steamship system, insofar as they could make a 
               <br />
               study on the information they had. There was not

               the time to come to Newfoundland and make a 
               <br />
               study of the Railway on the spot. They took the 
               <br />
               data and information that we gave them, and on 
               <br />
               that information they wrote a report on our rail-
