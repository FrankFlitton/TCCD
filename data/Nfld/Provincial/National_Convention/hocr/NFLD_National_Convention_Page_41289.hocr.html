               <br />
               on in Halifax. The government had a seat there 
               <br />
               that they had to win. We couldn’t make very 
               <br />
               much progress until that election was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decided.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, what I’m doing now is trying to 
               <br />
               show you why I’m anticonfederate. Then the next 
               <br />
               thing turns up is the Dominion-provincial tax 
               <br />
               agreement down in Nova Scotia that has to be 
               <br />
               signed That comes up the 20th of August, I 
               <br />
               believe - couldn‘t release any terms up to that 
               <br />
               time. Nova Scotia had to sign those tax agree- 
               <br />
               ments. And then we were making progress, but 
               <br />
               unfortunately the Minister of Fisheries, the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bridges died. That created a by-election 
               <br />
               down in New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick.</span> We couldn’t come 
               <br />
               home then, because if they’d released those 
               <br />
               generous terms, the opposition in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick would play on them. Finally, up 
               <br />
               comes this message. It came before the plenary 
               <br />
               session, and I’d say they were a little bit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tor.</span> 
               <br />
               mented. They thought the best thing they could 
               <br />
               do was get the Black Books ready —— give us the 
               <br />
               Black Books, and after the election in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick they’d send us down what now has 
               <br />
               been termed the Grey Book. Now as a member 
               <br />
               of that delegation, I thought that there was too 
               <br />
               much politics in the whole game. I went there 
               <br />
               with an open mind. I went there to get hard facts, 
               <br />
               and I am of that nature that I’ve got to be con- 
               <br />
               vinced before I really agree. And I’ve been 
               <br />
               charged with being cantankerous. You can call it 
               <br />
               that if you will. But there’s the position. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now then, I notice in that Grey Book that there 
               <br />
               is no mention whatever of the matter of divorce. 
               <br />
               Why? Take up your Black Book and it says that 
               <br />
               the whole matter is a matter for the province. 
               <br />
               How many provinces in Canada have no divorce 
               <br />
               laws? ....In Quebec there are no divorce laws — 
               <br />
               look what happened. Parties have to go before the 
               <br />
               Senate. They have to have all the evidence 
               <br />
               without belabouring the question. The position 
               <br />
               now is there’s a movement afoot that it will not 
               <br />
               be necessary to go to Ottawa, that the evidence 
               <br />
               will be taken in the courts of Quebec. If you have 
               <br />
               all the provinces except Quebec with divorce 
               <br />
               laws, if you go in as a tenth province, what chance 
               <br />
               have you got in Newfoundland for being driven 
               <br />
               into divorce? Look at it in the common sense 
               <br />
               way. I would like to say that overtures were made 
               <br />
               in Ottawa so that it would be possible to have 
               <br />
               some clause in that Grey Book regarding divorce. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I’m inclined to think too that there were some 
               <br />
               overtures made here in Newfoundland since we 
               <br />
               came back along the same lines, but nothing 
               <br />
               became of it and you have no reference whatever. 
               <br />
               Same thing applies to education. Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood said last night that I was an ex—school- 
               <br />
               teacher. In the old days, when I was a 
               <br />
               schoolteacher, in the early days of high school 
               <br />
               teaching, I was public school minded I’ve had 
               <br />
               some experience in Canada and in the United 
               <br />
               States regarding education. I followed the whole 
               <br />
               situation and I completely changed my mind, and 
               <br />
               decided that the best form of education for New- 
               <br />
               foundland, as the settlements are divided, is the 
               <br />
               system that you have. Again, they tell you in the 
               <br />
               Black Book that education is a matter for the 
               <br />
               provinces. How many provinces in Canada have 
               <br />
               denominational schools? Can‘t you see that if 
               <br />
               you go into confederation, there is always a pos- 
               <br />
               sibility that your educational system will be 
               <br />
               upset? It‘s one of the reasons why I’m not 
               <br />
               prepared to take the chance. I don’t know, sir, 
               <br />
               whether the time limit is up or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not....</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Take your time. 
               <br />
               Mr. Crummey Mr. Crosbie mentioned it this 
               <br />
               afternoon, he talked about the Fishery Board in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I know of a certainty that the 
               <br />
               Fishery Board under confederation has got to go 
               <br />
               out of existence, irrespective of the opinion of 
               <br />
               any other of the members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation.</span> They 
               <br />
               searched around everywhere in the statutes, laws 
               <br />
               of Canada and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">couldn’t</span> ﬁnd any place where 
               <br />
               they could allow Newfoundland to keep that 
               <br />
               Board in existence. You can look in the Black 
               <br />
               Book and you‘ll ﬁnd very nice phraseology 
               <br />
               covering up the situation. The next one and I’ll 
               <br />
               soon be ﬁnished. That is the deficit that’s going 
               <br />
               to be created by going into confederation. 
               <br />
               There’s deﬁnitely going to be a deﬁcit on the 
               <br />
               terms in that Grey Book. It was pointed out to the 
               <br />
               Canadians and asked how we were going to get 
               <br />
               around that situation. Put on more taxation or 
               <br />
               take your surplus, and in the Grey Book they’ve 
               <br />
               made provision by taking one third of your 
               <br />
               surplus to cover up any deﬁcits that you’ll incur. 
               <br />
               I could go on a bit longer, but I don’t feel like 
               <br />
               keeping people here any longer. What I’m trying 
               <br />
               to say is that I am opposed to confederation on 
               <br />
               the terms presented in that Grey Book. I am not 
               <br />
               against going into confederation if the terms suit 
               <br />
               me, being a Newfoundlander ﬁrst.
