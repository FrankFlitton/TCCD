               Committee is thinking of boats from 20 tons up. 
               <br />
               I think you will ﬁnd that it is $70 per ton from 12 
               <br />
               to 25 tons, and there is not any bounty on the

               engines if they are gasoline; they must be full

               answer to a lot of the country’s taxes being spent 
               <br />
