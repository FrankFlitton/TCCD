               have no doubt that Quebec wants it. As a matter

               of fact. the French Canadian people are living

               imagine that Mr. Duplessis or his successor will

               Labrador in the course of 20 or 25 years. And 
               <br />
               when this happens there is no need to upset the 
               <br />
               Privy Council decision; no need for Mr. 
               <br />

               <br />

               miles from the Quebec border? The population of 
               <br />
               Quebec now is something over four million, and 
               <br />
               is increasing at the highest rate. One does not

               A lovely picture has been painted with respect 
               <br />
               to all the money that Canada is going to pour into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to develop our resources once we 
               <br />
               become a province. I agree that what we want in 
               <br />
               this country is more employment and more in- 
               <br />
               dustry, rather then more baby bonuses. A country 
               <br />
               will never become prosperous by getting its in- 
               <br />
               come from this sort of a thing. In a sense it is like 
               <br />
               dole. It gives relief, but the kind of industry it 
               <br />
               encourages is not the kind best calculated to put 
               <br />
               us on the road to prosperity. It is a matter of record 
               <br />
               that all the premiums and earnings of our $100 
               <br />
               million in life insurance are in Canadian com- 
               <br />
               panies. Also there is an additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4060</span> million 
               <br />
               of our savings on deposit with the Canadian 
               <br />
               banks and trustcompanies in Newfoundland. The 
               <br />
               total of these monies, I suppose, is not less then 
               <br />
               $50-60 million. And so it has been for years, that 
               <br />
               the bulk of our people’s accumulated savings is 
               <br />
               in the hands of Canadian banks, trust companies 
               <br />
               and insurance companies. What have these 
               <br />
               Canadian financial institutions done with these 
               <br />
               monies, and what industries have they started and 
               <br />
               developed in Newfoundland with these monies?
