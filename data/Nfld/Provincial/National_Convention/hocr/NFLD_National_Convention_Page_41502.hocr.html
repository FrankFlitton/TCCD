               back to us? I believe the answer is “yes" to all

               these questions, and it is with that belief that I 
               <br />
               must support this motion to put confederation 
               <br />
               before the people. 
               <br />
               Mr. Roberts Mr. Chairman, I wish to state that 
               <br />
               I will vote for the motion before the Chair. I feel 
               <br />
               in duty bound to do so, in View of the fact that 
               <br />
               many thousands of Newfoundlanders wish to 
               <br />
               vote for confederation. I wish also to state I hold 
               <br />
               no brief for the people of St. Barbe district, which 
               <br />
               I represent, as to how they will vote. They will do 
               <br />
               as they please. I have only one vote, and will do 
               <br />
               as I please with it. But I would like to tell all 
               <br />
               anticonfederates that if confederation does not go 
               <br />
               on the ballot paper, the people of the northwest 
               <br />
               coast will vote overwhelmingly for Commission 
               <br />
               of Government. The mention of responsible 
               <br />
               government stinks with them. After neglect by all 
               <br />
               responsible governments, and despite all the sen- 
               <br />
               timental poppycock that some of our so—called 
               <br />
               patriotic Newfoundlanders have been getting off 
               <br />
               their chests here the past few days, and despite all 
               <br />
               the taxations they have been hearing about, they 
               <br />
               know what to expect from responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment and they are willing to take a chance on 
               <br />
               confederation. You don't have to take my word 
               <br />
               for it, let any man who wishes to ﬁnd out take a 
               <br />
               trip down that coast and talk about the glories of 
               <br />
               responsible government; butI wam him to have 
               <br />
               a plane standing by so as to make a quick 
               <br />
               getaway, especially if he should tell them they 
               <br />
               were disloyal or unpatriotic.

               <br />
               done by Canadian ﬁshermen who left the much

               abused, tax-ridden Maritime Provinces; thinking

               they were given a raw deal by their governments,

               they settled on our coasts. But within five years,

               after receiving a taste of our taxation and our low

               standard of living and backward facilities, they 
               <br />
               were glad enough to leave it, every one of them, 
               <br />
               and go back where they came from, taking with 
               <br />
               them scores of our northwest coast people, none 
               <br />

               <br />

               Dozens of my relatives and friends, after vain-

               ly trying to make a living, have gathered together 
               <br />
               a bit of money with the help of their relatives 
               <br />
               abroad and travelled to Canada. Ask these people 
               <br />
               if they wish to come back to the living conditions 
               <br />
               they left, and they would surely think it quite a 
               <br />
               joke. My own mother, widowed in the early years 
               <br />
               of her marriage, left with three small children and 
               <br />
               little means of support, struggled for three or four 
               <br />
               years to keep her family together and maintain 
               <br />
               them; she had to give it up, give away her 
               <br />
               children, and on the advice of a relative in Canada 
               <br />
               went there and made a comfortable living. So I 
               <br />
               have a warm spot in my heart for the country 
               <br />
               which befriended my mother, above all other 
               <br />
               people on this earth.

               ridiculed subjects, namely family allowances and 
               <br />
               old age pensions. I have in mind a family not far

               struggle that man is having to make a living. I 
               <br />
               wonder would he scoff at a family allowance of 
               <br />
               $60 a month, would he worry about the dozens
