               1 must apologise to you for bringing in the 
               <br />
               history of my own family, but I did it for this 
               <br />
               reason. Each year Confederation Life puts out a 
               <br />
               calendar they give to the public, a picture of how 
               <br />
               our great sister dominion was colonised. You see 
               <br />
               that great statesman Lord Halifax, with his ex— 
               <br />
               soldier settlers, backed by British cash, planning 
               <br />
               and building the city of Halifax. Another gives 
               <br />
               the settlers wading ashore at Pictou to the skirl of 
               <br />
               the pipers, a complete unit in itself. Go north to 
               <br />
               Cape Breton Island, and at Soldier’s Cove and 
               <br />
               vicinity you’ll ﬁnd where Wellington’s veterans, 
               <br />
               some who stood in the squares at Waterloo, 
               <br />
               carved out new homes. Go to south Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               there you’ll ﬁnd the Hessians, veterans of the 
               <br />
               American war. All those were settled with British 
               <br />
               cash, British organisation, and last of all with 
               <br />
               British blessing and care while they were getting 
               <br />
               on their feet. Compare that with the way our 
               <br />
               forebears settled here, not with the help of their 
               <br />
               government, but against the dictates of it. My 
               <br />
               people were here about 80 years before it was 
               <br />
               legal to build a chimney in a house. We could 
               <br />
               forget this persecution in the past, but it is carried 
               <br />
               on today. We must still take the nod and it makes 
               <br />
               no odds what government is in power, whether 
               <br />
               Tory, Liberal or Labour. We are not grown up 
               <br />
               and must be babied, must go the way they think 
               <br />
               we should go. Are those people mad? I can tell 
               <br />
               them they are playing with dynamite. Take this 
               <br />
               Convention, hardly one of us knew the other until 
               <br />
               we met here, and today although two-thirds of us 
               <br />
               are of the opinion that the agreement between the 
               <br />
               British Parliament of 1933 and the New- 
               <br />
               foundland parliament of that date should be car- 
               <br />
               ried out, what do we ﬁnd? Dictatorial terms of 
               <br />
               reference passed not by Newfoundland’s elected 
               <br />
               representatives, no, but by remote control, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some.</span> 
               <br />
               thing that won’t allow us to even mention the 
               <br />
               agreement of 1933. It’s ultra vires, beyond the 
               <br />
               scope. To boil it down, it’s this. The ballyhoo 
               <br />
               about Newfoundland’s effort in the two wars, her 
               <br />
               2,000 dead — they did not die in defence of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland democracy. They died for the 
               <br />
               Czechs, the Poles, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Belgians.</span> You have no 
               <br />
               right to mention that agreement should be carried 
               <br />
               out. It’s ultra virer, beyond the scope of the death 
               <br />
               in action of 2,000 Newfoundlanders and the prob— 
               <br />

               <br />

               government that should never have been 
               <br />
               tampered with. We hope that those countries, 
               <br />
               Britain and the United States, who signed the 
               <br />
               Atlantic Charter, will take cognisance of this, our 
               <br />

               <br />
               only representatives for the past 14 years, and 
               <br />
               grant that dominion status be given as quickly as 
               <br />
               possible, and allow us to put before the people 
               <br />
               whatever type of government they believe in, in 
               <br />
               a legal manner. Only this will give us back the 
               <br />
               confidence that we have lost in the mother 
               <br />
               country. Only then will we believe an English- 
               <br />
               man's word is his bond. This has been shown in 
               <br />
               the manner we have been treated and I, for one, 
               <br />
               regardless of what my fellow delegates think, 
               <br />
               believe both the country and the people have not 
               <br />
               been given a square deal. Politically in life I’ve 
               <br />
               carried my end of the plank, in govemmentl want 
               <br />
               nobody to carry my end of the plank. It’s my

               God-given right, the right man has struggled for 
               <br />
               a thousand years. Let Britain wipe the slate clean

               of this wrong she has done her eldest daughter 
               <br />
               and prove she is not playing power politics and 
               <br />

               With regard to this form of government that 
               <br />
               fate seems to have foisted on us, I can only quote 
               <br />
               one of our politicians when he said that a certain 
               <br />
               district left a bad taste in his mouth. This form of 
               <br />
               Commission government has always left a bad 
               <br />
               taste in my mouth. If it was the best form of 
               <br />
               government in the world I would say that, and it’s 
               <br />
               not that. I cannot think how anybody with a drop 
               <br />
               of blood in their veins could say anything else. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst time I contacted Commission of Govem- 
               <br />
               merit it was a puzzle to me —— that was in 1936, 
               <br />
               and in 1948 it still remains the $64 question —— 
               <br />
               how it operates. I would like to meet the Rip Van 
               <br />
               Winkle who ﬁrst worked out the plan, for I’m 
               <br />
               sure that only somebody who has been asleep for
