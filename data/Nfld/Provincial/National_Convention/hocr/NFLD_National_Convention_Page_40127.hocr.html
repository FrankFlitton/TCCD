               over to Newfoundland. But, Mr. Chairman, I am 
               <br />
               not going to sit down here and be a party to what 
               <br />
               I feel in my soul is a policy to sell out this country 
               <br />
               to Canada. I lived in Canada longer than any man 
               <br />
               in this House, and I like Canada, but I love 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I know what happened in the 
               <br />
               Canadian provinces, in the eastern provinces. I 
               <br />
               have also lived in British Columbia. I heard 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood here yesterday state that our 
               <br />
               people were 50 years behind the times. I think our 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Brown brought him up on that. I have 
               <br />
               been on Queen Charlotte Islands, and I would 
               <br />
               like to bring Mr. Smallwood there and show him 
               <br />
               conditions, and also to the city of Montreal and 
               <br />
               let him look at the conditions that exist there, and 
               <br />
               then come back and make a comparison with our 
               <br />
               people. I never heard of any Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               who would come in here and blacken his people 
               <br />
               as this gentleman did. I want to say, as a man who 
               <br />
               went over in 1914 and did my bit at that time -— 
               <br />
               I did not see him over there though!

               Mr. Cashin I have stated that there is an ulterior 
               <br />
               motive behind this whole motion. I grant you that 
               <br />
               the gentlemen who are supporting it don’t realise 
               <br />
               it. I believe that the Commission of Government, 
               <br />
               directly or indirectly, and the Dominions Ofﬁce, 
               <br />
               are behind it. Why doI make that statement? On 
               <br />
               the 18th of September of this year I gave a short 
               <br />
               talk in this House, and was severely criticised by 
               <br />
               some people. In that talk I made a short quotation 
               <br />
               taken from a speech delivered in the British 
               <br />
               House of Commons by Prime Minister Attlee: “It 
               <br />
               is important that a series of reconstruction 
               <br />
               measures which the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               are planning to introduce should proceed without 
               <br />
               interruption, and these will be pushed forward as 
               <br />
               rapidly as possible. The Commission have a full 
               <br />
               programme to meet during the next two or three 
               <br />
               years.” What is the interpretation to be placed on 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               these remarks?.... I would analyse it like this, that 
               <br />
               Mr. Attlee, when he made that talk on December 
               <br />
               1 I last, stated that we are going to hold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis«</span>

               sion of Government in Newfoundland for two or 
               <br />
               three years because they have a deﬁnite program 
               <br />
               which has got to go forward without interruption. 
               <br />
               If that is true, what are we doing here? I have 
               <br />
               asked for a statement by someone who knows 
               <br />
               what they mean by that, and I think I am entitled 
               <br />
               to an answer. I got a letter from the Secretary to 
               <br />
               this effect: “With reference to your question sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to the Information Committee to be sub— 
               <br />
               mitted to Mr. Attlee and the House of Commons, 
               <br />
               1 am directed by the Information Committee to 
               <br />
               inform you that it needs further consideration, 
               <br />
               and that it would be reviewed at a later date”. 
               <br />
               Reviewed by whom — the Information Commit- 
               <br />
               tee? That question should have gone to the 
               <br />
               government, and from there to the Dominions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce and back here. It has been held up by the 
               <br />
               Information Committee, and they are going to 
               <br />
               review it later. It was merely a question asking 
               <br />
               for an explanation, and it has not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex«</span>
