               your Committee were in agreement to leasing the 
               <br />
               airport to the airline companies? 
               <br />
               Mr.Smallwood I prefer not to speak for the 
               <br />
               whole Committee on that. We stand by the report 
               <br />
               as a whole. We say it was suggested to Mr. Neill 
               <br />
               that such an attitude might have been chosen by 
               <br />
               the government in the ﬁrst place. Knowing that 
               <br />
               these foreign airlines were more eager to use 
               <br />
               Gander than the government was or could be, all 
               <br />
               they had to do was to sit tight and wait for the 
               <br />
               airlines to come to them. They can’t make their 
               <br />
               airlines pay, so far as the North Atlantic trafﬁc is 
               <br />
               concerned, without Gander; it’s an impossibility 
               <br />
               to make it pay, and the government might have 
               <br />
               stood pat and waited for the airlines to come to 
               <br />
               them, and then said “All right, we have no use for 
               <br />
               Gander, we have no aircraft and we don’t intend 
               <br />
               to use it, but if you want to use it you can, on our 
               <br />
               conditions, and these are (1) that you pay all 
               <br />
               charges of operating the port, and (2) that you 
               <br />
               follow the conditions and standards of payment 
               <br />
               of wages, and the fact that Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               must be employed. We lay down the standards 
               <br />
               and you follow them and pay all costs.” It was 
               <br />
               suggested to Mr. Neill that should have been the 
               <br />
               attitude of the government His answer was to 
               <br />
               shrug his shoulders and not vouchsafe a word of 
               <br />
               comment.

               As for the Transportation Committee, in reply 
               <br />
               to Mr. Higgins, I still don’t see for a moment that 
               <br />
               it would have been proﬁtable, or that the Com— 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               meet them, I don’t see that it would be quite 
               <br />
               proper. Maybe I am misunderstanding Mr. Hig-

               Mr. Harrington I would like to ask a question, 
               <br />
               but ﬁrst I would like to make a few comments on 
               <br />
               the report. To my mind the way Gander is being 
               <br />
               operated now is a public scandal. I have ex- 
               <br />
               pressed myself on this whenever I could get an 
               <br />
               opportunity. The most reasonable thing to do 
               <br />
               would be to close down Gander. It is like a man 
               <br />
               with $3,000 a year trying to operate a 50 car

               <br />
               disgrace. As for the question, I see here that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, in the preamble, page 2, says, 
               <br />
               “We have to record that with one exception we 
               <br />
               have secured all the information we wanted.” 
               <br />
               That exception is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gander,</span> Has that been refused? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood In reply to Mr. Harrington, the 
               <br />
               House will recall that the very ﬁrst question 
               <br />
               tabled in this Convention was the one I tabled in 
               <br />
               connection with Gander. It was rather a long 
               <br />
               question, asking for details of expenditure, etc. I 
               <br />
               understand that a very honest attempt is being 
               <br />
               made to get out that information, but as yet we 
               <br />
               have not received it. It has not been refused. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Job It seems to me that, in expressing its 
               <br />
               views on the omissions, the Committee has over- 
               <br />
               looked the fact that not only should the airport 
               <br />
               have been run without loss to the colony, but the 
               <br />
               colony should have gotten something out of it. 
               <br />
               We have a strategic position, but it seems to have 
               <br />
               been given away, and a heavy loss incurred. 
               <br />
               There should have been something obtained for 
               <br />
               the colony in return for the concessions given. 
               <br />
               Early in February this year the surviving mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the old Legislative Council issued a 
               <br />
               protest through the newspapers here on the leases 
               <br />
               of airﬁelds, and the lack of general information 
               <br />
               given to the public. In his reply Mr. Neill stated, 
               <br />
               as an excuse, that it was a rule between the 
               <br />
               nations concerned that only exchanges in air 
               <br />
               rights should be given. This report rightly points 
               <br />
               out that we were not in the same position of other 
               <br />
               countries because we did not want to run an air 
               <br />
               service, therefore we were entitled to something 
               <br />
               else in addition in exchange for use of our air- 
               <br />
               ﬁelds. We were a member of this organisation 
               <br />
               and the excuse was that we were not able to 
               <br />
               bargain. The answer would seem to be that we 
               <br />
               should never have been a member of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PICAOx</span> as 
               <br />
               it is called. l thought I would like to draw the 
               <br />
               attention of the members to the fact that this had 
               <br />
               been protested <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against.</span> This is exactly what 
               <br />
               Mr. Neill wrote us: “Strategic positions on air 
               <br />
               routes are not a bargaining factor against any 
               <br />
               other concessions. ‘Air rights for air rights’ is the 
               <br />
               accepted international principle, and any sugges- 
               <br />
               tion that air rights should be a bargaining factor 
               <br />
               for other concessions would not be entertained.” 
               <br />
               That is where we fell down at the start, in agree- 
               <br />
               ing to abide by the decision of an organisation to 
               <br />
