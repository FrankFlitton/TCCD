               <br />

               <br />
               from these two sources. The thing was to get the

               Mr. Smallwood Another thing to which I would 
               <br />
               like to draw your attention, a matter of vital 
               <br />
               importance. You refer here to the three mile 
               <br />
               limit,I and you say that large parts of it have been 
               <br />
               denuded, which is largely the case. I am especial— 
               <br />
               ly familiar with it in parts of Bonavista Centre, 
               <br />
               which overﬂows into Bonavista North, from 
               <br />
               Hare Bay up to Gambo, where there is no wood 
               <br />
               left, not a scrap. The people down there have sent 
               <br />
               a petition to the government, drawing their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span> 
               <br />
               tion to the fact that at the present time the three 
               <br />
               mile limit is cut out completely, and immediately 
               <br />
               adjacent are paper areas. I rather expected the 
               <br />
               report to contain a reference to the serious situa- 
               <br />
               tion that had arisen in many parts of the country 
               <br />
               where the three mile limit had been almost com- 
               <br />
               pletely cutout. The only timber remaining is that 
               <br />
               owned by the paper companies, and small saw- 
               <br />
               mill men have got to go in on the companies’ land 
               <br />
               to cut, and pay royalties for so doing. Many such 
               <br />
               cases have happened in Bonavista Centre and 
               <br />
               Bonavista North. I know also of one or two cases 
               <br />
               where the government actually swapped Crown 
               <br />
               land limits for the convenience of Bowaters. I 
               <br />
               have in my possession a number of letters from 
               <br />
               Dark Cove and contiguous places around Gambo 
               <br />
               dealing with this same matter. It seems that the 
               <br />
               government did the swapping to provide the 
               <br />
               grounds for the statement that the output for local 
               <br />
               sawmills would increase.
