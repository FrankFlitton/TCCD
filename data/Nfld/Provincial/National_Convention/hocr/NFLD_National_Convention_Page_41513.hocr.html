               As the impartial Chairman of this Convention, 
               <br />
               I am not a member; I came here under a royal 
               <br />
               commission, and have been working with you 
               <br />
               gentlemen for going on four months. We have 
               <br />
               had our troubles, and perhaps made our mistakes 
               <br />
               and had our shortcomings, nor did we ever make 
               <br />
               a pretence to being an assembly of wise men. No 
               <br />
               properly elected assembly ever is or ever has 
               <br />
               been in the history of the world, but I want to say 
               <br />
               this: we have been criticised outside, and quite 
               <br />
               properly so. Any man who offers himself for 
               <br />
               public office must be prepared to accept 
               <br />
               criticism, but I do feel that the criticism directed 
               <br />
               at times towards the work of this Convention has 
               <br />
               not been fair. For if I have any powers of percep- 
               <br />
               tion, and if I am capable of evaluating man and 
               <br />
               his handiwork, then I want to lay down that in my 
               <br />
               judgement the work of this Convention must 
               <br />
               inevitably prove to be of an inestimable value to 
               <br />
               the country, not only now but in the future. It is 
               <br />
               a very easy thing to tell a man to do something, 
               <br />
               an entirely different thing to go and do it yourself. 
               <br />
               And I am not satisﬁed that the criticism at times 
               <br />
               directed towards this Convention was fair, for the 
               <br />
               reason that many of these critics did not take the 
               <br />
               time to qualify themselves by experience to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as»</span> 
               <br />
               sume the status of critics.

               I would say that the work done by the 
               <br />
               committees particularly, and the Convention 
               <br />
               generally, was of a tremendous nature, to say the 
               <br />
               least. How could any man in his right mind, and 
               <br />
               with a proper sense of proportion, view all the 
               <br />
               reports which have been compiled by the com- 
               <br />
               mittees, the co-ordination of these reports, and 
               <br />
               eventually the recommendations which we are 
               <br />
               now about to make, and say that nothing has been 
               <br />
               accomplished?.... If this Convention did nothing 
               <br />
               other than to provoke this country out of the Rip 
               <br />
               Van Winkle sleep into which it had sunk for 14 
               <br />
               years, and had produced and created, as it has, 
               <br />
               political consciousness in the minds of our 
               <br />
               people, then I am prepared to reafﬁrm that from 
               <br />
               this standpoint alone, the members of this Con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment. Today you have in this country three 
               <br />
               schools of thought. That is to say, three forms of 
               <br />
               government are being discussed, their merits and 
               <br />
               demerits, by all sections of the people. And I 
               <br />
               would say this, that if Major Cashin has provoked 
               <br />
               people into a realisation of the merits of respon- 
               <br />
               sible government, and others into deciding 
               <br />
               against responsible government, then Major 
               <br />
               Cashin and his associates in this House have 
               <br />
               performed a most invaluable function, because 
               <br />
               they have made up the minds of these people as 
               <br />
               to what they desire in future forms of govem— 
               <br />
               ment. The same goes for Mr. Smallwood. If the 
               <br />
               country ever gets the chance to decide for or 
               <br />
               against confederation, I think all fair-minded 
               <br />
               men must agree that the prodigious and untiring 
               <br />
               efforts of Mr. Smallwood have made that pos- 
               <br />
               sible. I could go on with further and repeated 
               <br />
               illustrations, but I do not want to unnecessarily 
               <br />
               trespass upon the time and patience of members, 
               <br />

               propose to state publicly outside this Convention, 
               <br />
               that in my considered judgement I think this 
               <br />
               country is irreparably indebted to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conven»</span> 
               <br />
               tion, and the members. At times it was trying; but 
               <br />
               the fact that it was trying is proof paramount of 
               <br />
               the sincerity with which the members of this 
               <br />

               fare of the country, then there would have been 
               <br />
               no sharp exchanges because nobody would be 
               <br />
               sufﬁciently excited about the business to get 
               <br />
