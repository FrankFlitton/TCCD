               large companies did give their figures and we

               <br />
               have liked to have seen in this report, and that is 
               <br />
               on the protective tariff, the duties as they would 
               <br />
               have regularly been, provided we did not have 
               <br />
               that industry here at all. As I see it, this discussion 
               <br />
               got a bit away from that, we got down to drawing 
               <br />
               examples on the basis of no duties at all. I don’t 
               <br />
               think that situation has any relation at all when 
               <br />
               we are dealing with protective tariffs. I think that 
               <br />
               had these tariffs in relation to the different matters 
               <br />
               as we found them been ﬁgured out, and if we had 
               <br />
               a tabulation on these things, that a few figures 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood On page 8, the last paragraph,

               I wonder if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hickman would mention <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> It 
               <br />

               local industry is carried <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> At the end of the last 
               <br />
               war I came in contact with quite a bunch of men 
               <br />
               who were interested in changing the map of 
               <br />
               Europe. One of those rose to a pretty prominent 
               <br />
               position in the Czechoslovakian government, and 
               <br />
               he explained to me what was going to take place 
               <br />
               and what was going to be put into the boot and 
               <br />
               shoe industry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> He spoke also of the good 
               <br />
               quality of our herring. I suppose today the 
               <br />
               country has got an idea of the consumption of 
               <br />
               herring in Middle Europe, as they call <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> The 
               <br />
               humble herring may be nothing at all in this 
               <br />
               country, but in those countries it is a luxury. 1 was 
               <br />
               interested, and at that time we had a big export of 
               <br />
               herring from this country, but unfortunately, due 
               <br />
               to the depression and not being handled right, we 
               <br />
               lost that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">market...</span> Those chaps, apparently they 
               <br />
               were very intelligent and well educated. I 
               <br />
               thought, if he banks on going into that position it
