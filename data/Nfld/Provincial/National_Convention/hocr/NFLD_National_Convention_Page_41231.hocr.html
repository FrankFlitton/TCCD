               there are many people who have very hazy and 
               <br />
               very often very strange ideas about it. Here in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland we look at public debt quite dif- 
               <br />
               ferently from other countries, because we have 
               <br />
               had a very sad experience with our public debt. 
               <br />
               Our public debt has everything wrong with it that 
               <br />
               it could have. It was too big to start with. It was 
               <br />
               a crippling burden on us, a millstone around our 
               <br />
               necks. In the second place, it was owed to people 
               <br />
               outside the country — practically all of it. Instead 
               <br />
               of borrowing it from ourselves, we borrowed it 
               <br />
               from people in other countries -— no doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause we couldn’t borrow it from ourselves be— 
               <br />
               cause we didn’t have it amongst ourselves to 
               <br />
               borrow it from ourselves. In the third place, we 
               <br />
               paid too much interest on it. We paid out scores 
               <br />
               and scores of millions of dollars in interest on our 
               <br />
               debt, and we paid it out to people in other 
               <br />
               countries. It was a terrible drain to pay out all that 
               <br />
               interest. I think in the Finance Report there’s a 
               <br />
               table showing the amount of money that this 
               <br />
               country paid out over a number of years in inter- 
               <br />
               est that it had to send out of the country. I don’t 
               <br />
               remember that ﬁgure, but I do remember <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compil»</span> 
               <br />
               ing it myself years and years ago, showing that 
               <br />
               up to that time we had paid out over $100 million 
               <br />
               of our hard—earned money in interest and we had 
               <br />
               had to ship that money out of the country al- 
               <br />
               together. In the fourth place, most of what we 
               <br />
               borrowed we spent for unproductive and often 
               <br />
               wasteful purposes. Yes, our public debt was the 
               <br />
               worst kind of debt a country could have. And it 
               <br />
               was very little credit to us that we had such a debt. 
               <br />
               Anyway, the day ﬁnally came when we found 
               <br />
               ourselves at the end of our rope. We couldn’tﬂnd 
               <br />
               enough money even to pay the interest on our 
               <br />
               public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debt.</span> As a country we were bankrupt and 
               <br />
               insolvent. At that point Britain came to our res- 
               <br />
               cue. She took over practically all our debts, 
               <br />
               guaranteed the principle and interest to the 
               <br />
               people we owed it to, and cut the rate of interest 
               <br />
               down to 3% per year. However, we still are 
               <br />
               draining our country, draining ourselves of mil- 
               <br />
               lions of dollars just to pay the interest on our debt. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Major Cashin says that Canada’s public 
               <br />
               debt is $17 billion. Actually, their debt is $12 
               <br />
               billion, because $5 billion is what's called self- 
               <br />
               liquidating, or is otherwise an asset rather than a 
               <br />
               liability. But, $12 billion or $17 billion, it really 
               <br />
               doesn’t matter very much at all because the big 
               <br />
               point is that practically all of it is owed right in

               <br />
               on that debt is paid out to people living right in 
               <br />
               Canada. It hasn’t got to be shipped out to people 
               <br />
               in some other country. The Canadian government 
               <br />
               has borrowed $12 billion net from the Canadian 
               <br />
               people. And back to the Canadian people that 
               <br />
               government pays around $400 million every year 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest.</span> The money stays right in Canada 
               <br />
               where it can be used for capital to start industry, 
               <br />
               to employ people and produce still further wealth 
               <br />
               for Canada. Now that’s one difference between 
               <br />
               Canada’s public debt and our own, and a pretty 
               <br />
               big difference it is — the difference between a 
               <br />
               debt draining a country of its money and keeping 
               <br />
               it right in the country for further development.

               There’s another very important point. It’s this. 
               <br />
               That a country’s public debt is big or small ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the resources developed and un- 
               <br />
               developed of that country. That is, according to 
               <br />
               whether the total amount of wealth produced in 
               <br />
               the country is enough to pay the interest on the 
               <br />
               debt without feeling it. On this test, Canada’s 
               <br />
               public debt is a small one, for to ﬁnd around $400 
               <br />
               million a year to pay the interest on their debt is 
               <br />
               scarcely anything at all out of the vast yearly 
               <br />
               wealth produced in Canada. They’re producing 
               <br />
               over $12 thousand million worth of wealth a year 
               <br />
               in Canada now — over $12 billion a year. We 
               <br />
               must not forget that Canada is the third largest 
               <br />
               trading nation in the whole world. And out of all 
               <br />
               that fabulous wealth, to ﬁnd $400 million a year 
               <br />
               for interest is no burden at all worth mentioning, 
               <br />
               especially when we remember that the $400 mil- 
               <br />
               lion is paid right back to Canadian people living 
               <br />
               right in Canada... The national debt of Canada is 
               <br />
               owed to the Canadian people. It was borrowed 
               <br />
               from the Canadian people and corporations, and 
               <br />
               the interest on it is paid to the people and institu— 
               <br />
               tions of Canada. All the people owe all the money 
               <br />
               making up the national debt to some of the people 
               <br />
               of Canada. Interest on that national debt is paid 
               <br />
               to some of the people and collected from all the 
               <br />
               people generally....
