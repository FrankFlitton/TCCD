               Mr. Chairman, there appears to be a dif- 
               <br />
               ference of opinion in the delegation as to its 
               <br />
               reception in England, but the tenor of the report 
               <br />
               leaves little room to doubt the feeling of the 
               <br />
               majority. Lord Addison and his colleagues would 
               <br />
               seem to have some resentment towards the 
               <br />
               delegation, and I am of the opinion that the full 
               <br />
               report of the conversations in England should be 
               <br />
               laid before the Convention, convened in private

               Mr. Smallwood I think Mr. McCormack said 
               <br />
               that the British government has told us that if we 
               <br />
               go back to responsible government, then the 
               <br />
               British government will no longer be responsible 
               <br />
               for our sterling debt...

               Mr. McCormack That is right.

               Mr. Smallwood I think it is utterly incorrect. I 
               <br />
               do not see in the memoranda from the British 
               <br />
               government any such statement. I have not heard 
               <br />
               any of the delegates who went to London make 
               <br />
               the statement. I am aware there are people in this 
               <br />
               town who seem to have got the impression that if 
               <br />
               we go under responsible government the British 
               <br />
               government will repudiate the guarantee of our 
               <br />
               sterling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debt,</span> It is wrong. It is utterly untrue... 
               <br />
               Mr. McCormack I thank Mr. Smallwood for 
               <br />
               pointing out my error.

               Mr. Hollett Whilst I appreciate the excellence

               of the speech of Mr. McCormack, it was an error. 
               <br />
               I believe someone else made the same statement 
               <br />
               yesterday. Great Britain guaranteed in 1934 the 
               <br />
               interest on the debt, otherwise they could not 
               <br />
               have converted it and it could not have gone back

               Britain has guaranteed the interest on that debt,

               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood for bringing up this point. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood lthought I had a chance to have 
               <br />
               a knock at responsible government, but I gave 
               <br />
               responsible government a boost. Really, I think 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrl</span> Hollett should thank me a little more heart-

               Mr. Higgins It would not be that Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Small‘</span> 
               <br />
               wood was more worried about Commission of 
               <br />
               Government in putting in his ﬁve cents‘ worth for 
               <br />
               responsible government? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I am one who wants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self.</span> 
               <br />
               government for Newfoundland but it is my 
               <br />
               opinion that the majority of people want Com- 
               <br />
               mission govemment— I say that as one who does 
               <br />
               not want Commission ofGovemment, but as one 
               <br />
               who wants self-govemment. In my opinion Com- 
               <br />
               mission government is the most popular govern- 
               <br />
               ment in Newfoundland at this moment. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins In other words, the Gallup poll is 
               <br />
               the “Smallwood poll." 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I believe Mr. Smallwood is getting 
               <br />
               off on the wrong foot. Yesterday I addressed him, 
               <br />
               and looked up and found he was not in his seat, 
               <br />
               and then he cried from across the house, “Here I 
               <br />
               am.“ So you see Mr. Smallwood has already 
               <br />
               walked across this House. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy ....This report should have been 
               <br />
               debated when the main report is brought before 
               <br />
               the Convention, and I see no point in covering a 
               <br />
               lot of ground over which we will have to retrace 
               <br />
               our steps at a later date. The information from 
               <br />
               London is exactly as I anticipated. What can 
               <br />
               reasonably be expected from the British people 
               <br />
               they have promised to do, except we feel they 
               <br />
               could purchase more from this country. What 
               <br />
               criticism we have to offer should be directed to 
               <br />
               the Commission as an irresponsible group of 
               <br />
               individuals who appear to stop at nothing except 
               <br />
               what would be in the best interests of this country. 
               <br />
               The Dominions Office assumes no risk 
               <br />
               whatever in continuing to guarantee our bonds 
               <br />
               while there is a surplus, but the responsibility is 
               <br />
               ours to recommend or help to provide our people 
               <br />
               with a government which this country should 
               <br />
               have, and can afford... 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey lam mildly surprised that we have
