               deposits recently discovered in the New- 
               <br />
               foundland-Labrador. As that development takes

               place, no government however benevolent could 
               <br />
               look after the material interests to be derived

               Newfoundlanders ﬁghting for Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               interests It is admitted on all sides today that the 
               <br />
               development of this mineral wealth can be 
               <br />
               probably one of the most important, if not the 
               <br />
               most important development that has ever taken 
               <br />
               place in the history of this country. To bring this 
               <br />
               home to us, let us suppose that the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would be assured in the future of 
               <br />
               another industry which would be as valuable to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as the development of the paper 
               <br />
               industry at Comer Brook. That is the position 
               <br />
               with regard to the almost certain development of 
               <br />
               the mineral deposits of the Labrador, if we can 
               <br />
               believe the facts which have been placed before 
               <br />
               us. The important thing to me is this: that we, the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, who should reap the 
               <br />
               advantages from this wealthy resource, should be 
               <br />
               in a position to get all the material advantages for 
               <br />
               our own people. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The fourth reason which helped me to make 
               <br />
               up my mind in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self~government</span> is the 
               <br />
               fact that the development of our fisheries, both 
               <br />
               on the side of marketing possibilities and the 
               <br />
               extension of the industry itself is, for a number of 
               <br />
               reasons, stronger today than it has ever been. In 
               <br />
               spite of the present difficulties, particularly ex- 
               <br />
               change difﬁculties which I feel certain will be 
               <br />
               resolved, the over—riding consideration is that for 
               <br />
               no little time to come there will be a shortage of 
               <br />
               food in the world which Newfoundland ﬁsh will 
               <br />
               help to ﬁll. I believe that our recent progressive- 
               <br />
               ness in the ﬁsheries has been due to a realisation 
               <br />
               on the part of Newfoundland exporters of the 
               <br />
               need for modernisation and diversiﬁcation, and 
               <br />
               for a more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> approach to the market-

               <br />
               ment of Newfoundlanders would not jeopardise 
               <br />
               these accomplishments, but would be anxious to 
               <br />
               advance them still further.

               Further, since 1934 (which we were bound to

               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Further, I am convinced that if we could once 
               <br />
               get that spirit of national pride which pervades 
               <br />
               the more progressive nations, big or small, we 
               <br />
               would be in a position to take on to ourselves 
               <br />
               under present conditions the whole of the balance 
               <br />
               of our national debt. That national pride can best 
               <br />
               be fostered at this time by the feeling that once 
               <br />
               again we have had the guts to take our political 
               <br />
               and economic future into our own hands as an 
               <br />
               expression of faith in our country and in oursel- 
               <br />
               ves. There are a number of other things which 
               <br />
               have been added to the development of the 
               <br />
               economy of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> They have been men— 
               <br />
               tioned so often that I propose to skip over them.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Finally, there is still another reason why I feel 
               <br />
               that self—government is the best for New— 
               <br />
               foundland. It is a reason which is less easily tied 
               <br />
               down, because it has nothing to do with tangible 
               <br />
               facts or ﬁgures. It has to do with personality, with 
               <br />
               human hopes, with that quality of man that 
               <br />
               pushes him onward through the generations 
               <br />
               toward a better way of living. I happen to believe 
               <br />
               that a man can best develop his personality, can 
               <br />
               best arrive at what happiness is possible in this 
               <br />
               life, through accepting all the dangers and pos- 
               <br />
               sible catastrophes of independence. The man 
               <br />
               who relies on himself, we all know, takes a risk 
               <br />
               on everything that he has -— his health, his ability, 
               <br />
               his wealth, his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances.</span> But the man who 
               <br />
               relies on others, who has no thought or power of 
               <br />
               earning which is really his own, no achievements 
               <br />
               that he can regard with pride as his own, no 
               <br />
               victories over his own personal struggles — such 
               <br />
               a man can know no victory because he knows no 
               <br />
               defeat. So, Mr. Chairman, I believe it is with a 
               <br />
               nation or a counuy; countries, like men, can only 
               <br />
               achieve real maturity by accepting the challenge 
               <br />
               of free will to make or break themselves. 
               <br />

               Life is a struggle, and only those who do not

               face this fact must escape into dependence upon 
               <br />
               stronger personalities. One gentleman said, 
               <br />
               “Responsible government is right in principle,

               practice. The most one can say of it is that it is
