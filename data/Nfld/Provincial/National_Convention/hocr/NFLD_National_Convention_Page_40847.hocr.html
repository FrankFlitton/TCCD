               Mr. MacDonald Coming back to this question 
               <br />
               of appointing someone to pilot this through com- 
               <br />
               mittee of the whole. We have a precedent to 
               <br />
               follow. Major Cashin steered the Forestry 
               <br />
               Committee’s report through committee of the 
               <br />
               whole. I know the Chairman of the Convention 
               <br />
               did not appoint him. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman Furthermore, even if it was the 
               <br />
               practice to have the chairman of a committee 
               <br />
               pilot it though the committee stage, I would rule 
               <br />
               that it is not applicable here. For this reason, Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley was a member of that delegation by 
               <br />
               virtue of the fact that he was Chairman of the 
               <br />
               Convention.

               Mr. Chairman Therefore, the moment he

               resigned his ofﬁce, he lost his right to appoint 
               <br />
               anyone. The more I go on, the more I become 
               <br />
               convinced of the soundness of what Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               says; that it is going to devolve upon me to 
               <br />
               appoint somebody to steer it through, if and when 
               <br />
               you decide to go into committee of the whole.
