               Mr. Chairman, I am not greatly interested in 
               <br />
               all the long tables of ﬁgures that have been 
               <br />
               presented to this Convention, nor do I think the 
               <br />
               people are interested in them. I am much more 
               <br />
               interested in the broad outline of the situation, 
               <br />
               and I am not too sure that everything is bright for 
               <br />
               the future in this country. There are too many 
               <br />
               signs of something altogether different, our 
               <br />
               people have long memories. There are thousands 
               <br />
               in this country who can remember back before 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst world war. They remember how the price 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh and everything else went up when that war 
               <br />
               broke out. They remember very well the 
               <br />
               prosperity that came to Newfoundland in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               world war. Yes, and they remember the depres— 
               <br />
               sion and hard times and dole and poverty that 
               <br />
               came after the war. They remember that with very 
               <br />
               few exceptions that depression lasted all the time 
               <br />
               from the end of that war almost to the start of this 
               <br />
               war. And they remember also that when this war 
               <br />
               came, prices began to jump just as they did in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst world war. Now, Mr. Chairman, this second 
               <br />
               world war is over — or at least the actual ﬁghting 
               <br />
               is over —— and can you blame people for wonder- 
               <br />
               ing what is going to happen in the near future? 
               <br />

               I am a plain working man, a trade unionist.

               foundland workers, and how they live and bring 
               <br />
               up their families. I know something of their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strug»</span> 
               <br />
               gles to live, I know something of their struggles

               to make both ends meet, and I know something

               <br />
               our people endured. So Mr. Chairman, I must tell 
               <br />
               you frankly that I am a bit hard to convince when 
               <br />
               I am told that everything is all right and our future 
               <br />
               assured. My mind is not a bit romantic, and the 
               <br />
               hard facts of our people’s struggle to live make a 
               <br />
               deeper impression on my mind than all the talk 
               <br />
               in the world about the glorious traditions and all 
               <br />
               sorts of things. I am not going to be carried away 
               <br />
               by any comforting assurances about our future, 
               <br />
               for when I remember the past I am still the more 
               <br />
               determined to keep my feet planted ﬁrmly on the

               Chairman, it can’t be so bad after all, as thousands

               of our people have gone there, obtained good 
               <br />

               <br />

               will admit that there are people in Canada similar

               to those in Newfoundland to whom I have

               Mr. Northcott Mr. Chairman, I want to say ﬁrst 
               <br />
               of all just why I cannot vote for confederation, 
               <br />
               why I cannot suppon it. First, our ﬁsheries are of 
               <br />
               paramount importance to me. Our people, a great 
               <br />
               many of them, live by the fisheries, and under the 
               <br />
               act we have no gilt~edge security that the federal 
               <br />
               government will take care of our ﬁsheries. Our 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board may not function as heretofore. 
               <br />
               This is a thing the fishermen in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will want to bear in mind. Every fisherman will 
               <br />
               want to know the facts, the real facts, and the truth 
               <br />
               in connection with our ﬁsheries and what will 
               <br />
               happen to the Fisheries Board. Gentlemen, we 
               <br />
               must export or perish. That is a very important 
               <br />
               thing. That is one of the reasons why I cannot 
               <br />
               support the motion now before the Chair. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am also of opinion that there are people in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland today who just cannot understand 
               <br />
               the terms of taxation and how they are going to 
               <br />
               be applied. You will remember that we have all 
               <br />
               been confused and bewildered. One person will 
               <br />
               tell you there is no taxation on a certain thing; 
               <br />
               another person will tell you there is taxation. Our 
               <br />
               people listening to the radio night after night are 
               <br />
               really confused over that issue, and I do not want 
               <br />
               to be a party to or in any way connected with 
               <br />
               anything that may lead them astray. I do not want 
               <br />
               the people to make a leap in the dark. This is a 
               <br />
               serious issue, and our people will want a long 
               <br />
               time to consider it before marking their vote. That 
               <br />
               is another reason why I am not prepared to sup- 
               <br />
               port the motion. 
               <br />

               <br />
               us it may be a different way of life and we want 
               <br />
