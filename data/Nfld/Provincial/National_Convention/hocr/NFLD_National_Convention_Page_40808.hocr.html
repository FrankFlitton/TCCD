               efﬁciency expert were to pass judgement on 
               <br />
               some of the equipment our ﬁshermen have to use, 
               <br />
               and I am not thinking only of the Labradorians, 
               <br />
               but of the ﬁshermen who go to the Labrador, that 
               <br />
               at least 50% of it would be thrown on the scrap- 
               <br />
               heap, and the other 50% would not reach a very 
               <br />
               high stage of efﬁciency.

               And not only is the equipment of the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               man a handicap to him, but I think it can be well 
               <br />
               said that a man cannot do his best unless he is 
               <br />
               well-fed and well-housed, and well cared for in 
               <br />
               that way. On the bread and tea economy that our 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen have had to depend upon, they are not 
               <br />
               able to bring their best possible contributions to 
               <br />
               our productive life. It is true that that man’s bread 
               <br />
               and tea economy has been varied, as far as he is 
               <br />
               able to have a meal of ﬁsh and brewis two or three 
               <br />
               times a week, and on Sunday he can have a meal 
               <br />
               of pufﬁns and turrs, but that kind of diet does not

               enable him to bring his best possible contribution.

               We all know that when England had to reduce on 
               <br />
               her rations the authorities saw to it that the men 
               <br />
               who had to go down in the mines, and the men 
               <br />
               who had to work in the factory, and the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men, were given an extra ration. It has a bearing 
               <br />
               upon his ability to produce. The same is true of 
               <br />
               our people. If they had better equipment, and 
               <br />
               were better fed, they could bring a better con— 
               <br />
               tribution to the economy of this country.

               When the member from Bonavista Centre

               dividual family or two somewhere on the coast

               whole background of this report should be

               <br />
               the fact that these are not isolated cases, that there 
               <br />
               is a great deal of hunger, and has been in the past, 
               <br />
               and a great deal of poverty, and a great deal of 
               <br />
               distress in our island, I think that that fact, which 
               <br />
               our Committee members must have known, 
               <br />

               It is not a waste of our time to look at this

               many people on the island and the coast of

               a waste of time, and I think we would have spent

               some portion of the 14 months we have spent here 
               <br />

               It was with a great deal of concern and regret

               that I read this morning in the Daily News of the 
               <br />
               fact that another of our industries in Labrador has 
               <br />
               had to declare itself insolvent. That company 
               <br />
               touches in a very vital way a large part of the coast 
               <br />
               of Labrador. The people along that coast have had 
               <br />
               a very hard and very difﬁcult existence all 
               <br />
               through their lives. A few years ago this industry 
               <br />
               started. It did not have a very good beginning. It 
               <br />
               dropped out of existence for a while and came 
               <br />
               back again, but when this company came into 
               <br />
               existence these people saw an opportunity 
               <br />
               whereby they might be able to make a few dollars 
               <br />
               other than through the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁshery.</span> In the long winter 
               <br />
               months they might work and make a bit of 
               <br />
               money, rather than have to rely upon the dole 
               <br />
               which they know so well. It was a very bright spot 
               <br />
               to them. Now to most of us it would not be a 
               <br />
               bright spot. It is not an easy thing to have to make
