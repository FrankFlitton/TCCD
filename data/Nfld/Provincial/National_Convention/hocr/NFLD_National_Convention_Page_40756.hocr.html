               a government started to raise a bond issue of 
               <br />
               nearly $100 million. Yet what they’ve done in 
               <br />
               Iceland will have to be done here. In 1946 the 
               <br />
               exportation of Iceland ﬁsh and ﬁsh products 
               <br />
               amounted to 244 million kroner equal to 80% of 
               <br />
               its total exports... That’s what they’ve done in 
               <br />
               Iceland, with one-third our population. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">criti«</span> 
               <br />
               cal, but I hope it’s constructive criticism I offer. 
               <br />
               But now let me leave this, and pass to what in 
               <br />
               my opinion is one weak link in our economic 
               <br />
               chain, the lack of a merchant marine. No country, 
               <br />
               especially an island can do without one. Let’s do 
               <br />
               a little ﬁguring, and see what the country has to 
               <br />
               offer in the way of freight to keep us from selling 
               <br />
               our ships at half-price. I’ll only take a few essen- 
               <br />
               tials, over roughly the life of a ship. First I’ll say 
               <br />
               ﬁgures don’t lie, but liars can ﬁgure. If you doubt 
               <br />
               them, you can check them. First I'll talk salt for 
               <br />
               the years 1925 to 1942, 16 years, not quite the life 
               <br />
               of a ship. We imported 762,503 tons at a freight 
               <br />
               rate of $2.80 per ton —— that’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peacetime</span> freight 
               <br />
               rates — an annual freight bill on salt of $132,438. 
               <br />
               For 16 years that makes $2,119, 008. Now coal, 
               <br />
               for the same period we imported 5,792,191 tons 
               <br />
               of coal at a peacetime freight rate of $1 per tort, 
               <br />
               or an average of $321,788 annually. Next let’s 
               <br />
               take ﬂour. It can all come in by ships. Over a 21 
               <br />
               year period, still in the life of a ship, we imported 
               <br />
               8,249,000 barrels of ﬂour at a freight rate of 60 
               <br />
               cents a barrel: $4,949,000 in freights on flour or 
               <br />
               $235,686 a year. The last of the four commodities 
               <br />
               I’ll refer to is ﬁsh. And it won‘t be the least. From 
               <br />
               the period <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1924.25</span> to 1944-45, we exported dried 
               <br />
               and pickled ﬁsh to a total of 24,532,550 quintals. 
               <br />
               At a freight rate of 70 cents per quintal, it cost us 
               <br />
               $17,172,785: an annual average of$817,751. 
               <br />
               Now this means that an annual freight bill 
               <br />
               went to outsiders totalling $1,507,563 on these 
               <br />
               four commodities alone. That money was lost to 
               <br />
               this country, wages were lost to our seamen, and 
               <br />
               wealth to our internal trade. In ordinary peace 
               <br />
               time that meant a loss to the country, a total loss, 
               <br />
               due to the lack of a merchant marine, of 
               <br />
               $31,033,384 over the period referred to. If the 
               <br />
               government had built those three ships of 2,000 
               <br />
               tons in 1925, what a different story. We can 
               <br />
               easily see how over that period this country paid 
               <br />
               out $80 million in freight, 99% of it going to 
               <br />
               outside interests. So that way too, did New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders help to bring this cod-vention into 
               <br />
               being, if it wasn’t the main cause. How can

               <br />

               <br />

               heavy, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">352-3</span> million annually for freight, gone

               That is a sum we can’t afford to lose, the trade 
               <br />
               loses, the government loses and worst of all the 
               <br />
               seaman loses, he has to eat the dole while in many

               sunk because an officer doesn‘t know his job is 
               <br />
               just as much a casualty as if sunk by enemy 
               <br />
               action. I think I have shown without a shadow of 
               <br />
               a doubt that there is cargo to be had for a merchant 
               <br />
               marine, and we should have one. Our flag should 
               <br />
               never have gone from the seas. There is always 
               <br />
               work for ships to do. Besides the things I have 
               <br />
               mentioned, the freight potentialities have not 
               <br />
               been scratched. We have the brawn, and the 
               <br />
               capital; I say again, do we lack the brains? Can’t 
               <br />
               we plan like the Icelandic parliament? Why the 
               <br />
               defeatist attitude? Only when we do plan like this 
               <br />
               will the man on the bill of Cape George and all 
               <br />
               the other bills get his three square meals, his suit 
               <br />
               of clothes and his tight roof. We can‘t get it out 
               <br />
               of baby bonuses and old age pensions. Let the 
               <br />
               people of the country demand that we get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Let

               resources here. Let us at one blow lick what we

               the uneconomical. If a fishery doesn't pay, let’s 
               <br />
               get rid of it. I heard my friend in the “B block” 
               <br />
               the other day speaking about the state of affairs 
               <br />
               in his part of the island, putting up a poor mouth 
               <br />
               because the Labrador ﬁsh are not to be caught, 
               <br />
               and is a drag on the market to sell when it is 
               <br />
               caught. 15 that any reason why this cannot be

               changed, when without going 100 miles from
