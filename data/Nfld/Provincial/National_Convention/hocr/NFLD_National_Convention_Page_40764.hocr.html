               that the Finance Committee has deliberately

               prepared anything like a political document. Far 
               <br />
               from it. I am quite prepared to accept this report

               that induced this condition. And indeed the 
               <br />
               Depression occasioned more havoc within the

               economy of Newfoundland than it did within the 
               <br />
               economies of most countries. But the Depression 
               <br />
               was able to do that because of other causes 
               <br />
               making for fundamental weaknesses in the 
               <br />
               economy. Of such causes the more notable were 
               <br />
               these:

               1. Newfoundland’s economy was an ex- 
               <br />
               port economy. The national income was for 
               <br />
               the most part derived from the sale of staple 
               <br />
               commodities abroad. In consequence, our 
               <br />
               economy was extremely vulnerable and col- 
               <br />
               lapsed with the collapse of world trade. Col- 
               <br />
               lapse was very nearly complete... Such a 
               <br />
               disastrous deterioration in our export trade 
               <br />
               naturally resulted in wage cuts and lay-offs 
               <br />
               and in the reduction of ﬁshermen’s incomes 
               <br />
               to sub-subsistence levels. The coincidence of 
               <br />
               these conditions in their turn precipitated 
               <br />
               wage reductions and unemployment in local 
               <br />
               secondary industry.

               2. Newfoundland’s economy was based 
               <br />
               upon but few natural resources — for the 
               <br />
               most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> ﬁsh, wood and some minerals. Ex-

               <br />
               natural resources was meager. And in the 
               <br />
               instance of fish we were geared to the 
               <br />
               production of a greater quantity than the 
               <br />
               market at that time could absorb. This lack of 
               <br />
               diversiﬁcation was a fundamental fault.

               3. Newfoundland’s economy was crip- 
               <br />
               pled by the great burden of servicing the 
               <br />
               public debt. Had the public debt been inter- 
               <br />
               nally contained, the national income would 
               <br />
               have been at the advantage of what it cost to 
               <br />
               service <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> But the public debt was 
               <br />
               preponderantly an external debt and this in- 
               <br />
               volved the export of a sizeable proportion of

               By 1933 the ratio of service cost to revenue 
               <br />
               had become such as would in any case have 
               <br />
               led to the eventual wreck of the island’s
