               <br />
               ment is interested in and it’s the tourist <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade.</span> If 
               <br />
               the government of Switzerland had left out the 
               <br />
               possibility of the tourist trade that country would 
               <br />
               be in a lot worse condition than she is in today. 
               <br />
               In fact it’s the one thing that makes that country 
               <br />
               one of the best living countries in the world with 
               <br />
               the assets that she has got. It’s only valleys and 
               <br />
               mountains, snow and ice, and farming land is at 
               <br />
               a premium... There are other countries in the

               I think some men on the Committee lifted their 
               <br />
               eyebrows when I asked Squadron Leader Pat- 
               <br />
               tison the potentialities of travelling in Gander, 
               <br />
               and he said, “I think we don’t want them, we have 
               <br />
               got nothing for them to come to, even people who 
               <br />
               want to stay over we don’t want, because they are 
               <br />
               something we can’t manage because we have no 
               <br />
               facilities for them." So I don‘t know, we acquired 
               <br />
               the Gander very cheaply, but for a country like 
               <br />
               Newfoundland we acquired the Gander at a 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce. Having acquired Gander at a sacriﬁce, 
               <br />
               if there was any way it could be made pay, why 
               <br />
               should they turn their thumbs down on it? I 
               <br />
               believe people travelling from the old country to 
               <br />
               the west would stop over for a day or two and 
               <br />
               have a look at it if the country was interested in 
               <br />
               it.

               I don’t hold with Mr. Miller about private 
               <br />
               capitalisation because I don’t believe hotels in 
               <br />
               this country are going to ﬂourish. It is not the 
               <br />
               hotel that you have got to look at, it is the dollars 
               <br />
               that are left behind in the country, and in that way 
               <br />
               the government has to take hold of it. Perhaps in 
               <br />
               time, when the country comes up to expectations, 
               <br />
               people who have come here and had a good time 
               <br />
               will go back and talk about it, and it may pay just 
               <br />
               as well as St. Petersburg or Key West. The 
               <br />
               Government of the United States came in at Key 
               <br />
               West and took a hold there and built up the road 
               <br />
               and helped the people. They did not build any 
               <br />
               hotels, but they came in and helped the people get 
               <br />
               on their feet, and paid the unemployed people 
               <br />
               who were starving, fixed the roads and ﬁxed the 
               <br />
               golf course I believe that the government should 
               <br />
               at least spend $1 million on this. I don’t believe 
               <br />
               it would be lost to the country. When the dollar 
               <br />
               is spent everybody gets the good of it, in fact one 
               <br />
               of the reasons that our whole economic system 
               <br />
               was so bad was that our dollars were not turned

               concentration camps, or land settlements, yet 
               <br />

               plow up ﬁve or six acres of land. Now they have 
               <br />
               other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plans.</span> That has been the policy all through.

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Higgins properly con- 
               <br />
               demned the discourtesy of the government in the 
               <br />
               way they treated the Tourist Board, but it would 
               <br />
               be a pity if the net result of the debate were to 
               <br />
               concentrate on that side of the matter. The Tourist 
               <br />
               Board is merely an incident — the thing that 
               <br />
               matters is tourism; bringing people to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland and having them spend money. We are 
               <br />
               hoping the tourist trade will develop in this 
               <br />
               country. I would like the people to see it as a 
               <br />
               chance to help the country. Up to the outbreak of 
               <br />
               war, everything Newfoundland needed she had 
               <br />
               to import; she paid for everything she received 
               <br />
               with the money she got from the things she ex- 
               <br />
               ported. But when the war came, a new element 
               <br />
               came into the picture. We were not dependent 
               <br />
               during the war on the money we got from the 
               <br />
               things we exported to foreign markets; we had 
               <br />
               new money which the Canadians and Americans 
               <br />
               paid us for work in building defense bases. That 
               <br />
               construction has stopped and very little money is 
               <br />
               coming to Newfoundland today from work on the 
               <br />
               bases. We are back again to where we were 
               <br />
               before the war. The big thing about the tourist 
               <br />
               trade is that it will bring into the country new 
               <br />
               money. The Commission of Government has this 
               <br />
               chance of bringing new money into the country, 
               <br />
               dangling before their very eyes, and they have 
               <br />
               done nothing about it. So far as they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> 
               <br />
               cerned the tourist trade does not exist. They are 
               <br />
               not interested in a thing which is going to bring 
               <br />
               money into Newfoundland. If this report does not 
               <br />
               put that thought across to the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, then it is just a waste of words. It is 
               <br />
               not enough to feel sympathy for the Tourist 
               <br />
               Board for the way the government has treated 
               <br />
               them; the thing to be disgusted with is that the 
               <br />
               government has neglected what is going to be a
