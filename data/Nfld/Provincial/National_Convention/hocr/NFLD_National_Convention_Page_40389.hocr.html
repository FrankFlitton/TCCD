               Mr. Fudge I rise to support the amendment. 1 
               <br />
               think you are all aware of my feelings. I believe 
               <br />
               that ﬁrst we want to have a government so that 
               <br />
               we can decide in the right way. I paid particular 
               <br />
               attention to my friend from White Bay wherein 
               <br />
               he told us they have had quite a lot of meetings, 
               <br />
               and talked about certain forms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government,</span> I 
               <br />
               presume he was speaking for his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">district.</span> He did 
               <br />
               say there was one particular form of government 
               <br />
               they did not want. I have an idea what form he 
               <br />
               meant. Suppose I want that form, have I not got 
               <br />
               the right to recommend it? As far as Humber 
               <br />
               district is concerned, I am here as a representative 
               <br />
               and I have endeavoured to do the best I can. I am 
               <br />
               not afraid to return home. If they want something 
               <br />
               better than I recommended, they are entitled to it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell I think the member from Comer 
               <br />
               Brook has misinterpreted something I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said.</span> 
               <br />
               I did not say some have expressed preference for 
               <br />
               two speciﬁc forms of government — what I did 
               <br />
               say, however, and in my own mind I was thinking 
               <br />
               of economic conditions, was they were quite 
               <br />
               certain what they did not want — ever again. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I have listened carefully this after- 
               <br />
               noon and evening to some fine addresses from all 
               <br />
               shadows of political opinion — if you put it that 
               <br />
               way —- those who profess a leaning towards 
               <br />
               confederation and those who lean towards home 
               <br />
               rule. At times I have been somewhat amused, at 
               <br />
               times somewhat sorry at some of the expressions 
               <br />
               I have heard...

               In that speech today there was too much dig— 
               <br />
               ging up of the graves of people who never had 
               <br />
               any possible hope of being represented here — 
               <br />
               they are dead. Records of dead people do not 
               <br />
               concern this Convention. What is the point in 
               <br />
               bringing up the records of prime ministers? What 
               <br />
               is the point in bringing up records of commis— 
               <br />
               sioners? It has nothing to do with this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convene</span> 
               <br />
               tion. There is entirely too much of the broken

               record, too much of this 1933 agreement, this

               We have the suggestion that they will not 
               <br />
               discuss the matter of terms with us. Who says 
               <br />
               that? The only way we can find out things of that 
               <br />
               nature is by written briefs. We have some official 
               <br />
               accounts from Canadian ministers who said they 
               <br />
               would discuss the matter with Convention repre— 
               <br />
               sentatives, ifthey so desired. One of the speakers 
               <br />
               tonight who delivered a fine speech, said that 
               <br />
               some people were anticonfederates but they 
               <br />
               wanted to hear the terms. I say that lest there be 
               <br />
               any misunderstanding about my anticonfederacy 
               <br />
               —— I am definitely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promesponsible</span> government 
               <br />
               and nothing else ~— but between <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro'responsible</span> 
               <br />
               government and not doing my duty as a member 
               <br />
               of this Convention, there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">job.</span> When the time 
               <br />
               comes there is no doubt in my mind about howl 
               <br />
               am going to vote, and no doubt about the way I 
               <br />
               feel on this approach to Canada or any other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> It is only because we have ajob we must 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> Much has been said about our not having the 
               <br />
               power from the people. I am certain that we do 
               <br />
               have a mandate from the people to make all the 
               <br />
               enquiries possible into all the forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment that we think might possibly come within 
               <br />
               the purview of the national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referendum.</span> I am no 
               <br />
               constitutional lawyer - merely an ordinary 
               <br />
               general practitioner — but at least I have suffi- 
               <br />
               cient common sense to interpret the simple terms 
               <br />
               of reference. The other angle by the people who 
               <br />
               are against these terms, is what is the point of 
               <br />
               going to Canada, you have not the power to 
               <br />
               bargain, you are merely a post ofﬁce. I do not care 
               <br />
               if we are a rubber stamp, we will get what we can. 
               <br />
               Once we have gotten that we have discharged our
