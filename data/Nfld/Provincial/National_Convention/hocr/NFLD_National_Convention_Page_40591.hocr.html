               £400,000 temporary loan we may consider can- 
               <br />
               celled. Remember that that £400,000 was the 
               <br />
               price of keeping your brothers in Flanders Fields 
               <br />
               in 1916, 1917 and 1918. It was never intended at 
               <br />
               the time it was raised that our people would be 
               <br />
               called upon to pay it. Is there any concession 
               <br />
               there? They say that the question of convening 
               <br />
               the debt to a lower rate of interest had been raised 
               <br />
               by the Commission of Government with the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government, and that a conver~ 
               <br />
               sion operation can be carried out in January 1948, 
               <br />
               provided the Commission gives them three 
               <br />
               months’ notice —— and we hope the Commission 
               <br />
               does not forget to give them notice. You will 
               <br />
               agree that all these things were ours of right. The 
               <br />
               sinking fund should naturally have been applied 
               <br />
               to the debt long ago, ever since 1937 and 1938. 
               <br />
               The £400,000 — it was never intended we should 
               <br />
               pay it, otherwise we should not have gotten off 
               <br />
               so easily. This supposedly generous action of 
               <br />
               converting from 3% to 2.5%, that is in line with 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom cheap money policy, and 
               <br />
               also the Canadian cheap money policy.

               Why then, I repeat, why was it necessary to 
               <br />
               send a delegation to London? The answer, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, is simply this: the Dominions Ofﬁce 
               <br />
               wanted the Convention to send a delegation to 
               <br />
               Canada! Why? Because Canada wanted the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce to send a delegation there! 
               <br />
               They know very well that only by receiving the 
               <br />
               English delegation was it possible to achieve 
               <br />
               their principal aim. You will all remember the 
               <br />
               resolution of the member from Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               — that the delegation to Canada should not be 
               <br />
               sent until after the return of the English delega— 
               <br />
               tion. That is the only reason why the answers of 
               <br />
               Lord Addison were not sent by airmail. Receive 
               <br />
               a delegation to England? Of course! What shall 
               <br />
               we do when we get them here? Oh, we shall brush 
               <br />
               them off somehow. We shall make a gesture 
               <br />
               about the debt. Oh yes, we must be careful to tell 
               <br />
               them that if they vote for responsible government 
               <br />
               we shall no longer guarantee their financial 
               <br />
               stability. That is exactly what they did. You have 
               <br />
               heard Lord Addison’s statement given the press 
               <br />
               — “Vote for responsible government and your 
               <br />
               financial stability will no longer be guaranteed.” 
               <br />
               Just what did they mean by ﬁnancial stability? 
               <br />
               That is what they assured us in 1933 when they 
               <br />
               took away our constitution — “We will look after 
               <br />
               you”, “We will look after your financial 
               <br />

               Any of you who have lived on our coast where

               1940, you must ask yourselves, “What does Lord

               Addison mean by ﬁnancial stability?“ If any of 
               <br />

               hardy people, down to a very gaunt, starved 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnancial stability which is to be taken away from 
               <br />
               us if we vote for responsible government? I ask 
               <br />
               you to consider it well. Ask yourselves what the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce means by financial stability. 
               <br />
               Does it mean a starved beri-beri race? Does it 
               <br />
               mean a TB race? Gentlemen, if that’s the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">finan~</span> 
               <br />
               cial stability which Lord Addison promises you,

               I ask you to reject it without any hesitation 
               <br />
               whatever. I won’t go into the question as to 
               <br />
               whether, if they guarantee it, they can carry it out. 
               <br />
               I have no patience with those people who are 
               <br />
               putting up this austerity business about Great

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Britain.</span> 1 ask you to remember that the British 
               <br />
               Empire has granted credits to the extent of 
               <br />
               £750,000 to European countries. £300 million 
               <br />
               worth of credits have been given out to Greece, 
               <br />
               Turkey, Holland, Belguim, Italy and God knows 
               <br />
               how many other countries, and most of those, it 
               <br />
               has been stated, need never be paid back. We, 
               <br />
               300,000 Britishers here, who gave our young

               the Chairman of the Commission government
