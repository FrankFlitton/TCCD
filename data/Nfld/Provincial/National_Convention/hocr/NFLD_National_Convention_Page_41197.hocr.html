               coming more and more bewildering, conﬂicting,

               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confusing,</span> And I fear that this can be said of 
               <br />
               many people in our island home today. They 
               <br />
               haven’t as yet got a clear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">picture.</span> However, much 
               <br />
               credit is due to Mr. Hollett, Mr. Fogwill and 
               <br />
               Major Cashin, for their great pains in trying to 
               <br />
               reveal the truth, as they saw it, regarding taxation 
               <br />
               and confederation. Sir, our people must be en— 
               <br />
               lightened on this very important matter. The 
               <br />
               people want to know the whole truth and the truth 
               <br />
               shall make them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">free,</span> You cannot light a candle 
               <br />
               and put it under a bushel, for if you do, you cannot 
               <br />
               get a very effective light. This can be applied to 
               <br />
               our people. They are still groping and wandering 
               <br />
               around in darkness over the issue of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion and taxation. Sir, whatever be the form of 
               <br />
               government, we shall still have to pay taxes. But 
               <br />
               the vital and burning question now being asked 
               <br />
               is, are the federal, provincial and town council 
               <br />
               taxes, all three combined, more than the taxes 
               <br />
               now being paid under Commission of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment? This is what the country is asking, and is 
               <br />
               demanding of us as members of the National 
               <br />
               Convention. We must in all honesty and sincerity 
               <br />
               give the answer to the best of our knowledge and 
               <br />
               ability. We must be honest with ourselves and the 
               <br />
               people and explain every note and angle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxa»</span> 
               <br />
               tion. Then, and only then, can the people have a 
               <br />
               clearer picture of the proposed terms of union 
               <br />
               with Canada. We cannot, we dare not, allow 
               <br />
               ourselves to make a leap in the dark... There must 
               <br />
               be nothing hid, not one single iota. There can be 
               <br />
               no misunderstanding then, and everything shall 
               <br />
               and will be open and above board; and we will 
               <br />
               have fulﬁlled our tasks. We then can leave the

               Mr. Starkes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, this Convention has 
               <br />
               been dubbed as a gloriﬁed debating society. To 
               <br />
               my mind I think that‘s wrong, because so far it 
               <br />
               seems that everybody is on one side, the negative, 
               <br />
               I think I’ll speak from the afﬁrmative side, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause it makes it more interesting to the people 
               <br />
               of this country. It’s not my intention to go into a 
               <br />
               long speech about taxation, federal, provincial, 
               <br />
               or municipal. In my opinion this House is already 
               <br />
               familiar with all forms of taxes, and the people 
               <br />
               will remember the taxes they had to pay under 
               <br />
               responsible government as well as those under 
               <br />
               the present form of government. I do not think 
               <br />
               that we are concerned with one member being 
               <br />
               interested in the moving picture business and the 
               <br />
               amusement tax in Lewisporte in particular. I am 
               <br />
               not concerned if any one member is doing busi- 
               <br />
               ness for an outport or a junk dealer in Montreal, 
               <br />
               whether he is selling merchandise to the New— 
               <br />
               foundland shopkeepers or selling ships and coals 
               <br />
               to the Newfoundland Railway. If a member feels 
               <br />
               obligated to repay money, then let him pay it, and 
               <br />
               he will have the admiration of all concerned. But 
               <br />
               why all this bickering and ﬁlibustering at a cost 
               <br />
