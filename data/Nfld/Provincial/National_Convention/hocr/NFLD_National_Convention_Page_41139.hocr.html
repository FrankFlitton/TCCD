               Mr. Chairman, I have shown that unless our 
               <br />
               accumulated surplus, consisting of some $ 16 mil- 
               <br />

               to dollars, we would only have around $4 million 
               <br />
               left to ﬁnish these hospitals, extend our road 
               <br />
               system and perform other necessary capital 
               <br />
               expenditure. The completion of these buildings, 
               <br />
               like the sanatorium at Corner Brook as well as the 
               <br />
               ﬁnishing of the St. John’s General Hospital and 
               <br />
               other institutions will take at least another $3 
               <br />
               million. Therefore we would only have $1 mil~ 
               <br />
               lion available for road expansion.

               Under the programme outlined in the Eco- 
               <br />
               nomic Report, we forecast an annual expenditure 
               <br />
               which includes $1.5 million for roads and general 
               <br />
               public works —— a total of $5.5 million. That 
               <br />
               represented a cut in this particular department of 
               <br />
               around $3 million. These cuts were made up of 
               <br />
               the elimination of any deﬁcit on the Gander 
               <br />
               operations, together with capital expenditures 
               <br />
               there, amounting to $1.15 million. Another $1.75 
               <br />
               million was taken from the vote covering the 
               <br />
               construction of new buildings and hospitals, as it 
               <br />
               was our idea to complete these institutions from 
               <br />
               our present accumulated surplus, or if we had 
               <br />
               acquired more surplus than our anticipated $5 
               <br />
               million, we could have continued the construc— 
               <br />
               tion and allowed the accumulated surplus to 
               <br />
               remain intact, to be used, as we pointed out, only 
               <br />
               in case of great national emergency. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, therefore, has eliminated any re- 
               <br />
               quirements for new road construction or the fur- 
               <br />
               ther expansion of buildings, which, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, should require between the two, not less 
               <br />
               than $2 million yearly. Therefore, I suggest that 
               <br />
               the vote under the heading of the Department of 
               <br />
               Public Works should not be less than $4 million

               curtailment of our educational system, we would 
               <br />
               find that salaries of our teachers, long overdue for

               Mr. Chairman, I have made a brief survey of 
               <br />
               the four main departments of government which 
               <br />

               <br />
               propose to give what in my opinion would be the 
               <br />
               necessary monies to administer the affairs of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland under a provincial government. I 
               <br />
               give these expenditures under the various head- 
               <br />
               ings as follows:*

               <br />
               Newfoundland as a province of Canada would be 
               <br />
