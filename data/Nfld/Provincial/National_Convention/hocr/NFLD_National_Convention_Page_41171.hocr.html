               <br />
               November to 12 December, 1947. I did not par- 
               <br />
               ticipate to any great extent in that debate, for I 
               <br />
               realised the magnitude of its implications, and I 
               <br />
               confess I felt rather at a loss as it muddled through 
               <br />
               the weeks before Christmas. I, for the most part, 
               <br />
               sat and listened to the by-play between certain 
               <br />
               speakers; and day after day I made notes on 
               <br />
               certain aspects of the debate as the House strug- 
               <br />
               gled slowly through the documents.

               I do not intend to deal with each of the 23 
               <br />
               clauses; many of them I shall only brieﬂy refer 
               <br />
               to, for if some members here do not realise their

               Clause 2. “The Province of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will include the territory of Labrador deﬁned by 
               <br />
               the award of the Judicial Committee of the Privy 
               <br />
               Council in 1927 as Newfoundland territory.” 
               <br />
               This clause has raised quite a storm, and that it 
               <br />
               will continue to do so is inevitable. We must be 
               <br />
               realistic on this question; we must face up to it. 
               <br />
               These arrangements, the Canadian government 
               <br />
               calls them, are supposed to be a “fair and equi- 
               <br />
               table basis” for our entry into the Canadian con- 
               <br />
               federation. We have heard it described as a 
               <br />
               federation of nine self-goveming provinces with 
               <br />
               a central government set above them all. We have 
               <br />
               not heard it referred to here as a hybrid nation, 
               <br />
               which it is; for Canada is not one nation, but two. 
               <br />
               Canada is English and Canada is French; and if 
               <br />
               we don’t recognise the difference, others do.... It 
               <br />
               is now almost a proverb that unless the present 
               <br />
               trend is not altered considerably, “Ontario or 
               <br />

               the Privy Council in some not too distant day

               <br />
               dominions are each year becoming more and

               <br />
               of the dominions are now Canadian or Australian 
               <br />
               citizens, etc., not “British subjects”. In time the 
               <br />
               supreme courts of the dominions will no'doubt

               become the highest courts of law, the highest 
               <br />
               tribunals of these dominions.... What then? 
               <br />
               Should the Supreme Court of Canada become the 
               <br />
               highest tribunal of the Dominion of Canada, su- 
               <br />
               perseding the Privy Council, what is there to 
               <br />
               prevent Quebec appealing to that new tribunal, 
               <br />
               and in the light of present events, receiving a 
               <br />

               <br />
               part? That is one aspect that has not been touched 
               <br />
               upon at all, and I draw it to members’ attention, 
               <br />
               and to the attention of the country as well. This,

               <br />
               the ﬁrst eight years of union would be in such a 
               <br />
