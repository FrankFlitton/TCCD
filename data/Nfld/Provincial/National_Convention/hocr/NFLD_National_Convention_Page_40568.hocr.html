               the bases agreement — a 99 year lease. when it

               There is one other point I want to make, and 
               <br />
               that’s in the Labrador report of the Mining Com- 
               <br />
               mittee, page 12. It was referred to by Mr. Fudge 
               <br />
               the other day, and it says: “Negotiations over the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland-Canada boundary between 
               <br />
               Labrador and Quebec have begun between the 
               <br />
               Canadian and Newfoundland governments and it 
               <br />
               is possible that the actual delimiting of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bound</span> 
               <br />
               ary on the ground may begin in 1947." I always 
               <br />
               had the impression that the boundary was set. Of 
               <br />
               course, it was pointed out the other day that the 
               <br />
               exact lines might not be known, it was the water- 
               <br />

               <br />
               might wake up to ﬁnd we don’t own as much of 
               <br />

               the Newfoundland government, when it goes into 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I think I was the 
               <br />
               one who brought out the fact here that the rate of 
               <br />
               tax paid in the Province of Quebec on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water~</span> 
               <br />
               power is $1 per horsepower. Since then there has 
               <br />
               been quite a bit of discussion in the Convention 
               <br />
               about that question of the l5 cents per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">horse</span> 
               <br />
               power that the government has agreed to accept, 
               <br />
               as against the dollar that we think they ought to 
               <br />
               get, in line with the rate that the Quebec govem— 
               <br />

               <br />
               out that there is some doubt as to where the town 
               <br />

               possibly do anything other than agree with a

               deposits in the area ~— Quebec area and New- 
               <br />

               the greatest distance between all deposits, up to 
               <br />
               now, is 100 miles. Mr. Howse is of the opinion 
               <br />
               that there will not be one main town, but several 
               <br />
               small towns. As far as the Mining Committee is
