               <br />
               fully. They say they can save $750,000. That is 
               <br />
               the only point upon which I must agree with my 
               <br />
               friend from Bonavista Centre, that I can’t agree 
               <br />
               on the information which we received when we 
               <br />
               were in London. I believe, and it was intimated, 
               <br />
               that if the deﬁcit was $750,000 we would have to 
               <br />
               pay $250,000 and Great Britain would have to 
               <br />
               pay the rest. I can see I think Major Cashin’s 
               <br />
               point. How is Great Britain going to pay that? 
               <br />
               How can she send us over the dollars? Where is 
               <br />
               she going to get the dollars? Evidently we will 
               <br />
               have to supply the dollars for the time being 
               <br />
               anyway, and I suspect that is what he had in his 
               <br />
               mind. Anyway, they ﬁgure out that there will be 
               <br />
               a total saving of $3 million, and it looks to me 
               <br />
               quite sound. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then they come on to the proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expendiv</span> 
               <br />
               ture of $25 million... And then they logically go 
               <br />
               on and ask themselves, “Where are we going to 
               <br />
               get the money to pay for this?” And they quote 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194041</span> revenue ——— $16.25 million — and 
               <br />
               they tell us that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194647</span> it amounts to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$27.25</span> 
               <br />
               million, and that the indications were that for this 
               <br />
               year, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194748,</span> the revenues would come close to 
               <br />
               the staggering amount of $40 million. Then, 
               <br />
               having decided that, they take a very realistic 
               <br />
               view of the industries in this country. They refer 
               <br />
               to the value of the pulp and paper industry and 
               <br />
               refer to the proposed expansion in the Comer 
               <br />
               Brook area, and generally they say that the pulp 
               <br />
               and paper industry in Newfoundland is tops. 
               <br />
               They also refer, which I think does not concern 
               <br />
               this report, to the possibilities of the pulp and 
               <br />
               paper industry in the Labrador area; I think I must 
               <br />
               touch upon this matter although 1 cannot see that 
               <br />
               the revenues will derive any beneﬁt therefrom in 
               <br />
               the three year period which they forecast.... When 
               <br />
               we think of the possibilities of a new paper or 
               <br />
               sulphite mill in Labrador, or a new paper mill in 
               <br />
               the Bay d’Espoir area, and the value to the 
               <br />
               workmen, the clergymen, doctors, businessmen 
               <br />
               and everybody, then I think we can take a pretty 
               <br />
               good view of the pulp and paper industry, espe- 
               <br />
               cially in view of the fact that they inform us that 
               <br />
               the Comer Brook and Grand Falls people have 
               <br />
               contracts for the next ten years. Is that correct? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin That’s right.
