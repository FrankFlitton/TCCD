               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, we have a slight

               correction in the bottom of the report. 
               <br />
               Mr. Thomas advises me today by telegram that 
               <br />
               the area leased from the AND Co. is 30 miles 
               <br />
               radius from center of shaft: “We pay running 
               <br />
               rates to AND Co. on 14 mile section of railroad 
               <br />
               from Millertown Junction to Buchans Junction. 
               <br />
               We own 22 mile section of railroad Buchans 
               <br />
               Junction to Millertown Junction." We hope you 
               <br />
               will remember that and make any necessary cor- 
               <br />
               rections yourself. With respect to the question 
               <br />
               that Mr. Fogwill put concerning the Labrador 
               <br />
               report, I have since asked the government 
               <br />
               geologist the position with respect to that $6 
               <br />
               ﬁgure we quoted in our Labrador report, and we 
               <br />
               were informed that that ﬁgure is that quoted by 
               <br />
               the Lake Superior Iron Ore Producers Associa- 
               <br />
               tion. That would be the association of all iron ore 
               <br />
               producers in the Lake Superior district. That is 
               <br />
               the fob. value of Lake Superior ores of 51% 
               <br />
               iron, the iron ore being laid down at Lake Supe- 
               <br />
               rior ports. Mr. Howse informs us that you have 
               <br />
               to ﬁgure into that $6 price the moisture, silica, 
               <br />
               manganese and phosphoms, there is a deduction 
               <br />
               made forthese. As you will rememberthe sulphur 
               <br />
               and phosphorus content of the Bell Island ore is 
               <br />
               quite high in comparison with the Lake Superior 
               <br />
               ore, and that would mean that off that $6 you 
               <br />
               would have to take all those deductions. 
               <br />
               Mr. Howse did not have the time to give me all 
               <br />
               that, but his opinion was that $2.55 is a very fair 
               <br />
               price. That is the figure we submitted in our 
               <br />
               report. Now Mr. Chairman shall we go on to
