               <br />
               wondering if they are talking about the same 
               <br />
               country that my good friend the member for 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre has been telling us about. 
               <br />
               Maybe these Canadians to whom I have been 
               <br />
               talking are all wrong, and maybe they only think 
               <br />
               they are being taxed, and maybe Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               is right, but I am satisﬁed that they can’t both be 
               <br />
               right. That is something you have to decide for 
               <br />
               yourselves. The gentleman for Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               reminds me of a tourist who visits another town 
               <br />
               or country and then comes back and tells the local 
               <br />
               boys of the marvellous sights he has seen, and the 
               <br />
               beautiful things he has encountered, and how 
               <br />
               everything is so much better than in the old home 
               <br />
               town. It reminds me of an old saying, the grass is 
               <br />
               always greener in the other fellow’s yard. 
               <br />

               The good member is like an individual who is 
               <br />
               called a barker, who stands in front of a tent at a 
               <br />
               circus and has a very convincing story to tell you. 
               <br />
               He tells you that for 25 cents, if you will just step 
               <br />
               inside, you will see some wonderful things. I 
               <br />
               don’t mind admitting that I visited Coney Island 
               <br />
               once and I was hypnotised by this barker. [parted 
               <br />
               with 50 cents which I could illafford to spend, but 
               <br />
               which I thought was little for what I was going to 
               <br />
               see. But I don’t mind telling you, and I use a 
               <br />
               common but explicit word, I was a sunken And 
               <br />
               since then I am inclined to be very suspicious of 
               <br />
               any gentleman who says in effect, “Will you walk 
               <br />
               into my parlour, said the spider to the ﬂy.” For- 
               <br />
               tunately for me, I was able to get out of the 
               <br />
               circumstance. But in this instance the tent we are 
               <br />
               invited to enter has no exit, and over the door 
               <br />
               might well be written, “Abandon hope all ye who 
               <br />
               enter here.”

               I want to compliment the gentleman from 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre for the resourcefulness that he 
               <br />
               has shown whenever this subject of Canadian 
               <br />
               taxes has been brought up. In effect he’s brushed 
               <br />
               it of by saying, “Oh don’t worry about this tax, 
               <br />
               don’t worry about that tax, because the federal 
               <br />
               government will pay them for you. It does not 
               <br />
               come out of your pocket at all. It comes out of the 
               <br />
               pocket of the federal government.” The good old 
               <br />
               fairy godmother the federal government, whose 
               <br />
               sole purpose of existing is apparently to throw out 
               <br />
               gratuitously, to all her offspring, including the 
               <br />

               man, that is the picture that the good member for 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre has endeavoured to create in 
               <br />
               the minds of the people. And I believe that he has 
               <br />
               done a very good job. I will now digress a mo- 
               <br />
               ment to pay a tribute to Mr. Smallwood’s ability 
               <br />
               in this respect. I believe if it were possible for that 
               <br />
               gentleman to descend into the inferno that the 
               <br />
               poet Dante speaks about, and then come back 
               <br />
               again and write and distribute his prospectus, I 
               <br />
               am convinced that he would describe that inferno 
               <br />
               in such glowing terms that they would be 
               <br />
               swamped with applications for ringside seats. 
               <br />
               Seriously, Mr. Chairman, while I am on the sub- 
               <br />
               ject, I recommend now that if we do not go into 
               <br />
               confederation, that the member for Bonavista 
               <br />
               Centre be appointed head of our tourist bureau, 
               <br />
               because I think that a man with his imagination 
               <br />
               can write such a glowing account of this country 
               <br />
               that he will bring sufﬁcient tourists here from 
               <br />
               Canada to pay off our national debt, and convince 
               <br />
               even Mr. Smallwood himself that we are self- 
               <br />
               supporting. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               From the Canadian people whom I have met 
               <br />
               and talked with, and there have been many during 
               <br />
               the past year, I know that it is not a dream world 
               <br />
               that Mr. Smallwood would have us believe. It has 
               <br />
               a bright side and a dark side and I think I might 
               <br />
               glance at a few figures. Canada’s population in 
               <br />
               the last census, 1941, was 11.5 million. Most 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders have a hazy idea that if we 
               <br />
               would join Canada we would be joining up with 
               <br />
               much the same kind of people as we have in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, that is English, Irish, and Scotch 
               <br />
               descendants. If you think mat, you are wrong. 
               <br />
               Fifty percent of all Canada’s population are of 
               <br />
               English, Irish and Scotch descents, and the other 
               <br />
               ﬁfty are French, Polish, Russian, Italian, and so 
               <br />
               on. So that we would be really joining a foreign 
               <br />
               power, in more ways than one. And if in the years 
               <br />
               ahead the foreign population outgrows the people 
               <br />
               of the British Isles, which could happen, and 
               <br />
               these people take charge of Canada, a lot of 
               <br />
               trouble that we never dreamed about we could be 
               <br />
               letting ourselves and our descendants in for. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Have you looked up the landed 
               <br />
               immigrants in the USA? 
               <br />
