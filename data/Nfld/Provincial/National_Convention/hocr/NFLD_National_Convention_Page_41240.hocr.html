               Above everything else, what’s wrong with our 
               <br />
               country is the fact that we have persisted and 
               <br />
               insisted on acting as though we were a nation, or 
               <br />
               as though we thought we could be a nation. 
               <br />
               Whereas the fact is we’re only a large family. 
               <br />
               Most of our trouble stems from that misguided 
               <br />
               policy. Sir, you could bring Winston Churchill 
               <br />
               and Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison to New— 
               <br />
               foundland, and along with them Mackenzie King 
               <br />
               and Franklin D. Roosevelt if he were alive, and 
               <br />
               Lloyd George too if he were alive, and you could 
               <br />
               put those men at the head of affairs in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span>

               <br />
               best would not be good enough. They would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fail.</span> 
               <br />
               They would be licked before they started, be- 
               <br />
               cause it’s impossible to make things right for the 
               <br />
               people of this country so long as we hold out 
               <br />
               stubbornly against the one thing that can make a 
               <br />
               prosperous Newfoundland really possible. They 
               <br />
               would fail so long as they tried to run New— 
               <br />
               foundland as a separate independent country 
               <br />
               pretending that it was a nation. They would fail 
               <br />
               so long as they failed to link Newfoundland onto 
               <br />
               a much greater, at much larger, a much more 
               <br />
               stable unit. That’s the ﬁrst lesson we all need to 
               <br />
               learn when we come to ﬁgure what’s wrong with 
               <br />
               our country and what the cure might be. To stay 
               <br />
               isolated from the great continent besides which 
               <br />
               God placed us, to persist in a mistaken and hope- 
               <br />
               less independence, to continue our vain hope of 
               <br />
               paddling our own canoe, that way has produced 
               <br />
               untold misery for our people and will produce 
               <br />
               more misery if we don’t wake up to our mistake. 
               <br />
               And it is also needless, Mr. Chairman, so need— 
               <br />
               less. A great British nation is asked by us, asked 
               <br />
               by this Convention, to receive a delegation. They 
               <br />
               received the delegation, and they say, “We invite 
               <br />
               you to link up with us to make one great strong 
               <br />
               British nation stretching all the way from St. 
               <br />
               John’s to Vancouver.” And what do we do? What 
               <br />
               do we do? We look suspiciously at them. We 
               <br />
               thought it was a land full ointlers, Hitlers trying 
               <br />
               to gobble us up, trying to rob us of our little store 
               <br />
               of natural resources, trying to get rich out of us. 
               <br />
               We pick holes in the terms and conditions they 
               <br />
               offer us. The moment we receive their invitation 
               <br />
               to join up with them, we get suspicious and put 
               <br />

               up every tmmpery excuse we can think of for not 
               <br />
               accepting. Yes, by all means let us have national

               pride, but let us also have national common 
               <br />
               sense. Now, sir, I turn to Mr. Northcott. Just two 
               <br />
               points. He tells us he wants out Newfoundland 
               <br />
               people to know how the burden of taxes under 
               <br />
               confederation would compare with our burden of 
               <br />
               taxes today. He asks the question, “Would 
               <br />
               federal, provincial and town council taxes all put 
               <br />
               together he more or less than we’re paying out 
               <br />
               now in taxes?" That’s a very fair question -— a 
               <br />
               very practical question and a very useful ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and I thank Mr. Northcott for asking it. 
               <br />
               Today our taxes amount to about $40 million a 
               <br />
               year, not counting municipal or town council 
               <br />
               taxes. That’s what we’re paying the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government, $40 million a year. Under con- 
               <br />
               federation we would pay taxes to both the federal 
               <br />
               government of Canada and the provincial 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland. What would these 
               <br />
               amount to? That’s what Mr. Northcott wants the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to know. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern</span> 
               <br />
               ment of Canada estimates that they would collect 
               <br />
               $20 million a year proﬁts in federal taxes. That is 
               <br />
               if the present rates of taxation continue as they 
               <br />
               are in Canada, if they don’t fall and if the 
               <br />
               present level of economic activity stays as it is 
               <br />
               now in Newfoundland. Very few of us expect it 
               <br />
               to do that, for already it has started to drop. $20 
               <br />
               million, the Government of Canada would take. 
               <br />
               The provincial government of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would collect $5 million or $6 million a year from 
               <br />
               us in taxes. At least it would for the ﬁrst eight 
               <br />
               years of union. Well, that’s a total of say $26 
               <br />
               million a year between the two governments. Mr. 
               <br />
               Northcott can add to that if he likes. He can add 
               <br />
               a couple of million to the provincial budget and 
               <br />
               he can add a couple of million to the federal 
               <br />
               budget and get a grand total of $30 million. Even 
               <br />
               then, our total taxation would fall $10 million 
               <br />
               short of what we’re paying now. We’re paying 
               <br />
               $120 a head to our government now. We’d pay 
               <br />
               at the most $91 a head under confederation, a 
               <br />
               saving of $29 a head. Mr. Northcott may or may 
               <br />
               not be willing to accept my ﬁgures. So I’ll stretch 
               <br />
               the thing all out of shape to see how he’ll like it 
               <br />
               then. Let’s say the Government of Canada are as 
               <br />
               much as 50% out in their estimate -— 50% out. 
               <br />
               They say they’ll collect $20 million from us. Let 
               <br />
               us say they’ll collect $30 million from us. I say 
               <br />
               the provincial government will collect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">35-6</span> mil-
