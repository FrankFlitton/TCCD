               of all our little petty differences, when the mother 
               <br />
               country was in trouble we immediately donned 
               <br />
               our uniforms and rushed to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colours,</span> We are 
               <br />
               also conscious of our very close friendship with 
               <br />
               the United States. That is an undeniable fact. In 
               <br />
               fact we see Canada, Newfoundland and the 
               <br />
               USA ﬂirting so closely that many times we feel 
               <br />
               perhaps that they should get married; yet down 
               <br />
               deep in our inner consciousness is that longing 
               <br />
               for freedom, the longing to cement even closer 
               <br />
               our relationship with Great Britain. I cannot see 
               <br />
               eye to eye with many of the things that have been 
               <br />
               said. I spent, during the two wars, something over 
               <br />
               seven years in the Paciﬁc, around the British 
               <br />
               coast and in various parts of Britain. I have never 
               <br />
               yet been able to ﬁnd a word that I could say in 
               <br />
               disrespect of the British people. I know that our 
               <br />
               treatment in 1932-33-34 was not really the wish 
               <br />
               of the British people... It was not the people, but 
               <br />
               the Dominions Office who gave us that treatment. 
               <br />
               It was a handful like that who betrayed Belgium 
               <br />
               and France... I want to see this National Conven~ 
               <br />
               tion uphold the principle that the mother country 
               <br />
               and the Union Jack have stood for for so long... 
               <br />
               Since I have come in here today I have worded 
               <br />
               an amendment to the motion. It is along the lines 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrr</span> Butt suggested in the early part of the 
               <br />
               debate: “That, in view of the fact that a delegation 
               <br />
               is about to proceed to the United Kingdom to 
               <br />
               ascertain what the mother country is prepared to 
               <br />
               do, no further discussion should take place on this 
               <br />
               resolution until the delegation returns and its 
               <br />
               results are discussed.” I think that in all fairness, 
               <br />
               with that consciousness in our hearts that the 
               <br />
               mother country has stood up for us at all times, 
               <br />
               that we should give her the last chance of giving 
               <br />
               our delegation the proper information and proof 
               <br />
               in realistic terms, that they still stand behind 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, as Britain’s oldest colony, and 
               <br />
               that they are prepared to liquidate our national 
               <br />
               debt for the blood we have given to protect the 
               <br />
               British Isles. We were told repeatedly over there 
               <br />
               that if it had not been for the colonial troops the 
               <br />
               mother country would have gone under...

               out what I could do for my country. As far as I

               can see, we have been given instructions in this

               by a constitutional expert from Great Britain that 
               <br />
