               Mr Chairman It could be two separate motions, 
               <br />
               but by that change it is immaterial.... One is just 
               <br />
               that you do now receive, and the other is that on

               tomorrow the motion will be made to resolve the

               Mr. Higgins I suggest that it might be better to 
               <br />
               have two separate motions in the matter, rather 
               <br />
               than have this in the double-barrelled form that it 
               <br />
               is now.

               Mr. Bradley I don’t see that there could be any
