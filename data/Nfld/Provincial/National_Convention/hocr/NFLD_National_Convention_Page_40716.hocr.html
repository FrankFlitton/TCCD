               Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, I want to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks on this Economic Report, and I dare say 
               <br />
               that people will be curious to know why my 
               <br />
               signature is not appended to it. Perhaps they will 
               <br />
               be disappointed when I tell them that, in the main, 
               <br />
               I was in favOur of the winding—up part of the 
               <br />
               report. I believe that the country is self-support- 
               <br />
               ing. I did not sign the report for two or three 
               <br />
               reasons. The ﬁrst was that I thought it was not 
               <br />
               necessary to introduce a budget. One can quite 
               <br />
               understand the inclination of Major Cashin to 
               <br />
               introduce this report on the basis of a budget, and 
               <br />
               as any ﬁnance minister would have introduced it 
               <br />
               in a house of parliament. I think we can also 
               <br />
               understand why Mr. Smallwood, who might be 
               <br />
               termed “the Leader of the Opposition", thought 
               <br />
               it his duty to tear it to pieces. His tearing of it to 
               <br />
               pieces was a matter of opinion, whether it was 
               <br />
               effective or not. I don’t think it was very effec- 
               <br />
               tive. I would like to express my approval of the 
               <br />
               conclusions of the report, and I don’t want to 
               <br />
               enter into a discussion of the details. I think the 
               <br />
               report was written in a very racy, very readable 
               <br />
               way, and presented in a very interesting form. On

               the other hand I don’t hesitate to say that the 
               <br />
               estimates can be only regarded as guesswork. 
               <br />
               Estimates generally are. There is no reason, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, why $35 million or $25 million, or $40 
               <br />
               million should not have been taken as the prob- 
               <br />
               able revenue, instead of $30 million. However, 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures as they are in the report are pretty 
               <br />
               good, and it is the interpretation that counts. 
               <br />
               There is only one discrepancy that I can really 
               <br />
               point to in the ﬁgures, and it is not done with a 
               <br />
               view to criticism, because I don’t think it matters 
               <br />
               very much. Life insurance values are put down as 
               <br />
               $30 million as the surrender value.
