               and so have the people of 20 other places. Now

               <br />
               does these things for their people, but where do 
               <br />
               they get the money? Well, we know that the

               government of the country, to encourage people 
               <br />
               to form the town councils, to encourage them, the 
               <br />
               government has been helping these town councils 
               <br />
               ﬁnancially, giving them money and lending them 
               <br />
               money, but in all these towns where they have 
               <br />
               town councils they have the property <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax....</span> As 
               <br />
               you study the ﬁnancial statements of the various 
               <br />
               town councils what do you find? You ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               already, here in our own little Newfoundland, we 
               <br />
               have the property tax.... Now these town councils 
               <br />
               collect that property tax, so much per head and so 
               <br />
               much per family, for what? To give it to the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government? No. To spend it in 
               <br />
               their own community, and for conveniences and 
               <br />
               improvements and comforts that they can’t very 
               <br />
               well expect anyone else to give them. Now if we 
               <br />
               had confederation any community in New- 
               <br />
               foundland that wishes to form a town council is 
               <br />
               permitted to do it. That is the way it is now. We 
               <br />
               have not got confederation. Today if the people 
               <br />
               of any community decide to have a town council 
               <br />
               they go right ahead and have it. Of course in 
               <br />
               having it they have got to follow the law of the 
               <br />
               land. You can’t form a town council like that!

               Government Ofﬁcer, and the government passed 
               <br />
               a law, and these town councils are formed under 
               <br />
               that law, and that law tells them what they can do 
               <br />
               and what they can't do. Any community in New- 
               <br />
               foundland can go right ahead and form that town 
               <br />
               council. That is the way it is now without con-

               could speak, I did however point out, and I again 
               <br />
               reiterate, that in view of the fact that you have 
               <br />
               addressed yourself on this matter a number of 
               <br />
               times it is my right to intervene if you indulge in 
               <br />
               unnecessary or tedious repetition, andI asked that 
               <br />
               your reply to Mr. Hollett should be as brief as 
               <br />
               possible, and your remarks should be conﬁned to

               and not to indulge in anything which may be 
               <br />
               fairly regarded as tedious repetition, because if 
               <br />
               my attention is drawn to it I will have to rule you
