               Mr. Ashbourne There is another point too that 
               <br />
               should not be overlooked, that is the stimulus 
               <br />
               that’s given to the ﬁsherman as he gets up in the 
               <br />
               morning and goes out realising that for his day‘s 
               <br />
               catch of codﬁsh, before the evening sun sets, he 
               <br />
               will have the money in his pocket. That’s a very 
               <br />
               important thing, and I am rather of the opinion 
               <br />
               that the great production of fresh and frozen ﬁsh 
               <br />
               that’s been made in Newfoundland the past few 
               <br />
               years has been practically the result of the fact 
               <br />
               that cash has been paid for fresh ﬁsh. 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney Many delegates are going out for a 
               <br />
               rest and it almost looks as if we are getting tired 
               <br />
               of this informative debate and that it ought to be 
               <br />
               soon ended in order to move on to another sec- 
               <br />
               tion. Before we do, I would like to say that to me 
               <br />
               the Fishery Board as constituted today is one of 
               <br />
               the bright sides in the marketing and control of 
               <br />
               the ﬁshery products of Newfoundland. The per- 
               <br />
               sonnel are doing a ﬁne job, and one of the persons 
               <br />
               who had perhaps a great deal to do initially with 
               <br />
               that great undertaking is Mr. Brown. I am sorry 
               <br />
               he is unable to see the job through, at least in the 
               <br />
               House. The ﬁshermen over across our way are 
               <br />
               very pleased and satisﬁed that things are going 
               <br />
               so well. I congratulate the members of the Fishery 
               <br />
               Committee who so far are giving us a ﬁne report 
               <br />
               and doing a good job. 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Before the Convention passes on 
               <br />
               to another section I have some information which 
               <br />
               I think the Convention should have. It has to do 
               <br />
               with the export of ﬁsh. I just checked with the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Fisheries Board, and the informa- 
               <br />
               tion I have is as follows: 
               <br />
               This guaranteed system was discontinued in 
               <br />
               1941. The price has gone up and there is no 
               <br />
               further guarantee in that respect. In 1943 the 
               <br />
               Combined Food Board allocated all the 
               <br />
               world’s supplies of salt codﬁsh and under 
               <br />
               that allocation system certain prices were 
               <br />
               agreed on, and when these export schedules 
               <br />
               were established the exporters and ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               in this country met and agreed on prices. 
               <br />
               These were minimum prices, and they could 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 934 184 1470 1870">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               pay more if they so desired. In 1944 the same 
               <br />
               procedure was followed. The price repre- 
               <br />
               sented some increase on the 1943 price. In 
               <br />
               1945 the exporters and ﬁshermen did not 
               <br />
               come to an agreement. Apparently they felt 
               <br />
               that competition would take care of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provid»</span> 
               <br />
               ing a good price. Apparently it did, and the 
               <br />
               same story was true in 1946. No agreed to, or 
               <br />
               set price was determined by a meeting of 
               <br />
               exporters and ﬁshermen, but the price ran 
               <br />
               higher than in 1945. Incidentally for 1946 the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen may have further saltﬁsh cuts. 
               <br />
               That seems to be the story. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood In 1938-39 the government 
               <br />
               guaranteed the merchants a certain export price 
               <br />
               on small Madeira and Brazil, and on Labrador 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. It is a remarkable fact that for that very year 
               <br />
               the total value of codﬁsh exported from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland was only $4,190,000, which was less 
               <br />
               than the year before that, when the catch was 
               <br />
               bigger. That’s an average of only roughly $4 per 
               <br />
               quintal.... Now in the following year, that would 
               <br />
               be 1940, they guaranteed all did they? 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Correct. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood So the exporters are naturally 
               <br />
               paying a bit ﬁrmer price to the ﬁshermen, but in 
               <br />
               that year the catch was 1,208,000 quintals, and 
               <br />
               the value was up to $6.5 million. I can’t make that 
               <br />
               up in my mind just now, but it’s a bit more; but 
               <br />
               1940 was surely the ﬁrst year of the great world 
               <br />
               up-swing of prices. The war broke out in 1939, 
               <br />
               but we did at least sell the fish in spite of the 
               <br />
               exchange trouble. What was the position in 
               <br />
               1941? 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Apparently the guarantee system 
               <br />
               was in existence up to a certain time in 1941, at 
               <br />
               which time it was discontinued. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood 750,000 quintals. Now in 1942 
               <br />
               the price jumped to $9.25 million, and the next 
               <br />
               year $12.5 million, and the next year $13.25 
               <br />
               million and 1945 $16.75 million, that is of course 
               <br />
               when the Combined Food Board was controlling 
               <br />
               all the prices was it not? 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Yes. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The total export value was 
               <br />
               1,097,700 quintals <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—~</span> over $17.25 million. That 
               <br />
               year, 1946, did the Combined Food Board have 
               <br />
               anything to do with it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Croshie Yes. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood When did the Combined Food 
               <br />
               Board’s control over Newfoundland come to an 
               <br />
