               my learned friend, Mr. Higgins, and in doing so 
               <br />

               First of all, I believe in responsible govem— 
               <br />
               ment, I know it must be right in principle, and I 
               <br />
               believe it can be made to work in practice. It is 
               <br />
               now, and always has been the goal of civilised 
               <br />
               humanity. All down through the ages, men have 
               <br />
               struggled to achieve and maintain their indepen— 
               <br />
               dence. Twice in our time we have seen the 
               <br />
               freedom—loving nations of the world wage inter— 
               <br />
               necine war in defence of the very principles em- 
               <br />
               bodied in responsible government, and it is not 
               <br />
               necessary for me to remind you that New- 
               <br />
               foundland acquitted herself nobly and well on 
               <br />
               both occasions. Therefore, gentlemen, the innate 
               <br />
               desire for self-government ﬁnds its roots in the 
               <br />
               natural aspirations of the human mind toward 
               <br />
               independence. The Burmese have it. The Hindus 
               <br />
               and Moslems of India have it. The largely il- 
               <br />
               literate coloured folk of Jamaica have it. Surely 
               <br />
               it must also lurk in the souls of the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, who ﬁrst won autonomy when

               <br />
               reminded us on Monday. Gentlemen, in my 
               <br />
               opinion responsible government is the proper 
               <br />
               course for an independent people to take. That 
               <br />
               does not mean cutting ourselves adrift from the 
               <br />
               world, as some of you would have us believe. 0n 
               <br />
               the contrary, it affords us greater opportunity, it 
               <br />
               gives us a free hand to conclude arrangements 
               <br />
               with any country, should the opportunity present 
               <br />
               itself. And to those who desire a closer relation- 
               <br />
               ship with the United States, it must be evident that 
               <br />
               responsible government is the only means of 
               <br />
               attaining that end.

               Mr. Chairman, thousands of young New~ 
               <br />
               foundlanders, on whom will shortly be placed the 
               <br />
               responsibility of determining our future form of 
               <br />
               government, like myself have no personal recol- 
               <br />
               lection of responsible government in this 
               <br />
               country. For I will remind you that nobody in this 
               <br />
               country under 35 years of age ever had the 
               <br />
               privilege of marking a ballot to determine the 
               <br />
               conduct of the affairs of their country. And that 
               <br />
               is why so many are inclined to accept as true the 
               <br />
               hearsay that corrupt and incompetent govern- 
               <br />
               ments caused the ﬁnancial debacle of the early 
               <br />
               thirties. They do not realise that it was mainly due 
               <br />
               to the condition of the time brought about by 
               <br />
               external circumstances over which our govem— 
               <br />
               ment had no control. The entire world was 
               <br />
               plunged into the direst depression it had ever 
               <br />
               known, Britain herself went through the gravest 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial crisis in her history, and millions went 
               <br />
               on the unemployment rolls in Canada and the 
               <br />
               United States. Confusion reigned everywhere, 
               <br />
               people lost faith in everything and governments 
               <br />
               became the principal scapegoats, and thus were 
               <br />
               sown the seeds that today bear fruit in the unjust 
               <br />
               condemnation of responsible government. Let 
               <br />
               me remind the apostles of Commission of 
               <br />
               Government that when it assumed power on that 
               <br />
               bleak February day in 1934, with all its ingenuity 
               <br />
               and skill in the art of tax extraction, it could ﬁnd 
               <br />
               nothing better for our people than six cents a day 
               <br />
               dole for five long years, and an annual deficit —— 
               <br />
               which, by the way, they did not have to worry 
               <br />
               about. This should prove beyond reasonable 
               <br />
               doubt that there was more wrong at that time than 
               <br />
               the form of government. It is evident that the 
               <br />
               change to Commission did nothing to improve 
               <br />
               our condition until the beginning of the war, 
               <br />
