               All right, we have a quorum <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again,</span> Now, I will 
               <br />
               give you an example of how a country that is a 
               <br />
               federal union rather than a unitary state can have 
               <br />
               its serious disagreements. its squabbles, its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weak«</span> 
               <br />
               nesses, and yet be a great country. Let us take 
               <br />
               United States as an example. There you have had, 
               <br />
               since the days of Thomas Jefferson, a continuing 
               <br />
               dispute over the question of states’ rights... That 
               <br />
               has rent the United States on more than one 
               <br />
               occasion. Then again, you have the great question 
               <br />
               of child labour. They have not got a federal law 
               <br />
               in the United States forbidding child labour, and 
               <br />
               you get young children working in mills and 
               <br />
               factories, because there is no American law for 
               <br />
               the whole nation that forbids it. In the individual 
               <br />
               states they do have their own state law, but be- 
               <br />
               cause of this dispute they still can’t get a federal 
               <br />
               law to forbid child labour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generally,</span> 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then again in the United States you have the 
               <br />
               racial question, the negro question. You know, 
               <br />
               the whole world knows. and has been shocked by 
               <br />
               the trouble caused in the United States by this 
               <br />
               question of the negro. We know the stories of 
               <br />
               lynchings, and miscarriages of justice, of the Jim 
               <br />
               Crow policy, of the way the negro is treated. And 
               <br />
               you have anti-semitism in the United States. The 
               <br />
               country is made up of all kinds of nationalities, 
               <br />
               and again you always have trouble coming for 
               <br />
               that cause. We know the story of the Ku Klux 
               <br />
               Klan, and we know that all these and similar 
               <br />
               troubles ended in the United States with a civil 
               <br />
               war, and yet...

               Mr. Hollett My point is that the remarks are 
               <br />
               irrelevant... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Except insofar as he intends to 
               <br />
               show that arising out of your statement that the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada is united in war but dis- 
               <br />
               united in peace, disunity on questions of national 
               <br />
               importance is not conﬁned to Canada alone. But 
               <br />
               I quite agree with you, I think, Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               that you are getting a little bit far aﬁeld, and I 
               <br />
               would like you to come back. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, sir, I was just about to 
               <br />
               elew up on that one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point...</span> To reply thoroughly 
               <br />
               and adequately to Mr. Hollett it would be neces- 
               <br />
               sary to speak for about two or three days, which 
               <br />
               Ihave not got time to do, and in fact the House is 
               <br />
               adjouming this afternoon. 30 to sum up that one 
               <br />
               point, while it is perfectly true that there are 
               <br />
               differences of opinion in Canada between one 
               <br />
               province and another province. or between two 
               <br />
               or more provinces on the one hand and the federal 
               <br />
               government on the other, so you have it in the 
               <br />
               United States, Australia, South Africa, and 
               <br />
               wherever you have a federal union. Nothing 
               <br />
               surprising about it. You might only describe it as 
               <br />
               the growing pains of a great nation, and Canada 
               <br />
               is one of the great nations of this world today. 
               <br />
               Yesterday Mr. Hollett made this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remark,</span> l 
               <br />
               jetted it down. I don’t guarantee that it’s the 
               <br />
               identical words he used because I don’t write 
               <br />
               shorthand, but he said that if we become a 
               <br />
               province of Canada, everything we import into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland which is not imported from 
               <br />
               Canada, we will have to pay duty on. Well, [don’t 
               <br />
               know if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hollett has taken the trouble to look 
               <br />
               through the tariff of the Government of Canada... 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Ihave. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well ifhe has, sir, l say that a 
               <br />
               lie is something said intending to deceive, know- 
               <br />
               ing that it is a lie and untrue, and ifa man knows 
               <br />
               it is untrue and then says it, it becomes a lie. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Irise to a point of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">order,</span> Is that man 
               <br />
               insinuating that I am a liar? If so I want him to 
               <br />
               take it back. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I was hinting that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If you have made that state- 
               <br />
               ment, Mr. Smallwood, I must ask you to 
               <br />
               withdraw it.... He must be presumed to be honest 
               <br />
               in the expression of his opinion for the same 
               <br />
               reason, Mr. Smallwood, that you must be

               presumed to be honest in the expression of your 
               <br />
