               <br />
               when I look at this particular item which they will 
               <br />
               collect in personal income tax from the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland -— $3.2 million. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               say they collected in personal income tax that 
               <br />
               much last year, on our rates. In other words, a 
               <br />
               single man earning $1,000 before he pays any 
               <br />
               income tax whatsoever in Newfoundland. After 
               <br />
               he passes $1,000, he pays 9%. A married man 
               <br />
               with no dependents but his wife can earn $2,000 
               <br />
               before he pays income tax. In connection with 
               <br />
               that, I would refer you to page 153, volume 2 of 
               <br />
               the Black Book, to show you how ridiculous that 
               <br />
               amount of $3.2 million might be. A single man 
               <br />
               pays income tax if he earns $750. Also he has to 
               <br />
               pay 8% sales tax on practically everything he 
               <br />
               buys in Canada. More than that, if he has to buy 
               <br />
               a present for his girl friend, he has to pay luxury 
               <br />
               tax.

               Mr. Smallwood You are quoting ﬁgures on the

               Mr. Hollett I said I would take the single men 
               <br />
               first. I am thinking mostly at the moment of our 
               <br />
               fishermen who fish out of Harbour Breton, 
               <br />
               English Harbour and Burin; the loggers who cut 
               <br />
               down the trees; the miners who dig out the ore; 
               <br />
               our paperworkers in paper mills. We have a lot 
               <br />
               of young men who came back from overseas who 
               <br />
               are in these income tax brackets. For instance this 
               <br />
               $1500; we had ﬁshermen who earned as high as 
               <br />
               $2,200 in Fortune Harbour. Those ﬁshermen in 
               <br />
               Harbour Breton or Burin will pay $264 in 
               <br />
               Canada, whereas here in Newfoundland he will 
               <br />
               pay $110. On top of that also, he pays 8% sales 
               <br />
               tax on practically everything he buys and 25% 
               <br />
               luxury tax. $2100 or $2200 or $2400 — we have 
               <br />
               a lot of people in this country earning $2400; a 
               <br />
               surprising number. In the industrial towns of 
               <br />
               Grand Falls and Comer Brook, 21 great many 
               <br />
               Banking ﬁshermen, over on Bell Island there is 
               <br />
               an average of $1,600 or $1,800. That was worked 
               <br />
               out by the Mining Committee. We can go back to 
               <br />
               $2,200; on that he pays $264 in Canada if we 
               <br />
               become a province; whereas at the moment he 
               <br />
               pays $110. A single man should pay; he has no 
               <br />
               dependents; I grant you that. I also grant you this; 
               <br />
               if he is paying that much more, that is all the more 
               <br />
               reason why this $3.2 million is wrong. Take a 
               <br />
               married man with two dependents; he earns 
               <br />
               $1,980 before he pays any tax, then he pays $20.
