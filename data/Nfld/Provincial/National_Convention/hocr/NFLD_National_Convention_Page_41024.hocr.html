               <br />
               thing applies there as in the General Hospital and 
               <br />
               the Sanatorium. The government, in their present 
               <br />
               estimate, have deducted $17,000 from the

               <br />
               have not got, but I have included the full amount, 
               <br />

               <br />
               tom. That $750,000 is one quarter less than is 
               <br />
               voted in the estimates of the government for the 
               <br />
               present year, and that is deducted because of the 
               <br />
               fact that when family allowances and old age 
               <br />
               pensions are paid to so many, many thousands of 
               <br />
               people in Newfoundland it is a fair assumption 
               <br />
               that the vote for indigent persons will not be the 
               <br />
               $1 million that is in the estimates this year, but 
               <br />
               $250,000 less than that; and I think I am being 
               <br />
               very, very conservative when 1 lop off only 
               <br />
               $250,000, in view of the fact that something like 
               <br />
               $11-12 million will be paid over to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               think we would be justified in lopping off some, 
               <br />
               in view of the many millions of dollars that will 
               <br />
               be spent by the Government of Canada in social 
               <br />
               welfare here in Newfoundland, but I have not 
               <br />
               lopped off any. “Old Age Pensions." The es- 
               <br />
               timate is 10,000 old age pensioners who would 
               <br />
               receive $30 a month. Of that amount $7.50 a 
               <br />
               month would be paid by the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government, and $22.50 a month by the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada. Well, 10,000 old age pensioners 
               <br />
               at the age of 70 and over at $7.50 a month by the

               Government of Newfoundland would be 
               <br />
               $900,000. Now, we have in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               something over 12,000 persons of 70 and over 
               <br />
               who, from the standpoint of age at least, would 
               <br />
               be eligible for the pension, but I estimate that 
               <br />
               2,000 of the 12,000 would probably not be 
               <br />
               eligible because they would not meet the other 
               <br />
               tests, namely their income, so 1 put it at 10,000 
               <br />
               who would be fully eligible for old age pensions, 
               <br />

               Government of Newfoundland would be 
               <br />
               $900,000. “Hospital and other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grants."</span> There is a 
               <br />
               note 6 in addition. It refers to orphanage grants, 
               <br />
               $46,200. That's the full vote that the government 
               <br />
               now gives, but it is to be noted that in addition to 
               <br />
               that $46,000 a year that our government gives 
               <br />
               orphanages, that the orphans themselves would 
               <br />
               receive family allowances. “Maintenance and

               <br />
               $859,000." It is now something over $1 million 
               <br />
               that is voted, but I have lopped off an amount 
               <br />
               from that, one third in fact, on account of the 
               <br />

               sir, I have deducted, according to note 8, 
               <br />
               $100,000 from L-13. The whole vote for that is 
               <br />
               $465,000 the government has voted this year, and 
               <br />
               from that 1 deducted $100,000. making the vote 
               <br />
               therefore $365,500, and the total vote according 
               <br />
               to this estimate, for the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Health and Welfare per year is $5,214,868.

               have added $750,000 for that for the first four
