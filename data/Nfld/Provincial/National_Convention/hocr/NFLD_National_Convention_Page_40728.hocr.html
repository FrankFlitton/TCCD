               Which brings me to the second conclusion, 
               <br />
               “that all the evidence available to us indicates that 
               <br />
               this position of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfvsupport</span> will continue in the 
               <br />
               foreseeable future”. They have defined the 
               <br />
               “foreseeable future” as a three—year period, from 
               <br />
               now to 1950, and have thus gone far beyond the 
               <br />
               ordinary requirements of any ﬁnance minister in 
               <br />
               the presentation of a budget. But that is as it 
               <br />
               should be, for our task is somewhat different, and 
               <br />
               it is as much to instill courage and hope in the 
               <br />
               many faint hearts in our midst, as to prove to the 
               <br />
               country and the world in dollars and cents that

               Newfoundland can afford democracy.

               the merchants own all those savings and life

               that Newfoundland should have a mercantile

               ment. 1 agree with the Committee‘s observation 
               <br />
               that, “It is the foreign airlines that proﬁt through 
               <br />
               the operation of Gander airport, and it is these 
               <br />
               same airlines which should be made responsible 
               <br />
               for any deﬁcits that may accrue in operation.” 
               <br />
               Please let no one stand up and rave about the fact 
               <br />
               that so many Newfoundlanders are getting work 
               <br />
               at Gander. We are all aware of that. It is a good 
               <br />
               thing. But the airport cannot run itself. And it 
               <br />
               costs a lot less for the foreign airlines to run it 
               <br />
               with Newfoundland help than by importing their 
               <br />
               own, which would never be allowed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anyway.</span> 
               <br />
               Incidentally, while speaking of Gander, I should 
               <br />
               like to refer to a statement I made 12 months ago 
               <br />
               — I can hardly believe it —— when the Gander 
               <br />
               airport section of Transportation Committee’s 
               <br />
               report was being debated. In stressing the point 
               <br />
               now made again by the Economic Committee, 
               <br />
               the use of Gander at the expense of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, I said in the heat of debate that Gander 
               <br />
               should have been closed down, if that was the 
               <br />
               best deal die government could make. That was 
               <br />
               not to be taken literally, but the intention was to 
               <br />
               convey my belief that a far better deal could have 
               <br />
               been made out of which Newfoundlanders would 
               <br />
               still have received employment, and that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">addi.</span> 
               <br />
               tion, the country would not have to stand the 
               <br />
               expense of running the airport for the con- 
               <br />
               venience of foreign airlines. The threat of closing 
               <br />
               down this vast airport would have brought the 
               <br />
               airlines to our way of thinking soon enough. The 
               <br />
               implication is, therefore, that no attempt was 
               <br />
               made to strike a better bargain and the conclusion 
               <br />
               reached by me is the same as that of the Economic 
               <br />
               Committee, that the airport was used by the 
               <br />
