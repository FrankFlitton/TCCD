               This Board has resigned and the next thing we

               the utterly ruthless policy of the government. It

               approval of our rulers! It leads to the belief that 
               <br />
               has been expressed that the government does not

               <br />
               in the condition of servitude so that we will not 
               <br />
               get too independent.

               If we refer to the paid personnel of the Tourist

               <br />
               them. They are not paid for working nights, Sun- 
               <br />
               days or holidays; but the Board has been there 
               <br />
               nights, Sundays and holidays. Even the voluntary 
               <br />
               workers have been there on such occasions. It has 
               <br />
               not cost the country anything, because the Tourist

               Board and the paid personnel have been

               <br />
               That is such a rank injustice that I could not let it

               today. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood There are several points about 
               <br />
               tourist travel business that ought to be brought 
               <br />
               out. If an American or Canadian concern comes 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland to start a paper mill or a mine, 
               <br />
               we are all very glad. It means they employ New— 
               <br />
               foundlanders and pay out wages, it circulates 
               <br />
               money. But a paper mill or mine uses up some of 
               <br />
               this country’s natural resources. There is this 
               <br />
               about the tourist trade; money is brought into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland by tourists who come here and 
               <br />
               spend and do not use up any of the natural resour- 
               <br />
               ces. You might also say it is money for not 
               <br />
               exactly nothing; they get pleasure out of our 
               <br />
               climate, our air, out of meeting our people and by 
               <br />
               knocking around the country. Some of them do 
               <br />
               take some salmon and other fish — that is a very 
               <br />
               small diminution of the resources. This Tourist 
               <br />
               Board, as Mr. Higgins said, has been working for 
               <br />
               something like 20 years, absolutely free. When 
               <br />
               the Tourist Board appeared before the Transpor- 
               <br />
               tation Committee I am sure all the members were 
               <br />
               deeply impressed... These hard-headed, practi- 
               <br />
               cal businessmen are not easily impressed with the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial possibilities of anything. We were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im»</span> 
               <br />
               pressed by the great faith these men had in the 
               <br />
               tourist possibilities of Newfoundland. I have 
               <br />
               been a ﬁrm believer that the tourist trade con~ 
               <br />
               stitutes the most promising thing we have in this 
               <br />
               country today. If Newfoundland in 1946 had 
               <br />
               been ready to receive them, Newfoundland could 
               <br />
               have got many, many thousands of the tourists 
               <br />
               who, in this present year, were spending $4 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bil»</span> 
               <br />
               lion on the North American continent. It would 
               <br />
               not take a great many million dollars to bring into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland each year 40,000 — 50,000 
               <br />
               tourists. If 100,000 tourists can be brought into 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia in one year, I feel quite confident 
               <br />
               that we can bring that number of tourists into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland for a fortnight or a month or six 
               <br />
               weeks and some even longer, every summer, it 
               <br />
               can mean $10 million or $15 million of new 
               <br />
               money coming in without costing the country 
               <br />
               anything in the way of its natural resources.
