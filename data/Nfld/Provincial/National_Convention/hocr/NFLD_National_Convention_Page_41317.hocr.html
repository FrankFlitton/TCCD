               This is a portion of the Evening Telegram, for 
               <br />
               Saturday, February 17, 1934. I am not going to 
               <br />
               read what’s in it, but I want to refer to it for just 
               <br />
               a moment as I move on to deal with the motion

               description of the proceedings that went on inside 
               <br />

               <br />
               wondered. Ido not propose to describe that scene, 
               <br />
               which is so familiar to so many of our people, nor

               I wish briefly to summarise the meaning of that

               The new Letters Patent of 1934 suspended the 
               <br />
               Letters Patent of 1876 and 1905, and contained 
               <br />

               sequel to the 1933 Act which declared that when
