               us. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood In the next paragraph it goes on 
               <br />
               to say what the tax is, expiring in 1949. Maybe 
               <br />
               there will be changing that and making a new 
               <br />
               contract. Let me read it out: “The Company pays 
               <br />
               no royalties but instead pays an export tax, and 
               <br />
               under the above mentioned act for the 20 year 
               <br />
               period the export tax payable is (a) on the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               1,000,000 tons or part thereof exported by said 
               <br />
               Company during any one year, 10 cents per ton; 
               <br />
               (b) on iron ore exported by the Company during 
               <br />
               one year in excess of 1,000,000 tons and not 
               <br />
               exceeding a further 500,000, tons the sum of 3 
               <br />
               cents per ton.” ’ 
               <br />
               Now I remember after the general election of 
               <br />
               1928, when Major Cashin was Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance. I remember the great joy, his voice 
               <br />
               literally rang with pleasure, when he got up and 
               <br />
               announced that he had managed to collect 
               <br />
               $48,000. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin You are wrong. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well, what was it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin $136,000. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I think my memory is very 
               <br />
               good. Well, that he had collected $136,000 from 
               <br />
               the Bell Island company in taxes that they ought 
               <br />
               to have paid and had not paid, arrears of taxes that 
               <br />
               the outgoing government had never bothered to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">collect,</span> Major Cashin got it, and then in the fall 
               <br />
               of 1929 and the spring of 1930 they got this new 
               <br />
               act collecting 10 cents a ton on the ﬁrst million 
               <br />
               tons, and 3 cents a ton thereover up to 1.5 million. 
               <br />
               I was not in that government, but I have been 
               <br />
               hearing since 1920 about taxing Bell Island, and 
               <br />
               I know it has been a ﬁlthy story, one of the

               There were unions, I remember leading a 
               <br />
               delegation of the very union you are referring to 
               <br />
               in 1926 before the Monroe cabinet. I was the 
               <br />
               spokesman for the entire afternoon, and I remem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               father of Mr. Higgins was Attorney General, and 
               <br />
               he supported me from beginning to end that after- 
               <br />
               noon, and as a result they changed the 
               <br />

               <br />
               contention with the government from 1920 down 
               <br />
               to a very short while ago, that the tax ought to be 
               <br />
               50 cents a ton, and there was also a contention 
               <br />
               that it ought to be $1 a ton. Now I see it is down 
               <br />
               to 10 cents a ton on their ﬁrst million, and 3 cents 
               <br />

               <br />
               can pay, and we don’t pass it to the government. 
               <br />

               before 1919, when there were two companies

               together and called themselves the British Em-
