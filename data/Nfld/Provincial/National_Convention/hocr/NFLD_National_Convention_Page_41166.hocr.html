               As for the secret ballot, Mr. Bradley surely 
               <br />
               must have known that in 1869 the secret ballot 
               <br />
               was unheard of in this part of the world, and not 
               <br />
               only in North America but in Great Britain as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well.</span> The secret ballot, as you know, was an 
               <br />
               Australian invention, ﬁrst used in that country in 
               <br />
               1856, and the secret ballot is still referred to as 
               <br />
               the Australian ballot. Around the process of poll- 
               <br />
               ing great parliamentary ﬁghts were waged in the 
               <br />
               19th century, and the issue at stake was always to 
               <br />
               seek the freedom of the voter from outside <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in«</span> 
               <br />
               fluences, and honesty in the counting of the votes. 
               <br />
               Every election was a time of underground <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pres«</span> 
               <br />
               sure and interest. One authority says, “Social and

               <br />

               <br />
               came operative, and in their obvious indiscrete 
               <br />
               forms are forbidden by law everywhere.” The 
               <br />
               19th century stage relied exclusively upon politi- 
               <br />
               cal parties for theirchoice of candidates, and even 
               <br />
               in many countries for other electoral services and 
               <br />
               the distribution of ballot papers. The result of 
               <br />
               these tendencies in the United States was the 
               <br />
