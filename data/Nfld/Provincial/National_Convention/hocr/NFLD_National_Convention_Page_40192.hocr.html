               Convention a gloomy report, and you all know 
               <br />
               how glad I would be if I could agree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume that there are 60 million cords of 
               <br />
               wood in Labrador. That seems to be fantastic. 
               <br />
               There may be 50,000 square miles with some 
               <br />
               wood on it, but valuable wood I doubt very 
               <br />
               much...

               Mr. Northcott Referring to Mr. Vardy’s 
               <br />
               speech, it is a fact that we have 800 sawmills 
               <br />
               operating, and they saw up to 10,000 feet of 
               <br />
               lumber. They pay the $5 license. Therefore we 
               <br />
               have 800 mills and 10,000 ft. of lumber sawn in 
               <br />
               this country and no licence being paid on it. I do 
               <br />
               believe that we should have royalty paid on every 
               <br />
               thousand feet sawn, under the present high price 
               <br />
               of lumber. If it was down to $20 a thousand I 
               <br />
               would not mind, but with that high price we 
               <br />
               should have 50 cents on every thousand sawn. 
               <br />
               That in itself would give us a lot of extra money. 
               <br />
               While on this royalty question, I think that we 
               <br />
               should receive this royalty and it should be ear- 
               <br />
               marked to use at a later date for reafforestation. I 
               <br />
               think it is a crime to use this money ordinarily, 
               <br />
               and after ﬁve or six years, getting 50 cents on 
               <br />
               every thousand feet sawn, we could use that up 
               <br />
               for some betterment in connection with the in- 
               <br />
               dustry. I really feel hurt to know that all this 
               <br />
               lumber is being sawn and no royalty paid. We 
               <br />
               should get after the Department of Natural 
               <br />
               Resources and see that we have stricter and more 
               <br />
               rigid examination of these facts.

               <br />
