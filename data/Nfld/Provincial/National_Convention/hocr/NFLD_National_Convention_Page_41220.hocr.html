               <br />
               commercial experts of that government. Now I 
               <br />
               wonder if Major Cashin’s contempt for experts is 
               <br />
               as real as he makes out? What is a doctor, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, but an expert in the diseases of the 
               <br />
               body and how to cure them? What is a lawyer but 
               <br />
               an expert in the law? Do we despise drese legal 
               <br />
               experts, or do we go running to them when we 
               <br />
               get in trouble? We are very glad to take their 
               <br />
               advice, and to pay them for it too, as no doubt you 
               <br />
               have found out, sir, in the past few years. What is 
               <br />
               a musician but an expert in music, and a motor 
               <br />
               mechanic and an aeroplane pilot, experts in those 
               <br />
               ﬁelds of human endeavour; can’t there be experts 
               <br />
               in the ﬁeld of public ﬁnance and trade and com- 
               <br />
               merce? Major Cashin called Mr. Gordon Howell 
               <br />
               an expert in customs matters here in this country, 
               <br />
               and Mr. George Allan an expert in income tax 
               <br />
               matters. Is there anything strange in the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada having experts to assist them? 
               <br />
               Their Department of Finance is a great depart- 
               <br />
               ment of government, and as a matter of fact the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada is extremely lucky in the 
               <br />
               calibre of their experts, and it was those men who 
               <br />
               made these estimates of what the government 
               <br />
               would spend and collect should we become a 
               <br />
               province These are the men who make up 
               <br />
               Canada’s own budgets, and if we think that’s a 
               <br />
               job that any slouch can do, then we had better 
               <br />
               think again. They have to know exactly what they 
               <br />
               are talking about, just as Mr. Walter Marshall in 
               <br />
               our own Finance Department has to know what 
               <br />
               he is talking about, and Mr. Herbert Russell has 
               <br />
               to know what he is talking about before he can 
               <br />
               run our Railway.

               <br />
               it was experts who compiled these estimates.

               Major Cashin told us that the Bank of Canada 
               <br />
               had this Very month withdrawn its support price 
               <br />
               for long-term bonds. I do not know just what we 
               <br />
               were supposed to infer from this simple fact, but 
               <br />
               I suppose it was intended to make us think that 
               <br />
               there was something wrong with the value of the 
               <br />
               bonds. What Major Cashin failed to tell us was 
               <br />
               that the Bank of Canada’s action was taken ex— 
               <br />
               actly ten days after the United States Treasury 
               <br />
               had done exactly the same thing with regard to 
               <br />
               United States bonds. In both countries it was 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial government policy, and it was part of the 
               <br />
               mutual American-Canadian policy of anti~inﬂa~ 
               <br />
               tionary measures. And what Major Cashin did not 
               <br />
               tell us is that a few days afterwards the Bank of 
               <br />
               Canada resumed its support-price policy. Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, a lot of statements can he made that 
               <br />
               sound bad, that sound as though there was some— 
               <br />
               thing wrong, but which are capable of a perfectly 
               <br />
               reasonable explanation. Truly, a little knowledge 
               <br />
               is a dangerous thing.
