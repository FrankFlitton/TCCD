               Higgins that we should not wade through the 
               <br />

               Mr.Smallwood ....The position is this: ....these 
               <br />
               provincial old age pensions authorities meet once 
               <br />
               or twice a year, and at this interprovincial confer- 
               <br />
               ence they make regulations insofar as they are 
               <br />
               allowed to under the act itself. They have to be 
               <br />
               guided by the act. Within the power conferred 
               <br />
               upon them they make these regulations in such 
               <br />
               matters of practice as this point — does the 
               <br />
               government step in and recover the old age pen- 
               <br />
               sion that was paid to the pensioner after the 
               <br />
               pensioner dies? Yes and no. That is what they 
               <br />
               have to decide. Will we get it back no matter what 
               <br />
               estate is left by the pensioner who dies, or will we 
               <br />
               ﬁx an amount? ....So they set the amount at 
               <br />
               $2,000. When the pensioner dies, if his estate is 
               <br />
               worth less than $2,000 then the government does 
               <br />
               not bother. If he has an estate valued over $2,000, 
               <br />
               then under certain conditions the government 
               <br />
               will get back the pension that it had paid.

               Mr. Hickman I forget the wording but that is a 
               <br />
               different interpretation than I saw in it this after- 
               <br />
               noon. I was under the impression that it was only 
               <br />
               in cases where the estate or property was over 
               <br />
               $2,000 that they could take action. Why I ask is, 
               <br />
               it says here, “the pension authorities would be 
               <br />
               required to make a claim against an estate where 
               <br />
               the net value was in excess of $2,000". They 
               <br />
               would not have any choice. It does not say they 
               <br />
               cannot make one under $2,000. There is nothing 
               <br />
               here to say they would not. If it is over $2,000 it 
               <br />
               is not the choice of the pension authorities, they 
               <br />
               would be compelled to do it. They have no alter-
