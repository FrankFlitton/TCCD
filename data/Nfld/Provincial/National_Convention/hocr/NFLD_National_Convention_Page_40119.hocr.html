               time ago I saw a comparison of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Canadian prices in our daily papers. There 
               <br />
               were some very important omissions. A relative 
               <br />
               of mine living in western Canada paid for New- 
               <br />
               foundland dry cod — and for our worst quality 
               <br />
               ~— 50 cents a pound or $6 a quintal. Our firm 
               <br />
               packed herring this spring for which we received 
               <br />
               $15.75 a barrel, a good price. This person paid 25 
               <br />
               cents each for Newfoundland split herring or 
               <br />
               $ 125 a barrel. Our lobster ﬁshermen received the 
               <br />
               equivalent of $1 a pound for lobster meal. A 
               <br />
               friend of mine in Montreal paid $5.25 for it. I 
               <br />
               could tell you of other things, but this will suffice 
               <br />
               to show you that Canadians are also gypped on

               During the years of responsible government I 
               <br />
               mentioned to a learned friend of mine that I was 
               <br />
               alarmed at the borrowing of our government. He 
               <br />
               laughed. “Don’t worry about that”, said he, 
               <br />
               “there will always be money for the country to 
               <br />
               borrow.” But alas, the time came when we could 
               <br />
               not borrow and the government collapsed. I look 
               <br />
               at the borrowings of our wealthy neighbour 
               <br />
               Canada with the same alarm, and feel sure the 
               <br />
               time will come when her borrowings will come 
               <br />
               to an end in spite of all her reputed wealth. I don’t 
               <br />
               want this country to be a part of Canada and have 
               <br />
               to face another period of ﬁnancial stress such as 
               <br />
               was witnessed in this country in the 19303, 
               <br />
               brought about by the borrowings of her govem- 
               <br />
               merits.
