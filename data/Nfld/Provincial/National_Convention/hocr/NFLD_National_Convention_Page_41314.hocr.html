               <br />
               a long list of questions which are in the Black 
               <br />
               Book and which the Canadian government 
               <br />
               answered in writing, when we did that, it would 
               <br />
               have been a good thing, if we had thought of it, 
               <br />
               to ask them the question in writing; they would 
               <br />
               have replied in writing and Major Cashin would 
               <br />
               have been saved the bother of getting it in writing. 
               <br />
               The High Commissioner has sent the question on 
               <br />
               to the government in Ottawa by cable, and if they 
               <br />

               will ﬁnd the answer will be as I told you, namely 
               <br />
               that the government Savings Bank will not be 
               <br />

               Mr. Cashin I am not Minister of Finance - 
               <br />
               although I was promised to be Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance of Canada. I might enlighten the House 
               <br />
               further with regard to this matter. I had conﬂict 
               <br />
               before in connection with this, and I may say that 
               <br />
               I came out on top. Under the Savings Bank Act 
               <br />
               of 1937 — if my memory serves me right -— the 
               <br />
               proﬁts that would accrue were to be placed in a 
               <br />
               special fund so as to build it up until proﬁts 
               <br />
               amounted to 25% of the total deposits in the bank 
               <br />
               as further security against any loss depositors 
               <br />
               might run up against. At that time also in that act, 
               <br />
               provision was made whereby the proﬁts would 
               <br />
               be handed over to the Crown Agents in London 
               <br />
               for administration. That act of 1937 was never 
               <br />
               carried out. Proﬁts were never sent to the Crown 
               <br />
               Agents because two and half years afterwards 
               <br />
               they amended that act (1939) wiping out that 
               <br />
               clause. It was still laid down that proﬁts were to 
               <br />
               be set aside, but those proﬁts, as a matter of fact, 
               <br />
               are not properly set aside yet; they are just shown 
               <br />
               as assets of the bank. No fund has been created. 
               <br />
               If tomorrow they should get a run on the bank 
               <br />
               (God forbid!), and they had to sell some of these 
               <br />
               bonds at a discount, the proﬁt might be wiped out. 
               <br />
               I want to assure the Convention and the country, 
               <br />
               because I lcnow steps have been taken in high 
               <br />
               circles in this country condemning me for bring- 
               <br />
               ing this matter up. I consider it my job as a 
               <br />
               member of this Convention to bring it up. I want 
               <br />
               to see the thing straightened out and unless and 
               <br />
               until it is straightened out, I am not going to be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed. We cannot take Mr. Smallwoood’s

               word or the word of any member of that delega—

               to put a special provincial bank here, and they 
               <br />

               <br />
               have a provincial bank in Montreal, but it does
