               by the Dominion government, and only gives us 
               <br />
               three days a week with two mines operating. The 
               <br />
               company told us they were losing money on that. 
               <br />
               We won’t dispute that, but what we are looking 
               <br />
               for is full time operation for everybody — not 
               <br />
               working two slopes, three days a week, but four 
               <br />
               slopes. six days a week. The only way we can get 
               <br />
               it is by having something to absorb our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">output.</span> 
               <br />
               We have it today in England. She will take our 
               <br />
               output if we can keep within the price... It is a 
               <br />
               question of keen competition. The Spaniards, 
               <br />
               Africans and all the rest are competing in the 
               <br />
               British market, and our management said. 
               <br />
               “Here is the position: we can break into the 
               <br />
               English market for 750,000 tons of ore, but to do 
               <br />
               so everybody must co—operate", and we did 
               <br />
               decide that we were going to go all out to hold 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">market...</span> The point I want to bring out is this: 
               <br />
               I say forget taxation and give all our people 
               <br />
               work, and let all the ore we can get be exported 
               <br />
               to England —— let it go there, and our payroll will 
               <br />
               be around $4 million. Our payroll would not be 
               <br />
               $1 million if we got too tough with the company 
               <br />
               insofar as government and labour are concerned. 
               <br />
               I don’t care what anyone says in this Convention, 
               <br />
               my argument is that we are today encouraging 
               <br />
               capital to work on Bell Island, to maintain 
               <br />
               employment for all of us, and we are not going to 
               <br />
               tax them out of it. I do not see how anybody, when 
               <br />
               they know the full terms of it, could say that the 
               <br />
               Dominion Coal and Steel Co. are getting away 
               <br />
               with anything. They are not. We are putting more 
               <br />
               money into the hands of the people and less 
               <br />
               money into the hands of the government. As I 
               <br />
               said yesterday, the less money the government 
               <br />
               has to spend the better for all of us. Purchasing 
               <br />
               power is what we want in this country, less 
               <br />
               government, more work for the people.

               Mr. Ashboume What I am concerned about is 
               <br />
               the value of this ore that goes out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New.</span>

               <br />
               further worry on that, I think you will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the value here is the export value, which I believe 
               <br />
               had been agreed upon between the Bell Island 
               <br />
               company and the government. The price of ore 
               <br />
               apparently ﬂuctuates considerably, and, as I un- 
               <br />
               derstand it, there was some sort of agreement in

               <br />
               Customs or anybody else should put in nominal 
               <br />

               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worth.</span> Iknow the export price of fish has gone 
               <br />
               up, and every exporter has to put down the value, 
               <br />
               and why should not these companies? Any ﬁrm 
               <br />
               that’s sending out exports, why don‘t they put in 
               <br />
               the current domestic value, no matter whether it 
               <br />
               is up or down? In 1939-40, according to the 
               <br />
               number of tons exported and the value, it is about 
               <br />
               $2.50 per ton, and that’s what I am driving at.... 
               <br />
               A person trying to assess the assets and resources 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland will find that these are not 
               <br />
               correct values, and we, as people wanting to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out the value of Newfoundland, want to get die 
               <br />
               thing as correct as we can. Therefore we ought to 
               <br />
               have what this ore is worth in Canada and also in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, so that we will know what these 
               <br />

               <br />
               they are getting for their ore, how can we say
