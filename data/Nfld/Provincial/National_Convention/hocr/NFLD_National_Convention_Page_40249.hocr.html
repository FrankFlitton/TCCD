               Mr. Jackman The pointI want to make is that 
               <br />
               it is important the road to the beach be attended 
               <br />
               to, and for quite a number of years it has not been 
               <br />
               kept open. If the report shows $529,000 spent on 
               <br />
               nine miles of road, I fail to see how we can have 
               <br />
               a transinsular road if it is going to cost $60,000 a 
               <br />

               Mr. Burry I have not spoken in this debate, not 
               <br />
               because I am not interested, but because 
               <br />
               Labrador was not mentioned in it. I do not feel 
               <br />
               that there has been discrimination against 
               <br />
               Labrador. We do not want to claim any money to 
               <br />
               be spent on opening up the various communities. 
               <br />
               We have no roads in Labrador. There are at least 
               <br />
               35 miles of good motorable roads in the area of 
               <br />
               Goose Bay —— Canadian and American —— but 
               <br />
               apart from that, no roads, as such. We should 
               <br />
               spend money to open up the country, but we 
               <br />
               should be careful how we apportion the money. 
               <br />
               For so small a country to spend a lot of money on 
               <br />
               roads, that will not mean very much in opening 
               <br />
               up the country, would seem an unwise expendi- 
               <br />
               ture, when we need it so much to develop our 
               <br />
               resources and bring prosperity. I am wondering, 
               <br />
               when we have spent all those millions of dollars 
               <br />
               on roads, how is it going to compare with the 
               <br />
               amount the government has spent on fisheries 
               <br />
               which are so important to Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Labrador....

               <br />
               I am sure we all agree that we should offer 
               <br />
               criticism on the amount spent on Avalon Penin- 
               <br />

               <br />
               other parts of the country. I am thinking of a 
               <br />
               funeral I attended at Ireland's Eye1 during the 
               <br />
               summer, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrs</span> Toope was buried; they had

               <br />
               they should spend money on isolated parts of the 
               <br />
               country. Local road committees have done a 
               <br />
               great deal, and I agree that the department, on the 
               <br />
               whole, has been reasonably liberal to those on the 
               <br />
               various committees who are prepared, to some 
               <br />
               extent, to help themselves. It is not easy to be- 
               <br />
               come so public-spirited, to take such a com— 
               <br />
               munity interest as to neglect the fishing and 
               <br />
               logging in orderto get work done on a 50-50 basis 
               <br />
               on the roads. When the government brought in 
               <br />
               that policy of spending the money through road 
               <br />
               committees, they were thinking in terms of town 
               <br />
               councils. They put the cart before the horse. They 
               <br />
               should continue to pay the people the rate of $4 
               <br />
               a day. I am not complaining because our friend 
               <br />
               here says the rate is 58 cents an hour; we have not 
               <br />
               been dissatisﬁed. The people are willing to work 
               <br />
               for 40 cents an hour.... I do not think Trinity has 
               <br />
               been mentioned. We have been petitioning the 
               <br />
               government for the past 25 or 30 years to put a 
               <br />
               bridge across the Sound so that Random Island 
               <br />
               will become part of Newfoundland also. With 
               <br />
               regard to this $6 million for a transinsular road, I 
               <br />
               think it will cost at least $10 to $12 million at die
