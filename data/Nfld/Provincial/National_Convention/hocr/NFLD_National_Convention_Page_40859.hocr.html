               Mr. Smallwood I appreciate Mr. Job’s main 
               <br />
               point, namely that the people are entitled to a 
               <br />
               complete accounting of this document, entitled to 
               <br />
               understand it; and I appreciate and know that for 
               <br />
               months past that has been Mr. Job’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viewpoint.</span> 
               <br />
               The difﬁculty, however, with his main sugges- 
               <br />
               tion, is two-fold. First it presupposes that I am 
               <br />
               able to take this Grey Book, in the light of the two 
               <br />
               Black Books, and give a running description, all 
               <br />
               in one piece, of what confederation would mean 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland. If Mr. Job is agreeable that I 
               <br />
               should carry out what it has been rumoured I was 
               <br />
               going to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> speak for three weeks — I am quite 
               <br />
               agreeable to do it if the Convention wishes and 
               <br />
               if my voice will hold out that long. I am sure my 
               <br />
               mind will, but I doubt if, at the end of the three 
               <br />
               weeks, the public would know very much more 
               <br />
               about confederation than they would at the begin- 
               <br />
               ning. Then I have the further doubt that, having 
               <br />
               done that, Mr. Hollett, or any other one man, 
               <br />
               would be in a position to take that whole three 
               <br />
               weeks’ speech and in another three weeks dis— 
               <br />
               pose of it.

               Mr. Chairman ....Mr. Job‘s suggestion, as I un- 
               <br />
               derstand it sir, is that you should ﬁrst make a 
               <br />
               general statement, that would take you an hour, 
               <br />
               or an hour and a half, giving only the highlights 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Ican’t do it. I can only do it by 
               <br />
               taking it clause by clause. The length of time that 
               <br />
               will be used by any one clause is entirely a matter 
               <br />
               for the Convention. It depends on how many 
               <br />
               members wish to ask <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span> I will not occupy 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman If you feel that it can only be

               dealt with clause by clause, then I suggest to 
               <br />
               members that Mr. Job’s recommendation is still 
               <br />
               a very sound one, in the sense that you take the 
               <br />
               clause, read it if you will, give your interpretation 
               <br />
               of it as brieﬂy and as simply as possible

               <br />
               of the clause under discussion. I still think mat 
               <br />
               Mr. Job’s recommendation is calculated to help 
               <br />

               We have this report here, sir. Whether last night

               <br />

               good nights and bad nights for both parties in this

               I guess, but we have it here and I base my dis- 
               <br />
               agreement on this: we represent Newfoundland 
               <br />
               district by district. No one here represents <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland as a whole, not even Mr. Smallwood,

               Mr. Miller It is on that basis that I think it would 
               <br />
               be something that we would regret later if we 
               <br />
               restricted the rights of individual members to 
               <br />
               question. I think also that the ﬁrst construction 
               <br />
               put on any section of this or any clause of this 
               <br />

               impression; and I feel that if Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               statements go unchallenged the people will ac- 
               <br />
               cept them as such, but if there is something in his 
               <br />
               statement which may be cleared up, I think right

               Mr. Chairman Iam inclined to agree with you.

               <br />
               a mistake, as Mr. Miller points out. There are 44
