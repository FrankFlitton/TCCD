               Mr. Cranl'ord Mr. Chairman, for ﬁve weeks the 
               <br />
               proposals for confederation with the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada was debated in this chamber, and I 
               <br />
               wonder if the people of this country understand 
               <br />
               those proposals any better than they did when we 
               <br />
               began. There is one thing that I am sure of, and 
               <br />
               that is our people do not lmow how they are going 
               <br />
               to be taxed in order to ﬁnance a province if we 
               <br />
               decided to become a province of Canada. That is 
               <br />
               one thing I am sure of, as I have taken a very keen 
               <br />
               interest in this matter, and as yet I do not know, 
               <br />
               and the fact is it has not been outlined to us and 
               <br />
               it cannot be expected for any person outside of 
               <br />
               this chamber to know. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It has been said in Canada that we are a touchy 
               <br />
               and suspicious people, of which I plead guilty, in 
               <br />
               view of the goings-on in our political life. If we 
               <br />
               were not touchy and suspicious, it would be very 
               <br />
               little interest we would have in the support of our 
               <br />
               families.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Chairman, much has been said about 
               <br />
               direct and indirect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> Now let us consider for 
               <br />
               one moment which of the two is best for a fisher- 
               <br />
               man. If the tax is direct, ﬁshermen will have a 
               <br />
               yearly amount to pay, good voyage or bad voyage 
               <br />
               — that direct tax must be paid or charged against 
               <br />
               him. If the tax is indirect, it is the same as we are 
               <br />
               used to. The years of a good voyage we spend all 
               <br />
               our money on all necessities of life to replace the 
               <br />
               badly worn, and to buy extras that we were not 
               <br />
               able to buy when we have a bad voyage. In the 
               <br />
               years of a bad voyage we curtail our spending 
               <br />
               wherever possible and we mend and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revmend</span> our 
               <br />
               clothing and make other things do us for that year, 
               <br />
               in order to try and balance our budget; and 
               <br />
               believe me, in years of bad voyages we do not 
               <br />
               pay much in the form of customs duty, when we 
               <br />
               consider the principal part of a ﬁsherman’s food 
               <br />
               is on the free list. Therefore Mr. Chairman, in- 
               <br />
               direct taxes are better for a ﬁsherman; because 
               <br />
               how is a ﬁsherman going to pay a direct tax in a 
               <br />
               year of a bad voyage or even an average voyage, 
               <br />
               when he can just square his family account and 
               <br />
               try and ﬁnd something to do in order to try and 
               <br />
               carry him through to the next season?

               how odd it sounds to me when a person asks the 
               <br />
               question about the political feeling in any district, 
               <br />
               when they ask how do the people take the con- 
               <br />
               federation issue? To me, sir, this question sounds 
               <br />
               out of place, inasmuch as I am sure there is not a 
               <br />
               person in Newfoundland today who knows what 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada would mean to New— 
               <br />
               foundland. On one hand we are offered family 
               <br />
               allowances and so on. On the other hand, we are 
               <br />
               asked to give our God—given rights together with 
               <br />
               an assurance that we will not use our surplus that 
               <br />
               will foster our industries that will be in competi- 
               <br />
               tion with Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">industries.</span> Now, sir, that 
               <br />
               means we are asked to allow Canada monopolies 
               <br />
               that would be against us. The word “monopolies” 
               <br />
               stinks in my nostrils. I am a man that is against 
               <br />
               monopolies — we have had a few to contend 
               <br />
               with, and because we have had a few, will I for 
               <br />
               spite give the whole of our trade to another 
               <br />
               country to be monopolised? Sir, in View of this 
               <br />
               how can any person decide on confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada? I think, sir, the advocates of confedera— 
               <br />
               tion should he held responsible for all the 
               <br />
               promises made, as I feel sure they are made to be 
               <br />
               broken.

               Mr. Chairman, you may consider what I have 
               <br />
               just said to be in the nature of a joke, but I was 
               <br />
               never more serious in my life, as I consider this 
               <br />
               confederation issue of grave concern to all of us, 
               <br />
               since in the past we have been made into a 
               <br />
               political football without any consideration for 
               <br />
               the welfare of the people. It is time for us to hold 
               <br />
               someone responsible for their doings. As we all 
               <br />
               realise, all the changes that have taken place in 
               <br />
               our political life have been done by a few and not 
               <br />

               <br />

               his address on Wednesday, January 14, when he 
               <br />
               said that $16 million would be given by Canada

               yearly to the province of Newfoundland if we 
               <br />
               should become such, and the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada regards that amount as mere chicken 
               <br />
               feed. Now, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe one 
               <br />
               word of that statement, not one word. And the 
               <br />
               fact is, that statement has caused me to take all
