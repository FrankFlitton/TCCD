               <br />
               social services and social welfare. Because it is

               would suggest it is wrong for the government to 
               <br />
               give more and more attention to social welfare.

               Mr. Butt As we had some discussion on the

               Lady Anderson about the justiﬁcation for the 
               <br />

               more question, has the Lady Anderson any X-ray

               Mr. Butt When we were discussing the opening 
               <br />
               of the new sanatorium on Topsail Road there 
               <br />
               seemed to be some doubt as to whether there were 
               <br />
               any more patients in the hospital since the new

               building has been opened. Is there any difﬁculty 
               <br />
               in the way? Why are there not more patients? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne I have here a letter from Dr. 
               <br />
               Bennett. There are now 350 patients at the 
               <br />
               Sanatorium; 250 of these are in the new naval 
               <br />
               hospital; 150 patients were transferred out of the 
               <br />
               former sanatorium and 100 new patients have 
               <br />
               been admitted There are still 100 patients in the 
               <br />
               old hospital, making a total of 350 now left. The 
               <br />
               new hospital, which was taken over from the 
               <br />
               Canadian naval authorities, will hold 35 more 
               <br />
               and these will be admitted soon, making a total 
               <br />
               of 285. These new patients will be admitted as 
               <br />
               soon as staff is available. There are 100 patients 
               <br />
               now in the former sanatorium and 130 will be 
               <br />
               admitted after renovation; which will then give 
               <br />
               capacity to the old sanatorium of 230 ~ which 
               <br />
               added to the 285 capacity of the naval hospital, 
               <br />
               will give a grand total of 515 patients. Further 
               <br />
               accommodation above this figure will need new 
               <br />
               construction of the wings of the naval hospital.... 
               <br />
               One point as regards the Sanatorium, it seems 
               <br />
               to me that they have only a skeleton crew of 
               <br />
               nurses. It is a sad affair. lt seems to me there is 
               <br />
               great danger of some of these nurses being run 
               <br />
               off their feet. Some of the patients I spoke to there 
               <br />
               had been in the nursing service, and picked up the 
               <br />
               germ and have become victims and naturally they 
               <br />
               require hospitalisation. There is a big shortage of 
               <br />
               nurses... 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I wonder if the Committee gave con- 
               <br />
               sideration to the question of care or follow—up 
               <br />
               treatment of people who have been in the 
               <br />
               Sanatorium?.... In my opinion one of the most 
               <br />
               hopeful signs that I have seen as far as welfare is 
               <br />
               concerned in the last few years is the organisation 
               <br />
               of the TB Association, for the reason that it has 
               <br />
               grown out of the people of Newfoundland and is 
               <br />
               not a purely governmental organisation. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">invol»</span> 
               <br />
               vcs a principle which to me is of the utmost 
               <br />
               importance, that it is out of the people themselves 
               <br />
               must grow all the institutions which will make 
               <br />
               Newfoundland better and increase her social wel- 
               <br />
               fare developments. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne I do not know definitely what 
               <br />
               follow-up treatment the doctors have as regards 
               <br />
               the patients, but I would take it that in these 
               <br />
               institutions they have some such plan. In the 
               <br />
               Notre Dame Bay Memorial Hospital at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Twillin~</span> 
               <br />
               gate, every patient who leaves that institution is 
               <br />
               given a slip signed by Dr. Olds advising what that
