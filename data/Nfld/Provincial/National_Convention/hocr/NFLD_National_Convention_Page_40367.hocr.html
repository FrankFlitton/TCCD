               Mr. Smallwood I believe that in Ottawa there is

               information that this Convention needs to have, 
               <br />
               and that the people of Newfoundland need and 
               <br />
               want to have. I believe that a delegation ought to

               go and get it if they will receive the delegation. 
               <br />
               However, the delegation to London should go 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, and return to bring its report before the

               Mr. Cashin I want to thank the honourable

               delegate from Labrador for an opportunity of 
               <br />
               clearing the atmosphere. I know when the cap 
               <br />
               fits. Mr. Chairman, before I deal with this matter 
               <br />
               before the Chair, I want to clean up this insidious 
               <br />
               propaganda that is going on inside and outside 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> I have been accused of being anti- 
               <br />
               British, and I want to tell those individuals who 
               <br />
               make such vile accusations that they must be 
               <br />
               possessed of very diseased minds. I want to point 
               <br />
               out that some 32 or 33 years ago I offered my 
               <br />
               service to King and country in western Canada; 
               <br />
               1 was young at the time and my father telegraphed 
               <br />
               me and suggested that I return and join the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Regiment. which I did. I went over- 
               <br />
               seas, and my friend across the way here, Sergeant 
               <br />
               Northcott, went overseas at the same time... Fol- 
               <br />
               lowing that l commanded a unit of an English 
               <br />
               regiment on the other side, and still it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inn</span> 
               <br />
               sinuated that l am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">antivBritish.</span> Also, in the last

               war, although well over 50, I offered my services 
               <br />
               and took a contingent across from Canada, but on 
               <br />
               account of my age I had to get out. If] hear any 
               <br />
               more of this I am going to take further steps, not 
               <br />
               in this House, but outside of it.

               Now with regard to the motion. 1 have from 
               <br />
               the beginning been an exponent of aretum to

               place myself on record as still retaining that view, 
               <br />

               to bore the House somewhat, and I trust they will
