               <br />
               Let’s get the thing straight. There is a lot of talk 
               <br />
               about the mysterious secret documents, and the 
               <br />
               members of the Convention may have a feeling 
               <br />
               that we have been living in an atmosphere of 
               <br />
               conspiracy and plots now for 14 months. A lot of 
               <br />
               members may feel that there are some dark and 
               <br />
               mysterious documents closely guarded under 
               <br />
               lock and key by the members of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation. There is no such thing. The fact of the 
               <br />
               matter is these Black Books contain 99.99% of 
               <br />
               what was given us in Ottawa. There is one docu— 
               <br />
               ment only, to my knowledge, speaking from 
               <br />
               memory which has not been put in the Black 
               <br />
               Books, and that is the one to which I have just 
               <br />
               made reference in reply to Major Cashin. One 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only.</span> All other documents appear in the Black 
               <br />
               Book in their final, ofﬁcial form... Please let us 
               <br />
               have done with any further suggestions of secret, 
               <br />
               dark, mysterious documents under lock and key, 
               <br />
               that we are trying to keep back from the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion. That is a completely wrong impression. All 
               <br />
               trash and nonsense... 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I don’t know if it is in the Black 
               <br />
               Book. The point I make is this: it is a very 
               <br />
               important document, and even if it is the only one 
               <br />
               that is left out, the point is it should have been 
               <br />
               tabled here the ﬁrst day, because it relates to the 
               <br />
               public debt of Canada, and a comparison has to 
               <br />
               be made between the public debt of Canada and 
               <br />
               the public debt of Newfoundland. I tabled a ques— 
               <br />
               tion on this ten days ago, and I ﬁnd new that my 
               <br />
               questions have gone off to Ottawa when the 
               <br />
               actual information is here in the city. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The fact that any memorandum 
               <br />
               or document in the possession of members may 
               <br />
               overlap the so—called Black Books is no reason 
               <br />
               for withholding it from the members of the Con- 
               <br />
               vention. On the contrary, in certain circles it 
               <br />
               might be regarded as very foolish, because in a 
               <br />
               sense it provides independent corroboration for 
               <br />
               what is in the Black Books. Therefore, there is 
               <br />
               every reason why it should be made the property 
               <br />
               of the Convention. But in that respect has any 
               <br />
               member of the Ottawa delegation anything to say 
               <br />
               on whether or not the document referred to 
               <br />
               should not be made the property of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion? Is there any reason why it should not be? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry 
               <br />

               here, Mr. Bradley, because I think that he might

               have some views on this matter, As far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned myselfl want to see my position clear, 
               <br />

               <br />
               am doing right. If I accepted, when I was a 
               <br />
               member of the delegation to Ottawa, certain 
               <br />
               documents which, in the compilation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi‘the</span> Black 
               <br />
               Books and the Grey Book, were used, and these 
               <br />
               documents came to me marked “Conﬁdential“. 
               <br />
               and in a folder marked “Secret", the question I 
               <br />
               must ask myself is whether or not lam permitted 
               <br />
               to divulge that information without permission 
               <br />
               from the people who supplied it. I might say I 
               <br />
               accepted that information as it was handed to me, 
               <br />
               as conﬁdential and secret but I understood that 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reports</span> which had been prepared by sub- 
               <br />
               committees, etc., and supplied to the members, 
               <br />
               were superseded by these Black Books, and that 
               <br />
               these were to be the final word, so to speak. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Mr. Smallwood has made the 
               <br />
               statement that 99.99% of the information <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cone</span> 
               <br />
               tained in the documents, or memoranda to which 
               <br />
               you refer, is already set forth in the Black Books. 
               <br />
               Do you agree to that statement? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume Well, I would not like to make 
               <br />
               any statement, but in the main, 1 don't know 
               <br />
               mind, but I am afraid that I could not say whether 
               <br />
               there is very much left out of these Black 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Books...</span> Of course, I don't want to withhold 
               <br />
               anything from the Convention, and if the 
               <br />
               Canadian government is satisfied to release it, 
               <br />
               that’s up to them... I understand Mr. Bradley is 
               <br />
               still ill, but I am sorry he is not here. because, as 
               <br />
               I said before, I consider that these things were 
               <br />
               given to us and marked “Secret”, and whether or 
               <br />
               not I am entitled to read from these documents, 
               <br />
               that is a point that I want to be satisfied on.

               yourselfon this very important question, because

               it is the second time that it has come before the

               <br />
               Mr. Burry Well, Mr. Chairman, I stated my 
               <br />
               position in this case once. Idon‘t know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ii‘l</span> made

               Convention. I did not give any undertaking to 
               <br />
               keep anything secret. While we were there we
