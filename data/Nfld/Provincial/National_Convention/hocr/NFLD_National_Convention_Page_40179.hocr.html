               remember the time when the total expenditure of

               public money on education in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               reached the shocking amount of half a million 
               <br />
               dollars, considered by the education people in 
               <br />

               total amount of public money earmarked for

               brokenly, up to the very moment when the impact 
               <br />
               of the world depression was felt. So for that 
               <br />
               reason, the Education Committee wisely and fair- 
               <br />

               notice that total expenditure rose steadily from

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">192122</span> year by year until it reached $1 million

               larger proportion of money on it began before 
               <br />

               <br />
               tinuous. We ought to give credit to the pioneers

               <br />
               and that was the system of education. It was 
               <br />
               agreed at the outset that the current system was 
               <br />
               the most desirable, and I would like to go on 
               <br />
               record as being unalterably in favour of the 
               <br />
               present system because it is the best that could be 
               <br />
               devised. The history of this country shows that 
               <br />
               before there was any attempt made by any 
               <br />
               governmental authorities, the churches stepped 
               <br />
               into the breach and gave us what educational 
               <br />
               facilities we have at the present time, and I am 
               <br />
               quite convinced that, under conditions as they are 
               <br />
               in the country today, the present system is the best 
               <br />
               under the circumstances, and it does not come 
               <br />
               within our province as a Convention to interfere
