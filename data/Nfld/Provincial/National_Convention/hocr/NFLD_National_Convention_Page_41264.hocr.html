               the matter.... My position is simply this, and I 
               <br />
               have to appeal to the generosity of members. Mr. 
               <br />
               Job has been very ill, and I know what I’m talking 
               <br />
               about because his doctor brought the question 
               <br />
               before me since Mr. Job insisted that he was 
               <br />
               going to come into this House contrary to his 
               <br />
               doctor’s instructions, when he shouldn’t attempt 
               <br />
               to walk across the sueet. I called on Mr. Job and 
               <br />
               pointed out to him what a great risk he was 
               <br />
               taking... I felt it my duty to communicate with 
               <br />
               him as a result of the remarks that were made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood this afternoon, and Mr. Job in- 
               <br />
               timated that his doctor may allow him to appear 
               <br />
               for a few minutes when the evening session 
               <br />
               begins. As far as I‘m concerned, I’m prepared to 
               <br />
               sit here until 3 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">M4</span> o’clock tomorrow morning on 
               <br />
               condition that Mr. Job should be permitted to 
               <br />
               speak. He isn’t going to speak very long, and it’s 
               <br />
               my intention to ask him to remain in his seat. I 
               <br />
               think having regard to all the attendant cir— 
               <br />
               cumstances the House will endorse my action. I 
               <br />
               have no power, of course, to take the floor away 
               <br />
               from the speaker. But I would appeal to your 
               <br />
               good nature, gentlemen, and ask you that should 
               <br />
               it develop that the Hon. Mr. Job is permitted by 
               <br />
               his doctor to attend the evening session for a few 
               <br />
               minutes, would the member who then has the 
               <br />
               floor be good enough to yield it for a few mo- 
               <br />
               ments, so that Mr. Job may be able to express 
               <br />
               himself briefly on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question...</span> It may very well 
               <br />
               be that we would be doing a great kindness in 
               <br />
               enabling Mr. Job to discharge a duty which has 
               <br />
               been troubling him now for some two weeks. 
               <br />
               Therefore I ask the member who may be occupy— 
               <br />
               ing the floor at 8 o’clock, would he kindly con-

               <br />
               assure you the circumstances are very urgent...

               Mr. Ashbourne I’ve been speaking a little over 
               <br />
               an hour. I realise that members probably would 
               <br />
               like to have some explanation from me as regards 
               <br />
               the fact that I was a member of this Ottawa

               more time. I shall be a happy man when it’s over

               aspirations or bring them prosperity and lasting

               happiness.

               Mr. Reddy Mr. Chairman, fora greatmany days 
               <br />
               and weeks we have been listening to the argu— 
               <br />
               ments in favour of confederation by the member 
               <br />
               for Bonavista Centre, which arguments have 
               <br />
               been based on the offer contained in the books 
               <br />
               sent here by the Canadian government. I want to 
               <br />
               congratulate the member for Bonavista Centre, 
               <br />
               who in his own masterly manner has explained 
               <br />
               the meaning and the application of these terms. I 
               <br />
               must confess that to me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood is a 
               <br />
               magician with words, and I have listened to him 
               <br />
               repeating and repeating the points that he wanted 
               <br />
               to stress and to be remembered by the radio 
               <br />
               audience. And he has shown the same ability to 
               <br />
               side-step and gloss over the shaded and dark spots 
               <br />
               that for his purpose might best remain hidden and 
               <br />
               ignored. Mr. Smallwood, by his ability to outtalk 
               <br />
               and outguess any member here, has usually had 
               <br />
               the last word time and again. He has drawn one 
               <br />
               or other of us away from our point that he did not 
               <br />
               wish to discuss, and then having his opponent in 
               <br />
               deep water, so to speak, he has proceeded to 
               <br />
               drown him by something irrelevant to the case in 
               <br />
               point. Mr. Smallwood has reminded me of a 
               <br />
               French chef who, with a few scraps of leftovers, 
               <br />
               can combine them and with a little ﬂavour make 
               <br />
               it appear a dish for a king. But unfortunately, in 
               <br />
               this instance, it is not the appearance that matters, 
               <br />
               much less Mr. Smallwood’s ability to debate it. 
               <br />
               We cannot live in a beautiful picture or a fantastic 
               <br />
               dream, because we do not live in a land of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make»</span> 
               <br />
               believe. We live in a hard world, where facts and 
               <br />
               not debates are the most important things.
