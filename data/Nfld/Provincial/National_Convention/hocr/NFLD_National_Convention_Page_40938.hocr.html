               Mr. Smallwood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, yesterday we 
               <br />
               ﬁnished reading clause 16, and I wonder if the 
               <br />
               Convention is ready to go with clause 17'? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Higgins One question only. Would Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood describe the type of ship meant under 
               <br />
               paragraph I, clause 16. 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Oh, that’s the ferry on the Gulf. 
               <br />
               What Mr. Higgins probably has in mind is some 
               <br />
               discussion that took place in one of the last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plen~</span> 
               <br />
               ary sessions we had in Ottawa, where I think Mr. 
               <br />
               St. Laurent, the chairman of the plenary sessions, 
               <br />
               gave us verbally a part description of a boat that 
               <br />
               he said their steamship advisers ﬁgured might be 
               <br />
               the kind of boat that they would put on the Gulf. 
               <br />
               There was nothing ﬁnal about it, nothing in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">writ‘</span> 
               <br />
               ing; it was merely a description by word of 
               <br />
               mouth... I have forgotten the speciﬁcations and 
               <br />
               dimensions that they spoke of tentatively, but I 
               <br />
               do remember that Mr. Higgins, who sat next to 
               <br />
               me whispered, “Well, Joe, it looks to me as if they 
               <br />
               are willing to give us anything we ask for.” He 
               <br />
               was very pleased with the possibilities of the 
               <br />
               tourist trade in Newfoundland, and I was very 
               <br />
               pleased, at least at the thought that a ﬁne ferry 
               <br />
               boat would be put on the Gulf the kind of boat 
               <br />
               that would bring tourists and their cars across the 
               <br />
               Gulf. I think that’s what Mr. Higgins is referring 
               <br />
               to. 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins Yes, that is what I was referring to. 
               <br />
               I wonder, would it be possible if Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood‘s memory later on might help him in 
               <br />
               giving us a description? 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Bradley has apparently 
               <br />
               been interested for years past in ships and ship— 
               <br />
               ping, I am sure when he gets back he will be able 
               <br />
               to repeat these details and speciﬁcations because 
               <br />
               he was very interested in these from the technical 
               <br />
               standpoint. I don’t know much about ships and 
               <br />
               shipping, and I was not in a position tojudge. Mr. 
               <br />
               St. Laurent, I believe, read from a written memo 
               <br />
               that had been handed to him by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government shipping people, but if Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               would wait until Monday, Mr. Bradley will be

               the bull by the horns. It was this: knowing the

               <br />

               ship service and practice, their steamship people 
               <br />

               province they would have to take all these things 
               <br />
               into consideration, considered the matter of a 
               <br />
               ferry on the Gulf; and because of that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government went into just what kind of 
               <br />
               an outﬁt they would put there, and that was where 
               <br />
               they got the idea of making an estimate of what 
               <br />
               it would cost. The kind of boats they anticipate 
               <br />
               would cost about $2.5 million, and would take 30 
               <br />
               cars, and give a daily service back and forth. 
               <br />
               That’s a lot better than we get now. But that is 
               <br />
               what they anticipated, and that is exactly what
