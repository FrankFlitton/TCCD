               the pledge given us by the British government. 
               <br />
               The British government came to our aid 
               <br />
               generously and fully in our days of need, and 
               <br />
               advanced us $11 million, and let us show our 
               <br />
               appreciation of this fact. We live in a world in 
               <br />
               which we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interdependent.</span> No man lives to 
               <br />
               himself, no country lives to itself. As the ebb and 
               <br />
               flow of tides continue, so a mutual world trade 
               <br />
               and commerce will ever be present upon the vast 
               <br />
               expanses of our ocean, bringing us, we hope, the 
               <br />
               necessary essentials of life, and also carrying our 
               <br />
               own products by which we live and by which we 
               <br />
               have ﬂourishing industries, and to provide the 
               <br />
               necessities of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">life...</span>

               Our strategic position between the new and 
               <br />
               old worlds, being the Gibraltar of North America, 
               <br />
               gives us a wide bargaining power. We have near 
               <br />
               our shores vast treasuries of the deep, which 
               <br />
               when properly developed and effectively 
               <br />
               marketed will enhance our economy. We realise 
               <br />
               we have been fortunate in having UNRRA and 
               <br />
               the rehabilitation associations to help us out in 
               <br />
               the marketing of our produce, and as we face the 
               <br />
               future it gives us some concern regarding the 
               <br />
               competition which will soon be evident from 
               <br />
               ﬁshing countries on the other side. We must see 
               <br />
               to it that our capital assets bring to our shores that 
               <br />
               necessary wealth by which our people can live 
               <br />
               and maintain themselves in dignity and security. 
               <br />
               That is why people long for freedom from want 
               <br />
               and a sense of security, so that they will be able 
               <br />
               not only to have three meals a day, but there will 
               <br />
               be that dignity and that prestige which we as 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders desire. It is unthinkable that 
               <br />
               we should do without the necessary amenities of 
               <br />
               life in order to provide and build up an expensive 
               <br />
               administrative form of government. We have 
               <br />
               many drawbacks, some of them resulting in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unemployment.</span> In the north, people can only 
               <br />
               work for a period of a few months, necessitating 
               <br />
               quite a bit of spare time. There is a serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cur«</span>

               tailment in the earning power of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as a result which we must try to overcome. Our 
               <br />
               social conditions need improving, the cost of 
               <br />
               living needs to be lowered. In this great task of 
               <br />
               building a better Newfoundland we are digging
