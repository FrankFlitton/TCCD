               <br />
               We are going to have a reassessment of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posi«</span>

               <br />
               only be read one way, and that is that we are to

               get transitional grants for a period until we are 
               <br />
               able to develop revenue producing services, so 
               <br />
               that we can pay our own taxes. That’s the only

               way in which I can read it. I said yesterday that 
               <br />
               we would become the baby province of Canada.

               This transitional grant, I hope it’s not being 
               <br />
               facetious, makes me feel that while we are the

               baby province we will get a few rattles and a few 
               <br />

               <br />
               the extra bottle of milk, and we’ll be played with

               really delightful. The fact that we’re going to

               Mr. Butt ....Now sir, we come to transportation. 
               <br />
               I can see that the application of the Maritime 
               <br />
               Freight Rate to Newfoundland may be of help. 
               <br />
               Why, in the name of fortune we haven’t asked for 
               <br />
               some concessions like that, in view of the 
               <br />
               favourable balance of trade that Canada has with 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, I don’t know. Why couldn’t We 
               <br />
               ask for it in the future? I took the $40 million that 
               <br />
               we bought in Canada last year and I assumed that 
               <br />
               they would make 20%, which turns out to be $8 
               <br />
               million that’s made by the producers of goods in 
               <br />
               Canada on their sale of goods to New- 
               <br />
               foundland... I’m talking about the markup and 
               <br />
               the proﬁts which will be made by the producer or 
               <br />
               the manufacturer. I don’t see that there’s any 
               <br />
               earthly excuse for this country’s not asking for 
               <br />
               concessions of that kind. It’s only because we sit 
               <br />
               down on the job that we don’t get these things. 1 
               <br />
               don’t know whether I’m very young and foolish, 
               <br />
               but these things really make me boil. There is a 
               <br />
               deﬁnite inertia that comes over the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and they’re prepared to sit down 
               <br />
               under anything without asking for concessions 
               <br />
               from other people. It seems to me to be a stupid

               we ﬁnd an extra $2 million to ﬁnd a ferry? If we

               We may be able to find another million or two to

               <br />
               pose, Mr. Smallwood, that it would be fair to 
               <br />
               criticise you, in making up your budget, for leav- 
               <br />
               ing out one item because I don’t see how it would 
               <br />
               ever occur to you. It did occur to me, however, 
               <br />
               because I was one time a civil servant. The point 
               <br />
               is this, you will ﬁnd the civil servants are on scale, 
               <br />
               that there are yearly increments that are going to 
               <br />
               civil servants. That that has to be paid. It has to 
               <br />
               be found this year, it has to be ﬁnd again next 
               <br />
               year.... These increments will have to go on for 
               <br />
               quite a few years, because a number of young 
               <br />
               people at the lower part of the scales are being 
               <br />
               taken into the civil <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">service.</span> I suggest that in the 
               <br />
               budget made up by Mr. Smallwood you could 
               <br />
               completely wipe out one item which he put in 
               <br />
               there this year, and that you would have to double 
               <br />
               it next year. That particular item is $254,000 from 
               <br />
               refunds. One man estimated for me that within 
               <br />
               the civil service the yearly increments alone next 
               <br />
               year would cost practically 10% of the amount 
               <br />
               paid to the civil service normally. I’ll be accused 
               <br />
               of propaganda if I say any more about this... It 
               <br />
               only means one thing, that if you cut out that item, 
               <br />
               and I’m not talking about extra increases that the 
               <br />
               civil service are looking for now, you have to add 
               <br />
               an equal amount to your budget, which means 
               <br />
               that you have to add another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,400,000</span> a year 
               <br />
               to your provincial budget, which can only be 
               <br />
               found out of direct taxation on the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I would also point out that 
               <br />
               federal employees may get better wages than 
               <br />
               employees in the Newfoundland government. If 
               <br />
               they do, and if they have got to make contribu- 
               <br />
               tions to the pension fund, then in all fairness, 
               <br />
               those that are kept by the provincial government,
