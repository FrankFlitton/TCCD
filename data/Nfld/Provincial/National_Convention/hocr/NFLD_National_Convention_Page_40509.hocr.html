               would never have attempted to bring it in. The 
               <br />
               only reason was that I felt that there are a certain 
               <br />
               number of people in Newfoundland who would 
               <br />
               want to be given a chance to vote for union with 
               <br />
               the United States. I quote the Sunday Herald. I 
               <br />
               like that paper, you get a lot of news out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> 
               <br />
               I have seen in that paper where the United States, 
               <br />
               in a straw balldt, topped all other forms of 
               <br />
               government. Have we the right to turn around and 
               <br />
               be dictators and say: “No, you are not going to 
               <br />
               have any chance whatever to vote for the United 
               <br />
               States, you are not going to have any chance to 
               <br />
               vote for confederation, or any chance to vote any 
               <br />
               way”? Is that what we say — we 45 delegates? 
               <br />
               Who are we? Are we dictators? If this is turned 
               <br />
               down, we are dictators. We are telling people that 
               <br />
               as far as we are concerned they have no right to 
               <br />
               vote for federal union with the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.</span> I 
               <br />
               protest in fairness as a democratic citizen, as a 
               <br />
               true blooded Britisher. Possibly there is a great 
               <br />
               deal more British blood in my veins than in a 
               <br />
               good many here. I protest in the name of Run- 
               <br />
               nymede and the Bill of Rights. After all, when the 
               <br />
               Convention is over and we discuss forms of 
               <br />
               government, it is all finished. Are we the 
               <br />
               masters? No, we are only the servants. The 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, as far as my experience 
               <br />
               is concerned, and I have been a working man 
               <br />
               always associated with labour, I know they are 
               <br />
               pretty good. They might not know the three Rs, 
               <br />
               but they know the difference between a codﬁsh 
               <br />
               and a herring. Let us give them the ﬁnal say. I 
               <br />
               protest with all my power against this dictatorial 
               <br />
               attitude, against the attitude of this Convention in 
               <br />
               saying to the people of Newfoundland, “You 
               <br />
               can’t put you name on the ballot paper for the 
               <br />
               United States.” I think we should consider it very 
               <br />
               carefully. I challenge any member as far as my 
               <br />
               loyalty is concerned. I believe in Britain, she is 
               <br />
               the cradle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">democracy.</span> It was there that trade 
               <br />
               unions started, out of which I get my living today. 
               <br />
               Hitler’s ﬁrst move was to bust the trade and 
               <br />
               labour unions wide open, but thanks be to God
