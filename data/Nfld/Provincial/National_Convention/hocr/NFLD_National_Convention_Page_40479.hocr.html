               time it is perfectly obvious they will have a 
               <br />
               tremendous amount of work to do. We have 
               <br />
               asked the Canadian government to receive a 
               <br />
               delegation, and they have accepted the idea. It is 
               <br />
               obvious now that we must get ready for that

               <br />
               of work to do locally. They have to take up the 
               <br />
               possible repercussion of the change from the

               <br />
               of the revenue that will be left to us, what amount 
               <br />
               would be required to run a provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem‘</span>

               from, how much of our money will have to be 
               <br />
               taken over by the Canadian government, etc. All 
               <br />
               these questions require considerable ﬁguring, in 
               <br />
               the course of which deliberations the delegation 
               <br />
               will have to have the assistance of some of the

               <br />
               sor of Taxes and others. In fairness to whoever 
               <br />
               the delegation should be, I suggest that they 
               <br />
               should be appointed immediately, but it is for you
