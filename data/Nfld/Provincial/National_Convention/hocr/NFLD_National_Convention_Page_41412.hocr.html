               days ago. No reply has been received at all. The

               other day we were told indirectly by Mr. Carew 
               <br />
               that the thing had been passed on to the High 
               <br />

               <br />
               or ﬁve days ago, and there is no reply yet. In View

               that reply not after it is all over, but during the

               discussion, because it is a very important matter. 
               <br />

               <br />
               it, and we are entitled to have that question 
               <br />
               answered. It has been there two weeks, and no 
               <br />
               reply has been received. There is no excuse, none 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman I understand, Maj or Cashin, that 
               <br />
               the reply to that question will be received this 
               <br />
               afternoon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Thanks very much. Now with re- 
               <br />
               spect to the Savings Bank one, what about that? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman All I can say is there has been 
               <br />
               no indifference or inertia. Every time it has been 
               <br />
               drawn to our attention it has been taken up, and 
               <br />
               it has been forwarded to the High Commissioner 
               <br />
               for Canada, with the request that he should 
               <br />
               telegraph the question to Canada, and ask for an 
               <br />
               immediate reply. I don’t know whether that has 
               <br />
               been done. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin The last time I brought that up was 
               <br />
               Monday, and Captain Warren said he got in touch 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Carew, and he got in touch with the High 
               <br />
               Commissioner and all that has been done. What 
               <br />
               is the position supposing we don’t get a reply? 
               <br />
               Are we to continue discussing the matter when 
               <br />
               we don’t know what is going to happen to $20 
               <br />
               million belonging to our people? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman All I can say is that we will go 
               <br />
               back again. We can only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try.</span> Captain Warren, can 
               <br />
               you go back this afternoon and say that this reply 
               <br />
               is urgent? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I suppose this House will close this 
               <br />
               afternoon until Monday, and I think we should 
               <br />
               have a reply then. Is it possible for us to get a 
               <br />
               deﬁnite answer as to whether a reply can be had 
               <br />
               on Monday? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Will you please get in touch 
               <br />
               with them, Captain Warren, and will you please 
               <br />
               be good enough to put it up to them that way, so 
               <br />
               that we can know where we are. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I think the Convention and the 
               <br />
               country are entitled to it. 
               <br />
