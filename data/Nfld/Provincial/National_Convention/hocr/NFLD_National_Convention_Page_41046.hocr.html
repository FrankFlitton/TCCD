               frankly the difference in the expenditure from the

               one we made up rather puzzles me. The ﬁrst gave

               an accounting for expenditure of $13,920,000.

               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, when we ad- 
               <br />
               joumed yesterday, I was referring to budgets that 
               <br />
               had been made by the delegation prior to their 
               <br />
               going to Ottawa in June... Now we made two 
               <br />
               “guesstimates” going to Ottawa, one was to do 
               <br />
               with expenditures and one with revenue. There 
               <br />
               has been a difference in both these budgets, from 
               <br />
               the ones we made up and the ones that are before 
               <br />
               you today, and it is in that connection that I would 
               <br />
               like some explanation... Now if you will begin 
               <br />
               on page 56 of the Black Book, part II, you will 
               <br />
               probably follow me a little more intelligently. It 
               <br />
               is “Probable Division of Existing Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Public Expenditures”.... 
               <br />
               (Mr. Higgins then went on to compare the es- 
               <br />
               timates of probable provincial expenditures and 
               <br />
               revenues prepared by the Ottawa delegation and 
               <br />
               printed in the Black Book, with the estimates 
               <br />
               submitted by Mr. Smallwood on December 8] 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">....1</span> merely draw your attention to these [chan- 
               <br />
               ges] because frankly the way it appears to me is 
               <br />
               this: that when these estimates were made up by 
               <br />
               the committee going away, they did the best they 
               <br />
               could with what they had. They had no clerical 
               <br />
               help from the department concerned, even 
               <br />
               though application was made, but we did the best 
               <br />
               we could. Now I submit to Mr. Smallwood that 
               <br />
               he was faced with increased expenditure, and he 
               <br />
               had to ﬁnd increased revenue for it, and he has 
               <br />
               apparently stepped up the ﬁgures that the com- 
               <br />
               mittee prepared, and I would like an explanation 
               <br />
               as to why he did mat. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               has gone to great trouble to compare the estimates

               of revenue and expenditure made up by the Ot-

               tawa delegation before we went to Ottawa, with 
               <br />
               the estimates of revenue and expenditure that I 
               <br />
               brought in here on Monday. Frankly I do not see 
               <br />
               the point. l do not see what point there is in 
               <br />
               comparing two things which are not comparable. 
               <br />
               Before we went to Ottawa we felt that we ought 
               <br />
               to have some idea of how much money the 
               <br />
               Government of Newfoundland would have to 
               <br />
               spend each year, if we became a province, and 
               <br />
               what would likely be the revenue to go towards 
               <br />
               that expense. We felt that we ought to do that. We 
               <br />
               did it according to the best of our knowledge at 
               <br />
               that time. We spent three months in Ottawa, and 
               <br />
               we learned a lot, and on the basis ofwhat I learned 
               <br />
               I brought in here on Monday estimates of what 
               <br />
               the Province ofNewfoundland would likely have 
               <br />
               to spend per year. and estimates of what the 
               <br />
               revenue from all sources would likely be.... What 
               <br />
               relation there is or can be between the two, apart 
               <br />
               from a purely academic relationship, 1 fail to see.

               three weeks the estimates of expenditure and
