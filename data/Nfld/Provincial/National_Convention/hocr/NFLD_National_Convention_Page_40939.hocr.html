               <br />
               conversation while we were walking the streets. 
               <br />
               But Commander Edwards was in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               years ago and spent four days on the Gaff Topsail 
               <br />
               stuck in the snow, and he has been down around 
               <br />
               the lighthouses and wireless stations, and you 
               <br />
               know half of these things in Newfoundland are 
               <br />
               looked after by the Canadian government. He is 
               <br />
               the Deputy Minister of Transport, and what he 
               <br />
               said to me was just between ourselves and is not

               you to say that this ship or ferry that they are 
               <br />
               going to put on the Gulf is going to cost $2.5 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Ballam Yes, but that’s a small one to start. 
               <br />
               They have a $6-7 million one at Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island; but it would be foolish to build a big one 
               <br />
               and put it on the Gulf when we have not the cars, 
               <br />

               difﬁcult. For example they are not exempted

               from jury service as the ordinary civil servant 
               <br />
               would be, but in all other respects they are 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely government employees, because the 
               <br />
               Railway is a utility owned and operated by the 
               <br />
               government, and they have not even bothered to 
               <br />
               superimpose upon the railway operation the 
               <br />

               foundland Broadcasting Corporation, however,

               that is something entirely different. I do suggest
