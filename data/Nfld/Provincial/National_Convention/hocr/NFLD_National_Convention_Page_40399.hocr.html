               In view of the voluminous nature of this

               report, I suggest it be divided for reading and 
               <br />
               debating purposes into 12 sections which I shall 
               <br />
               define as we proceed. The ﬁrst section for treat— 
               <br />
               ment in this manner is on pages 1~15 of the report 
               <br />

               one omission I made when introducing this

               <br />

               year, so that last year that plant paid $234,000 to

               Can Mr. Job give us any idea of what those 
               <br />
               corresponding ﬁgures might be in 1947, taking 
               <br />
               that plant as being subject to the same conditions 
               <br />
               as other plants throughout the country? I am 
               <br />
               trying to get the position generally for the fresh 
               <br />
               fish industry in 1947. Could you give us an

               outline of what it might be? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job It is impossible to give any outline; we 
               <br />
               do not know what the position is going to be. We 
               <br />
               have not made any contracts. The American 
               <br />
               market at the present time is in a bad condition. 
               <br />
               The British market has not purchased any fish. It 
               <br />
               is utterly impossible to make any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commitments.</span> 
               <br />
               I would not risk stating what I think would hap- 
               <br />
               pen. We are all hoping that if we get a contract in 
               <br />
               the United States and if the American market 
               <br />
               recovers, we will produce on the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scale.</span> It is

               Mr. Smallwood Where was most of the fresh 
               <br />
               fish sold in 1946? What I am trying to get at is 
               <br />
               this -— you mention the United States and the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom — the United Kingdom is still 
               <br />
               in the picture, is it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Page 13 of the report shows the 
               <br />
               amounts which went to the different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">markets.</span> I 
               <br />
               question whether a great deal more went to the 
               <br />
               States than to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Here it shows 7.5 million pounds ex- 
               <br />
               ported to Canada — some of that was trans- 
               <br />
               shipped to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I do not want Mr. Job to say 
               <br />
               more than he can, but I am trying to get the fresh 
               <br />
               ﬁsh prospects for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1947-48.</span> The position today is 
               <br />
               you can sell to the United Kingdom and United 
               <br />
               States and some to Canada; a lot of what went to 
               <br />
               Canada was re-sold to the United States? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job 90% of it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Job is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well«in~</span> 
               <br />
               formed on this business —- he is actually in it, 
               <br />
               how much are we likely to sell in 1947 to Great 
               <br />
               Britain and the United States? You say no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> 
               <br />
               tracts are made ~ is not that really late? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No.</span> This is about the time we make 
               <br />
               contracts with Great Britain; as a rule there have 
               <br />
               not been any contracts made ahead with the 
               <br />
               United States. The position there is very bad. 
               <br />
               There is a tremendous amount of ﬁllets in cold 
               <br />
               storage and until that is disposed of, it is impos- 
               <br />
               sible to gauge the US market in the future. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood How is the price shaping? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Very low, there has been a drop in 
               <br />
               prices. I do not want to talk about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood On page 15 of your main report
