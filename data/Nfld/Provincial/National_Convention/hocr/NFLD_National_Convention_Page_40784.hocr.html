               there are two documents that concern us most. 
               <br />
               One is the report of the Royal Commission of 
               <br />
               1933 under the chairmanship of Lord Amulree... 
               <br />

               <br />
               have nothing to do with that at all. 
               <br />

               <br />
               draw some comparisons with condition of the 
               <br />
               country when Lord Amulree made that report? 
               <br />

               Mr. Miller To this I might add as a sidekick the 
               <br />
               report of Chadwick and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jones?</span> Now, if I make 
               <br />
               comparisons, this Amulree Report, it presents a 
               <br />
               story of conditions and reasons therefore. Sub- 
               <br />
               mitted in the report are plain admissions that we 
               <br />
               are not self-supporting and it makes recommen- 
               <br />
               dations for its correction. Our Economic Report 
               <br />
               takes into consideration the results of these 
               <br />
               recommendations, or as we know it better, the 
               <br />
               reconstruction programme of Commission of 
               <br />
               Government up to and including the war period, 
               <br />
               and assessing this latter period as well. It deals 
               <br />
               with our main industries, our revenue, and refers 
               <br />
               to the fact that our national debt, $101 million in 
               <br />
               1933, is down to $35 million in 1947. It gives our 
               <br />
               deposits in the bank, $26 million in 1933, at an 
               <br />
               all time high of $80 million today. It is helpful 
               <br />
               then, and interesting to make these comparisons.
