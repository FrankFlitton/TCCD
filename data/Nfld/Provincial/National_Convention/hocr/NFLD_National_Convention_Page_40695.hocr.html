               Mr. Chairman, I call this document a budget, 
               <br />
               because that is exactly what it is. It sets out what, 
               <br />
               in the opinion of the Committee, will be the 
               <br />
               necessary expenditures of the government, and 
               <br />
               what, in their opinion, will be the revenues that 
               <br />
               the government will get to meet those expendi- 
               <br />
               tures. Now there’s this to be said about budgets 
               <br />
               in this country: in the period from 1920 to 1932, 
               <br />
               we had a number of very notable New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders who occupied the position of 
               <br />
               ﬁnance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minister.</span> We had Mr. H. J, Brownrigg, 
               <br />
               Sir Richard Squires, Mr. W.H. Cave, Sir John 
               <br />
               Crosbie, the Hon. P.J. Cashin, and the Hon. RC. 
               <br />
               Alderdice, and each of them introduced his 
               <br />
               budget. Now the difference between their 
               <br />
               budgets and this one that the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               has introduced is that those budgets only looked 
               <br />
               ahead for one year whereas this budget goes a 
               <br />
               lot further than that, because it attempts to 
               <br />
               forecast three year’ s expenditure and three years' 
               <br />
               revenue. If, therefore, it was a hazardous and 
               <br />
               dangerous thing for the ﬁnance ministers to 
               <br />
               forecast for a year, how much more hazardous 
               <br />
               and dangerous is it to forecast for three years? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let us look at just how dangerous it is to 
               <br />
               forecast even forcne year. In 1920-21 the Hon. 
               <br />
               H. J. Brownrigg made his budget, and he forecast 
               <br />
               a surplus of $200,000.... But what happened?... 
               <br />
               When the year was over he had a deﬁcit of $2.5 
               <br />
               million. Well, in the next year Mr. Brownrigg 
               <br />
               was not well, so the Prime Minister had to act as 
               <br />
               ﬁnance minister — Sir Richard Squires ——- and 
               <br />
               he brought in his estimate for the next year.... The 
               <br />
               forecast he made for 1921-22 was a surplus of 
               <br />
               $96,000, but when that year ended they found 
               <br />
               that they had a deﬁcit of $867,000.... Well then, 
               <br />
               in the next year Sir Richard Squires was ﬁnance 
               <br />
               minister again. On that occasion Mr. Brownrigg 
               <br />
               was in New York, so the Prime Minister brought 
               <br />
               down the budget, and what he forecast was a 
               <br />
               surplus of $108,000, but when the year was over 
               <br />
               he had a deﬁcit of $675,000. In the next year the 
               <br />
               ﬁnance minister was the Hon. W. H. Cave. He 
               <br />
               said that [there would be] a surplus of $43,000. 
               <br />
               When the year was over they had a deﬁcit of 
               <br />
               $1,620,000, so his guess was not very good. Then 
               <br />
               in 1924-25 the late Sir John Crosbie became 
               <br />
               ﬁnance minister, in my opinion one of the best 
               <br />
               finance ministers we ever had. Sir John Crosbie 
               <br />
               estimated a surplus of $105,000. When the year

               <br />
               in 1925-26, Sir John forecast a surplus of 
               <br />
               $207,000, and he had a deﬁcit, I am afraid, of 
               <br />
               $112,000.... For the year 1926-27 he brought in 
               <br />
               an estimate of a surplus of $300,000, and they had 
               <br />
               a deﬁcit of $1.6 million instead. Then 1927-28 
               <br />
               rolls around, and Sir John made another estimate, 
               <br />
               a very large surplus of $845,000, and when the 
               <br />
               year was over there was a deﬁcit of $ 1 .25 million. 
               <br />
               The last year he brought in his budget, 1928-29, 
               <br />
               he estimated for a deﬁcit of $268,000. When the 
               <br />
               year was over he had the deﬁcit all right, and it 
               <br />
               was $1.1 million. The next year was 1929-30, and 
               <br />
               the present chairman of the Finance Committee, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> P. J. Cashin, was the minister. I was in 
               <br />
               the gallery there and I heard him deliver his 
               <br />
               budget speech, and he did it with real gusto and 
               <br />
               it was a pleasure to hear him deliver that 
               <br />
               speech... He estimated a deﬁcit of $187,000. He 
               <br />
               was the second ﬁnance minister to estimate a 
               <br />
               deﬁcit, but he was the ﬁrst ﬁnance minister in the 
               <br />
               history of Newfoundland who estimated a deﬁcit 
               <br />
               and turned up with a surplus of $144,000. That 
               <br />
               was his ﬁrst budget. His next budget was 1930- 
               <br />
               31; he forecast a deﬁcit of $27,000.... When the 
               <br />
               year was over he had a deficit of $3,242,000.

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, did it in style no doubt.

               Well then, in 1931-32 he estimated a deﬁcit of 
               <br />
               $1,456,000, and I suppose he ﬁgured, “That will 
               <br />
               certainly cover any deﬁcit that we can possibly 
               <br />
               have”, but when the year was over their deﬁcit 
               <br />
               was $4 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> I can’t help remembering that in 
               <br />
               his ﬁrst budget Major Cashin, stated to the House 
               <br />
               and to this country: “The outlook for the future I 
               <br />
               regard as decidedly encouraging”, and he lived 
               <br />
               to see the greatest deﬁcits that Newfoundland had
