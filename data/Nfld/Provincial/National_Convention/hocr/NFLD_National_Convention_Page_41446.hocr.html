               The people of Newfoundland, sir, have 
               <br />
               learned a great many things in late years, and they 
               <br />
               have begun to realise that we are too small a 
               <br />
               country to stand alone. We have a small popula— 
               <br />
               tion scattered over a very large area. We do not 
               <br />
               have a large variety of natural resources. Our 
               <br />
               whole economy depends upon three industries —— 
               <br />
               ﬁshery, forestry and minerals. No doubt our 
               <br />
               ﬁshery could stand further development, and we 
               <br />
               may some day see more mineral developments 
               <br />
               than we now have; but it is doubtful if we shall 
               <br />
               see any marked increase in our forestry develop- 
               <br />
               ment. Except for our paper mills, we have no 
               <br />
               highly developed industry. We are a country of 
               <br />
               primary production. We still have to depend too 
               <br />
               much on one industry, the ﬁsheries, and when 
               <br />
               something happens to upset that industry our 
               <br />
               whole economy suffers. We still have too many 
               <br />
               eggs in one basket, so to speak. When one goes 
               <br />
               down, they all go down and our people are left

               What we have to beware of, Mr. Chairman, is

               another depression. Some of our members here

               assure us that we need not fear another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depres«</span>

               sion. They have told us that there are no shadows

               sincerely hope they are; but can we depend on our

               not having another depression? I do not think we 
               <br />
               can. That is one of the dangers we must keep in 
               <br />
               mind. For if another depression strikes us, and we 
               <br />
               are on our own trying to paddle our own canoe,

               <br />
               we must bear in mind when the vote is taken on 
               <br />
               this motion. We all know what conditions were 
               <br />
               like in 1933 and up until the last great war. We 
               <br />
               have very vivid memories of our people trying to 
               <br />
               exist on six cents a day, and many who were 
               <br />
               unwilling to accept relief, working for almost 
               <br />

               <br />
               haps it would not. But as part of a larger country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               with free trade with that country, the lower cost

               of living would better ﬁt us to meet a depression 
               <br />
               if it came; and if under confederation a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depres‘</span> 
               <br />
               sion did come, the Canadian family allowance 
               <br />
               would see to it that our children under 16 years 
               <br />
               of age have something better than six cents a day 
               <br />
               to look forward to; and the increased old age 
               <br />
               pension would guarantee our old people who 
               <br />
               needed it a fair share of the necessities of life. I 
               <br />
               am afraid the answer to all these questions is 
               <br />
               already known to our people. Our people have 
               <br />
               already asked themselves these questions, sir, 
               <br />
               and they have already answered them as well. 
               <br />
               And that is why so many thousands of them have 
               <br />
               made up their minds to vote for confederation.
