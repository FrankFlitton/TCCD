               Now the ﬁrst matter which engaged our 
               <br />
               attention was the question of whether New- 
               <br />
               foundland was self-supporting. The Report 
               <br />
               of the Finance Committee of this Convention 
               <br />
               indicates that we are. In 1945 the Secretary 
               <br />
               of State for Dominion Affairs, according to 
               <br />
               the British Hansard, stated in the British 
               <br />
               House of Commons that Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               self-supporting. And Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Finance Wild, when he appeared before this 
               <br />
               Convention one year ago, distinctly stated 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland was self-supporting. 
               <br />
               During the discussions of the delegation from 
               <br />
               this National Convention to London with 
               <br />
               Lord Addison, he told us the same thing. We 
               <br />
               think therefore that we can, without further 
               <br />
               discussion, accept the fact that New- 
               <br />
               foundland is now a self-supporting country.

               But the terms of reference of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion contain the following qualiﬁcation: “to 
               <br />
               consider our present financial position hear- 
               <br />
               ing in mind the extent to which the high 
               <br />
               revenues of recent years have been due to war 
               <br />
               time conditions.” In this connection we have 
               <br />
               the following observations to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make,</span> In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place the war has now been over for over 
               <br />
               two years and we find our revenues even 
               <br />
               greater than our highest war time revenues. 
               <br />
               Now, making every allowance for the 
               <br />
               momentum of war expenditures, carrying on 
               <br />
               after the close of hostilities, and allowing for 
               <br />
               the gradual recession of this boom period, it 
               <br />
               is yet an obvious fact that our present 
               <br />
               revenues cannot be something dependent on 
               <br />
               war boom. There must be some other cause, 
               <br />
               and on examining the matter further we 
               <br />
               found that a great portion of our present 
               <br />
               revenue is coming to us because of the 
               <br />
               growth of our main industries. Now, these 
               <br />
               industries are wholly peace industries and are 
               <br />
               not dependent for their prosperity on war 
               <br />
               conditions. It is clear merefore that we can 
               <br />
               properly regard our present revenues as being 
               <br />
               anything but a result of war boom...

               In view of the above, we feel that it is not

               beyond the province of our report to conclude 
               <br />
               with the observation that it would seem to 
               <br />
               your Committee, in reviewing their inves- 
               <br />
               tigations, that it is to be regretted that the list 
               <br />
               of our assets does not contain in greater quan- 
               <br />
               tity, one which we cannot place in the 
               <br />
               columns of our Economic Report; we mean 
               <br />
               faith in ourselves, the faith and conﬁdence 
               <br />
               which every man owes to himself and his 
               <br />
               country. This lack of faith, of course, is not 
               <br />
               so with all of us. Our farmers cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> 
               <br />
               stand the mystery of growth, yet by faith they 
               <br />
               cast their seed into the earth and God gives a 
               <br />
               bountiful harvest. Our fisherman knows not 
               <br />
               the fortunes which await him on the bosom 
               <br />
               of our waters, but each year ﬁnds him ready 
               <br />
               to venture with faith and conﬁdence upon his 
               <br />
               quest, and it is proper that this should be so. 
               <br />
               For faith and trust are in the inescapable laws 
               <br />
               of both individuals and nations. To use the

               words of the late President Roosevelt, “We
