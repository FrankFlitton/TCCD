               Sir, [am against responsible government com- 
               <br />
               ing back to Newfoundland. In principle, I think 
               <br />
               responsible government is right, but in practice, 
               <br />
               I think it is wrong. I think if we went back to 
               <br />
               responsible government we would bring misery 
               <br />
               and suffering on our people. I think it would be a 
               <br />
               terrible gamble to take. When I say that respon- 
               <br />
               sible government is all right in principle, I mean 
               <br />
               that all people should have the right of self-

               power to put them out if they don't do right. But 
               <br />
               when I say that responsible government is all 
               <br />
               wrong in practice, what I mean is that I see no 
               <br />
               chance whatever that responsible government 
               <br />
               would be any better for us than it was those last

               Under responsible government our country 
               <br />
               went <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">broken“</span> Our govemment’s credit was gone 
               <br />
               — we were bankrupt and insolvent. Our people 
               <br />
               were on the dole in the tens of thousands. Our 
               <br />
               children went hungry and naked. Our standard of 
               <br />
               health fell very low, and TB increased by leaps 
               <br />
               and bounds. I see no chance at all that we could 
               <br />
               ever keep clear of those same terrible conditions 
               <br />
               if we went back to responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment, which means that Newfoundland has cut

               herself clear of close organic connection with any 
               <br />
               other country. Under responsible government we 
               <br />
               would be on our own, without help from 
               <br />
               anyone. We tried that before, and where did we 
               <br />
               end? I, for one, am not willing to go through all 
               <br />
               that misery again, and I don’t think our people are 
               <br />
               willing to try that again, for a “burnt child dreads 
               <br />
               the ﬁre”. Where would people be once our little 
               <br />
               cash surplus was all gone? Where would we turn 
               <br />
               then for help? It is no use anyone telling me we 
               <br />
               would never need help, because I don’t believe 
               <br />
               it. When the price of ﬁsh falls, as fall it will; when 
               <br />
               the icy blast of depression strikes again, as it will;
