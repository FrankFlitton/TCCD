               <br />
               The replies have just arrived, and have been 
               <br />
               placed on my desk by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Secretary,</span>

               Mr. Chairman Do they have any hearing on 
               <br />
               this? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Oh entirely, sir. If you remem- 
               <br />
               ber, I gave notice on Thursday past that I would 
               <br />
               ask His Excellency the Governor in Commission 
               <br />
               to furnish the Convention with a statement show- 
               <br />
               ing the amount of the accumulated cash surplus 
               <br />
               of the Government of Newfoundland, up to 31 
               <br />
               March, 1947. You will remember my reason for 
               <br />
               asking that question. Mr. MacDonald from 
               <br />
               Grand Falls drew the attention of Major Cashin 
               <br />
               to the fact that whereas in the Economic Report 
               <br />
               it was stated that our surplus is $35 million, there 
               <br />
               were other statements appearing in print saying 
               <br />
               that the surplus was $28 million. Major Cashin 
               <br />
               explained why he put the ﬁgure in the report, or 
               <br />
               why his Committee put it in the report, at $35 
               <br />
               million. He hoped that the house was satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with his explanation. Apparently it was, with one 
               <br />
               exception. I was not satisﬁed, and I said so. I 
               <br />
               therefore gave that notice of question to the 
               <br />
               Governor in Commission, to ask what is the 
               <br />
               amount. Is it $35 million? Is it $28 million? Or 
               <br />
               what is it? Here is the reply, sir. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman May I see it ﬁrst? I am not 
               <br />
               questioning that, but is there a covering letter? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes sir, there is a covering let- 
               <br />
               ter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman This is in reply to the question 
               <br />
               forwarded on my instmctions under rule 39, by 
               <br />
               letter of November 15 to the Secretary of

               I asked, you may recall, for the ﬁgures for the 31

               March last, and also for the 31 December last, and

               <br />
               not available. I don't know if Major Cashin has 
               <br />
               had a copy of this sent him or not. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin No, I don‘t need it. ldon't require

               them, I know all about it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The accumulated surplus at 31

               March was $28,645,800. Now the sinking fund. 
               <br />
               I was rather shocked by the statement of Major 
               <br />
               Cashin that Newfoundland has been plundered of 
               <br />
               an amount of $1,750,000 on our sinking fund. If 
               <br />
               that can be shown to be true, the persons respon~ 
               <br />
               sible must go to gaol. If anyone has plundered 
               <br />
               Newfoundland of $1,750,000, the guilty parties 
               <br />
               should go to gaol or there is nojustice. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I agree with you.

               Mr. Smallwood So being shocked and surprised 
               <br />
               by that rather startling statement I gave notice of 
               <br />

               sterling debt, the debt that is guaranteed by the
