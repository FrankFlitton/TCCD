               I said, Mr. Chairman, concessions like these 
               <br />
               might make it worthwhile, on a ﬁnancial basis, 
               <br />
               to enter confederation. And why not conces- 
               <br />
               sions? We are not bankrupt as in 1895; we are not 
               <br />
               a shaky, insecure colony as in 1867. We are 
               <br />
               today, in 1947, comparatively well-off with 
               <br />
               many of the characteristics of a nation. We 
               <br />
               deserve special inducements to get us to forsake 
               <br />
               our traditional independence and our economic 
               <br />
               sovereignty. But we are not getting them; we are 
               <br />
               not even offered them. We are handed something 
               <br />
               and told to take it or leave it: “the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada believes that the arrangements go as far 
               <br />
               as the government can go under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstan'</span> 
               <br />
               ces”. The confederates have been preaching that 
               <br />
               if we do not take it, then we are doomed and 
               <br />
               damned. That is their propaganda. New- 
               <br />
               foundland has no future. her future is built on 
               <br />
               sand, she must clutch this Canadian straw or go 
               <br />
               down in the financial whirlpool. They are not 
               <br />
               arguing for confederation on its merits; they are 
               <br />
               trying to press their case by aiming to prove that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is headed for ruin otherwise 
               <br />
               They are apparently blind -—— conveniently so ~— 
               <br />
               to the fact that as yet Newfoundland has not been 
               <br />
               able to ask the United States for any concessions 
               <br />
               — concessions, it is needless to point out, that 
               <br />
               could only be sought and secured by a sovereign 
               <br />
               government of the Newfoundland people.

               I say again, Mr. Chairman, there should be 
               <br />
               special concessions before we should, in our

               Yet there are none, and they call them generous 
               <br />

               <br />
               call them “terms" — nowhere in any of the docu-

               that doesn’t mean very much. I can arrange for 
               <br />
               you to become a member of my club, but I do not

               guarantee that if you accept, you will become its

               kind, we would have to agree on terms for that. 
               <br />
               We should not be using that word “terms” so 
               <br />
               glibly; neither should we be using the word 
               <br />
               “generous” in connection with them. They are 
               <br />
               not generous, neither should they be. “Fair”, yes; 
               <br />
               “equitable”, yes, if they are (which I doubt); but 
               <br />
               “generous” —— not We do not want generosity. 
               <br />
               Some of our people may be looking for a handout, 
               <br />
               but most of them are not, I believe. As Major 
               <br />
               Cashin said, Newfoundland’s entry into con- 
               <br />
               federation is a going into partnership. Partners 
               <br />
               are equals, at least that’s how I always understood 
               <br />
               it. Partners do not expect generosity from each 
               <br />
               other. They expect co-operation. They expect 
               <br />
               each other to accept equal responsibilities, 
               <br />
               receive equal gains, share equal losses. Apartner- 
               <br />
               ship is not one-sided. One partner does not get all 
               <br />
               the beneﬁts and the other take all the risks. It is 
               <br />
               like marriage, or like marriage is supposed to be. 
               <br />
               Of course, there’s divorce from marriage in 
               <br />
               Canada, but not in Newfoundland. We have not 
               <br />
               heard much about that yet. But there is no divorce 
               <br />
               from confederation - it is final, it is forever. You 
               <br />
               cannot try it for ten or 15 years, like Commission 
               <br />
               or responsible government, and then change. No, 
               <br />
               sir, you are stuck with it. 
               <br />

               But getting back to partnership and confedera-

               tion between Canada and Newfoundland as an 
               <br />
               arrangement between equals, these so-called 
               <br />
               terms are, as far as I can see, a one-sided affair. 
               <br />
               If anyone is going to beneﬁt from confederation, 
               <br />
               it is going to be Canada. We will get a few paltry 
               <br />
               millions in family allowances, old age pensions, 
               <br />
               and other subsidies which will cease after the first 
               <br />
               eight years of union; and Canada will get control 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland and Labrador. There will pass 
               <br />
               into her hands the control of one of the most 
               <br />
               strategic areas of the earth with all that implies in 
               <br />
               these days. What she pays into Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will return in time to her a hundredfold from the 
               <br />
               exploitation of that strategic position, and the 
               <br />
               tremendous bargaining power that will accrue to 
               <br />
               her in dealing with the United States in particular, 
               <br />
               by virtue of air bases like Gander and Goose; the 
               <br />
               United States bases; the immense iron and 
               <br />
               mineral deposits of Labrador. In regard to the 
               <br />
               Labrador, the Privy Council heard the case on the 
               <br />
               boundary in 1926; their judgement was handed 
               <br />
               down in 1927, giving Newfoundland 110,000 
               <br />
               square miles. Early in 1928, Senator C.E. Tanner
