               bring those terms back with us, but they were sent 
               <br />
               down through the Governor. Nobody can deny 
               <br />
               that it was our visit to Ottawa and our work in 
               <br />
               Ottawa that secured these terms. It was not until 
               <br />
               they were read out in this chamber that we really 
               <br />
               knew for sure just what the terms would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be.</span> But 
               <br />
               it was impossible for us to be there all that time, 
               <br />
               and to be meeting almost every day with the 
               <br />
               Canadian ministers or ofﬁcials, without getting a 
               <br />
               pretty shrewd idea of what the terms were going 
               <br />
               to be like. But we held our peace... We wouldn’t 
               <br />
               say a word until they came here in writing... 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think these terms are pretty fair. We were 
               <br />
               told by these gentlemen in Ottawa that no other 
               <br />
               body, even an elected government, or the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government, could not get better 
               <br />
               terms: that these were the best terms available at 
               <br />
               this particular time. There's no reason that they 
               <br />
               can’t be sort of added to at some future time.... If 
               <br />
               you look at the thing fairly and squarely, I think 
               <br />
               that even the Major knows in his heart and soul 
               <br />
               that they’re very good, and that it would be the 
               <br />
               best thing for the people in this country. I do not 
               <br />
               think that everything would be perfect if we 
               <br />
               became a province, it could not be, but there 
               <br />
               would be a great many improvements. The bulk 
               <br />
               of our people would be better off, and that is the 
               <br />
               most important thing. I think most family men 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd it easier to bring up their families, and 
               <br />
               our younger generation would have a better 
               <br />
               chance in life. I think the working man would 
               <br />
               have a better chance, although our working men 
               <br />
               are doing very well, I must say....

               It was not my ﬁrst visit to Canada, Mr. Chair~ 
               <br />
               man, but while we were there last summer we 
               <br />
               were given every opportunity to see a very large 
               <br />
               section of it. We certainly saw enough to see 
               <br />
               what a great country Canada really is. I’m sure 
               <br />
               that there’s nobody can deny that Canada is a 
               <br />
               really great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country...</span> By joining with Canada 
               <br />
               we’re still going to be Newfoundlanders. You 
               <br />
               can’t take that out of us. I think we were patriotic, 
               <br />
               although we were told that we weren’t patriotic, 
               <br />
               we were called Judas Iscariot and God knows 
               <br />
               else. I and my three brothers served overseas in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst war and I had two people serving in this 
               <br />
               war. That is a patriotism of one form, and there’s 
               <br />
               another form of patriotism, and that’s being truth- 
               <br />
               ful and sincere and honest with your fellow man. 
               <br />

               federation is the better thing for most people in 
               <br />
               this country, then I think I’m being patriotic, and 
               <br />
               I’m being sincere and honest with the people of 
               <br />
               the country.... We never went back on our 
               <br />
               country, I can guarantee you that.... But at the 
               <br />
               same time, we were all very deeply impressed by 
               <br />
               Canada’s greatness, by her progressive methods, 
               <br />
               by her wide-awake system of doing things. 
               <br />
               There’s one thing that strikes my mind very 
               <br />
               much, Mr. Chairman, and that is the fact that if 
               <br />
               we decide to tie on with that great country, things 
               <br />
               will have to fall pretty low indeed for New- 
               <br />
               foundland to go under. If we become a province 
               <br />
               of Canada, all that big country will have to fail 
               <br />
               for us to fail. That’s a very important thing, and 
               <br />
               it doesn’t seem that Canada is going to fail very 
               <br />
               soon. Although Canada may not always be 
               <br />
               blessed by the wonderful prosperity they have 
               <br />
               right now, I find it impossible to believe that she 
               <br />
               will ever go under. I look to see her go onward 
               <br />
               and upward to ever greater things in the future. I 
               <br />
               regard Canada as one of the coming powers of 
               <br />
               the world, and I honestly believe that if we link 
               <br />
               our fortunes with hers, we’ll go up with her. 
               <br />
               There’s one thing about Canada more then any- 
               <br />
               thing else that impresses my mind, and that is the 
               <br />
               wonderful way in which she backed the old 
               <br />
               country in this last war, and since the war ended. 
               <br />
               There’s no country in the world doing better.... 
               <br />
               There’s one thing about confederation that satis— 
               <br />
               ﬁes my mind, and that is the fact that Canada is 
               <br />
               a great British nation — don’t forget. It’s true that 
               <br />
               there is great friendship between Canada and the 
               <br />
               United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States...</span> But Canada is still British and 
               <br />
               proud of it. If we do decide to join up with 
               <br />
               Canada, it’s a British nation we’d be joining. 
               <br />
               There are many things about confederation 
               <br />
               that we would be a while getting used to. Canada 
               <br />
               is something like the United States in her form of 
               <br />
               government, she is a federal union. She’s really 
               <br />
               nine countries in one, and she’d be ten countries 
               <br />
               in one if we get in, only they don’t call themselves 
               <br />
               countries, they call themselves <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces...I</span> It is 
               <br />
               very much like the Newfoundland Federation of 
               <br />
               Labour, which is a federation of unions, or a 
               <br />
               federal union in itself. This union runs its own 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show.</span> There are certain matters that are too big 
               <br />
               for an individual union to run, and that’s why they 
               <br />
               associate with the federal union. That’s how it is 
               <br />
               with the Canadian federal union. Each province 
               <br />
