               <br />

               in g just brieﬂy to Mr. Miller, the Americans were 
               <br />
               not paying those low wages in Argentia very 
               <br />
               long. I had that interview with Sir Wilfred Woods 
               <br />
               just a few months after the Americans went into 
               <br />
               Argentia, and that letter he wrote to the 
               <br />
               magistrate in Placentia was written some time 
               <br />
               before I saw him. In other words that letter was 
               <br />
               written to Magistrate Linegar or whoever was the 
               <br />
               magistrate, just after or just around the time that 
               <br />
               the Americans went into Argentia. When I went 
               <br />
               to Argentia ﬁrst, they were just barely beginning. 
               <br />
               I’ll never forget the second time I went there, 
               <br />
               watching a great army of trucks removing a hill 
               <br />
               and dumping it out in the water to build an 
               <br />
               embankment. And, as I watched, one of the truck 
               <br />
               drivers pulling up to be loaded gave me a nod to 
               <br />
               come aboard and I got up and sat in the cab with 
               <br />
               him. And I made the circle ﬁve or six times. He 
               <br />
               was an American, we chatted. He said, “Are you 
               <br />
               a Newﬁe?” I said, “I’m a Newfie, yes.” He said, 
               <br />
               “It’s a darn scandal, it’s a darn shame the way you 
               <br />
               people are being treated here.“ I said, “Why?” He 
               <br />
               said, “I’m getting $1.80 an hour for driving that 
               <br />
               truck. You see the truck right behind me?” I said, 
               <br />
               “Yes.” “It’s a Newfoundlander, a Newfie driving 
               <br />
               it. You see the truck in front of me?” I said, 
               <br />
               “Yes.” “It’s a Newfie driving that. Here we are, 
               <br />
               three of us, two Newfies, one American, driving 
               <br />
               the same trucks, doing the same work, one be- 
               <br />
               hind, one in front and one in the middle. I'm 
               <br />
               getting $1.80 an hour and they’re getting 80 cents 
               <br />
               an hour and from all I can hear your own govern- 
               <br />
               ment is the cause of it." “Well“, I said, “you heard 
               <br />
               right because I got it right straight from the

               deplore the action and make a positive statement

               that it was the action of the Commission of
