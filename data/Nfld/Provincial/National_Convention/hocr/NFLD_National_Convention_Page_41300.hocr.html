               “Because of its freshness and quality, there is a 
               <br />
               strong demand for Newfoundland fish.” I direct 
               <br />
               your attention to the note on page 2 relative to 
               <br />
               fresh~frozen ﬁsh: “The head of the National 
               <br />
               Fisheries Institute of the United States has 
               <br />
               predicted an increased consumption this year.” 
               <br />
               The explanation is that the United States 
               <br />
               authorities estimate their annual consumption for 
               <br />
               a three year period as 180,000 tons and of that, 
               <br />
               quotas permit 15% or 27 million pounds to enter 
               <br />
               the United States at the low rate of 1 7/8 cents per 
               <br />
               pound, the remainder at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2%</span> cents per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pound.</span> As 
               <br />
               the rate of consumption increases, the amount 
               <br />
               coming in at the lower rate increases. Whilst the 
               <br />
               former rate was the same, it was not bound. The 
               <br />
               agreement cannot be varied for three years and 
               <br />
               then if it is not denounced it carries on indeﬁnite- 
               <br />
               ly.... On being asked what effect this agreement 
               <br />
               would have on Newfoundland, Mr. Gushue said, 
               <br />
               “It gives security to fresh-frozen ﬁsh operators 
               <br />
               and the advantage of a quarterly quota. It will 
               <br />
               mean that more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fresh«frozen</span> fish will be 
               <br />
               produced than last year and so on from year to 
               <br />
               year. It is bound to mean increased employment." 
               <br />
               On being asked how our fresh ﬁsh business com- 
               <br />
               pared with similar kinds elsewhere, he said, 
               <br />
               “Newfoundland has made progressively greater 
               <br />
               gains than any other country. The standard of our 
               <br />
               plants is higher than that of any other country.” 
               <br />
               “This”, he said, “was conﬁrmed by two Nor- 
               <br />
               wegian experts who came here two months ago 
               <br />
               and came back again.” “They tell me", said 
               <br />
               Mr. Gushue, “that there is nothing like our plants 
               <br />
               on the North American continent."

               of a prosperous Newfoundland is of special 
               <br />
               interest owing to the fact that Newfound~ 
               <br />
               land’s imports from Canada amount to a very 
               <br />
               large percentage of the total imports into
