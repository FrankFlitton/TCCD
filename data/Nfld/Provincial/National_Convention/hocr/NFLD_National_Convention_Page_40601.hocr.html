               meeting; we asked if any effort was made to get 
               <br />
               tariff concessions in return for the bases. They did 
               <br />
               not say “no” or “yes”. With regard to their taking 
               <br />
               the matter up further, they told us plainly that if 
               <br />
               we had our own government we would be able to

               Mr. Hickman I do not wish to delay the

               <br />

               clariﬁed by the report from London. It is obvious

               there is only one solution for us. We have to get

               which Mr. Miller just raised, further discussions 
               <br />

               <br />
               that is a job for our own government. I think the

               sooner we can get on our own feet so that we can

               take up the question of the base deals with the 
               <br />
               Americans the better. Those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interesbfree</span> loans 
               <br />
               should be applied to the reduction of our debt and

               so cut down on debt services. That is important, 
               <br />
               particularly in view of the lower rate of interest

               out and ﬁght for ouselves and talk later about 
               <br />
               what we want to do. 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell ,...We know what the result of the 
               <br />
               trip to London is. We know it in clear and unmis- 
               <br />
               takable terms. We have all said it is what we 
               <br />
               expected. Perhaps there was not much else we 
               <br />
               could have expected. Responsible government 
               <br />
               means we accept responsibilty for our own af- 
               <br />
               fairs. Commission of Government means that the 
               <br />
               British government accepts responsibility for our 
               <br />
               affairs. We knew that. But it was not a waste of 
               <br />
               time to send a delegation to London. A good 
               <br />
               many points were cleared up — points which 
               <br />
               would have been indefinite if any other method 
               <br />
               had been used to seek the information. I havejust 
               <br />
               said Commission of Government means that the 
               <br />
               British government accepts responsbility for our 
               <br />
               ﬁnances. Having said that, there is a bit of a catch. 
               <br />
               Whereas the British government accepts respon- 
               <br />
               sibility for any deficits, it retains the power to see 
               <br />
               to it that we do not incur any deﬁcits. In other 
               <br />
               words, the aid we receive from the British 
               <br />
               government may mean something or it may mean 
               <br />
               nothing. And if we are to rely on the impressions 
               <br />
               brought back by the delegation to London, we are 
               <br />
               inclined to believe it will mean nothing, or very 
               <br />
               little. It is good for us to be clear on that.... 
               <br />
               Throughout our deliberations, we have al~ 
               <br />
               lowed our own personal politics to obtrude too 
               <br />
               much into the discussion, and history will 
               <br />
               remember us perhaps just as much for what we 
               <br />
               said on these occasions, as for what we did. I 
               <br />
               regret it has been found necessary in discussing 
               <br />
               the report, to have anything to say about forms of 
               <br />
               government, and that questions of politics should 
               <br />
               be dragged in again, Were it not for the fact that 
               <br />
               there has been so much political colouring to our 
               <br />
               discussions, they might have been over before 
               <br />
               this... Since, however, the question of forms of
