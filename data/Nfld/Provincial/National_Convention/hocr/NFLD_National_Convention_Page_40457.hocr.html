               market. Unless we can get something of that sort, 
               <br />
               it will be a poor situation in the future. It is all 
               <br />
               very well to say America has a big ﬁshery of its 
               <br />

               considerable quantities of frozen ﬁllets from

               on account of exchange. We are up against that

               This past number of years many of our sea 
               <br />
               fishermen proceeded to Lunenburg to engage in 
               <br />
               the deep-sea ﬁshery. The return they receive for 
               <br />

               This past year has witnessed the inauguration

               of a more modern way of ﬁshing. A large fresh

               <br />

               not surpassing, anything of its kind on the North 
               <br />
               American continent. Three fair size draggers are 
               <br />
               in operation at the plant, manned with local cap-

               brought to the old and historic town of Burin,
