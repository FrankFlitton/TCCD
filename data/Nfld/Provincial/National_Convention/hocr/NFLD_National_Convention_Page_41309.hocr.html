               responsible government, and Britain had to take 
               <br />
               us over, but ﬁrst responsible government had to 
               <br />
               go, and Commission government had to take its 
               <br />
               place. We needed help back in 1933-34 in the 
               <br />
               worst kind of way. Britain was in a position then 
               <br />
               to give us some help, in those days before she was 
               <br />
               washed up and plunged into poverty by the war; 
               <br />
               she was able to help us, and she did help us. We 
               <br />
               should be eternally grateful to her for it, and we 
               <br />

               able to help her a little bit with our money during

               I am not one of those who go around saying

               Great Britain forced Commission of Government 
               <br />
               on us in 1934, nor am I one of those who go

               <br />
               don’t think that. I am ﬁrmly convinced that she 
               <br />
               wants all of us to have a thoroughly free choice

               Britain would like to see us join up with another 
               <br />
               British country. I don’t know about that, but if 
               <br />
               she would she is not trying to force us to do it. I 
               <br />
               dare say it is true that the mother country would 
               <br />
               like us to throw in our lot with another British 
               <br />

               Sir, in the referendum I shall vote against 
               <br />
               Commission government. I am all in favour of 
               <br />
               our people having the chance to vote for Com— 
               <br />

               <br />
               think that Commission government ever can sue- 
               <br />
               ceed, nor can ever give our people the kind of 
               <br />
               government they need and want. The Commis- 
               <br />
               sion government are straight and honest. They 
               <br />
               don’t rob the public chest — of that I am quite 
               <br />
               sure. I believe they are trying to do their best, but 
               <br />
               their best is not good enough. So long as we stay 
               <br />
               under Commission form of government, or if we 
               <br />
               are under responsible government, we shall have 
               <br />
               our present unjust system of taxation. They can- 
               <br />
               not change it. This unjust system of taxation 
               <br />
               crushes the life out of our people, drives up the 
               <br />
               cost of living, and the cost of production in our 
               <br />
               main industries, makes it impossible for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland’s main industries to compete with the 
               <br />
               industries of other countries, unless they pay our 
               <br />
               producers just barely enough to exist <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on,</span> So long 
               <br />
               as we have this unjust system of taxation the only 
               <br />
               way our main industries, especially our ﬁsheries, 
               <br />
               can compete with the industries of othercountries 
               <br />
               is by paying our producers, our ﬁshermen espe- 
               <br />
               cially, a smaller share than the producers and 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen of other countries get. Our ﬁshermen

               Mr. Chairman, it matters not what form of

               just one example of what I mean. Last year, 1947, 
               <br />
               our bank ﬁshery was pretty successful. The 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen who toiled on our hi ghliner in the bank 
               <br />
               ﬁshery, the Freda M, what did they get? Around 
               <br />
               $1,550 per man. That was counted pretty good, 
               <br />
               wasn’t it? And yet what do we ﬁnd? We ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               other Fortune Bay ﬁshermen, toiling on other 
               <br />
               vessels, Nova Scotia bankers, who got about the 
               <br />
               same quantity of ﬁsh in the same year, were paid 
               <br />
               $1,000 more than the Freda M’s men, I mean 
               <br />
               $1,000 per man more —— in fact over $1,000 per 
               <br />
               man. I am not blaming the owners of the Freda
