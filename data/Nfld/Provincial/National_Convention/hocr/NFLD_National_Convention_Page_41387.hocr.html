               Responsible government is the ideal for the 
               <br />
               people of any country to strive for. I wonder if 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders are doing just that? I am sure 
               <br />

               see the peoples of many countries today, large

               <br />
               bloodshed to drive foreigners out so as to govern 
               <br />
               themselves; while we in Newfoundland with 
               <br />
               balanced budgets, a surplus, our resources barely 
               <br />
               scratched, seem afraid to govern ourselves, or too

               nevertheless it is a fact that the people of this

               businessmen and lawyers. Proper men, one

               would think, to run the affairs of this country, but 
               <br />
               the argument against these, especially in the out- 
               <br />
               ports, is the age—old prejudice of merchant versus 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman, St. John’s versus the outports. Why 
               <br />
               should St. John’s run the outports? Very narrow 
               <br />
               views, and I wish I could say they don’t exist, but 
               <br />
               unfortunately they do.

               If that is the case, someone would suggest the 
               <br />
               National Convention, a body of men elected from 
               <br />
               every district, a cross-section of many trades and 
               <br />
               professions. Surely these must be the men we 
               <br />
               have been wanting for years. But what do you 
               <br />
               hear from all parts of the country, from all classes 
               <br />
               of people? We have been termed wranglers, 
               <br />
               wasters of public time and monies, incapables 
               <br />
               etc., and people hold up their hands in horror at

               the thought of trusting the affairs of this country 
               <br />
               to our incapable hands. How often have I heard 
               <br />
               the expression, until I am ashamed to say that I 
               <br />
               am a member of the Convention (although we 
               <br />
               don’t deserve it), “If these are the sort of men we 
               <br />
               are likely to get to govern us, God help the 
               <br />
               country in a very few years.” So the thought has 
               <br />
               been continually in my mind —— how, after 14 or 
               <br />
               15 years, could England give us back responsible 
               <br />
               government? Who is to take it back? The ques- 
               <br />
               tion has never been answered by the people who 
               <br />
               advocate it.
