               our case. They may be inﬂuenced slightly by 
               <br />
               certain international complications, but I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that our case will be properly put to the

               Mr. Spencer Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the 
               <br />
               motion before the Chair. I am strongly of the 
               <br />
               opinion that this Convention must recommend 
               <br />
               confederation to be put before the people in the 
               <br />
               referendum. I cannot see how even one member 
               <br />
               of the Convention can vote against letting our 
               <br />
               people decide this question. It is the solemn duty 
               <br />
               of every member here to give the people the 
               <br />
               chance to say if they want confederation, or if 
               <br />
               they do not want it. We all have the same duty, 
               <br />
               whether we personally favour confederation or 
               <br />
               not. We should not let personal likes or dislikes 
               <br />
               enter into the picture at all. After all, we in this 
               <br />
               Convention are not deciding which form of 
               <br />
               government our country shall have, for that is the 
               <br />
               people’s right. If we of this Convention had the 
               <br />
               right to decide the question, then there would be 
               <br />
               no need for holding a referendum. We were sent 
               <br />
               here to recommend forms of government to be 
               <br />
               laid before the people for their choice. That is as 
               <br />
               far as we can go; and it is the plain duty of every 
               <br />
               man here to support this motion to place con— 
               <br />
               federation before the people. I, for one, will be 
               <br />
               perfectly satisfied for the people to decide 
               <br />
               whether our future government will be con— 
               <br />
               federation or not. 
               <br />

               In seconding the motion, Mr. Banﬁeld said he

               <br />
               know that is true. I also know that the people of 
               <br />
               the southwest coast want confederation to be on 
               <br />

               <br />
               the ﬁnest in the country. How can any member 
               <br />
               of this Convention vote to deny those thousands 
               <br />
               of Newfoundlanders the chance to vote for the
