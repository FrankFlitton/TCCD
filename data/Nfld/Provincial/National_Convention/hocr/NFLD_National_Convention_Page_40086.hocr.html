               <br />
               in the last year. We know that herring are avail-

               of the herring exported in this last year or two

               and his board have done a good job in respect to

               aux-Basques or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Isle»aux-Morts.</span> It would seem 
               <br />
               that where the herring are in abundance, as in the 
               <br />
               Bay of Islands, would be the most logical place 
               <br />
               to have such a plant, since bait could be obtained 
               <br />
               not only for our own ﬁsheries, but exported for 
               <br />
               the same purpose. We do, during the winter 
               <br />
               months export quite a lot of herring to Canada, 
               <br />
               frozen by natural process. It is probable these 
               <br />
               matters have been gone into by the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Committee, or will be looked into at future meet-

               ring to mention the importance of ﬁsh meal 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Chesley Crosbie, in Bay of Islands. I think 
               <br />
               that this phase of the herring industry can be 
               <br />
               developed on a far greater scale if given aid and 
               <br />

               <br />
               not want to sectionalise the debate. I speak of it 
               <br />

               that shipping closes at an early date due to ice, 
               <br />
               much of the produce must be shipped by rail.

               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, when the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Committee presented the report which we now 
               <br />
               have before us it raised a question which is more 
               <br />
               important than the apparent subject matter of the 
               <br />
               report <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper.</span> I feel sure that as it was listened to 
               <br />
               by the majority of the members of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, and since that time by the public generally, 
               <br />
               there arose in the minds of the majority some- 
               <br />
               thing of the past history of Newfoundland...

               If we go back into Newfoundland’s history far

               <br />
               in particular, a clear picture of how in her struggle 
               <br />
               to establish herself, Newfoundland had to grow 
               <br />
               up in an atmosphere where the whole power of 
               <br />
               great nations tended to depress the struggling 
               <br />
               colony. Newfoundland, and the potential and ac- 
               <br />
               tual wealth of her ﬁsheries, were treated as just 
               <br />
               another source of producing wealth for the 
               <br />
               mother country as well as a training ground for 
               <br />
               the defence of Britain, which at that time was 
               <br />
               looked upon as the chief preoccupation of 
               <br />
               government. In our studies of the problem of 
               <br />
               governing Newfoundland we are almost in- 
               <br />
               variably faced with the fact that the greatestprob- 
               <br />
               lem of government is the dispersal of our people. 
               <br />
               People may vary in their interpretation of the 
               <br />
               reasons for our having settled so far apart from 
               <br />
               each other, but if my reading of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               history is correct the repressive measures taken 
               <br />
