               Mr. MacDonald Mr. Chairman, it’s not my in-

               tention...

               Mr. Chairman Sir, I don’t have to leave here at 
               <br />
               all, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> decided I could stay here till nine tomor- 
               <br />
               row morning if I like. If you don’t like it, it’s your 
               <br />
               right to walk out of the House. I’m not going to 
               <br />
               take the right of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> MacDonald to speak when 
               <br />
               he hasn’t had the opportunity to address himself 
               <br />
               on this question at all, and other people have been 
               <br />
               able to address themselves tonight. There’s a case 
               <br />
               of discrimination that I could be probably 
               <br />
               charged with that I’m not going to be charged 
               <br />
               with. Please go ahead, Mr. MacDonald.
