               If ever I had deep respect for the statesmanship

               of Great Britain it is now as I stand to move this 
               <br />
               resolution, that we recommend confederation to

               be submitted to the Newfoundland people in the 
               <br />
               forthcoming referendum. My respect for the 
               <br />
               statesmanship of Great Britain is boundless. Just 
               <br />
               consider, sir, what the British government could 
               <br />
               have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> They decided to allow the New- 
               <br />
               foundland people themselves to decide what 
               <br />
               form of government they would have for their 
               <br />
               country, and they decided to hold a referendum 
               <br />
               for that purpose. But they decided at the same 
               <br />
               time to ask the Newfoundland people to elect a 
               <br />
               National Convention to make recommendations 
               <br />
               as to what forms of government should be sub— 
               <br />
               mitted to the people in that referendum. The 
               <br />
               British government could have arranged to leave 
               <br />
               it completely to this Convention as to what forms 
               <br />
               of government the people would vote on in the 
               <br />
               referendum. If they had done that, then whatever 
               <br />
               a majority of the members here recommended 
               <br />
               would go on the ballot paper, and nothing else. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> British government could have done that. 
               <br />
               They could have left it to a majority of the 
               <br />
               delegates of this Convention to decide what 
               <br />
               forms of government would be put before the 
               <br />
               people. In that case we know now what would 
               <br />
               have been recommended -— responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment would have been recommended and noth~ 
               <br />
               ing else, for as the whole country knows, the 
               <br />
               majority of the delegates here are in favour of 
               <br />
               responsible government and nothing else. If the 
               <br />
               majority had their way our people would not be 
               <br />
               allowed to vote for anything but responsible 
               <br />
               government. Thank God this was not done. It is 
               <br />
               not up to a majority of this Convention to decide 
               <br />
               what our people shall vote on in the referendum 
               <br />
               this spring. The British government could have

               arranged it that way, but they did not. Thank God. 
               <br />
               The British government knew very well why. 
               <br />
               They know very well that a majority of members 
               <br />
               here in the Convention might represent a 
               <br />
               minority of the people. They knew that a minority 
               <br />
               here might well represent a great majority of the 
               <br />
               population of the country, so the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern“</span> 
               <br />
               ment very wisely kept to themselves the right to 
               <br />
               decide what should go on the ballot and what 
               <br />
               should not. In this way the democratic rights of 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland people have been preserved 
               <br />
               against usurpation, and I am very grateful to the 
               <br />
               British government for doing it.

               So I say to our Newfoundland people, I say to 
               <br />
               the many thousands of Newfoundlanders who 
               <br />
               want confederation with Canada, and I say to the 
               <br />
               members of this Convention, that although the 
               <br />
               Confederates in the Convention are out~ num- 
               <br />
               bered almost two to one, although we are a 
               <br />
               minority in the Convention, our recommendation 
               <br />
               will be respected by the British government. 
               <br />
               There is no doubt about, confederation will be on 
               <br />
               the ballot paper in the referendum. Our people 
               <br />
               will get their chance to vote forconfederation this 
               <br />
               spring. The many hundreds of people who have 
               <br />
               written or telegraphed or telephoned about this 
               <br />
               matter to me, can be of good cheer, for the British 
               <br />
               government will protect the democratic rights of 
               <br />
               our people against all attempts of a mere majority 
               <br />
               of this Convention. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Well, the ﬁrst stage of our great battle for the 
               <br />
               people is nearly over. It was a battle to get this 
               <br />
               Convention to adopt my resolution to send a 
               <br />
               delegation to Canada to get the terms, but that 
               <br />
               battle was ﬁnally won. It was a battle to get this 
               <br />
               Convention to debate the terms, but that battle 
               <br />
               was won. Now we are entering the last stage of 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst half of the battle. We are going to decide 
               <br />
               whether, as a Convention, we will recommend 
               <br />
               that confederation be put before the people in the 
               <br />
               referendum for their verdict. We may not get a 
               <br />
               complete victory in this present part of the battle. 
               <br />
               A majority of the members here will probably 
               <br />
               vote against my motion, but by this time the 
               <br />
               British government has a very good idea of how 
               <br />
               things stand in this country today. They are not 
               <br />
               going to be carried away by a vote of a mere 
               <br />
               majority of this Convention, because they know 
               <br />
               that 99 Newfoundlanders out of 100 want con- 
               <br />
               federation to be submitted to them after this Con-
