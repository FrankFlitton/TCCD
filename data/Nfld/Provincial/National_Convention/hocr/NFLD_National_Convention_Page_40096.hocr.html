               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen of 
               <br />
               the National Convention, I should like to draw 
               <br />
               your attention to the copy of the report on educa- 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">noon.</span> I might say that this report has been ready 
               <br />
               for some considerable time but it was held up 
               <br />
               because it was believed it would be wiser to await 
               <br />
               other reports which were nearing completion 
               <br />
               before we introduced the one on education, with 
               <br />
               the hope that the public sessions of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion might be enabled to continue. I might say that 
               <br />
               we experienced some little difﬁculty at the outset 
               <br />
               in making up our minds as to the proper approach 
               <br />
               of the committee on this question of education; 
               <br />
               the conception of education, as we all know, is 
               <br />
               changing from era to era and it is different in all 
               <br />
               parts of the world. We realised that education 
               <br />
               insofar as this country is concerned, is something 
               <br />
               the form of which is familiar to the whole of our 
               <br />
               people. Why then probe into the merits or 
               <br />
               demerits of the system of education? We felt 
               <br />
               therefore that it would be futile for us to raise that 
               <br />
               point in our report. 
               <br />

               We felt that we were approaching it in a right 
               <br />
               and proper sense. Even on our committee of ten 
               <br />
               men, there were various shades of opinion as to 
               <br />
               our present educational system. How useless 
               <br />
               would it therefore be to start this enquiry by 
               <br />
               introducing something which was already con- 
               <br />
               tentious. We feel that a system of education can 
               <br />
               only be introduced into any country when you 
               <br />
               have the majority of people favouring that sys-

               we would like you to give your attention in the

               That is correct and as it should be. We could have

               gone back into the history of education, gone

               little to enhance the cause of education in this 
               <br />
