               Fisheries. The most unnerving feature of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland life is, or was, our dependence on 
               <br />
               the ﬁshery. In the past it was the incontestable 
               <br />
               argument explaining our slow advancement and 
               <br />
               low standards. In prosecuting this industry we 
               <br />
               were not alone in the world. We were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unques“</span> 
               <br />
               tionably left with a bounty of supply, but we were 
               <br />
               carefree, we were lax. Our government, our mer- 
               <br />
               chants and our ﬁsherman were all to blame for 
               <br />
               the gradual loss to competitors of our markets. 
               <br />
               And so the tide flowed against us, and this had 
               <br />
               reached crippling proportions by 1933. Let us not 
               <br />
               lose sight of the fact that whilst we were sliding 
               <br />
               downhill our competitors, Norway and Iceland, 
               <br />
               were consolidating their positions in the ﬁsh 
               <br />
               markets of the world. Iceland’s dependence on 
               <br />
               ﬁshery was even greater than ours. I’ll have to 
               <br />
               give you some ﬁgures on just what Iceland did in 
               <br />
               comparison to Newfoundland’s progress. I am 
               <br />
               forced to give them, because we had an argument 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland was producing more than the 
               <br />
               demand was capable of absorbing. In 1885 
               <br />
               Iceland exported less than 100,000 quintals of 
               <br />
               wet and dry salted codﬁsh, Newfoundland 1.3 
               <br />
               million. In 1932 Iceland exported 1.5 million 
               <br />
               quintals and was then ahead of Newfoundland by 
               <br />
               450,000 quintals of ﬁsh. I presume that they sold 
               <br />
               all that ﬁsh, that there was no overproduction. 
               <br />
               They produced it and they sold it, and we lost the 
               <br />
               market. And if you read the papers today we will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that we are losing markets in herring too. 
               <br />
               These are ﬁgures. Production must always keep 
               <br />
               a keen eye to the requirements of demand. In this 
               <br />
               we were neglectful. However, that age is past. 
               <br />
               Perhaps slowly but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surely,</span> Newfoundland’s ﬁsh 
               <br />
               is ﬁnding an honoured place on the food counters 
               <br />
               of continents far and near. This has been brought 
               <br />
               about by the combined effort of government and 
               <br />
               capital and has been furthered, in no little 
               <br />
               measure by the vigilance of the ﬁshermen them- 
               <br />
               selves. Perhaps the most reassuring event of late 
               <br />
               was the recent increase in the price of fresh fish 
               <br />
               at some of our larger ﬁlleting plants. Yes, the 
               <br />
               weaknesses of our old position have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recoga</span> 
               <br />
               nised and are being corrected — corrected by 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders themselves. Read the 
               <br />
               Economic Report on this, page 26. It says, 
               <br />
               “...during the year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">193031,</span> when a ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               crisis engulfed the world suddenly, prices for our 
               <br />
               saltﬁsh product during the early thirties and prac- 
               <br />

               reached the lowest ﬁgure in history." I consider 
               <br />
               this part of the report incomplete, for it offers no 
               <br />
               explanation why the price was down, other than 
               <br />
               in a general sense. That reason can be clearly and 
               <br />
               unmistakenly deﬁned and here it is. We were 
               <br />
               selling our ﬁsh in sterling and converting to 
               <br />
               Canadian dollars — a condition much as exists 
               <br />
               today existed on the money markets. The value 
               <br />
               of the pound was down in its relation to the 
               <br />
               Canadian dollar. And the value of the Canadian 
               <br />
               dollar was down in its relation to the American 
               <br />
               dollar. This caused the ﬁshermen to suffer a loss 
               <br />
               of 20% on the value of ﬁsh. In other words, by 
               <br />
               way of example, $10 of ﬁsh was sold for $8. 
               <br />
               Moreover, this $8 was in some cases spent in 
               <br />
               buying American clothing, footwear, etc. There 
               <br />
               we had to pay a tithe of $ 1 .22 Canadian funds for 
               <br />
               American funds. Converted into American dol— 
               <br />
               lars then, the price of $10 ﬁsh is reduced to 
               <br />
               slightly more than $6.50. If we had had our 
               <br />
               currency tied to the pound sterling the ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               could have received the full $10 value for thier 
               <br />
               ﬁsh.... This condition is due entirely to the fact 
               <br />
               that we use Canadian currency in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               —~ or until such time as Canada buys all our 
               <br />
               codﬁsh and pays forthem in dollars. What are the 
               <br />
               possibilities of this happening? I am extremely 
               <br />
               fair when I say I see no possibility of it happen- 
               <br />
               ing. Something that reduces the price of ﬁsh from 
               <br />
               $10 down $6.56 is a great big enemy of ours and 
               <br />
               should be removed. I do not propose to go any 
               <br />
               further here on this subject. To continue with the 
               <br />
               sections of their report on ﬁsheries. It was during 
               <br />
               this period that modern methods in handling, 
               <br />
               curing and marketing of both fresh, frozen and 
               <br />
               salt codﬁsh were begun by the establishment in 
               <br />
               various sections of the country of bait depots and 
               <br />
               cold storage plants, ﬁnanced in many cases by 
               <br />
               our own government. I’m urged here to give the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures for the amount of bait that was used 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">19334947:</span> 1933, 1.8 million pounds; 1945, 6 
               <br />
               million pounds. As a result our people became 
               <br />
               conﬁdent of thier capability to secure paying 
               <br />
               voyages in fresh, frozen or salted ﬁsh. It is not 
               <br />
               unreasonable then to draw this conclusion (page 
               <br />
               31): “And it is not unreasonable to say that the 
               <br />
               adoption of methods that have brought prosperity 
               <br />
               to such a country as Iceland cannot fail but bring 
               <br />
               similar results to 30,000 of our people engaged 
               <br />
               in the fishing industry of Newfoundland."
