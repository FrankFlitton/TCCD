               Convention to it. Only one thing more I’ll say, 
               <br />
               the Convention must be composed of men from 
               <br />
               the districts, so the Convention Act says. I guess

               that was so in order that we would have men who

               Mr. Banﬁeld ....Today we know where we

               <br />

               <br />
               sible government, Great Britain will not give us 
               <br />
               any ﬁnancial help whatsoever should we ever 
               <br />
               need such help. We will be free to vote for 
               <br />
               responsible government if we want to, but we 
               <br />
               will be on our own from that moment. If the

               people feel sure that their country is self-support-

               <br />
               years to come; if they feel sure that this country 
               <br />
               can go ahead on her own, without any help from 
               <br />
               anybody; if they have no fears of any future

               The delegation brought back another piece of

               Mr. Fudge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">....Unfortunately</span> there were seven 
               <br />
               delegates went over. I say unfortunately, because 
               <br />
               there should have been only five, and they would 
               <br />
               have agreed. Now the position of the disagree- 
               <br />
               ment, as I see it, repeats itself back to the first 
               <br />
               time they sent out their three goodwill commis- 
               <br />
               sioners to Newfoundland. Some of you saw them, 
               <br />
               and they went back with the verdict that we in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland did not know what we wanted. 
               <br />
               The second time they sent the Prime Minister of 
               <br />
               Great Britain with two others. I understand the 
               <br />
               same verdict was marked against us. Now they 
               <br />
               have a National Convention set up, wherein the 
               <br />
               people can discuss the suitable form or forms of
