               tion, and I just want to go on record to that effect. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, I would like very 
               <br />
               much to associate myself with this motion that 
               <br />
               has been proposed by Mr. Higgins, and seconded 
               <br />
               by the “father of this House”. That. sir, is an 
               <br />
               honour to you, to have such a motion seconded 
               <br />
               by a man with the reputation and characteristics 
               <br />
               of the Hon. R. B. Job. Now as Mr. Smallwood has 
               <br />
               claimed ﬁrst place with regard to the many an- 
               <br />
               noyances that have been caused you in your 
               <br />
               onerous position, I think I could claim second 
               <br />
               place at any rate. I like the wording of the motion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins mentioned the “able and courteous 
               <br />
               manner in which you have performed your 
               <br />
               duties”. He also mentioned the word “impartial”, 
               <br />
               and that to my mind has been the reason why you 
               <br />
               have been so successful in ﬁnishing up the work 
               <br />
               which was passed over to you. If I were to go on 
               <br />
               oath today, sir, and be asked what your particular 
               <br />
               political leanings were, I would have to answer 
               <br />
               frankly and truthfully, “I do not know", and for 
               <br />
               any man in this present day in Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               be able to cover up so well as you have done in 
               <br />
               this particular position is a recommendation 
               <br />
               which will go down with you to your dying day. 
               <br />
               I do most heartily agree with the mover and 
               <br />
               seconder, and with the expression made by my 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Smallwood, and I sincerely hope, sir, 
               <br />
               that the work of this Convention, in the end, will 
               <br />
               justify our having such a fair, courteous and 
               <br />
               impartial Chairman.

               Mr. Vardy It must be a grand feeling to hear 
               <br />
               such words of praise about oneself while you are 
               <br />
               still living. Now I can only just in a very brief way 
               <br />
               add my own support to the resolution, and those 
               <br />
               to follow as well. I know that many times we have 
               <br />
               felt like jumping right after each other’s throats. 
               <br />
               I never felt more like it in my life than Wednesday 
               <br />
               night, butI decided that discretion was the better 
               <br />
               part of valour, but I have had nothing but admira- 
               <br />
               tion for you, even when you tried to chastise a 
               <br />
               recalcitrant member. I wish to associate myself

               Mr. Harrington I don’t propose to carry on this

               Mr. Chairman In expressing to you my deep 
               <br />
               appreciation and sincere thanks for all your kind— 
               <br />
               ness to me, particularly here this evening I want 
               <br />
               to express my gratitude and thanks, which 
               <br />
               began with my induction during an afternoon in 
               <br />
               October last. Now at that time, ifI recall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correct</span> 
               <br />
               1y, I made two statements, one of which was that 
               <br />
               the extent to which I would be successful in the 
               <br />
               proper discharge of my duties would in the last 
               <br />
               analysis depend on the sympathy and co-opera- 
               <br />
               tion which I received from the members of this 
               <br />
               House. Therefore, if I have had any success in the 
               <br />
               proper discharge of my duties, it has only been 
               <br />
               made possible by the kindness and sympathy and 
               <br />
               co—operation to which I referred, so that the credit 
               <br />
               for my success must inevitably fall upon your 
               <br />
               shoulders. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At that time I also stated that I made no 
               <br />
               pretence to infallibility. I am quite sure that you 
               <br />
               had ample and adequate illustration of that during 
               <br />
               the time that has intervened since I ﬁrst began; 
               <br />
               but the thing I like to think about most, and for 
               <br />
               which I perhaps may be most proud, is the fact 
               <br />
               that while undoubtedly on occasions in the stress 
               <br />
               and heat of the moment, when I was called upon 
               <br />
               to make rulings, I ruled erroneously, I think the 
               <br />
               greatest kindness and courtesy, and the greatest 
               <br />
               compliment that has been paid me, is the fact that 
               <br />
               there has not been a single appeal from any ruling 
               <br />
               that I made against any member of the House 
               <br />
               since I accepted the chairmanship of the National
