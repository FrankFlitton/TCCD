               income tax in Canada is being reduced each year 
               <br />
               since the war. A single man earning $750 in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland pays no income tax. But on 
               <br />
               spending that money, he pays at least 15% duty 
               <br />
               on his goods — that is $112, plus the proﬁts on 
               <br />

               Take the retail prices in Canada. The tax on a 
               <br />
               fur coat from Canada was mentioned the other 
               <br />
               day. We’ll say a fur coat in Canada cost around 
               <br />
               $150. An importing agent in Newfoundland ﬁrst 
               <br />
               pays $55 duty which is $82.50, and with a 20% 
               <br />
               proﬁt to the importer, the total duty and proﬁt on 
               <br />
               that coat is $99. The coat costs the purchaser a 
               <br />
               total of $249. Under union with Canada, you 
               <br />
               would have to pay no duty whatever on that coat.

               Take an alarm clock -- and by the way, we’re 
               <br />
               thinking of the ﬁshermen ﬁshing 20 hours a day 
               <br />
               out of 24 off Cape St. John, and the man using 
               <br />
               the bucksaw in the woods down in Bishop Brook 
               <br />
               all day, working long hours and having only a few 
               <br />
               hours to rest, who might need an alarm clock. If 
               <br />
               he wishes to buy one from Canada, and it cost 
               <br />
               him $3.50 in Eaton’s catalogue, he pays 60% 
               <br />
               duty on that $3.50, which amounts to $2.10, and 
               <br />
               on that $2.10 the importer has his proﬁt, making 
               <br />
               a total $2.50 and that makes the alarm clock 
               <br />
               cost $6. Under union with Canada, he pays only 
               <br />
               the sales tax of 8%, which is 30 cents, making the 
               <br />
               total cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3.80.</span> Therefore, under union with 
               <br />
               Canada the poor ﬁsherman or the lumberman will 
               <br />
               get his clock $2.20 cheaper. Now we’ll come to 
               <br />
               shoes. The shoes on my feet cost in Canada $7. 
               <br />
               The duty on those shoes is 40%, which is $2.80. 
               <br />
               And to the importer who has his proﬁt of 20%, 
               <br />
               we must pay the total $3.35, so the shoes will cost 
               <br />
               me $10.35. Under union with Canada, the 8% 
               <br />
               sales tax would cost 50 cents, so the shoes would 
               <br />
               cost not over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$7.56,</span> Therefore, my shoes would 
               <br />
               be $2.80 cheaper under union with Canada than 
               <br />
               they cost today. We’ll take a suit of overalls, say 
               <br />
               they cost $5 in Canada, plus the duty of 40% 
               <br />
               coming into Newfoundland, which means there’ s 
               <br />
               $2 duty, 20% profit on that $2 is a total of $2.50 
               <br />

               which gives a total cost of $7.40 for the suit of 
               <br />
               overalls. Under union with Canada you’ll get 
               <br />
               them with only a sales tax of 8%, and the same 
               <br />
               overalls would be $2 cheaper. Major Cashin 
               <br />
               mentioned playing cards, I think he said there 
               <br />
               were two jokers in a pack. If so, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               there are three at the present time. Two in the 
               <br />
               pack and one in the Newfoundland customs, 60% 
               <br />
               duty. If, for instance, a champion player of 45’s 
               <br />
               wants a pack of good cards, and decides to pay 
               <br />
               $2 for them in Canada, on that pack of cards he 
               <br />
               pays $1.20 duty and 25 cents profit on the duty, 
               <br />
               a total of $1.45, making the total for the cards 
               <br />
               $3.25. Under union with Canada he would save 
               <br />
               that duty of 60% and pay 25 cents tax per pack. 
               <br />
               He would then have the cards for $2.25 and save 
               <br />
               $1.20, which would give a good player a chance 
               <br />
               to reach the jackpot. Even a bottle of Milk of 
               <br />
               Magnesia can be purchased 25 cents cheaper in 
               <br />
               Montreal than in St. John’s, so if a man has a 
               <br />
               hangover after drinking, he can get a straightener 
               <br />
               in Canada cheaper then he can in Newfoundland.

               Pickled beef and pork in barrels. It was stated 
               <br />
               here that under confederation pickled beef and 
               <br />
               pork imported from the United States would cost 
               <br />
               under sales tax, $369,000. This ﬁgure must be 
               <br />
               wrong. The total number of barrels imported 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               $4 a barrel, this would be $136,488. We also 
               <br />
               imported 26,223 barrels from Canada, being 
               <br />
               8,000 barrels less than from the States. Having

               consulted with three Canadian packing ﬁrms in 
               <br />
               this country, they state that they can sell pickled 
               <br />
               beef and pork in Canada considerably cheaper 
               <br />
