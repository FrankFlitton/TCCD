               myself into the belief that for the next eight or ten

               <br />
               the $83 or $84 a ton that it is today. I wonder if

               Major Cashin can tell us what the price has been

               <br />
               owing to lack ofshipping, the paper was rationed,

               <br />
               foundland it will go down everywhere, so that it

               <br />
               three—mile limit. I remember a speech given by 
               <br />
