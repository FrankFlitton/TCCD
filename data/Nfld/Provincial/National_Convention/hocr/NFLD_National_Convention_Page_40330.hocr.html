               <br />
               I am trying to make. Perhaps when the Commit-

               tee on Agriculture brings in its report we may 
               <br />
               have some information on the practical pos- 
               <br />
               sibility of rearing sheep... Mr. Hollett wanted to 
               <br />
               know if they have protective tariffs everywhere. 
               <br />
               Yes they do. They caused the big war. Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               will agree there is a difference between Great 
               <br />
               Britain with a big home market, and the United 
               <br />
               States with 140 millions, and Canada with 12 
               <br />
               millions, setting out deliberately with a policy to 
               <br />
               start local industries. But take a country like 
               <br />
               Newfoundland with 318,000 population, count- 
               <br />
               ing Labrador -—— if you are going to start an 
               <br />
               industry where you have to import raw material 
               <br />
               and fabricate it into a ﬁnished article, the cost of 
               <br />
               doing so is great. You are turning out a small 
               <br />
               quantity. Your overhead is high. If you do it on a 
               <br />
               large scale, you get modern equipment and turn 
               <br />
               out large quantities, you cannot do it in a small 
               <br />
               country. If you do, you turn out enough in a week 
               <br />
               to last the country for years...

               What are we doing today? We are looking at 
               <br />
               one of the great issues that has divided man, free 
               <br />
               trade. We must export or die. We must export our 
               <br />
               fish, our paper and our minerals. Whatever lies in 
               <br />
               our power we must do to help industries bringing 
               <br />
               money into this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country...</span> When I say local in- 
               <br />
               dustries, I am talking about ﬁsh, ore, forests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> 
               <br />
               they are not the kind of industries we are talking 
               <br />
               about. I am talking about the industries that are 
               <br />
               artiﬁcial, made possible by a protective tariff. We 
               <br />
               are making it expensive to produce through the 
               <br />
               customs tariff. Ithas been a grave issue which has 
               <br />
               divided man and made enemies, this question of 
               <br />
               free trade versus protection. They come to the 
               <br />
               government as infant industries, need just a little 
               <br />
               bit of help, little bit of fostering care, protective 
               <br />
               tariff. “When we get on our feet, we will not need 
               <br />
               it", they say. While they are infants they want the 
               <br />
               government to help them. They want a little bit 
               <br />
               of nursing. Some of them are now pretty lusty 
               <br />
               infants, and they are still getting the protective 
               <br />
               tariffs — they were infants in the 18705. You are 
               <br />
               unpatriotic, you are destructive if you get up and

               <br />
               orbitant protective tariff that is enjoyed by the 
               <br />
               main local industries ofSt. John’s, which is con- 
               <br />
               veniently called a revenue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff.</span> This burden of 
               <br />
               taxation falls most heavily on those least able to 
               <br />
               bear it, our woodsmen, miners and fishermen. 
               <br />
               Some people argue that if you close down local 
               <br />
               industries, you put a certain number of people out 
               <br />
               of employment. I would say, if the rights of the 
               <br />
               masses are infringed upon, the cause of the 
               <br />
               minority is not a just one. In my opinion this 
               <br />
               peculiar set-up of local industries in St. John’s 
               <br />
               appears to be the greatest imposition yet per-

               I feel it is the duty of this Convention to
