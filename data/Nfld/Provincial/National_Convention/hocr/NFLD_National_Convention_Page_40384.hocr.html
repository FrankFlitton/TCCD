               <br />
               merchants than is Mr. Hollett, or Mr. Bailey, as 
               <br />
               well as the many other men in this Convention 
               <br />
               who in the last analysis share the same beliefs. 
               <br />
               The second charge, no doubt, will be that I, and 
               <br />
               anybody else who believes as I do, is restricting 
               <br />
               the choice of the people of Newfoundland by 
               <br />
               trying to block confederation. I have already ex- 
               <br />
               plained my position with regard to that matter, 
               <br />
               but I intend to go a little further to clear up that 
               <br />
               misapprehension and allegation in advance. I 
               <br />
               believe we are here to discuss and recommend 
               <br />
               forms of government, as I have outlined them, not 
               <br />
               forms of a form of government. If we are to 
               <br />
               discuss and recommend confederation on certain 
               <br />
               terms, for the sake of argument, then there are 
               <br />
               several other forms of responsible government 
               <br />
               we have to discuss and recommend. and in that 
               <br />
               case we shall be here another year, and none of 
               <br />
               us want that. The proponents of confederation 
               <br />
               know that for every one person in this island that 
               <br />
               advocates confederation, there are at least three 
               <br />
               who advocate union with or annexation by the 
               <br />
               United States. There are others who have a voice 
               <br />
               in this Convention in Mr. Bailey, who is a staunch 
               <br />
               believer in some sort of union with the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, something on the lines of Northern 
               <br />
               Ireland. There are extremists too, who advocate 
               <br />
               secession from the Empire, with intent to estab- 
               <br />
               lish a free state or a republic. These are all forms 
               <br />
               of responsible government. If we are to discuss 
               <br />
               and recommend one on a basis of terms like 
               <br />
               confederation, then we must get terms or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condiu</span> 
               <br />
               tions with respect to them all and discuss and 
               <br />
               possibly recommend them all. Where would it 
               <br />
               end? Where would we be? What confusion we 
               <br />
               would have. It is plain there are four options 
               <br />
               under responsible government open to the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland: l. Dominion status; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2.</span> Union 
               <br />
               with the United States; 3. Confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada; 4. Union with the United Kingdom. The 
               <br />
               second of these I intend to refer to next, and in 
               <br />
               doing so I will rebut the third charge.

               The third charge levelled at me will no doubt 
               <br />
               be the hackneyed one of narrow nationalism. 
               <br />
               Why? Because I believe in an independent New-

               foundland and the doctrine that God helps those 
               <br />

               <br />
               this world no one gets something for nothing. Yet 
               <br />
               the very people who would make that charge will 
               <br />
               themselves likely raise a great outcry because it

               <br />

               <br />
               independence and national pride; if we are to

               <br />
               alone; if we are more satisﬁed with servility on a

               sidered by those who control us. I have always 
               <br />
               believed that one of the main reasons why the

               report ofthe Goodwill Mission of l943 was never 
               <br />
               published was that it had discovered that a 
               <br />
               majority of our people looked to the United States 
               <br />
               as a far more attractive possibility than either 
               <br />
               Canada or the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Kingdom.</span> And that, Mr.

               It is just as apparent to everyone that such a

               a province of Canada. We are no Alaska, as the

               only a hundred miles farther than Ottawa, as the

               Some months ago in a debate in this chamber 
               <br />
               the view was expressed that in time there might 
               <br />
               be a federal union of North America. That is a 
               <br />
               view I have long held. In ancient times, when a 
               <br />
               vast area of Europe, Africa and Asia was included 
               <br />
               in the Roman Empire, it was the boast of many 
               <br />
               men of many nations, “Civis Romanus Sum” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">..</span> 
               <br />
               I am a Roman citizen. Perhaps that day may not 
               <br />
               be far away when “I am a citizen of North 
               <br />
               America” may be no idle boast. Such federal 
               <br />
               union may not be as far away as some people 
               <br />
               think. No one in his right senses then will deny 
               <br />
