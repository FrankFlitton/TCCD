               Mr. Chairman, I can take it and what was said 
               <br />
               does not bother me as an individual, but the 
               <br />
               principle of the thing is wrong. No one knows it 
               <br />
               all, even if he thinks he does. Mr. Hollett quoted 
               <br />
               some predictions made by Mr. Smallwood in 
               <br />
               1931 which showed how wrong he could be when 
               <br />
               he ventured into the ﬁeld of prophecy. I think it 
               <br />
               worthwhile to refer to this matter because it 
               <br />
               shows how things and opinions change. In I931 
               <br />
               the member for Bonavista Centre figured that 
               <br />
               conditions in Newfoundland were far better than 
               <br />
               they were in the cities of Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States. Today Mr. Smallwood sees nothing but 
               <br />
               rocks ahead. Why? That is what I have been 
               <br />
               asking myself, and what a lot of other people like 
               <br />
               me have been asking since they heard the destruc- 
               <br />
               tive opening attack on the report. Was it neces- 
               <br />
               sary to take up this report, pick a few sentences 
               <br />
               from it and try to make them sound as if the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee had nothing else in mind 
               <br />
               except to deceive the people of the country? I 
               <br />
               want to know also what gain there is to be found 
               <br />
               in proclaiming to the world that Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               future is grim and depressing when, as far as I am 
               <br />
               aware, there is no basis for it. That speech 
               <br />
               sounded like the prediction that all who entered 
               <br />
               here should abandon hope. I am content, how- 
               <br />
               ever, to leave the decision on the usefulness of 
               <br />
               the report to the people of this island and also to 
               <br />
               put it on the conscience of its opponents as to 
               <br />
               whether their forebodings are not one of the most 
               <br />
               harmful things to be heard in this country for a 
               <br />
               very long time. I tell you that nothing can so 
               <br />
               easily undermine prosperity than a loss of con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdence, and anything that is done to discourage 
               <br />
               our productive workers is a dangerous thing. I 
               <br />
               don’t believe in concealing the true facts of a bad 
               <br />
               situation, but there is nothing in the report that is 
               <br />
               deceitful or that hides anything. If there are errors 
               <br />
               of fact they are accidental and they are not, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, relevant to our main conclusions. As a 
               <br />
               businessman, I don’t believe in fooling myself or 
               <br />
               trying to fool anyone else on a matter of such 
               <br />
               importance.

               <br />
               condition of the economy we have been guided 
               <br />
               by the facts that are available — many of them 
               <br />
               from the reports of the various committees that 
               <br />

               or have been able to obtain from others who are

               reliable witnesses. When it came to the estima-

               tion of the condition and future of the ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               we had, of course, to be guided by the opinions 
               <br />
               of those people who are fully conversant with all 
               <br />
               sides of that great industry. The people who are 
               <br />
               investing large sums of money in the future of the 
               <br />
               ﬁshing industry are better guides than others who 
               <br />
               are looking in from the outside. in the case of the 
               <br />
               paper industry the same thing is true. We had all 
               <br />
               the leading ﬁgures in the Newfoundland forest 
               <br />
               industry give evidence to the Forestry Commit- 
               <br />
               tee, and the House is aware of their optimism and 
               <br />
               must surely accept their words before those of 
               <br />
               others who have no inside knowledge. I want to 
               <br />
               emphasise again that to the best of our ability we 
               <br />
               got all the facts we could get, and all the opinions 
               <br />
               we could find that we thought useful and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">valu»</span> 
               <br />
               able. We were not a committee of experts. We 
               <br />
               were only a few ordinary people trying to use our 
               <br />
               common sense as well as we could, and we were 
               <br />
               not interested in trying to fool the people or 
               <br />
               creating a sense of false optimism. I would ask 
               <br />
               the House to examine the picture very briefly 
               <br />
               because others, lam sure, will be prepared to go 
               <br />
               into greater detail on certain industries with 
               <br />
               which they are fully acquainted.

               The ﬁshery is still the main industry in the size 
               <br />
               of the employment it gives. Anyone who says that 
               <br />
               the ﬁshing industry is not stronger than it was 
               <br />
               before the war does not know what he is talking 
               <br />
               about. Prices may be beneﬁtting today from a 
               <br />
               measure of world inflation. That is true of every 
               <br />
               commodity that is produced. The point is that the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries are today on much stronger foundations 
               <br />
               than they ever were in the history of this country. 
               <br />
               We haven’t yet reached the point of perfection, 
               <br />
               but we are moving steadily forward and every 
               <br />
               year sees new improvements that will give 
               <br />
               greater security to the producers who are the 
               <br />
               life-blood of this and every country. The demand 
               <br />
               for saltﬁsh will always exist because in certain 
               <br />
               tropical countries it is the ideal food for a number
