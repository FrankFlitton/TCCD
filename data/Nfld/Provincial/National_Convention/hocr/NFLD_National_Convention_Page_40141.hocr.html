               Mr. Figary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">...,I</span> have followed the debate on the 
               <br />
               resolution presented by Mr. Smallwood to this 
               <br />

               <br />
               involved in the resolution; I feel we should have 
               <br />
               that information, and all the information we can 
               <br />
               get on any form of government. I and the people 
               <br />
               of my district want it, and we must get it, so we 
               <br />
               can be in a position to decide what form of 
               <br />
               government will be best so as to give our people 
               <br />
               a square deal. A government for all citizens of 
               <br />
               this country and not for a few. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In the past a lot of our people were given a 
               <br />
               rotten deal, they have been hungry and cold, and 
               <br />
               there is no doubt about that; I have been in homes 
               <br />
               and seen it. I have seen children crying for bread 
               <br />
               and none to give them, seen children and even 
               <br />
               adults use ﬂour sacks in order to cover their 
               <br />
               nakedness. These people did not endure this be— 
               <br />
               cause they were too lazy to work; there was no 
               <br />
               work to be had, and those who did work were paid 
               <br />
               a shamefully low wage, and the fishermen 
               <br />
               received next to nothing for their fish, barely 
               <br />
               enough for an existence. There was nothing that 
               <br />
               could be done about it, as at that time organised 
               <br />
               labour got little assistance or recognition from 
               <br />
               any source, indeed it was frowned upon in many 
               <br />
               places. Since Commission of Government has 
               <br />
               controlled this country there has been a lot of 
               <br />
               improvement as regards recognition of organised 
               <br />
               labour. This does not mean that the government 
               <br />
               has in all cases favoured the organisation of the 
               <br />
               workers, there have been times when they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">op«</span> 
               <br />
               posed and actually fought against the right of 
               <br />
               workers to organise and bargain collectively. In 
               <br />
               the main, however, they have generally en- 
               <br />
               couraged the idea of collective bargaining and 
               <br />
               have set up machinery whereby employer and 
               <br />
               employee can meet and discuss their difficulties. 
               <br />
               At the present, I am somewhat in favour of the 
               <br />
               present form of government until we can deter-

               <br />
               been wasted on this matter, and I do not see any

               inconsistent? In other words, do we practise what 
               <br />
               we preach? The vote now pending will decide my

               When we had responsible government, it was 
               <br />
               very often considered that spending money on 
               <br />
               trips both local and foreign, together with other 
               <br />
               similar acts, would lead to the ﬁnancial collapse 
               <br />

               <br />
               sible government was ousted from power and 
               <br />
               Commission of Government took its place, and 
               <br />
               in the opinion of some of us the Commission has 
               <br />
               not lived up to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expectations.</span> Hence a National 
               <br />

               Canada to seek terms of confederation. In my

               few gentlemen on ajoyride at the expense of the 
               <br />
               taxpayers. Now why do the same thing that past 
               <br />
               governments had done that we did not approve 
               <br />

               <br />
               the country at any time? Why not let our actions
