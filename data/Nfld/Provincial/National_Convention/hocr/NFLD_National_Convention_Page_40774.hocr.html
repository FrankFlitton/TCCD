               mal times prices for our products of the sea

               have been based on the unwritten law of 
               <br />
               supply and demand. And so it was that in the 
               <br />
               year 1915 when the ﬁrst World War was 
               <br />
               raging, when the German submarines were 
               <br />
               making efforts to starve the European 
               <br />
               countries, that the prices of our salt codﬁsh 
               <br />
               soared to unprecedented ﬁgures. Never in 
               <br />
               our history have prices for our principal 
               <br />
               product been so high. And then once hos~

               tilities ceased and the world generally started

               <br />
               obtained for our primary products began to

               <br />
               when normal conditions had been restored to 
               <br />
               the world generally in 1923 that the prices for

               a great proportion of our present revenues is

               Committee wants us to believe that if there had 
               <br />

               <br />

               1y believe that if there had been no war, paper

               quintal; iron, copper and zinc at as high prices? 
               <br />
               Would the herring industry have attained such 
               <br />
               high proportions as it did? Do not the members 
               <br />
               of the Committee and the people of this country 
               <br />
               believe that as soon as these ravaged countries 
               <br />
               who manufacture paper and pulp get into full 
               <br />
               production again, it will have a tendency to lower 
               <br />
               prices on these commodities? They know the 
               <br />
               ﬁshing industry in all its aspects will be affected, 
               <br />
               These are facts we have to face. In conclusion,

               with the exception of the observations I have

               Mr. Cashin I take it, as chairman of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com»</span>

               mittee, it is my privilege to reply to Mr. Mac-

               Donald. Iam glad the matter has been brought up. 
               <br />
               I take it everyone here has a copy of the Finance 
               <br />
               Report. Though we are dealing with the 
               <br />
               Economic Report, one relates to the other. I 
               <br />

               From information received from the Depart-

               ment of Finance we ﬁnd that as at December 
               <br />
               31, 1946, the actual cash to the credit of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was distributed as follows:* 
               <br />
               Now, this man in the editorial highchair... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Major Cashin, I cannot allow 
               <br />
               you to say that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin He is my most cherished friend... I 
               <br />
               wonder if the editor of the Telegram is aware of 
               <br />
               the fact that during that period we borrowed $8 
               <br />
               million in cash. What happened to it? Was it not 
               <br />
               put into the bank? Did it not go into the con— 
               <br />
               solidated fund? Add that on and you have $35 
               <br />
               million. But they are trying to put out the idea that 
               <br />
               myself and the Finance Committee faked these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures.
