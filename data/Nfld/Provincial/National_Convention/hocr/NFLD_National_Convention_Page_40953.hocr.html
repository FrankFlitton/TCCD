               This man is insulting. This man is completely 
               <br />
               insulting! Who does he think he is, sir? Does he

               think his money gives him the right to act like a

               going to be insulted by a man merely because he 
               <br />
               has money. Does he think just because he has

               Mr. Chairman It is rather late to take issue on

               the procedure, Mr. Penney. I would remind you 
               <br />
               we are on clause 22; there is only another clause 
               <br />
               to be read. If for any reason you were objecting 
               <br />
