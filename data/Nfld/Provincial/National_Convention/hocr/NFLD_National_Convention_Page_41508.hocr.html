               Mr. Hickman solemnly assures us that he is 
               <br />
               not an anticonfederate. Well, he certainly did not 
               <br />
               go very far out of his way to praise confederation 
               <br />
               very much. He says the governments of two 
               <br />
               provinces have not yet accepted the tax agree— 
               <br />
               ment. That is true. But the governments of seven 
               <br />
               provinces have accepted. Mr. Hickman tells us 
               <br />
               that in 1946 one-third of Canada’s revenue was 
               <br />
               raised from indirect taxes. That may be true. I will 
               <br />
               not vouch for one—third. In Newfoundland far 
               <br />
               over half the revenue was raised by indirect taxes. 
               <br />
               Quite a difference.

               There are only two points in Mr. Crosbie’s 
               <br />
               speech to which I will refer. He says there is a 
               <br />
               serious danger of our losing our ﬁsh markets in 
               <br />
               Europe; he quotes Mr. Gushue as having said so. 
               <br />
               But did Mr. Gushue say it was confederation that 
               <br />
               made this danger? No! The danger is here now, 
               <br />
               with no confederation. It is confederation that 
               <br />
               will help. Mr. Crosbie said that under confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, Canada will control our trade. There is not 
               <br />
               in all this country even one ﬁsh exporter who will 
               <br />
               not be able to go right on selling to the same 
               <br />
               markets just as long as he likes to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> The 
               <br />
               Canadian government does not tell each exporter 
               <br />
               to what country or to what customer he may sell 
               <br />
               or export his ﬁsh or ore or paper or anything else. 
               <br />
               Canada has not become the third largest expon- 
               <br />
               ing nation in the world by anything so stupid or 
               <br />
               silly as telling exporters where they may export. 
               <br />
               The other point is about the Fisheries Board, he 
               <br />
               is afraid it will have to go. But it won’t have to 
               <br />
               go. It will stay and still serve ourﬁshing industry, 
               <br />
               except that it will receive the extremely valuable 
               <br />
               assistance of the whole magnificent trade and

               Mr. Miller made an interesting point, he said

               There has been a lot of wonderful talk in this 
               <br />
               debate about the question of how the provincial 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland would finance it- 
               <br />
               self under confederation, how it would balance 
               <br />
               its budget. Some members have magniﬁed this, 
               <br />
               blown it up into gigantic proportions. They 
               <br />
               profess to regard it as a terrible and an insoluble 
               <br />
               problem, something they cannot see or under~ 
               <br />
               stand. Let me give them a short simple lesson. 
               <br />
               The federal government will take $20 million 
               <br />
               from us in taxes each year. The provincial 
               <br />
               government will take another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$56</span> million from 
               <br />
               us in taxes — call it $6 million. That is a total of 
               <br />
               $26 million altogether to be taken from us both 
               <br />
               governments ~— $26 million a year. What are we 
               <br />
               paying now? We are paying $40 million to our 
               <br />
               one government. $26 million taken from $40 
               <br />
               million is $14 million —- $14 million less taxes 
               <br />
               than we are paying now. Under confederation we 
               <br />
               would save $14 million a year in taxes. “But”, 
               <br />
               says someone, “what about the growth of our 
               <br />
               provincial government services“? Aren’t you 
               <br />
               going to make allowances for increase and im— 
               <br />
               provement of our provincial government services 
               <br />
               to the people?" “Haven’t we got to expect in- 
               <br />
               creased education and health services to our 
               <br />
               people?", I am asked. Of course we have. There 
               <br />
               is no doubt about it. And why shouldn’t we? We 
               <br />
               will save $14 million a year in taxes under con- 
               <br />
               federation. Is there anything to stop us from 
               <br />
               taking a million, or even two million of that $14 
               <br />
               million? Confederation will save $14 million a 
               <br />
               year in taxes for our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> It will put $ 14 million 
               <br />
               a year into their pockets, our peoples’ pockets. 
               <br />
               All right, if we want to improve our provincial 
               <br />
               public services, let us take back a million or two 
               <br />
               of that $14 million and spend it on better educa— 
               <br />
               tion and health services for our people. We could 
               <br />
               do that, sir, and our people would not only have 
               <br />
               those better services, costing say another $2 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mil»</span> 
               <br />
               lion a year, but would still be $12 million a year 
               <br />
               better off in their pockets <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span> and that’s a million 
               <br />
               a month.
