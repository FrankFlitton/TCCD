               <br />
               this point was put to us by Mr. St. Laurent at a 
               <br />
               plenary session when we asked him did it apply 
               <br />
               to steamships, as a lot of our stock comes and 
               <br />
               goes out by water, and this 20% reduction on 
               <br />
               stock coming in and going out by rail would not 
               <br />
               help us much. He said, “Surely the railway 
               <br />
               operating between the mainland of Canada and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would have to be cut in its rates 
               <br />
               by the competition it might have from steamers. 
               <br />
               Would your steamers not have to cut their rates 
               <br />
               by reason of competition from the railway?" 
               <br />
               You would have two means — rail and water, one 
               <br />
               is competing with the other; then the trade of the 
               <br />
               country would thrive.

               Mr. Cashin On this point about the feeds 
               <br />

               <br />
               water. Rail haul is much more expensive than 
               <br />
               waterhaul. That was why they gave that 20%
