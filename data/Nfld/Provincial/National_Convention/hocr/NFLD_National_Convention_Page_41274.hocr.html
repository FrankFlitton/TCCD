               of Canadian goal, I think that a delegation such

               as this could come back with any juice that 
               <br />
               might be extracted from the Canadian apple. In 
               <br />
               other words, I think that the gentlemen I have 
               <br />
               mentioned could drive the hardest and best pos— 
               <br />
               sible bargain, and would extract everything in the

               <br />
               said adieu to Mr. St. Laurent. I do not think that 
               <br />
               the men who went to Ottawa were capable of 
               <br />
               driving a hard bargain. As for Mr. Smallwood, I 
               <br />
               do not think mat there is a more sincere man in 
               <br />
               this House than he is. I have known Mr. Small— 
               <br />
               wood long enough to know that he is utterly 
               <br />
               sincere and honest in his convictions. He is a very 
               <br />
               kindly gentleman, and possesses all the virtues 
               <br />
               and none of the vices. As they say, to know him 
               <br />
               is to love him. But one quality Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               does not possess. With all his virtues he is not the 
               <br />
               kind of a man thatI would hire to drive a ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               bargain; and unfortunately that was the kind of a 
               <br />
               bargain that was laid in Mr. Smallwood’s lap. 
               <br />
               The men to do this kind of thing are keen, ex- 
               <br />
               perienced, hard-headed businessmen, merchants, 
               <br />
               which Mr. Smallwood is not, and which he does 
               <br />
               not want to be. It is nothing against Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood to say this. In a sense it is to his credit. But 
               <br />
               in dealing with our Canadian cousins, the quality 
               <br />
               of the bargaining and horse trading is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neces»</span>

               We all know how much the USA is interested 
               <br />
               in this country. I think if we were wise enough to 
               <br />
               take advantage of the rivalry between Canada amd 
               <br />
               the USA, we could get almost any concession 
               <br />
               from either of these two countries. If we had our 
               <br />
               own government, and sent a good delegation to 
               <br />
               the USA, I am inclined to think that we would get 
               <br />
               a trade treaty, and that country would take all the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery products that we might produce in the 
               <br />
               years ahead. It is in the USA that our economic 
               <br />
               welfare lies. They want the things that we have. 
               <br />
               Canada does not want the things that we have. 
               <br />
               And we can only prosper by exporting what we 
               <br />
               produce. I have no wish for a political union with 
               <br />
               the USA. I think as Newfoundlanders we have 
               <br />
               more freedom, and a lot of other good things that 
               <br />
               we would lose by joining politically with either

               <br />
               lies in the direction of the USA, and with our own

               government we will have very little difﬁculty in 
               <br />
               ﬁnding the USA very much interested in giving 
               <br />
               us fair economic terms. We have reached the 
               <br />
               point where our mineral resources on the 
               <br />
               Labrador are beginning to bear fruit, and are 
               <br />
               wanted by the USA; ourfresh ﬁsh industry is only 
               <br />
               in its infancy, and is ﬁnding a ready market in the 
               <br />
               USA. And since the USA recognises our im- 
               <br />
               mense strategic importance, we are, so to speak, 
               <br />
               on the threshhold of a brighter economic era. It 
               <br />
               would be a form of madness to throw all of this 
               <br />
               away by giving it to Canada, with nothing in 
               <br />
               return. I hope that when the time comes to vote 
               <br />
               our Newfoundlanders will not be hypnotised by 
               <br />
               the pied piper. Do not listen to his tune, because 
               <br />
               if you do, you will do as the pied piper of old did, 
               <br />
               and if you follow him you will drown in the Cabot 
               <br />
               Strait. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we have had our ups 
               <br />
               and downs, and our way has been hard and the 
               <br />
               struggle long. But we have enjoyed some things 
               <br />
               that we had, and there is more freedom in New— 
               <br />
               foundland than anywhere. We are all one big 
               <br />

               Windjammer. For the same reason I could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apv</span> 
               <br />
               prove of Mr. Smallwood’s efforts, if at the same

               time he had given us some real facts about this 
               <br />
               confederation business. I ﬁnd myself in the dark 
               <br />
               on many matters on which he should have thrown 
               <br />
               light. I feel that other members of the Convention 
               <br />
               and the people of the country feel as I do in this 
               <br />
               respect. Of course, he said many things and made 
               <br />
               many statements. But in my opinion, for every 
               <br />
               thing he did tell us, there are at least two others 
               <br />
               that he did not tell us. He handed out to us in 
               <br />
               plentiful supply his homemade forecasts and 
               <br />
               prophecies. He gazed long into the crystal ball 
               <br />
               and told us of the bright new world that was to 
               <br />
               be. But while that might be of value to him as an
