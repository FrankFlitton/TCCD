               Educational services have been very consid-

               But quite apart from the widening of the scope 
               <br />
               of government services, we have to bear in mind 
               <br />
               the increased costs for salaries, supplies and

               <br />
               Furthermore, we have to remember that in 1934 
               <br />
               government services had been pared to the bone, 
               <br />

               <br />

               I should point out that the provision of $23

               <br />

               larger amount to meet this need. Quite apart from

               <br />
               directions, but they will be more than counter- 
               <br />
               balanced by normal expansion of activities, 
               <br />
               which is the inevitable trend in any progressive 
               <br />

               <br />
               costs of well over half a million dollars a year in
