               exactly, but what he has done is ask for further

               detail on one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">item.</span> Here is a table of $26 million

               those details. If Major Cashin will put in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques»</span>

               debate this thing to our heart‘s content, and the

               people will know the truth. That’s the way to do 
               <br />
               it. In the meantime let’s adjourn the Convention 
               <br />
               and go home and take a rest. I know I need a rest, 
               <br />
               for one.

               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I think we are 
               <br />
               doing a lot of yelling and talking about very little. 
               <br />
               We seem to have overlooked the more important 
               <br />
               phase of this. We have asked for these questions 
               <br />
               to be tabled and sent forward, and I think we were 
               <br />
               agreed that this would take some time to get, and 
               <br />
               it might not be before we re—assemble in January. 
               <br />
               I think everyone feels we cannot get out of here 
               <br />
               without a Christmas recess, but we seem to be 
               <br />
               overlooking the fact, when we talk about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad~</span> 
               <br />
               jouming, that as I understood on Monday we 
               <br />
               would have some ﬁgures to go on with our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis»</span> 
               <br />
               cussion on a provincial budget, and that’s a lot 
               <br />
               more important than this federal one. This federal 
               <br />
               one is important because it means the money that 
               <br />
               the Canadian government will take out of New- 
               <br />
               foundland and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spend.</span>

               <br />

               the people of this country, and they should have

               Mr. Chairman Before you resume your seat, 
               <br />

               think, feels that there are matters of interest, other 
               <br />
               than the purely ﬁnancial questions, which could 
               <br />
               be dealt with this afternoon.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hickman Well, sir, on that, and going back 
               <br />
               to yesterday’s Steering Committee, there was no 
               <br />
               such agreement on what we would do, if any- 
               <br />
               thing, for one good reason mentioned this after- 
               <br />
               noon, and yesterday afternoon in the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee — that the Committee can make no 
               <br />
               agreements binding on this Convention, and 
               <br />
               there were suggestions that there was much in 
               <br />
               this that has no bearing on that question of 
               <br />
               ﬁnance; and the suggestion that this should be 
               <br />
               brought up or not brought up was discussed; and 
               <br />
               the very point was made the Steering Committee 
               <br />
               could decide nothing because it would only be the 
               <br />
               decision ofa few, and the other 34 or 35 members 
               <br />
               could bring up anything they like as long as it is 
               <br />
               relevant to what we are discussing, which is these 
               <br />
               books and the Grey Book, and for that reason 
               <br />
               there was no such agreement made. In fact there 
               <br />
               would have been no unanimity because there 
               <br />
               were men in disagreement there.
