               Brien, and Cecil Penney. This Convention —— 
               <br />
               most of us —— have no idea of the work that these 
               <br />
               men have to do. They have been here all hours of 
               <br />
               the day, until 5.30 the other morning, also some- 
               <br />
               one in the studio taking it all down on the records. 
               <br />
               I hope the Broadcasting Corporation will not 
               <br />
               forget to remember the staff when the bonuses are 
               <br />
               being passed around. I hope they will remember 
               <br />
               the work of the staff.

               I want to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> a special word for the Doyle 
               <br />
               News Bulletin. I am not thinking only of their 
               <br />
               impartiality, of their fairness in giving a square 
               <br />
               deal to every speaker; not only am I thinking of 
               <br />
               their accuracy. A man gets up here and talks for 
               <br />
               three-quarters of an hour. A man sits in that press 
               <br />
               box, and sums up quickly and accurately what 
               <br />
               that man says and compresses it into three or four 
               <br />
               minutes; that is a high-classjob that calls for real 
               <br />
               skill. The Convention rises at six o’clock and they 
               <br />
               come on the air at quarter to eight, and give a 
               <br />
               compressed, square account of the proceedings. 
               <br />
               It is a ﬁne piece of work, and in that work Mr. 
               <br />
               Michael Mulcahy is beyond comparison — one 
               <br />
               of the finest newspaper reporters or radio 
               <br />
               reporters this country has ever had. That man 
               <br />
               worked until he collapsed, simply collapsed.

               always getting up and asking for “a pint of

               Mr. Higgins I suppose this is the ﬁrst time I 
               <br />
               seconded a motion of Mr. Smallwood; it probably

               Corporation for any political prestige I might 
               <br />
               have. Particularly do I owe them a lot for what 
               <br />
               they did on March 2, 1947.2 I want to add my

               appreciation of the ﬁne work done by the staff of

               the Broadcasting Corporation, particularly the 
               <br />
