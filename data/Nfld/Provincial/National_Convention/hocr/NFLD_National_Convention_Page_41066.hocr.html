               1867 left no doubt as to where the sovereignty of 
               <br />
               Canada lay, and as Sir Wilfred Laurier stated,

               The relationships between the provincial

               legislatures and the Dominion government were 
               <br />
               deﬁned by the division of powers actually written 
               <br />
               into the British North America Act and later 
               <br />

               <br />
               words which describe what those powers really 
               <br />
               mean. The strength or weakness of the Canadian 
               <br />
               government relative to the provincial govem- 
               <br />
               ments has depended in large measure upon politi- 
               <br />
               cal, fiscal, economic and social considerations. 
               <br />
               The powers of the Dominion government as laid 
               <br />
               down in the British North America Act include 
               <br />
               these high functions and sovereign powers by 
               <br />

               lation may be secured in those questions that are 
               <br />
               of common import to all the provinces, to quote 
               <br />
               Lord Carnarvon when he introduced the act in the 
               <br />
               House of Lords. In other words, power was given 
               <br />
               to deal with all matters of a public and general 
               <br />
               character, as for example the making of treaties 
               <br />
               or the making of war, and laws relative to taxation 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generali</span> And to the provinces was given those 
               <br />
               powers which allowed then to deal with all mat- 
               <br />
               ters of a merely local or private nature in the 
               <br />
               province.

               If you have had the opportunity, gentlemen, to 
               <br />
               read the British North America Act you will find 
               <br />
               in one section that the Dominion government is 
               <br />
               given the power to raise money by any mode or 
               <br />
               system of taxation. And, if you turn to another 
               <br />
               section you will ﬁnd that the provinces are given 
               <br />
               the exclusive right to make laws in relation to 
               <br />
               direct taxation within the province in order to 
               <br />
               raise revenue for provincial purposes. This is 
               <br />
               very important to remember, for it is these two 
               <br />
               sections which all down through the past 82 years 
               <br />

               provincial relationships, and which on more than

               Take ourselves, for example; if we entered into

               confederation tomorrow our treasury would lose

               <br />

               deficits, the servicing of our deﬁcit, and a few 
               <br />

               <br />
               $28.5 million we no longer have to worry about 
               <br />
               these services as a government. But as in— 
               <br />
               dividuals we would still have to contribute to 
               <br />
               their costs. For instance, on all those articles we 
               <br />
               import, other than from Canada, we shall still be 
               <br />
               charged duty, and the Dominion government 
               <br />
               would collect from us about $15 million in in- 
               <br />

               But let us get back to Nova Scotia in 1865. 
               <br />
               Whilst still a separate province in 1864, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia had a revenue of $l.3 million and an 
               <br />
               expenditure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,222,355.</span> leaving a surplus of 
               <br />
               $77,645. The question was how much of the $ l <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.3</span> 
               <br />
               million revenue would still remain to the local 
               <br />
               legislature after confederation. At that time over 
               <br />
               90% of Nova Scotia‘s taxation revenue came 
               <br />
               from customs duties, and this, on going into 
               <br />
               confederation, she would have to turn over to the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. Acutally it was found 
               <br />
               that if Nova Scotia entered confederation only 
               <br />
               $107,000 could he expected to be collected by 
               <br />
               her from the local revenue sources still reserved. 
               <br />
               It was found that after she would go into con- 
               <br />
               federation her local expenditures would be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$667,000,</span> Now this would leave a deficit of 
               <br />
               $560,000. How was the deficit to be made up? 
               <br />
               There were various methods devised: (l) the use 
               <br />
               of the power of direct taxation; (2) concession of 
               <br />
               the right of the province to use indirect taxation; 
               <br />
               (3) divide Nova Scotia into municipalities and let 
               <br />
               them hear much of the burden with regard to 
               <br />
               government roads, health, etc. Up to this time 
               <br />
               town councils were almost unknown in Nova 
               <br />
