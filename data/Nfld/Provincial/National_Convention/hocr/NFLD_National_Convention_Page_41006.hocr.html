               <br />
               to attend that meeting yesterday. We attended a 
               <br />
               meeting the night before, and discussed a lot of 
               <br />
               things, and then came in here at a public session

               <br />
               which Mr. Higgins has referred are customs and

               <br />
               get certain information asked for; and I insist that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood is making a misinterpretation, 
               <br />
               not intentional I suspect, but there are certain 
               <br />
               things there that our people do not know, and I 
               <br />
               want them to know, and I hope Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               does that.

               day afternoon; but I feel it is correct to say there

               was no unanimity of opinion as to the procedure

               <br />
               noon, and Monday afternoon next. My impres- 
               <br />
               sion is that perhaps a slight majority might have 
               <br />
               had what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood suggests in mind, but i 
               <br />
               am quite sure that that was not unanimously 
               <br />
               agreed to, because one member very emphatical- 
               <br />
               ly stated that he would not consider himself

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anived</span> at; and secondly, it will have to be remem~ 
               <br />
               bered that a decision of the Steering Committee 
               <br />
               is not binding upon the Convention at all. It is a 
               <br />
               recommendation as to the procedure to be fol- 
               <br />
               lowed in a given case, which may be accepted or 
               <br />
               rejected by the Convention and therefore I do feel 
               <br />
               there is no useful purpose to be served in debat- 
               <br />
               ing, or trying to break down the probable 
               <br />
               revenues and expenditures as set forth in pages 
               <br />

               <br />
               requested from the various governments and

               government departments is forthcoming, and

               <br />
               figures in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> But. Mr. Smallwood, while it 
               <br />
               may very well happen that miscellaneous excise 
               <br />
               taxes and sources of revenue of $1.5 million is an 
               <br />
               item included in the probable revenues estimated 
               <br />
               by the federal government, I think that might be 
               <br />
               deferred until Monday for the reason that we have 
               <br />
               decided, at least I think we ought to decide, to 
               <br />
               defer discussion in this matter. But surely, surely, 
               <br />
               in discussing the meaning of excise duties. its 
               <br />
               effect upon the economy of a country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some.</span> 
               <br />
               thing entirely different from trying to show how
