               Mr. Harmon In order to satisfy the chairman of 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee and my friend from 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre, I say here now without fear of 
               <br />
               contradiction, that the Commission government 
               <br />
               did issue that order, that certain rates of wages be 
               <br />
               paid in Newfoundland when the war was on, 
               <br />
               when the military boys were running it here. I was 
               <br />
               in a position to know, as I happened to be employ— 
               <br />
               ment agent at Gander, and had all to do with the 
               <br />
               rates of wages, rising demand and all the rest. I 
               <br />
               received orders from the President of the Atlas 
               <br />
               Construction Company, no less a person than 
               <br />
               Sydney Dawes, and before he gave the order he 
               <br />
               said, “What kind of rum have you got there?" 
               <br />
               “Well,” I said, “not much rum.” He says, “I didn’t 
               <br />
               think so." “Harmon,” he said, “you’re to pay 
               <br />
               labourers only 30 cents.” I said, “Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               Dawes,” I said, “we can’t get labourers.” An 
               <br />
               order from the government, and to settle it the 
               <br />
               only way we could to get the labourers there to 
               <br />
               re-engage, thousands and thousands of men, was 
               <br />
               to offer them 10% in savings securities, and we 
               <br />
               were never allowed to pay them any more then 
               <br />
               30 cents cash. As a matter of fact I saw the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               order, and I have a copy of it at home. Anybody 
               <br />
               can doubt of course, but I’m prepared to produce 
               <br />

               of wages to be paid labourers would be at the rate 
               <br />
               of 30 cents per hour, but in addition to that, you 
               <br />
               saw an ofﬁcial order.

               whether business asked them or not. It didn’t

               Mr. Smallwood If my raising the point did noth- 
               <br />
               ing more than to bring Mr. Harmon to his feet, it 
               <br />
               was well worth doing. Now perhaps I have more 
               <br />
               information on this than any man in this house or 
               <br />
               any man in this country. I was editor of a 
               <br />
               newspaper in this city called The Express. One of 
               <br />
               the owners of that paper was Mr. Higgins who 
               <br />
               sits opposite there now. As editor of that paper I 
               <br />
               made it my business to get to the bottom of it. I 
               <br />
               knew, and everyone knew the story that was 
               <br />
               going around that the Americans and the 
               <br />
               Canadians were willing to pay more money, but 
               <br />
               that the Commission of Government had in- 
               <br />
               fluenced them in some way or other to keep the 
               <br />
               wages down and not to pay the wages that they 
               <br />
               were willing to pay. Everyone knew that rumour. 
               <br />
               And I decided to get to the bottom of it. My ﬁrst 
               <br />
               step was to go to Colonel Bmton, who was in 
               <br />
               charge of the United States engineering forces, 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst man to come here. He had ofﬁces in the 
               <br />
               Reid building on Duckworth Street. From him I 
               <br />
               could get only enough to make me feel that I was 
               <br />
               on the right track. Naturally he was an American 
               <br />
               ofﬁcer representing the American government. 
               <br />
               They were dealing with the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government and he didn’t like to say too much. 
               <br />
               But he said enough to show me that l was on the 
               <br />
               right track. So what I did was this; and if I’m not 
               <br />
               mistaken I think Mr. Butt can corroborate some 
               <br />
               of what I’m going to say. At that time Mr. Butt 
               <br />
               was conﬁdential secretary or assistant secretary 
               <br />
               for Public Utilities, working with Sir Wilfred 
               <br />
               Woods. I had an interview with Sir Wilfred 
               <br />
               Woods on this question. Was the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland responsible for keeping the 
               <br />
               wages down? That’s all I went to see him about. 
               <br />
               I told him that at the start. And I said to him, “Sir 
               <br />
