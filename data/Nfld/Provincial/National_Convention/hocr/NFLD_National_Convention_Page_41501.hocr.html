               <br />
               its own ofﬁcers, running its own affairs. But 
               <br />
               every union joined the Federation. The Federa- 
               <br />
               tion was a federal union of unions. There were 
               <br />
               certain matters and certain affairs that were too 
               <br />
               big for any one union to handle, and that is why 
               <br />
               the Federation was formed. Each union that 
               <br />
               linked up with the Federation held on to its own 
               <br />
               local autonomy and ran its own local affairs, but 
               <br />
               the Federation began to handle the things that 
               <br />
               were too big for any one union to run, and the 
               <br />
               Federation began to handle matters that were of 
               <br />

               <br />

               And that’s just how it is with the Canadian 
               <br />
               federal union. Each individual province goes 
               <br />
               right on handling its own purely local affairs, and 
               <br />
               the federal government takes over the manage-

               <br />
               marine works and so forth. Each province elects

               its own government to run its own local affairs,

               does not mean that Canada would take us over 
               <br />
               and run us. We would elect our own government 
               <br />

               <br />

               certain things and the federal government would 
               <br />
               run us in other things.

               big point in favour of confederation. But sir, the 
               <br />
               biggest reason of all for confederation, as I see it, 
               <br />
               is that it will link us up with a great British nation.

               <br />
               Britain herself. I repeat that, Mr. Chairman: 
               <br />
               Canada is the largest and richest nation in the 
               <br />
               whole British Commonwealth, next to Britain 
               <br />

               <br />
               surely a system of government that works for 
               <br />
               12.5 million people will work just as well for 
               <br />

               It is only plain common sense to think that it 
               <br />
               would benefit this small country to throw in her 
               <br />
               lot with that great, wealthy British nation. We 
               <br />
               should never forget in this country that at the very 
               <br />
               time our country went broke, one of Canada’s 
               <br />
               provinces went broke too. When Newfoundland 
               <br />
               went broke in the early 1930s, the Province of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan went broke. Where did we have to 
               <br />
               turn? To the old mother country. And thank God 
               <br />
               the mother country came to our rescue, because 
               <br />
               at that time she was able to But we had to give 
               <br />
               up our own government and come under the 
               <br />
               Commission system. Where did Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               turn? She turned to the federal government of 
               <br />
               Canada. Where else would she turn but to the 
               <br />
               government of the very union of which she was 
               <br />
               a member? She turned to the government of all 
               <br />
               Canada, and that government came to her rescue. 
               <br />
               But did she lose her own government? Did the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada take their government 
               <br />

               <br />
               Democracy remained in Saskatchewan. Self- 
               <br />
               govemment remained. That’s the difference, sir, 
               <br />
               when you are a province of Canada. You may run 
               <br />
               on hard times as a province, but you cannot go 
               <br />
               under. The government of the whole nation 
               <br />
               stands by you. And if we become a province of 
               <br />
               Canada with our own self~government, we will 
               <br />
               have a strong friend at our back in case we ever 
               <br />
               need one. That is something to think about, sir. 
               <br />
               For we must not get any foolish ideas into our 
               <br />
               heads that we will never need a friend. 
               <br />
               Everybody does. We know the kind of world we 
               <br />
               are living in. We know the uncertainties of this 
               <br />
               world, and the uncertainties of trade and ﬁnance. 
               <br />
