               There are many varieties of ﬁsh which I can- 
               <br />
               not take time to discuss with you. I would like to 
               <br />
               discuss, however, our lobster ﬁshery. At one time 
               <br />
               we only canned lobster, but today the greater part 
               <br />
               of our lobsters are being shipped alive. I am sure 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> men in this Convention will 
               <br />
               agree that, through the shipment of live lobster 
               <br />
               by the co—operatives and private firms, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsherv</span> 
               <br />
               men are much better off than they ever were. I am 
               <br />
               glad that the co-operative movement has taken 
               <br />
               over such work, and I wish them luck in the 
               <br />
               future. Now then, we come to the product about 
               <br />
               which many people are sceptical and that is the 
               <br />
               value of our waste. When we first started in 
               <br />
               Corner Brook to manufacture herring oil and 
               <br />
               meal after extracting the oil from the water, we 
               <br />
               had water left. During the last two years we have 
               <br />
               found this water valuable and today there is not 
               <br />
               a thing which cannot be used, including the 
               <br />
               water. This also applies to the whaling industry, 
               <br />
               and I am sure we are going to ﬁnd the same in all 
               <br />
               the other branches of our ﬁshery. In Iceland and 
               <br />
               other countries, all this waste is utilised, running 
               <br />
               into millions of dollars; and waste can be utilised 
               <br />
               in this country as well. I am sure that in centres 
               <br />
               such as Bonavista where they are handling large 
               <br />
               quantities of frozen ﬁsh, ﬁsh waste plants could 
               <br />
               be established and the ﬁshermen will get more 
               <br />
               money per quintal for their ﬁsh and get rid of the 
               <br />
               dirt and the filth around their harbours. 
               <br />

               The value of our ﬁsheries in 1946 was some- 
               <br />
               where in the neighbourhood of $34 million. The 
               <br />
               Fishery Committee valued the ﬁsheries at $25 
               <br />
               million. I think they can be valued at more if we 
               <br />
               have faith and courage enough to go ahead, to 
               <br />
               move forward, to push and strive for greater 
               <br />
               developments. I feel that if our ﬁsheries go below 
               <br />
               $25-30 million, it is because we are lacking 
               <br />
               foresight and vision, something which most 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders ﬁnd in other countries, and 
               <br />
               which we seem to lack in our own. I have every 
               <br />
               reason, the country has every reason, to feel 
               <br />
               optimistic over the future of ﬁsheries. We have 
               <br />
               unlimited resources and raw materials; we have 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen; we have everything that anyone 
               <br />
               needs to develop the ﬁsheries in this country and 
               <br />
               push them forward. We may need assistance, 
               <br />
               more research information, more biological in- 
               <br />
               formation and a better laboratory than the one we 
               <br />
               now have, but these are things we can have if we 
               <br />
               want to fight for them, push for them and insist

               sensibly, reasonably and intelligently. Let us give 
               <br />
               the public of this country the facts that we can 
               <br />
               give them without being hot, personal and 
               <br />
               abusive. We can do it if we wish, and l for one 
               <br />
               intend to follow those lines, and I hope and trust 
               <br />
               that we can prove to our country and our people 
               <br />
               that we are sensible, reasonable and willing to 
               <br />
               co-operate and work together.

               Mr. Hillier ....Mr. Hickman, in a very fair 
               <br />
               speech calmly made here two or three days ago, 
               <br />
               gave me the impression that he was a bit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disap&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               pointed in connection with Convention proceed— 
               <br />
               ings. If that is so, I can quite understand it. I too 
               <br />
               have been somewhat disappointed, because the 
               <br />
               mental picture I had built up of this work has been 
               <br />
               dashed to pieces. I have no desire to prolong this 
               <br />
               Convention one hour longer than is strictly neces- 
               <br />
               sary, so my remarks will not be lengthy. I am not 
               <br />
               aspiring to a place in any future government 
               <br />
               Newfoundland may have, so like Mr. Hickman, 
               <br />
               I have no axe to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grind.</span> My only wish is that 
               <br />
               whatever our political set-up, it proves to be 
               <br />
               productive of the most good for the most people 
               <br />
               and in the general interest of all. I do not look on 
               <br />
               the dark side of life, even when clouds are heavy 
               <br />
               and dark I look beyond them in hope. I believe 
               <br />
               that we have somewhere resources as yet un- 
               <br />
               touched which can be profitably developed, and 
               <br />
               that those we have can be further developed; but 
               <br />
               capital, labour and government must work 
               <br />
               together. A government must not be expected to 
               <br />
               shoulder all the responsibility in making a 
               <br />
               country progress. We, the people, have to bear 
               <br />
               our share, and blame ourselves to the proper 
               <br />
               extent for lack of progress. 
               <br />

               <br />
               not be considerably improved. I fear in the past 
               <br />
               there has been a little too much of self and not
