               I am going to refer shortly to our national debt. 
               <br />
               In my remarks this afternoon I stated that the 
               <br />
               national debt should have been cancelled when 
               <br />
               the base deal was put through. That is my own 
               <br />
               personal opinion. Why should I make that state— 
               <br />
               ment? These people who are operating the 
               <br />
               government were trustees and they have no right 
               <br />
               to give away our territory without some compen- 
               <br />
               sation, and they should have at least cancelled the 
               <br />
               sterling debt.... I am conﬁdent that if Ncw~ 
               <br />
               foundland was governed by a government of its 
               <br />
               own, one of the ﬁrst steps could be to negotiate 
               <br />
               with the British government as to the reduction 
               <br />
               of that sterling debt. Why? War debts all over this 
               <br />
               world have been cancelled $45 million of that 
               <br />
               money was spent during the war from 1914-18, 
               <br />
               that is to date what it has cost Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Well, if all other countries cancelled war debts 
               <br />
               we are just as much entitled to cancel them as 
               <br />
               anyone else, and I am compelled to state that if I 
               <br />
               was ever in a government of Newfoundland, one 
               <br />
               of the ﬁrst things I would do would be to start 
               <br />
               negotiations with the British government for the 
               <br />
               cancellation of that debt. 
               <br />

               There is one more matter, Mr. Chairman, and 
               <br />
               that is the matter brought up by my friend the 
               <br />
               Rev. Mr. Burry the other day, about this Labrador 
               <br />
               Development Company that’s going out of busi- 
               <br />
               ness at the present time. I know something of the 
               <br />
               struggles the promoter of that company has had 
               <br />
               during the past 12-14 months trying to keep it 
               <br />
               aﬂoat, trying to get sterling convened in dollars, 
               <br />
               that's been the great difﬁculty. He has 10-12,000 
               <br />
               cords of pit props which are required, mind you, 
               <br />
               on the other side... This company was prepared 
               <br />
               to put up £50,000 in London and to cash it, so to 
               <br />
               speak, out here for $200,000, and the government 
               <br />
               would not do that. What is the result? The busi- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ness</span> closes down. The further result, the most 
               <br />
               unfortunate of all, is that these poor unfortunate 
               <br />
               people down there have got to be fed during the 
               <br />
               winter at government expense. I contend that it is 
               <br />
               criminal... It means the loss of $300,000 this 
               <br />
               winter just because the Commission of Govem- 
               <br />
               ment or the Dominions Ofﬁce, or the British 
               <br />
               Treasury refused to cash a cheque for £50,000 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Did the government agree? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin The government here agreed to do 
               <br />
               it, and on the other side they said “no". Well, what 
               <br />
               can you expect? I can’t understand my friend Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood disagreeing with me at times when I 
               <br />
               make critical remarks about Dominions Ofﬁce in 
               <br />
               London, and the manner in which they handle our 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial affairs. A few days ago <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Bradley 
               <br />
               took up the time of this House by over an hour. I 
               <br />
               am sorry Mr. Bradley is not here. He is one ofthe 
               <br />
               ablest speakers in this country. I have been a 
               <br />
               member of this House with him, and a member 
               <br />
               of the government with him, and I realise that he 
               <br />
               is one of the outstanding public speakers of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New‘</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, and I am sorry he is sick.... He gave 
               <br />
               us an instance of how easy it is, with a big brush 
               <br />
               and lots of black paint, to smear an entire country. 
               <br />
               He went scavenging back to our national ash 
               <br />
               barrels for half a century, resurrecting the 
               <br />
               decayed corpses of this country’s misfortune, and 
               <br />
               rattled the bones of past history before us. His 
               <br />
               general motto seemed to be that if he could ﬁnd 
               <br />
               nothing bad to say, he would say nothing good 
               <br />
               anyhow. I waited to hear him say something even 
               <br />
               faintly optimistic, something with a promise of 
               <br />
               hope, something that could be called constructive 
               <br />
               or helpful, but I waited, and you waited, and the 
               <br />
               country waited in vain. In presenting the 
               <br />
               economic picture of this country we have been 
               <br />
               accused of trying to lop off a few million dollars, 
               <br />
               but Mr. Bradley goes further than this — he lops 
               <br />
               off seven years as if they had never existed. Truly 
               <br />
               an amazing performance. He spoke of the dole 
               <br />
               days, just as if Newfoundland was the only 
               <br />
               country which had known dole. He spoke of the 
               <br />
               hard times of our people as if we were the only 
               <br />
               people in the world who had known hard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times.</span> 
               <br />
               He spoke of depression as if we were the only 
               <br />
               ones to feel its bite. Now we all know the mean- 
               <br />
               ing of fair criticism, but anyone listening to Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley could only receive the same impression 
               <br />
               that I received, that I was not listening to a fair 
               <br />
               critic and an impartial discussion of the economic 
               <br />
               condition of this country, but to the voice of a 
               <br />
               person who had painstakingly and exhaustively 
               <br />
               and labouriously compiled what I regard as the 
               <br />
               most depressing wail of pessimism and despair 
               <br />
               which it has been my misfortune to hear in this 
               <br />
               House for nearly a quarter of a century.
