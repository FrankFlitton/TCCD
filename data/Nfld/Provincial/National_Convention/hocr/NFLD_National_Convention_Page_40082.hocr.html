               Mr. Job I think that the idea was that the cost of

               <br />
               a very worthwhile return to the pickers. I think it 
               <br />
               was because the price paid to the pickers was 
               <br />
               small in past years.

               Mr. Hollett There is anotherquestion about bait 
               <br />
               sold to ﬁshermen. The report states that “The bait 
               <br />
               frozen (squid and herring) was substantial, but 
               <br />
               nothing like the present—day volume because the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen were not generally so accustomed to 
               <br />
               using the frozen bait as they are now.” I don’t 
               <br />
               believe that, because years ago the only reason 
               <br />
               why fishermen did not use frozen bait very 
               <br />
               generally was because of the cost, which was 
               <br />
               almost prohibitive in view of the amount of 
               <br />
               money they received for the ﬁsh caught. I was 
               <br />
               wondering if the committee would be good 
               <br />
               enough to look into the present cost of bait as 
               <br />
               supplied to ﬁrst, out shore fishermen, and second, 
               <br />
               our bank ﬁshermen. It is absolutely essential if 
               <br />
               our ﬁshermen are to use frozen bait that some 
               <br />
               means he found to supply that bait at the least 
               <br />
               possible cost. The committee might be able to get 
               <br />
               some ﬁgures with regard to that... It is several 
               <br />
               years since I had anything to do with ﬁshery 
               <br />
               conditions, but in those old days there were a 
               <br />
               good many cases of the fall ﬁshing being given 
               <br />
               up merely because for that ﬁshery it became 
               <br />
               necessary for the banking ﬂeet to procure frozen 
               <br />
               bait, and after trying it for a number of years they 
               <br />
               discovered that the returns which the individual 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman made on that trip were absolutely nil 
               <br />
               when they took into consideration the cost of
