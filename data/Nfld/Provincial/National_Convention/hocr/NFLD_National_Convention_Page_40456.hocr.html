               time. I believe our subsidiary ﬁsheries can, in 
               <br />
               many cases, be enlarged... The figure of 
               <br />
               $34,499,171 for last year was heartening, and 
               <br />
               although these are inflated values, yet our ﬁshery 
               <br />
               is in a healthy condition and I believe a ﬁrm

               policy now, with an eye for new markets and also 
               <br />
               to barter where we can’t get cash, will put us 
               <br />
               through. But it must be done by a combination of 
               <br />
               government, merchants, and ﬁshermen. We are 
               <br />
               all tied up together. I believe the whole question 
               <br />
               of the Labrador cure is that we heavy-salt too 
               <br />
               much of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it..r.</span> With regard to decked boats of 
               <br />
               20-25 tons, those vessels would be very econom- 
               <br />
               ical, especially on short hauls... The time has 
               <br />
               come for the nations to get together to ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               where ﬁsh spawn and to protect those regions, 
               <br />
               because the depletion of the Banks is caused by 
               <br />
               the heavy dories and nets ploughing up the bot- 
               <br />
               tom and destroying the food the ﬁngerlings live 
               <br />
               on in their early <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">life.“</span> The depletion of the Banks 
               <br />
               also makes great inroads on the shore <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁshery.</span> In 
               <br />
               the Straits of Belle Isle in 1880 it was usual for 
               <br />
               two men ﬁshing from whale boats with hand lines 
               <br />
               to land from 360 to 460 quintals of shore ﬁsh 
               <br />
               from the 15th June to the 20th September. Today 
               <br />
               three men are doing well to land 160 quintals in 
               <br />
               the same time, ﬁshing with motor boats. I believe 
               <br />
               the setting up of the Fisheries Board is a step in 
               <br />
               the right directionand more power to their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elbowi</span>

               The co-operative movement, especially in the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, should and must be of prime impor- 
               <br />
               tance to this country. It is only when the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men show an interest in the ﬁsh from the time it 
               <br />
               spawns until it reaches the consumer that our 
               <br />
               fisheries will come into their own. Bounties 
               <br />
               should be given for the repair of schooners.... I 
               <br />
               am not in a position to speak from experience 
               <br />
               with regard to the frozen ﬁsh business. I know it 
               <br />
               has a future. I believe that if we had one strong 
               <br />
               central company with faith in the resources be- 
               <br />

               <br />

               then to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> This should be done as 
               <br />
               quickly as possible. We should demand, while 
               <br />
               our present status exists, to have access to the 
               <br />
               British marketing agency in the same proportion 
               <br />
               as a regular citizen of the United Kingdom, and 
               <br />
               if we do get back dominion status we should be 
               <br />
               a pan of that agency either by negotiation with 
               <br />
               the UK government or by other means, even if it 
               <br />
               meant a cash contribution towards its upkeep. 
               <br />
               They have the greatest marketing agency in the 
               <br />
               world and I believe there is no reason why we 
               <br />
               should not have a liaison with them... There is 
               <br />
               one more thing I want to speak about and it is the 
               <br />
               insurance; as Kipling puts it, “If blood be the 
               <br />
               price of Admiralty", we have paid it in full in the 
               <br />
               past. I believe not in an insurance but a pension 
               <br />
               scheme paid something like the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment paid to their seamen and ﬁshermen during 
               <br />
               the war, where a widow would receive a pension 
               <br />
               until she remarried, and the children until they 
               <br />
               reached a certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">age.</span> This could be a tax on the 
               <br />
               industry with the government standing a part of 
               <br />
               it. The time has come for social service to come 
               <br />
               into the picture in this country. The government 
               <br />
               employee gets it, why not the primary producer’s 
               <br />
               dependents, if he is drowned? If a loss of limbs 
               <br />
               occurs through hardship, sickness, stranding or 
               <br />
               suffering hardship on wrecks, then he should be

               only disappointing part of it was the absence of 
               <br />
               remarks about markets. It is all very well to talk

               <br />

               <br />
               what is the point? I am disappointed he made no

               reference to the point I stressed so much here —— 
               <br />
               a quid pro quo from the USA for the concessions

               London, I hope someone will not forget to bring 
               <br />
               up that point in spite of the fact that the Commis-
