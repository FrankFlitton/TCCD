               <br />
               a little. I think there is a deﬁnite correlation

               between the various parts of this Transportation 
               <br />

               <br />
               the sections on tourists and Gander. Surely they 
               <br />
               must have something in common. We have been 
               <br />
               criticised not a little because with one boot we 
               <br />
               kick people for spending a million a year on 
               <br />
               Gander, and at the same time urge them to spend 
               <br />
               many millions of dollars on roads to open up the 
               <br />
               country for the tourist trade. Somebody outside 
               <br />
               the Convention asked me if I did not think that 
               <br />
               Gander is doing a little to open up the country too. 
               <br />
               Things like that tend to give us an appearance off 
               <br />
               colour to the public. I don’t care if the public are 
               <br />
               listening at the moment. That’s one point.

               any day in the week. They spend five minutes 
               <br />
               broadcasting telegrams for people, which, if they 
               <br />
               had to follow the usual channels, would never

               <br />
               the isolated settlements that need roads more? If 
               <br />

               <br />
               problem. I feel that we must consider roads and

               railways in conjunction with each other....

               The other thing that I intended to speak about 
               <br />
               was this: after we have read the report and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis.</span> 
               <br />
               cussed it, what profit has it brought us in our

               deliberation? In other words what does the report

               add to this general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact-ﬁnding</span> job that we have 
               <br />
               to do? Now as far as Transportation and Com- 
               <br />
               munications are concerned, it seems to me that 
               <br />
               there are at least four questions we must answer:

               question, why spend anything on them? Which 
               <br />

               We must give a great deal of thought and

               important to me. If we are to make any intelligent

               <br />
               ﬁgures I am quoting are from the report, and I am 
               <br />
               quoting from memory. Gander, about which we 
               <br />
               have a great many mental reservations, we think 
               <br />
               may cost up to $1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million...</span> Posts and telegraphs 
               <br />
               and broadcasting are negligible. One may have a 
               <br />
               slight deﬁcit or small <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surplus.</span> In order to retain 
               <br />
               our road system we will have to spend $1 million

               on highroads, and on local roads roughly 
               <br />
               $250,000. Tourists: the luscious plum was left to 
               <br />
               the last, because there seems to be some doubt

               about that one. We will call that X — the un-

               known quantity. As far as I am concerned that 
               <br />
               whole thing is an unknown quantity anyway. X 
               <br />

               spend? There we are running into considerable

               difficulty. Why should we be prepared to expend 
               <br />
               anything? Well, there are only two reasons as far 
               <br />
               as I am concerned, one is that these services such
