               Mr. Smallwood I am not going to delay the

               tee of the whole, I think it is only fair to say a 
               <br />
               word or two about it. I think it is also only fair to 
               <br />
               say a word or two about the business of the 
               <br />
               Department of Public Health and Welfare. This 
               <br />
               Convention cannot possibly do its work without 
               <br />
               taking very close account of this department. 
               <br />
               They are spending $6 million a year. The Com- 
               <br />
               mittee is of the unanimous opinion that in the 
               <br />
               years to come they will have to go on spending 
               <br />
               $6 nu'llion a year, at least.

               It is pointed out by the Committee that al— 
               <br />
               though certain items of expense in the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Public Health and Welfare may come 
               <br />
               down because the value of the dollar may go up 
               <br />
               —- the same amount of money will buy more — 
               <br />
               on that account the cost of running the depart- 
               <br />
               ment may fall. Although that is true on the one 
               <br />
               hand, on the other hand the new extensions and 
               <br />
               new institutions that the department is putting in 
               <br />
               for the next year or two will drive the cost of 
               <br />
               running these institutions up again. The addition- 
               <br />
               al cost will equal the saving they may make on 
               <br />
               the purchases of supplies and materials in the 
               <br />
               public institutions. So for that reason, the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee is unanimous in the opinion that the future 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland, whatever that 
               <br />
               government may be, had just as well face up to it 
               <br />
               that itis going to require at least $6 million dollars 
               <br />
               a year to run the Department of Public Health and 
               <br />
               Welfare, not counting what used to be called dole 
               <br />
               in this country, but is now known as able-bodied 
               <br />
               relief; we have today practically none — none 
               <br />
               worth speaking of. If we should have it in the next 
               <br />
               few years, then the cost of able~bodied relief must 
               <br />
               be tacked on to that $6 million.

               Now, Mr. Chairman, speaking for myself and 
               <br />
               not for the Committee, I have to say that the 
               <br />
               growth of the public services of this country 
               <br />

               <br />
               services is a thing that needed to be done. I feel 
               <br />
               like giving the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               praise... In health and welfare, especially in 
               <br />
               health, they do deserve praise. I think the people

               As Major Cashin has said, they have gone 
               <br />
               from 500 employees of all kinds 12 years ago to 
               <br />
               1,400 today. They have gone from $2.75 million 
               <br />
               a year to $6 million today. Since 1934 they have 
               <br />
               spent $45 million in that one department. $18 
               <br />
               million of that was spent on public relief — not 
               <br />
               dole, not able-bodied relief, but all forms of 
               <br />
               public relief. The second largest item of expendi~ 
               <br />
               ture since 1934 is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$7.5</span> million in salaries; the 
               <br />
               third largest was pensions, principally for World 
               <br />
               War I —~ $7.5 millions in 13 years. Fourth is the 
               <br />
               same amount and is for maintenance of their own 
               <br />
               hospitals — $6 million, not counting salaries. 
               <br />
               That was for drugs, food and equipment. Then 
               <br />
               they spent $1 million since 1934 to help out 
               <br />
               privately~owned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hospitals.</span> Then they spent 
               <br />
               $500,000 in those 13 years to help out the or- 
               <br />
               phanages. That brings you up to $33 million. The 
               <br />
               remainder comes under various headings. On top 
               <br />
               of that they are going to spend $65 million in the 
               <br />
               next year or two: $250,000 on the General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hospi‘</span> 
               <br />
               tal; $2.5 million to build a practically new mental 
               <br />
               hospital; $200,000 for a new home for nurses; 
               <br />
               $750,000 to build a home for the aged and inﬁrm; 
               <br />
               $500,000 to build seven new cottage hospitals; 
               <br />
               $2.5 million to build a new sanatorium on the 
               <br />
               west coast. When the new west coast sanatorium 
               <br />
               is built, even though they have the old one on 
               <br />
               Topsail Road and the new one is opened, all the 
               <br />
               doctors who are authorities on TB who came 
               <br />
               before us agreed that there will still be a need for 
               <br />
               more. When these new institutions are built, it is 
               <br />
               going to run it up $1.25 million extra expenditure 
               <br />
               over and above the $6 million a year they are 
               <br />
               spending today. Let the Committee say, and I 
               <br />
               agree, that the government is doing right in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intro»</span>

               ducing and expanding these social services and
