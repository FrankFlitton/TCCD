               The sober truth is that never was there a more 
               <br />
               moral piece of legislation, for family allowances 
               <br />
               are a strong bulwark for the strengthening of 
               <br />
               family life. The family, sir, is the foundation of 
               <br />
               society and civilisation, and anything that fosters 
               <br />
               and strengthens the family is not immoral, but 
               <br />
               highly moral, and family allowances are the 
               <br />
               ﬁnest system so far developed by any govem- 
               <br />
               ment anywhere to strengthen and encourage the 
               <br />
               family. New Zealand has family allowances, 
               <br />
               Australia has family allowances, Great Britain 
               <br />
               herself has family allowances, but Major Cashin 
               <br />
               says family allowances are immoral. But, after 
               <br />
               working himself up into a lather of moral indig- 
               <br />
               nation against these immoral family allowances, 
               <br />
               Major Cashin cools down again and reassures us 
               <br />
               that we need not worry any more about these 
               <br />
               family allowances, and why? “Because", says he, 
               <br />
               “they are going to be done away with soon.” 
               <br />
               What is his reason for believing this? He forgot 
               <br />
               to tell us. Why does he think they are going to 
               <br />
               end? He did not think we would need any more 
               <br />
               proof than his bare word.

               Mr. Chairman, if I were to tell you that the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government were soon going to 
               <br />
               close down our entire railway system; that the 
               <br />
               United States government is soon going to do 
               <br />
               away with their army, navy and airforce; that the 
               <br />
               British government is soon going to invite Joe 
               <br />
               Stalin to come from Moscow to London and take 
               <br />
               over the governing of Great Britain; if I were to 
               <br />
               tell you that and ask you not to ask for proof, but 
               <br />
               to take my word for it, what would you say? But 
               <br />
               without any proof Major Cashin says that these 
               <br />
               family allowances are soon going to be done 
               <br />
               away with. Whether he meant minutes, days, 
               <br />
               weeks, months or years or decades, he did not 
               <br />
               say, but just “soon". Now, sir, people can talk till 
               <br />
               they are black in the faces against family a1- 
               <br />
               lowances. They can call them immoral, and say 
               <br />
               they are a la Hitler, they can twist and distort 
               <br />
               them, and when it is all said the simple truth 
               <br />
               remains, that we have 120,000 children in New— 
               <br />
               foundland today, 120,000 children, sir, under the 
               <br />
               age of 16 — over one-third of our whole popula- 
               <br />
               tion. Every one of those children, under con- 
               <br />
               federation, would receive the family allowances 
               <br />
               —— $5, $6, $7, or $8 a month, according to the 
               <br />
               child’s age. The parents may be rich or poor, high 
               <br />
               or low, sick or well, working or unemployed, it 
               <br />

               Well, he had a fling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'at</span> the income tax in 
               <br />
               Canada, and was very careful to point out that 
               <br />
               here in Newfoundland a single person must earn 
               <br />
               at least $1,000 a year before any income tax has 
               <br />
               to be paid by him, whereas in Canada it is $750 
               <br />
               a year. Now before dealing in any detail with this 
               <br />
               question of income taxes there is one general 
               <br />
               observation I want to make. Before the late war, 
               <br />
               the income tax in Canada was not very different 
               <br />
               from ours here in Newfoundland, but during the 
               <br />
               war Canada put up a very mighty war effort. Her 
               <br />
               taxes rose higher and higher and higher. That was 
               <br />
               during the war. But since the war ended Canada 
               <br />
               has reduced her taxes, not once, or twice, but 
               <br />
               three times, and it is believed throughout Canada 
               <br />
               that Finance Minister Abbott is bringing in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fur»</span> 
               <br />
               ther reductions in taxation when he brings down 
               <br />
               his new budget next month or the month after. 
               <br />
               Members of the Ottawa delegation will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rememx</span>

               her my joking attempt, at one of our plenary 
               <br />
               sessions, to draw Mr. Abbott out as to what 
               <br />
               reductions in taxation he is likely to bring down 
               <br />
               in his new budget this winter. He, being very well 
               <br />
               aware of the fact that a ﬁnance minister mustkeep 
               <br />
               that deadly secret till the last minute, refused to 
               <br />
               be drawn, but it is believed that there will be 
               <br />
               reductions again in the next budget a month or so 
               <br />
               from now.
