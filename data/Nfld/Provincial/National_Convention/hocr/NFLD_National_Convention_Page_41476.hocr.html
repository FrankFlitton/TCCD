               Mr. Smallwood reached the height of his class 
               <br />
               versus class propaganda when he took upon him— 
               <br />
               self to tell you of monopolies and monies made 
               <br />
               here. I am afraid, from what Mr. Smallwood has 
               <br />
               said, that he does not know very much about 
               <br />
               business and I refer to me general channels 
               <br />
               through which trade is done. Business is done 
               <br />
               exactly the same as it is done in Canada, the 
               <br />
               United States, Great Britain or any other country. 
               <br />
               With regard to his reference to agencies that have 
               <br />
               sole monopolies, he is away over his head when 
               <br />
               he goes into the fundamentals of business and 
               <br />
               distribution. Canadian ﬁrms do not distribute or 
               <br />
               sell their goods to every Tom, Dick and Harry in 
               <br />
               this country or any other country. They themsel- 
               <br />
               ves are the ones that use the principle of one agent 
               <br />
               or distributor, so that their goods may be better 
               <br />
               handled with more concentration of sales through 
               <br />
               one individual, and so that they may, through 
               <br />
               their distributorship methods, keep down the ul- 
               <br />
               timate cost of their product to the countries to 
               <br />
               which they sell. You will ﬁnd that where there 
               <br />
               are agents or distributors or representatives of 
               <br />
               any Canadian orAmerican firm, it is by the policy 
               <br />
               of these firms that there are sole agents, and that 
               <br />
               it is to further Canadian export business and at 
               <br />
               the same time keep down the cost of their 
               <br />
               products that they adhere to these methods that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has taken so much trouble to call 
               <br />
               “monopolies”. He has referred to the large 
               <br />
               volume of mOney made here in the last several 
               <br />
               years, but he omitted to say that a tremendous 
               <br />
               volume of the sales were made to American and 
               <br />
               Canadian ﬁrms who were contracting and build- 
               <br />
               ing bases, and that the sales to them took not one 
               <br />
               cent out of the pockets of the people. In fact, it 
               <br />
               was the construction of these bases that ﬁrst gave 
               <br />
               the people an opportunity to earn this money, and 
               <br />
               they were fed by these firms through the goods 
               <br />
               that were purchased in this country. He refers you 
               <br />
               to 105 ﬁrms that made a proﬁt of $15 million or 
               <br />
               an average of about $150,000 each. He did not 
               <br />
               tell you, however, that this included Bowaters 
               <br />
               and the AND Co., and the Buchans Mining Co., 
               <br />
               which would account for the larger part of this 
               <br />
               proﬁt and would probably bring the average of 
               <br />
               the lOO-odd Newfoundland ﬁrms down to around 
               <br />
               $80,000. He did not tell you that only 29 ﬁrms in

               the 105 ﬁrms in Newfoundland, including the

               propaganda to set class against class, and divide

               Mr. Banﬁeld, in seconding the motion, said 
               <br />
               that with confederation, the bulk of the taxes 
               <br />
               would fall on broader shoulders and not on the 
               <br />
               poor as today. Let me correct that right now. The 
               <br />
               sales taxes and excise duties in Canada will fall 
               <br />
               on those here in proportion to their purchases, but 
               <br />
               when you come to one of the real federal taxes, 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that in Canada the income tax 
               <br />
               collected by the Canadian government is what 
               <br />
               will really hit our people here. In 1945 people 
               <br />
               earning less than $1,000 -~ which is not taxable 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland -— paid to the Canadian 
               <br />
               government $19 million in income tax; the 
               <br />
               people earning between $1,000 and $2,000 a year 
               <br />
               paid $146 million, and those earning between 
               <br />
               $2,000 and $3,000 paid $137 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million,</span> For these 
               <br />
               last three income group brackets, that is $3,000 
               <br />
               and below, they paid a total of $300 million out 
               <br />
               of a total collected by the federal government of 
               <br />
               $680 million. In other words, the income tax paid 
               <br />
               by the lower—income group paid practically half 
               <br />
               of the $680 million collected, and then Mr. Ban- 
               <br />
               ﬁeld tries to tell you that it will fall on broader 
               <br />
               shoulders than it does today. The federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem«</span> 
               <br />
               ment on today’ s basis estimates taking about $3.2 
               <br />
               million in personal income tax out of this country, 
               <br />
               but I feel sure that this will be closer to $5 million 
               <br />
               because there are so many today not paying in- 
               <br />
               come tax in this country, who will have to do so 
               <br />
               if we become part of Canada. While I am on this 
               <br />
               question of taxes, I might say I have heard a lot 
               <br />
               of talk here about the Vicious system of indirect 
               <br />
               taxation in this country, and that our union with 
               <br />
               Canada would get us clear of this system. Perhaps 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood does not know that the revenue 
               <br />
               of the Canadian government for the ﬁscal year 
               <br />
               ending 1947 was largely derived from indirect 
               <br />
