               Question: What is the per capita tax of the 
               <br />
               federal government of Canada? 
               <br />
               Answer: A very substantial portion of the 
               <br />
               Canadian govemment’s revenues is derived 
               <br />
               from a graduated tax on personal incomes. 
               <br />
               Those below the exempt level pay no income 
               <br />
               tax and the weight of the tax rises propor— 
               <br />
               tionately to income. Succession duties are 
               <br />
               likewise related to the size of estates. 
               <br />
               Another substantial source of revenue is the 
               <br />
               corporation tax which ultimately affects the 
               <br />
               incomes of individual shareholders, most of 
               <br />
               whom are in the upper income brackets. Sub- 
               <br />
               stantially less than half of federal revenues 
               <br />
               will this year be derived from what might be 
               <br />
               termed consumption taxes, such as customs, 
               <br />
               excise, sales tax, tobacco and liquor taxes, 
               <br />
               etc., and, even in respect of those, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in“</span> 
               <br />
               cidence of the taxes varies greatly as between 
               <br />
               individuals because of differences in income 
               <br />
               and other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span> Moreover, ﬁgures 
               <br />
               of tax revenues in Canada include collections 
               <br />
               in respect of previous years and do not there— 
               <br />
               fore reﬂect the current burden of the rates. 
               <br />
               Any attempt to calculate the per capita tax 
               <br />
               in Canada by dividing the total tax revenue 
               <br />
               in any year by the population is therefore 
               <br />
               most misleading, particularly if the ﬁgure so 
               <br />
               derived is compared with a similar ﬁgure for 
               <br />
               any other country; indeed, such a comparison 
               <br />
               might produce manifestly absurd results. 
               <br />
               Apart altogether from the reasons . given 
               <br />
               above it should be bome in mind that even 
               <br />
               though tax rates in country A are lower than 
               <br />
               in country B, if country A had a higher <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">na«</span> 
               <br />
               tional income per capita it might well have a 
               <br />
               higher average tax per head of population 
               <br />
               than country B. The only relevant ﬁgures 
               <br />
               would be those showing taxes paid by in- 
               <br />
               dividuals in different countries with the same 
               <br />
               income in respect of the same year, but this, 
               <br />
               of course, is a most difﬁcult statistical com- 
               <br />
               putation.
