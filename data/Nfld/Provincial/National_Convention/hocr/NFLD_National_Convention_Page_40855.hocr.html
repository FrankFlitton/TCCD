               Mr. Smallwood Certainly. I am not trying to 
               <br />
               dodge it. We all know the Government of Quebec 
               <br />
               would like to have Labrador, So what? They were 
               <br />
               never satisfied to lose it, but did by the law case 
               <br />
               that was fought out in 1927 between New- 
               <br />
               foundland and whom? Between Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Quebec? No! Between the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               Not the Government of Quebec. Where should 
               <br />
               the boundary lie between Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Canada down in Labrador? That was the question 
               <br />
               submitted to the Privy Council.... Quebec was 
               <br />
               trying hard. They had a lawyer sitting in the court 
               <br />
               with what they call a watching brief. Now, will 
               <br />
               any member of the delegation who was present 
               <br />
               in Ottawa substantiate what I am saying when 
               <br />
               I say this: that Mr. St. Laurent told us as 
               <br />
               categorically, as plainly, as certainly and as ﬁnal- 
               <br />
               ly as words could make it, that the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada accepted the award of the Privy Coun— 
               <br />
               cil, and what in the name of goodness else could 
               <br />
               they do? Is the Government of Canada not going 
               <br />
               to accept the award, the decision, the judgement, 
               <br />
               the verdict of the Privy Council? Of course they 
               <br />
               accept it, and they can do no other. Now I come 
               <br />
               to your question. We know Quebec wants 
               <br />
               Labrador. They were disgusted because they lost 
               <br />
               it.... But, you say, Quebec controls the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada. Let us deal with that. First of all, 
               <br />
               I bring you back to section 3 of the BNA Act. Mr. 
               <br />
               Penney knows the difference between govern- 
               <br />
               ment and Parliament: “The Parliament may, with 
               <br />
               the consent of any province, increase, 
               <br />
               diminish...” With the consent! The Parliament, 
               <br />
               not the government. The Parliament includes the 
               <br />
               Liberal party (who happen to have a majority in 
               <br />
               the government); the Conservative party, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">So</span> 
               <br />
               cial Credit party and the CCF. Four political 
               <br />
               parties make up the Parliament. The Parliament, 
               <br />
               not the government could change the boundary, 
               <br />
               and Parliament could do it only with the consent 
               <br />
               of the Province of Newfoundland. That means 
               <br />
               that Mr. Duplessis, if he should live long enough 
               <br />
               and still be premier, when he is an old man, he 
               <br />
               may still be roaring and bawling that he wants 
               <br />
