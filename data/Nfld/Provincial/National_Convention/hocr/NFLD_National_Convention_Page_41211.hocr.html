               <br />
               is to vote against submitting them to the people 
               <br />
               on the grounds that if they can’t understand them, 
               <br />
               how could the people understand them? Well, 
               <br />
               you can lead a horse to the well but you can’t

               <br />
               not see. There is nothing complicated or hard to 
               <br />
               understand about these terms, as I shall show 
               <br />
               before I sit down. They are plain, simple, 
               <br />
               straightforward, and they can be understood by 
               <br />
               any average Newfoundlander. But first we must 
               <br />
               strip away the tangled brush of wrong statements 
               <br />
               and twisted thinking that has been thrown all 
               <br />
               around us. When we have done so, these terms 
               <br />
               will stand out bright, understandable and attrac-

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now sir, I wish ﬁrst to address myself to some 
               <br />
               of the points made by Major Cashin in his speech. 
               <br />
               It was very noticeable that during the three weeks 
               <br />
               we were debating these confederation terms, 
               <br />
               Major Cashin remained silent except for one or 
               <br />
               two remarks he interpolated as we went along; 
               <br />
               but now it seems that he was saving up his breath, 
               <br />
               saving it up for one big effort to destroy con— 
               <br />
               federation with one big blow. So like the big, bad 
               <br />
               wolf, sir, in the fairy tale, he huffed and he puffed 
               <br />
               in a long straining effort to blow the house down. 
               <br />
               For three days he blew and what did he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac‘</span> 
               <br />
               complish? He only made confederation stronger 
               <br />
               than ever. Indeed, his effort was so feeble that I’m 
               <br />
               forced to conclude either that he has a soft spot 
               <br />
               in his heart for confederation and didn’t want to 
               <br />
               hurt it, or else that he really wanted to hurt it but 
               <br />
               didn’t know how because he didn’t know enough 
               <br />
               about it and hadn’t studied it enough. Certainly, 
               <br />
               if his speech was the great, expected, big gun that 
               <br />
               was going to thunder against confederation, the 
               <br />
               big gun turned out to be only a pea-shooter and a 
               <br />
               not very good pea-shooter at that. As might have 
               <br />
               been expected, Major Cashin got off his usual 
               <br />
               stuff about plots and conspiracies. This Conven~ 
               <br />
               tion he tells us again is just a plot, just a con— 
               <br />
               spiracy, deliberately planned to confuse the 
               <br />
               people; planned to kill responsible government; 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               planned to force Commission government upon 
               <br />
               us. Well, I won’t waste time commenting on that. 
               <br />
               Major Cashin evidently believes it, certainly he 
               <br />
               has said it often enough. I don‘t believe there’s 
               <br />
               one single word of truth in it. Now he tells us that 
               <br />
               my introduction of the confederation question, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               thing? Isn’t he forgetting that he himself divided 
               <br />
               the Convention weeks and weeks before I ever 
               <br />
               even mentioned confederation? Surely, surely he 
               <br />
               has not forgotten that inside of a week after the 
               <br />
               Convention opened, he launched an attack upon 
               <br />
               the Convention, upon the Commission govem- 
               <br />
               ment and upon the British government itself. He 
               <br />
               told us that this Convention was dripping with 
               <br />
               treachery, that it was a glorified stall, something 
               <br />
               to fool us into Commission government. He told 
               <br />
               us that we should have responsible government, 
               <br />
               and that responsible government was the only 
               <br />
               thing we should discuss; all that in the very ﬁrst 
               <br />
               week of the Convention’s life, and now he turns 
               <br />
               around and says thatI am the one who divided 
               <br />
               the Convention by introducting my confedera— 
               <br />
               tion motion ﬁve or six weeks after he had made 
               <br />
               his famous speech, the very speech which threw 
               <br />
               down the gauntlet for responsible government. 
               <br />
               Then Major Cashin tells us that for 14 years 
               <br />
               the British government has been controlling 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s treasury, that is Newfound— 
               <br />
               land’s public chest. For 14 years the British 
               <br />
               government has been controlling Newfound— 
               <br />
               land’s treasury and confederation means that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government would control it. Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, if the Canadian government controls 
               <br />
               our treasury as decently, as efﬁciently and as 
               <br />
               honestly as the British government has done it 
               <br />
               these past 14 years, it will be a grand thing for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to be a province of Canada, for 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada has fashioned its fis- 
               <br />
               cal system fairly and squarely after the British 
               <br />
               system, than which there is none better in the 
               <br />
               world, none cleaner, none more decent, none 
               <br />
               more efficient and none more honest. It will not 
               <br />
               go down well with our Newfoundland people as 
               <br />
               an argument against confederation to say that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government will control our treasury if 
               <br />
               we become a province as the British government 
               <br />
               has controlled it in the last 14 years. Maj or Cashin 
               <br />
               tells us that it’s the historical policy of the im— 
               <br />
               perial government of Great Britain for the past 80 
               <br />
               years, for Newfoundland to go into confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada. He tells us that the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment and the Commission government are both 
               <br />
               in favour of confederation, that they’re both 
               <br />
               promoting and backing confederation. Mr. Har— 
               <br />
               rington, incidentally, sir, told us the same thing.
