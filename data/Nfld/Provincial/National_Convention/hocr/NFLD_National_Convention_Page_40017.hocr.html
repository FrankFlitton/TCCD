               Having given notice the question will be passed

               <br />

               <br />
               the question in turn will be passed to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depart</span>

               <br />
               can get information in any other way. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood You have not made it clear as 
               <br />
               to whether questions asked by an individual 
               <br />

               <br />
               be adopted by the House. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I thought I made it clear that by 
               <br />
               passing them to the Secretary they will then be 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Hollett It appears to me that if we are going 
               <br />
               about this inquiry into the state of affairs of our 
               <br />
               country, and if we are to be delayed by each 
               <br />
               member‘s asking any question as might occur to 
               <br />
               him overnight, we are not tackling the matter in 
               <br />
               the best systematic manner. We have a factual 
               <br />
               statement of affairs in the Amulree Report1 up to 
               <br />
               1934. Our business is to ﬁnd out how things stand 
               <br />
               now; what has happened between 1934 and the 
               <br />
               present time, and whether or not we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnancial‘</span> 
               <br />
               ly and economically sound or self-supporting. If 
               <br />
               we are to tackle it in the proper manner, we ought 
               <br />
               to take it subjectively: take ﬁnance, deal with it 
               <br />
               and be done with it; take fisheries, deal with each 
               <br />
               matter under its own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heading.</span> I referred to the 
               <br />
               Amulree Report. I think that report is pretty near 
               <br />
               correct. We ought to deal with one department of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland affairs at one time and be done 
               <br />
               with it. What makes me speak of this is thatl saw 
               <br />
               a communication in the press where one of the 
               <br />
               delegates had received a letter from the 
               <br />
               Governor’s private secretary relative to the 
               <br />
               departure of the Commissioner of Finance.2 It 
               <br />
               was thought that the commissioner ought not to 
               <br />
               be leaving at this particular juncture. We had the 
               <br />
               assurance given us that the Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Finance would be here for two weeks. Therefore, 
               <br />

               Mr. Hillier The object is to inquire into the fu-

               ture forms of government. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill After listening to the two previous 
               <br />
               speakers, I am of the opinion that there has not 
               <br />
               been enough provision made, and it would now 
               <br />
               appear that the best thing would be to appoint a 
               <br />
               special committee to draft a plan of action... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I had in mind. subject to the 
               <br />
               wishes of the Convention, a steering committee, 
               <br />
               that would have the setting out of the rotation of 
               <br />
               business and plan of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">campaign.</span> If my suggestion 
               <br />
               is agreeable, the committee will meet with all 
               <br />
               possible dispatch 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley It is not, I take it, intended to limit 
               <br />
               the right to ask a question. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman In the old days we had the order 
               <br />
               paper, and the order paper was the daily agenda. 
               <br />
               We will have to have the same method to enable 
               <br />
               us to know what is going to be discussed and by 
               <br />
               whom. 
               <br />
               Mr. BrownAs perhaps the oldest member of this 
               <br />
               House, I might say that I do not see how we can 
               <br />
               progress without some line of procedure. I move 
               <br />
               that this house will adjourn until such time as the 
               <br />
               Committee on Rules and Procedure has drafted a 
               <br />
               plan and it is adopted, so that the House can be 
               <br />
               guided by that line of procedure in the right way. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I am inclined to agree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett. One of the commissioners is leaving 
               <br />
               Newfoundland; he holds a most important posi- 
               <br />
               tion in the government in regard to finance. 
               <br />
               WhilstI agree with Mr. Brown that without cer— 
               <br />
               tain rules we cannot proceed, I feel we should 
               <br />
               take advantage of the commissioner’s presence 
               <br />
               and direct financial questions to him. I would 
               <br />
               suggest that these questions be put on the order 
               <br />
               paper and that Mr. Wild come here and be further 
               <br />
               able to answer questions that are not quite clear. 
               <br />
               You will remember, Mr. Chairman, what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hap</span> 
               <br />
               pened in the old days. A member placed ques- 
               <br />
               tions on the paper directed to the finance 
               <br />
               department and the next day the department 
               <br />
               tabled the information; and if the inquisitor 
               <br />
               wanted any further information, the minister was 
               <br />
               there and he got up and said “I want to know 
               <br />
               something else." The only way to get information 
               <br />
               is to have the Commissioner of Finance here and 
               <br />
               whoever wants to ask a question, the Commis— 
               <br />
               sioner is here to answer it.
