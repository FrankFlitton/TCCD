               Mr. Smallwood I was speaking now of the 
               <br />
               debate in the last few days, and for the next few 
               <br />
               days. I was just anxious that any member decid- 
               <br />
               ing to speak should get the chance to speak 
               <br />
               without receiving a nod from anyone except from 
               <br />
               you as Chairman. I move the house into committee. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Before the House goes into com- 
               <br />
               mittee of the whole, in connection with this nod- 
               <br />
               ding business, as Mr. Higgins said, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has been nodding his head ever since 
               <br />
               this confederation issue was brought in here. It’s 
               <br />
               been most atrocious what has been happening. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood introduced this matter into the 
               <br />
               House, and after every delegate has spoken, in— 
               <br />
               stead of waiting until everyone who had anything 
               <br />
               to say has ﬁnished, and then replying right away, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has been up contradicting him, 
               <br />
               and consequently this debate has gone on too 
               <br />
               long. It could have been over before now but for 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, I think that’s quite patent to all. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It is quite patent. As a matter of 
               <br />
               fact on that point standing order 572 puts the 
               <br />
               position thus: “The main difference between 
               <br />
               proceedings of the Committee and that of the 
               <br />
               House is that in the former the member is able to 
               <br />
               speak more than once in order that the details of 
               <br />
               the question or bill may be given the most minute 
               <br />
               examination, or as is commonly expressed, to 
               <br />
               have more freedom of speech, and that argument 
               <br />
               may be used pro <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> contra, so that this un- 
               <br />
               restricted right of debate is not taken advantage 
               <br />
               of to any great extent.”

               Mr. Cashin In other words it should not take a

               particular instance all I can say, Mr.

               <br />
               someone nods to me, and then I speak. Nobody 
               <br />
               in this house or out of it nods to me. The only 
               <br />
               person who nods to me is my wife as far as I 
               <br />

               <br />
               made a comment and quoted two authorities. The 
               <br />
               reply I got was, “All the economists in the world 
               <br />
               will look upon that as a childish idea.” I pointed 
               <br />
               out on another occasion that a thing was man- 
               <br />
               datory, and what comment did I get? “Trash and 
               <br />
               nonsense.” The only thing I can see is that I must 
               <br />
               have been nodding at that time, or there would 
               <br />
               have been hell to pay!
