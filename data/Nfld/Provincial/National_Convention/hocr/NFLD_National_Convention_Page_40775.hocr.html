               around this city and said they were coming up 
               <br />
               here for that purpose. In reply to Mr. MacDonald, 
               <br />
               that is how that $35 million was made up. Now 
               <br />
               that statement in the Telegram, in that they said 
               <br />
               there were $7,800,000 to the credit of our inter- 
               <br />
               est—free loans over on the other side. If they would 
               <br />
               turn to the report brought back by the London 
               <br />
               delegation in April or May (it did not take us three 
               <br />
               months either) you will ﬁnd that report says 
               <br />
               $9,300,000 to our credit. What happened since? 
               <br />
               Ihave not got charge of the treasury. I realise, and 
               <br />
               I will prove it, that the treasury has been 
               <br />
               plundered during the past two, three or four years. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is a dangerous statement. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I am going to prove it. I say it has 
               <br />
               been plundered and I make that statement before 
               <br />
               the House, before the country and before my 
               <br />
               God. The other day in connection with the sink- 
               <br />
               ing fund, I was asked about this $750,000. I am 
               <br />
               sorry I have not a blackboard here to work it out. 
               <br />
               If anyone doubts my veracity, I ask him to take it 
               <br />
               down. I am going to recite it. In 1937 New- 
               <br />
               foundland paid £177,950 in sinking funds; at the 
               <br />
               end of 1937 we were due 3% by buying in our 
               <br />
               original <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stock.</span> Consequently it was £183,288 that 
               <br />
               year; in 1938 we sent over £177,950 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">m</span> add that

               What do we ﬁnd? We ﬁnd the total sinking 
               <br />
               fund should amount to $10,189,391. We go to 
               <br />
               Ottawa to ﬁnd out what it is — we ﬁnd it is 
               <br />
               $8,342,000. A discrepancy as the editor calls it 
               <br />
               of $1,750,000 lost to the treasury of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. I will say the treasury was plundered 
               <br />
               of that amount. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman You ought to amplify it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin That is the only ampliﬁcation I can

               make. Now the interest-free loans. We gave
