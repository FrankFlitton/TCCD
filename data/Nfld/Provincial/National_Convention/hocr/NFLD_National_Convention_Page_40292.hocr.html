               against unity of thought and ideas. Indeed, our 
               <br />
               very origin is rooted in disunity. With us, the 
               <br />
               melting-pot of nationalism has worked very 
               <br />
               slowly. Hundreds of years ago our country was 
               <br />
               peopled with English, Irish and Scotch, and even 
               <br />
               today their assimilation into a national unity is 
               <br />
               not complete. We proclaim public holidays in 
               <br />
               honour of England, Ireland and Scotland, but 
               <br />
               where is our Newfoundland day? Why, even our 
               <br />
               very national ode was composed by one who was 
               <br />
               not a Newfoundlander. We boast of our English, 
               <br />
               Irish and Scotch descent, but who boasts that he 
               <br />
               is a Newfoundlander? Is not all this wrong? 
               <br />
               Should not the state of things be rectified? Is it 
               <br />
               not time that we awoke to the fact that we are first 
               <br />
               of all Newfoundlanders and not the citizens of 
               <br />
               any country thousands of miles across the seas? 
               <br />
               Let us acknowledge our national obligations, 
               <br />
               take pride in the fact that we are New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, and acknowledge the duty we owe 
               <br />
               this land. And the first duty — the first obligation 
               <br />
               -— is the duty of unity; the duty of joining our 
               <br />
               strength and our numbers in the common inter~

               I know there are members of this Convention 
               <br />
               who entertain ideas of merging our individuality 
               <br />
               with other countries, of absorbing our nationhood 
               <br />
               with other peoples. Such things, in view of the 
               <br />
               great vital issue which now faces us, I regard as 
               <br />
               being of secondary importance —— things that 
               <br />
               properly belong not to the present, but to the 
               <br />
               future —- things for the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to consider as a self—governing dominion I regard 
               <br />
               them as issues which should not be allowed to 
               <br />
               destroy the unity, or enervate the thoughts of the 
               <br />
               people at this juncture But let me add, that I deny 
               <br />
               to no man his right to advocate any form of 
               <br />
               government he may choose, and if a general 
               <br />
               election were called in this country, there is a free 
               <br />
               scope for the confederate, the unionist, the 
               <br />
               labourer, the socialist, and all those who wish to 
               <br />
               present their belief for the endorsement of the 
               <br />
               people. All such things come within the sphere of 
               <br />
               a free democracy. But I emphasise, that the issue 
               <br />
               today is not a party issue, it is a national issue, an 
               <br />
               issue of emergency, of saving the country, of 
               <br />
               saving the treasury, of saving the resources of the 
               <br />
               people while there is yet time. It is a situation 
               <br />
               where we must put Newfoundland first, before all 
               <br />
               else, before the aims of this Convention, before 
               <br />

               Now we come to this matter of confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada. Propaganda, inspired right here in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, has been appearing in certain 
               <br />
               sections of the Canadian press, specially 
               <br />
               designed to injure Newfoundland by mis- 
               <br />
               representation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts.</span> There is a lot of talk about 
               <br />
               this affair of submerging our century-old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nation»</span> 
               <br />
               hood with another country, and I expect we shall 
               <br />
               hear more, much more of it in the future. For the 
               <br />
               present I merely say this: if Canada is prepared 
               <br />
               to accept us in confederation, then be assured it 
               <br />
               is only because she wants something we have, 
               <br />
               and that she wants it very much. If she wants us, 
               <br />
               she wants us for her benefit, not for ours. And if 
               <br />
               she offers us one dollar, you can be certain that 
               <br />
               she counts on getting two or three of ours in 
               <br />
               return. Remember this, to any such deal Great 
               <br />
               Britain must be a party, and so it would all boil 
               <br />
               down to a clever game between Canada and Great 
               <br />
               Britain in which they would take the winnings 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland would be the pawn. As com- 
               <br />
               monsense people, I ask you to remember this 
               <br />
               when you are being deluged with the gilded story 
               <br />
               of the lovely things Canada is going to do for us, 
               <br />
               of how grand we will live with two chickens in 
               <br />
               every pot and every man a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">millionaire.</span> Let us 
               <br />
               remember that this is simply a repetition of the 
               <br />
               siren song that has lured many an unlucky 
               <br />
               country to its doom. It is the sugar on the pill, the 
               <br />
               bait in the trap. Such was the method used in 
               <br />
               luring us into Commission government and the
