               duction of the proposal brings back to my mind

               the old story — confederation, a bugaboo which 
               <br />
               lies dormant in this country until rumour has it 
               <br />
               that an election is in the ofﬁng. Since our last 
               <br />
               general election in 1932 up to 1946 the word was 
               <br />

               the greater part of this country. I have no

               <br />
               Newfoundland, the district which sent me here, 
               <br />
               where I may say confederation is anything but a 
               <br />
               live issue. However, I can speak from an ex-

               <br />
               During that time I passed through my hands 
               <br />
               thousands of men coming to work from all over

               men say anything in favour of confederation. But

               after our men had lived with the Canadians and 
               <br />
               had exchanged opinions, I found that whatever

               country should be restored to its former position, 
               <br />

               <br />
               here in this House. I have already done so in 
               <br />
               public, but because of this resolution I am forced 
               <br />
               to partly state what I was sent here for. I am the 
               <br />
               only delegate who was sent here on a definite 
               <br />
               policy for Newfoundland. I am not going to talk 
               <br />
               possible forms of government now. I merely wish 
               <br />
               to say that I speak for the common people... I 
               <br />
               speak for a woman who came to my home shortly 
               <br />
               before I came on this Convention, and asked me 
               <br />
               to go into her house and view the circumstances 
               <br />
               under which she had to live — a shack of about 
               <br />
               18 feet by 24 feet, and there were in that shack 16 
               <br />
               human beings, half of them with TB, living like 
               <br />
               cattle. I speak for a man who worked 45 years for 
               <br />
               a company, and is thrown onto the scrap heap and 
               <br />
               has to take a net pension of $8 a month. I speak 
               <br />
               for the countless numbers of young children in 
               <br />
               my own district who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">batted</span> in from .October

               until the sun shines again next spring, because 
               <br />
               they have not sufficient clothing to wear. These 
               <br />
               are the people I speak for, and I have a definite 
               <br />
               idea of what form of government Newfoundland 
               <br />
               needs; but I feel Newfoundland must ﬁrst get 
               <br />
               back her responsible government before we can 
               <br />
               go further.
