               future date. I am against confederation as I see it

               today. I came here with an open mind, with no

               Mr. Butt I am not wholly in accordance with the 
               <br />
               amendment of Mr. Penney. It is too deﬁnite; two 
               <br />
               months’ time would be better. Maybe it could be 
               <br />
               a little more elastic. My reason for speaking at 
               <br />
               this time is to introduce something which ought 
               <br />
               to be said at this time, and Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               address gives me the opportunity — that is to ask 
               <br />
               ourselves, before we go any further, does the 
               <br />
               Convention know exactly where it is going, as 3 
               <br />
               Convention? Have we given ourselves speciﬁc 
               <br />
               directions as to what we ourselves want to do? 
               <br />
               For example, we were presented with the Chad- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wickvlones</span> report and we more or less threw it 
               <br />
               out. We gave it scant attention although it was 
               <br />
               formally received We were presented with a 
               <br />
               reconstruction report which we did not consider 
               <br />
               worthy of discussion, in spite of the fact that 
               <br />
               future policy is involved; and the implication 
               <br />
               covering the introduction of that report is that a 
               <br />
               programme of $60 million be introduced, the 
               <br />
               funds for which would have to be found locally. 
               <br />
               We have not received that although it was laid on 
               <br />
               the table. Later on we were told that the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion must not concern itself with government 
               <br />
               policy in spite of the fact we have, as part of the 
               <br />
               terms of reference, to recommend future forms of 
               <br />
               government. How any man can divorce the two 
               <br />
               in his mind, I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> We do not know what 
               <br />
               the national production is, the data is not avail-

               able, how are we then to know if we are self 
               <br />
               supporting? Then we had the Fisheries Report. 
               <br />
               We got so far and had to leave it, as someone said, 
               <br />
               “in mid air", because we did not know what to do 
               <br />
               with it. We got into the bases deal and we did not 
               <br />
               know how to clarify our own position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> we did 
               <br />
               not know what to do under the circumstances. 
               <br />
               Then we are presented today with the Education 
               <br />
               Report, for the ﬁrst time. If I read aright the 
               <br />
               attitude of the Education Committee in this

               Mr. Chairman Are you discussing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Educa»</span> 
               <br />
               tion Report? If so, your remarks are not relevant. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I am trying to show you that the 
               <br />
               committee’s interpretation of our terms of refer- 
               <br />
               ence were narrower that I think they should be, 
               <br />
               consequently we ought to clarify just what we can 
               <br />
               or cannot do. I am not discussing the Education 
               <br />
               Report, I am giving an indication of the way we 
               <br />
               have or have not interpreted our terms of refer- 
               <br />
               ence. Lastly, when we are right in the midst of the 
               <br />
               gathering of facts and before we have made up 
               <br />
               our minds as to where we are going, we have a 
               <br />
               motion placed before us with a resolution of 
               <br />
               approaching another government with the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of union. Before we go any farther we ought 
               <br />
               to clarify our minds as to where we are going as 
               <br />
               a Convention. The chairman of the Forestry 
               <br />
               Committee tells us we did not get all the the facts; 
               <br />
               IfI have said anything that has not happened in 
               <br />
               this Convention so far, I would like to be brought 
               <br />
               up about it, but the point I am making is this: 
               <br />
               before we can discuss or even think about the 
               <br />
               question of confederation, or asking for the 
               <br />
               terms, we have to decide in our own minds what 
               <br />
               our terms of reference mean and where we are 
               <br />
               going. It is important, to me at least, that we do 
               <br />
               not interpret our terms of reference in too narrow 
               <br />
               a manner. I will support Mr. Penney’s motion 
               <br />
               that the matter of confederation be deferred until 
               <br />
               we see ﬁt to deal with it. I might add also that I 
               <br />
               too am looking for the welfare of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and I would not rule out the possibility at some 
               <br />
               time or other, of going to Canada, but before I do 
               <br />
               that I want to know the facts of Newfoundland; I 
               <br />
               want to go to Canada with a sense of dignity; with 
               <br />
               the feeling that I am a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundlander.</span> I do not 
               <br />
               want to go when we do not know whether or not 
               <br />
               we are self-supporting. We must ﬁrst of all decide 
               <br />
               where we are going in this matter.
