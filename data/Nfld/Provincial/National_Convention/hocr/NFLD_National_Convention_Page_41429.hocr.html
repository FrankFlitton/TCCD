               <br />
               matter from every angle, and then ﬁnally make a 
               <br />
               decision. When that decision is reached I shall

               <br />
               wrongly, to be in the interest and general welfare 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland.

               It seems to me, sir, with my little knowledge 
               <br />
               of public affairs in Newfoundland —— I own I have 
               <br />
               not the experience which some of my good 
               <br />
               friends have in business and politics; I admit my 
               <br />
               shortcomings in that respect. I have never before 
               <br />
               come out in public or spoken in public, and this 
               <br />
               has been my ﬁrst time speaking in this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, and it is an honour which I shall never forget, 
               <br />
               and it is something which I shall take with me to 
               <br />
               the end of my days. But I feel, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, that 
               <br />
               — and I believe there are others who feel the 
               <br />
               same — whether now or in two or ﬁve years time 
               <br />
               I do not know, the people have to say, but I feel, 
               <br />
               sir, that Newfoundland will at some time or other 
               <br />
               be obliged to unite with some larger power for 
               <br />
               her general welfare and progress, and as I think 
               <br />
               of that I ask myself this question —— I do not make 
               <br />
               a definite statement, but I ask myself this question 
               <br />
               —- would it not be as well to do that now? I say 
               <br />
               we probably might do worse than unite with the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The question, I realise to the full, rests with the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland. I must be one of the 
               <br />
               many, as I remarked just now, not one of prelimi- 
               <br />
               nary experience, not one who has been connected 
               <br />
               with public life in this country as some here, or 
               <br />
               greatly associated with the business life of this 
               <br />
               country as many gentlemen on the other side. The 
               <br />
               question rests with the people, sir.

               <br />
               have this to say, that I shall take back with me 
               <br />
               happy memories of association with fellow 
               <br />
               delegates from all over Newfoundland. It has 
               <br />
               been a great privilege and a great pleasure to meet 
               <br />
               these men, because I have from them gathered

               much valuable information. I have gathered

               something of what life is like in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as a whole. I have been able to draw comparisons, 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd there is a great similarity all around 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. To all my listeners, sir, I say a

               Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, I want to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks. They will only take a few, perhaps ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six minutes. I feel thatI am one of the juniors 
               <br />
               here, that have not to speak too long, while the 
               <br />
               bigwig on my right, and the two bigwigs on my 
               <br />
               left will have a good deal to say, I expect. But I 
               <br />
               want to deal with this motion before the Chair. I 
               <br />
               am not at all opposed to giving our people the 
               <br />
               opportunity of expressing their views in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the well-considered plan for confedera- 
               <br />
               tion with the great Dominion of Canada, and I 
               <br />
               want to make it absolutely and completely clear 
               <br />
               that I am not against confederation in principle, 
               <br />
               and on terms which would ensure justice to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. But I am deﬁnitely and positively 
               <br />
               opposed to the motion before the Chair for the 
               <br />
               following reasons. Now one of these reasons has 
               <br />
               already been dealt with quite nicely and exten- 
               <br />
               sively by the member for Carbonear, Mr. Penney, 
               <br />
               and I am not therefore going to go over that 
               <br />
               ground again, except that I feel that if we should 
               <br />
               enter into confederation before endeavouring to 
               <br />
               utilise our great strategic position as a basis for 
               <br />
               seeking joint help or assistance in some way from 
               <br />
               Great Britain, Canada and the United States on 
               <br />
               the lines I have advocated on several occasions, 
               <br />
               I think we would be casting away a most valuable 
               <br />
               bartering opportunity for seeking something 
               <br />
               which might be very much better for the future 
               <br />
               of this country than anything we can gain from 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada. I feel that if we con- 
               <br />
               clude arrangements with Canada on the basis of 
               <br />
               the terms indicated, without trying for something 
               <br />
               better, we shall live, or some of us will, to regret 
               <br />
               it, as the opportunity for expansion of our own 
               <br />
               resources, especially those of the ﬁsheries on the 
               <br />
               basis of trade with America, will be lost forever. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I believe it is entirely wrong in principle to 
               <br />
               place before the electorate, for a decision which 
               <br />
               will be irretrievable and irrevocable, terms which 
               <br />
               have not been the subject of negotiations in any 
               <br />
               form whatever, but which are simply the ideas of 
               <br />
               one of the parties as to a fair and equitable basis 
               <br />
               for union. And I further believe that the terms 
               <br />
               indicated can be improved upon, and unless they 
               <br />
               can be, we should be inviting future financial
