               <br />
               do so? Certainly they wouldn’t. As you all know, 
               <br />
               Halifax used to depend on Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               supply ﬁsh for re-export. And they used this ﬁsh 
               <br />
               to compete with our own, until under the present 
               <br />
               system this was stopped to the great advantage of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. For some years Canada, and 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia particularly, had a large share of the 
               <br />
               European market and produced as much if not 
               <br />
               more saltﬁsh for these markets than we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do,</span> But 
               <br />
               over a period of years she lost those markets 
               <br />
               while we held them. She also lost the West Indies 
               <br />
               markets to a great extent, which at one time were 
               <br />
               exclusively Canadian and which today are ours. 
               <br />
               I wonder why these markets were lost? And I 
               <br />
               wonder if under confederation we’ll find <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oursel~</span> 
               <br />
               Ves in the same position as Nova Scotia? During 
               <br />
               the last quarter of a century we have been able, 
               <br />
               with the help of England, to sell to Spain, Italy, 
               <br />
               and Greece while Canada was unable to make the 
               <br />
               same exchange agreement and consequently 
               <br />
               could not ship. High ofﬁcials of the federal 
               <br />
               government have made statements that our 
               <br />
               marketing system is far ahead of Canada’s. In 
               <br />
               fact, it is so far ahead that last year a Canadian 
               <br />
               delegation came here to study our system and

               mittee on the delegation to Ottawa can tell us, 
               <br />
               although I understand that only one meeting was 
               <br />
               held, attended by only two members of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland delegation. Mr. Chairman, one of our 
               <br />
               chief industries took the time of one meeting and 
               <br />
               the attention of two of our delegates, and we’re 
               <br />
               expected to vote on a referendum for confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. That committee should have had with them 
               <br />
               Mr. Raymond Gushue, who in my opinion knows 
               <br />
               more about trade agreements and what’s best for 
               <br />
               our ﬁshery then any member of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation. And if this is correct, that it was only 
               <br />
               attended by two members, all Ican say is that they 
               <br />
               had very little interest in their country and the 
               <br />
               most important branch of its economy. Just in 
               <br />
               case they can’t tell us what functions are to be 
               <br />
               reduced, to me it is quite obvious that these
