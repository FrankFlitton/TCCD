               the people of this country decided to make this 
               <br />
               country a province of Canada, in the purely 
               <br />
               mechanical, technical and practical terms of the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery, it will be the local will that will prevail. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey That is not what I was given to 
               <br />
               understand. That was why I asked down north, 
               <br />
               “Why not appeal to your members?” The answer 
               <br />
               was, it was outside provincial jurisdiction. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman As a matter of fact, from 
               <br />
               memory if there is any competition between 
               <br />
               die federal and the provincial occupying the same 
               <br />
               field, then the right of the province must give way 
               <br />
               to the right of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It is concurrent legislation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey As far as I can gather. I know they 
               <br />
               were outside and they had no appeal, and when 
               <br />
               the Mounted Police came they had to pull out, 
               <br />
               because the ﬁshing rights were hired to big can- 
               <br />
               ning concerns run by Japanese. 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy Does the Canadian government pro- 
               <br />
               vide any subsidy for shipbuilding in this country? 
               <br />
               Is there a bounty for building schooners for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsh‘</span> 
               <br />
               ing? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I do not think so. I will not 
               <br />
               swear to it. That is a provincial matter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy In this country the government 
               <br />
               provides $95 per ton for building schooners. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, any province of Canada 
               <br />
               no doubt could do the same thing. 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie There is a federal bounty on ship- 
               <br />
               ping. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I said I would not swear to it. If 
               <br />
               the House so desires, I could get that information. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I think it would be a help if you 
               <br />
               would get that information. I know there is a 
               <br />
               bounty in Quebec on everything built. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Iwonder if the bounty to which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Crosbie refers is provincial or federal? 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie It was a federal bounty in 1944. I 
               <br />
               do not know if it has been changed since. 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell I take it that copies of this Fisheries 
               <br />
               Act will be available presently? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It is in the bibliography and 
               <br />
               they will be available. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Yes, that particular act would be 
               <br />
               included and covered by the request already 
               <br />
               made, and we are expecting it any day now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell We can refer to this section any 
               <br />
               time? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Deﬁnitely. As I already pointed 
               <br />
               out, its proper interpretation might not pemiit

               Mr. Job I do not want to delay the House on this 
               <br />
               point, but I was looking through the report and 
               <br />
               with regard to the export of saltﬁsh from Canada, 
               <br />
               there is no information given on that subject. The 
               <br />
               point I wanted to make was this. I do not think 
               <br />
               Canada exports any ﬁsh to the Mediterranean 
               <br />
               countries. We do. We have been enabled to do 
               <br />
               that almost entirely by our connection with the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has sup- 
               <br />
               plied us with the sterling exchange, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particularly</span> 
               <br />
               from Spain, and for some reason or other Canada 
               <br />
               has not been participating in that market. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood To Italy, do they not? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Very little. It is worthwhile looking into 
               <br />
               the reason for that. It may be that if we joined up 
               <br />
               with Canada, it might affect our relations with 
               <br />
               those markets. Formerly Canada was a heavy 
               <br />
               shipper to these markets, but they have not been 
               <br />
               shipping in recent years. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Before we go any further, are 
               <br />
               you making a list of the requisitions for informa- 
               <br />
               tion, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood? I want to make sure that 
               <br />
               each and every request for information is com— 
               <br />
               plied with or given to the department concerned. 
               <br />
               They must, of course, ﬁrst go to the Information 
               <br />
               Committee. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes. I understand what Mr. Job 
               <br />
               wants is a list of the countries to which Canada 
               <br />
               exports codfish. I suppose Mr. Job is referring to 
               <br />
               salt codfish? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Yes, and more especially the Mediter—

               <br />
               Mr. Bailey We have been able to beat them, 
               <br />
               either in better selling methods or better ﬁsh. I 
               <br />
               know two or three markets which Canada held, 
               <br />
               where we came in and ousted the Canadians. I 
               <br />
               believe we did that in Central America with the 
               <br />
               Gaspé fish very lately.
