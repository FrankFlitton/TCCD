               a long time ago - that in the great decision that

               that first many months ago when the Convention 
               <br />
               was still young. In the meantime I have come 
               <br />
               upon nothing to convince me to the contrary, so 
               <br />
               do I repeat it here at the end. I am still of that 
               <br />
               opinion.

               And now as we turn to the casting of our ﬁnal 
               <br />
               vote, as we address ourselves to the pinnacle of 
               <br />
               our endeavour here, there is this that I would ask 
               <br />
               the Convention to bear in mind: let us remember 
               <br />
               in this hour, that all the days of our lives the mark 
               <br />
               of this Convention will be upon us. We can never 
               <br />
               be free of it, though we ﬂee it down the nights 
               <br />
               and down the days and down the labyrinthine 
               <br />
               ways of our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">souls.</span> It will remain with us 
               <br />
               always. We are committed here to the sewing of 
               <br />
               a great purpose in conscience and in honour. And 
               <br />
               our own conscience will judge us all the days of 
               <br />
               our lives if we fail in conscience, and history will 
               <br />
               judge us if we fail in honour. And we shall know 
               <br />
               no peace of mind again if in this historic hour we 
               <br />
               fail this land and this people. As, then, we apply 
               <br />
               ourselves to the ﬁnal act of recommending the 
               <br />
               alternatives of government to be submitted to the 
               <br />
               people’s choice, let us bear constantly in mind 
               <br />
               that it is a matter involving our conscience and

               our honour to recommend all legitimate altema-

               <br />
               let us at this moment have somewhat more than 
               <br />
               the courage of our connections. Let us be decided

               The mark of this Convention will be upon us 
               <br />
               always in this too. We who are gathered here 
               <br />
               were by our election to this Convention in some 
               <br />
               measure set apart. We have the high honour of 
               <br />
               being the men to whom Newfoundland, at a 
               <br />
               moment of supreme decision, has turned for 
               <br />
               guidance. We have had full opportunity to study 
               <br />
               the elements of the issue that confronts us. We 
               <br />
               have had greater opportunity than most of our 
               <br />
               fellows to take the measure of this land and the 
               <br />
               measure of its necessity. And there has come 
               <br />
               upon us in consequence responsibility and 
               <br />
               dedication that will not end with this Convention. 
               <br />
               To whom much is given, of him much will be 
               <br />
               expected. And it will surely be expected of us 
               <br />
               after we have gone forth from here, that we shall 
               <br />
               serve with greater diligence than most the cause 
               <br />
               of human dignity and social justice in this land; 
               <br />
               for we have had greater opportunity than most to 
               <br />
               see wherein we could come to serve with ad- 
               <br />
               vantage. Indeed, there devolves upon us the plain 
               <br />
               duty to go forth from this Convention determined 
               <br />
               in our hearts and resolved in our souls that we 
               <br />
               shall leave no stone unturned, that we shall move 
               <br />
               whatever mountains must be moved, that we 
               <br />
               shall labour from dawn till dusk, that we shall 
               <br />
               cease not from argument or action, that we shall 
               <br />
               know no peace or no rest in our time until — 
               <br />
               come what form of government there may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> we 
               <br />
               have made the fullest contribution that we may

               in our own time to the making of this land that 
               <br />
               we all do love: a land in which there will be peace

               Mr. Vincent Mr. Chairman, I am not at the

               moment concerned with the nebulous conception

               of economic justice, nor am I greatly concerned 
               <br />
               with what my friend, Mr. Newell called 
               <br />
               “economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politics’K</span> The case as I see it is simply 
               <br />
               a motion to put on the ballot in the coming 
               <br />
               referendum this spring, confederation on the 
               <br />
               basis of the proposals submitted by the King 
               <br />
               government to this Convention. Anticipating 
               <br />
               this, of course, I previously recommended the
