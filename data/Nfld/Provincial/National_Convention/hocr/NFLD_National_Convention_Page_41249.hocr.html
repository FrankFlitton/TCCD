               Mr. Chairman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins, I still have the 
               <br />
               closure motion moved by you under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considera»</span> 
               <br />
               tion and I can only repeat to a limited extent what 
               <br />
               I said yesterday. It isn’t for me to decide the 
               <br />
               wisdom or otherwise of carrying the motion; but 
               <br />
               it is my duty to put the motion at such time as I 
               <br />
               consider to be fair and reasonable. The House 
               <br />
               tomorrow will have had a week’s clear notice of 
               <br />
               this motion, and the sands of time are running out. 
               <br />
               So that if a number of members desire that this 
               <br />
               Convention should ﬁnish its deliberations and 
               <br />
               work by the end of the month is to be given effect 
               <br />
               to, it obviously follows that the debate on the 
               <br />
               business presently before the Chair must shortly 
               <br />
               come to an end. Unless and until I’m shown 
               <br />
               between now and tomorrow afternoon at 3 
               <br />
               o’clock some good and sufﬁcient reason why I 
               <br />
               should not put this closure motion, I would like 
               <br />
               to inform the House now that it is my intention to 
               <br />
               put it immediately after the order of business 
               <br />
               begins tomorrow afternoon. Will members 
               <br />
               please govern themselves accordingly? I do not 
               <br />
               want any suggestions made outside the chamber, 
               <br />
               I know there’ll be none made inside, that in 
               <br />
               putting this motion at that time I am leaning one 
               <br />
               way or the other. The fact is I have taken already 
               <br />
               the responsibility for deferring this motion for 24 
               <br />
               hours, and I am going to assume the respon- 
               <br />
               sibility for the next 24 hours of deferring this 
               <br />
               motion. But having regard to all the attendant 
               <br />
               circumstances, I think that at 3 o’clock tomorrow 
               <br />
               afternoon the final decision should rest with this 
               <br />
               House... Therefore, Mr. Higgins, as far as I 
               <br />
               know, I have every reason to believe that I’ll put 
               <br />
               this motion to the House tomorrow afternoon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I think it’s quite fair, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man. After all nobody will agree that we haven’t 
               <br />
               given full debate to this matter in three weeks. I 
               <br />
               think even Mr. Smallwood will agree. I think 
               <br />
               every member who’s wanted to, would have 
               <br />
               spoken by the time we conclude our session 
               <br />
               tonight.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman I think the opinion of the House 
               <br />
               should certainly be ascertained. My only worry, 
               <br />
               you will appreciate Mr. Higgins, was to ensure 
               <br />
               that this motion wasn’t jumped on the House at a 
               <br />
               time when they didn’t have notice... Tomorrow 
               <br />
               will constitute one week’s clear notice of this 
               <br />
               motion, and I will have withheld putting this 
               <br />

               motion for 48 hours. I do not propose to go 
               <br />
               beyond that, because it might very well be that I 
               <br />
               will be exceeding my discretionary power.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I agree that very ample time 
               <br />
               will have been given by the end of the sitting 
               <br />
               tonight for the debate of these terms. I think it’s 
               <br />
               very generous of the House, and very ample. If, 
               <br />
               sir, you put the motion of closure at 3 o’clock 
               <br />
               tomorrow, and the motion is adopted, I will not 
               <br />
               have any regrets or recriminations.

               Mr. Smallwood I want, sir, to direct the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atten»</span> 
               <br />
               tion of the House to the fact that I have learned 
               <br />
               within the past 20 minutes that the Hon. Mr. Job, 
               <br />
               who has been sick at home and unable to attend, 
               <br />
               seems to have got the impression somehow that 
               <br />
               this closure motion is to be put tomorrow, but that 
               <br />
               it would be put at a stage in the proceedings 
               <br />
               which would allow him to deliver a speech which 
               <br />
               he has spent some time preparing. I haven’t been 
               <br />
               talking withMr. Job, and if I were to consult only 
               <br />
               my own feelings in the matter, as Mr. Job is not 
               <br />
               likely to make a very strong speech in favour of 
               <br />
               confederation, if he hasn’t got the opportunity of 
               <br />
               speaking, I will not shed bitter tears. But I do ask 
               <br />
               the House to remember that Mr. Job does wish to 
               <br />
               speak, and if the House were willing to indulge 
               <br />
               him for say half an hour or an hour, and then put 
               <br />
               the closure motion, I think you would have been 
               <br />
               completely fair. He couldn’t be here, sir, he’s 
               <br />
               been sick at home. I’m putting it to the sense of 
               <br />
               justice of the House itself to hear Mr. Job attack 
               <br />
               confederation, though I would not like him to do 
               <br />
               it and I would rather he did the other thing. 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Nobody has more respect for

               <br />
               have, but I direct members’ attention to the fact 
               <br />
               that the motion is as follows: “To move that 
               <br />
               immediately before the order of the day is called 
               <br />
               on Wednesday, January 14, 1948, for resuming 
               <br />
               the debate on the motion that the Convention 
               <br />
               resolve itself into a committee of the whole to 
               <br />
               further consider and discuss the proposals 
               <br />
               received on November 6 from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rt.</span> Hon. the

               <br />
               shall not be further adjourned.” Now this motion 
               <br />
               supersedes the motion to resolve the House into 
               <br />
               a committee. Therefore, it is not for me to alter

               the form of this motion, which is whatl would be
