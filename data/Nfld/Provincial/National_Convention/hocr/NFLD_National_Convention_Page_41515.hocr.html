               It is perhaps the only time in the history of any 
               <br />
               country that the actual speeches of a delegate 
               <br />
               assembly were broadcast to the public over a 
               <br />
               period of time. I believe, in Australia, the Broad- 
               <br />
               casting Corporation of Australia did once or 
               <br />
               twice broadcast some — one day or part of a day 
               <br />
               of the House of Commons of the Commonwealth 
               <br />
               of Australia I think also on one or two occasions 
               <br />
               in other countries, they have broadcast part of the 
               <br />
               proceedings of such an assembly. We have, on 
               <br />
               occasion, heard the broadcast of the President of 
               <br />
               the United States when he addressed the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of Congress. I know of no other case 
               <br />
               anywhere, at any time, where all the proceedings, 
               <br />
               all the speeches, all the remarks, all the public 
               <br />
               business of such a body has been broadcast to the 
               <br />
               public, as the Broadcasting Corporation has done 
               <br />
               in this Convention. That, to my mind, is one of 
               <br />
               the ﬁnest pieces of public service ever performed 
               <br />
               in this country by anyone, by any organisation; 
               <br />
               because if this Convention of itself has been of 
               <br />
               any real value in Newfoundland, as someone 
               <br />
               remarked afew months ago, it was along the lines 
               <br />
               of interesting our Newfoundland people in their 
               <br />
               public affairs. But what chance would there have 
               <br />
               been really to have interested Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               in their public affairs through this Convention if 
               <br />
               the speeches of the Convention had not actually 
               <br />
               been broadcast? I have been attending these 
               <br />
               meetings since the Convention opened. I did not 
               <br />
               miss a meeting until the other night, when I had 
               <br />
               to be absent for a night session. I have sat here

               word spoken by everyone. On top of that, I lis- 
               <br />
               tened also to the broadcasts. I sat through it all 
               <br />
               the afternoon, did not miss one word spoken by 
               <br />
               one member, and then went home at 9.15 or 9.30, 
               <br />
               turned on the radio and listened to the broadcast 
               <br />
               from the ﬁrst word to the last word, whether 
               <br />
               11.30 or 12.30, for a very particular purpose. I 
               <br />
               had something special in mind in doing that. 
               <br />
               Sitting here, I heard it as we all heard it; but sitting 
               <br />
               home listening to the radio I heard the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion just as the public heard it. That is the way I 
               <br />
               want to hear it. I sat listening to speech after 
               <br />
               speech, trying to ﬁgure in my own mind just how 
               <br />
               interesting were these speeches to the man in Joe 
               <br />
               Batt' s Arm, the man on the Grand Banks, the man 
               <br />
               in Deer Lake, in Boone Bay, in Bonavista and 
               <br />
               Gander — trying to ﬁgure, well now, will he 
               <br />
               listen? Will he wait to hear the next chap? Trying 
               <br />
               all the time to estimate how it was taking with the 
               <br />
               public of Newfoundland. It is no secret that the 
               <br />
               only thing I have been concerned with is the 
               <br />
               public of Newfoundland. I never made any secret 
               <br />
               of that.

               marked “Mr. MacDonald, Funk Islands”. 
               <br />
