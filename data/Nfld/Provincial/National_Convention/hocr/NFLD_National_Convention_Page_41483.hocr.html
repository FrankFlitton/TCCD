               What seems to be overlooked in this whole 
               <br />
               affair is that to be a success and a good thing for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, confederation must work, and 
               <br />
               work a whole lot more smoothly than it does in 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces, for example. For these 
               <br />
               provinces are part and parcel of confederation, 
               <br />
               they grew up with it and within it. We have 
               <br />
               remained aloof until now, and in the meantime 
               <br />
               we have labouriously built up a country, a cul—

               unique. We are as separate a race of people, with 
               <br />
               ideas and standards of our own, as different from 
               <br />
               the Canadians as the Canadians are from the 
               <br />
               Americans. The adjustment of our whole lives, 
               <br />
               and our outlook on life, government, religion, 
               <br />
               everything would be a tremendous and shaking

               We hear a great deal of talk about the size of

               <br />
               stand on our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feet,</span> I would like to call your 
               <br />
               attention for a few minutes to Iceland. Iceland is 
               <br />
               a very small country having a population of only 
               <br />
               120,000; yet this small country is standing on her 
               <br />
               own feet and since the war ﬁnished, they have 
               <br />
               had the British withdraw and also the Americans. 
               <br />
               If Iceland can stand on her own feet and make her 
               <br />
               own trade agreements, surely we in New-

               courage of our convictions and the guts to carry
