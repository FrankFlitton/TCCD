               Thursday, the 30th of May, 1946, I decided I 
               <br />
               would put my name in nomination the following 
               <br />
               day. Even then I felt my chances were very slim, 
               <br />
               as the opposition in St. John’s (City) West was 
               <br />
               tremendous from the standpoint of the calibre of 
               <br />

               I have said all these things merely to underline 
               <br />
               the fact that the district that elected me knew what 
               <br />
               I stood for, Indeed, I will go so far as to say that 
               <br />
               the country knew it. But now that I was into the 
               <br />
               fray, I left no stone unturned in order to keep the 
               <br />
               minds of the electorate clear on what I repre- 
               <br />
               sented. In the month and a half preceding the 
               <br />
               National Convention elections, I was engaged in 
               <br />
               writing a column for the St. John’s Sunday 
               <br />
               Herald, under the caption “Looking Ahead." In 
               <br />
               one of my columns I wrote, “The more one con- 
               <br />
               siders that clause of the statement relating to the 
               <br />
               National Convention, which suggests that can- 
               <br />
               didates should have an open mind, the more one 
               <br />
               is inclined ~— especially a candidate -— to come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that it is either a very stupid 
               <br />
               clause or a very clever one. It has put every 
               <br />
               candidate in a somewhat embarrassing position, 
               <br />
               to say the least, and it has put the voting public 
               <br />
               into more confusion than previously existed." In 
               <br />
               the light of past developments 1 am forced to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that it was a very clever clause, in the 
               <br />
               shady meaning of the word “clever”. Far better 
               <br />
               would it have been if every man could have gone 
               <br />
               out and campaigned on his own particular belief; 
               <br />
               when the election was over, we would have had 
               <br />
               a pretty good idea of where the country stood. 
               <br />
               The delegates who did that, although against the 
               <br />
               spirit of the Convention as alleged, were by far 
               <br />
               the wisest of us all.

               over radio station VOCM in a campaign speech, 
               <br />
               I said: “Ever since the announcement of the 
               <br />
               machinery of the National Convention, and even 
               <br />
               before whenever the question arose, I followed 
               <br />
               the same line of reasoning, both in my Barrelman 
               <br />
               radio program, and my editorials in a local 
               <br />
               newspaper. First, we have to make a decision as 
               <br />
               to whether we wish to retain the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commis’</span> 
               <br />
               sion form of government or to return to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self</span> 
               <br />
               government. If the decision is to return to 
               <br />
               self-government, then the second step is to decide 
               <br />
               as a people what form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-government</span> we 
               <br />
               think best for our needs —— the 49th state of the 
               <br />
               American union; the tenth province of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada; a status like that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North,</span> 
               <br />
               ern Ireland with control in London; or to remain 
               <br />
               under responsible government as from 1855 to 
               <br />
               1934.” My views are no different now than they 
               <br />
               were when each of these statements was made. If 
               <br />
               anything, l am more certain now that I knew then 
               <br />
               what I was talking about.
