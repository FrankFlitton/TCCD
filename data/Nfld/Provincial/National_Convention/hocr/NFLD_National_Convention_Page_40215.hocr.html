               Mr. Butt If you have commercial advertising 
               <br />
               there is a certain rigidity about those programmes 
               <br />

               know how far the Broadcasting Corporation are 
               <br />
               prepared to go in lessening revenue from com- 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood It seems strange for Mr. Butt to 
               <br />
               be directing that question at me, because he is as 
               <br />
               well able to answer that question as I am.... In 
               <br />
               connection with the large number of radio sets on 
               <br />
               which no payment was made in 1944, the answer 
               <br />
               is that during the war it became just about impos- 
               <br />
               sible to get radio sets, and in many cases radio 
               <br />
               tubes and other spare parts, the result was that 
               <br />
               throughout the country there came, by the end of 
               <br />
               the war, to be a very large number of radio sets 
               <br />
               which actually were not in use and so I suppose, 
               <br />
               with some degree of humanity, postmasters 
               <br />
               throughout the island did not collect the fees on 
               <br />
               unused radio sets. I think that’s the explanation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller I am somewhat disappointed about 
               <br />
               the manner in which this report is being covered 
               <br />
               by the House. Very good points have been over— 
               <br />
               looked, and we are making useless remarks. Our 
               <br />
               business today is as serious as it will be later on. 
               <br />
               There was a good point made by Major Cashin, 
               <br />
               concerning the erection of broadcasting stations 
               <br />
               at St. John’s, Corner Brook, Gander, and Grand 
               <br />
               Falls. I can’t guess the amount these outlays 
               <br />
               might total. I might say a quarter of a million 
               <br />
               dollars. Not worth our consideration this after— 
               <br />
               noon? We may be asked to spend that in three or 
               <br />
               four years time. It is well worth our considera— 
               <br />
               tion, and further this report should deal with the 
               <br />
               business basis of the Broadcasting Corporation. 
               <br />
               I think it is incomplete because it has not got it 
               <br />
               here. I cannot form an opinion whether the 
               <br />
               Broadcasting Corporation will be an asset or a 
               <br />
               liability to the future of Newfoundland. I want to 
               <br />
               know. That’s what I am here for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> more about 
               <br />
               the assets and liabilities of the future. This report

               people are getting special rates, etc. General 
               <br />
               routine work, but it is not in the report. I do agree 
               <br />
               with Mr. Hollett and others who made mention 
               <br />
               of VOCM. That station is not heard in my district, 
               <br />
               or very rarely, and that is only 84 miles away. I 
               <br />
               cannot take Mr. Smallwood’s explanation when 
               <br />
               he says that VOCM could ﬁnd no place on the

               <br />
               think that the United States and Canada will have 
               <br />
               to go down to these lower frequencies and less 
               <br />
               power? We are not driving a hard enough bar- 
               <br />
               gain, and VOCM is getting a raw deal. At the 
               <br />
               same time I am not so greatly concerned over 
               <br />
               that, but I am that we have not got the facts in

               Mr. Smallwood As the report states, the

               Mr. Smallwood For each of these 16 years the

               annual balance sheet was published in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerv</span> 
               <br />
               able detail. It is fairly simple, and it seems they 
               <br />
               have been making from $12,000 to $25,000 a 
               <br />
               year proﬁt. It does not look like they would ever 
               <br />
               be a liability. If the number of people with radio 
               <br />
               sets and licence fees and the sale of time on the 
               <br />
               air should fall off, then their income will fall, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               to look upon them as a liability in the future. The 
               <br />
