               improvement so far as Newfoundland is con- 
               <br />
               cerned in our trading relation with the United 
               <br />
               States of America, because the arrangements 
               <br />
               have merely stabilised for the time being the 
               <br />
               current duties on our fresh ﬁsh, and the result 
               <br />
               from other concessions is negligible. It is true that 
               <br />
               the duty and processing tax against our seal oil 
               <br />
               and whale oil entering the United States of 
               <br />
               America has been reduced by 50%, but the exist~ 
               <br />
               ing tax is still a prohibitive duty. As you know, 
               <br />
               sir, I have been a steady advocate of the idea that 
               <br />
               a so—called partly intemationalised position, or 
               <br />
               what has been termed the position of a con~ 
               <br />
               dominium, might be the better solution for the 
               <br />
               future of Newfoundland. My reason for this is 
               <br />
               that I believe we are dependent for our future 
               <br />
               prosperity not only upon our trade with the USA, 
               <br />
               and with Canada to a small extent, but also upon 
               <br />
               our relation with the mother country, without 
               <br />
               whose assistance in various ways our trade in salt 
               <br />
               codﬁsh with European countries would be cut 
               <br />
               short, and our ﬁshermen would then indeed have 
               <br />
               a hard time. Anyone who imagines for one mo- 
               <br />
               ment that the old country is permanently down 
               <br />
               and out, and will not be in a position to assist us, 
               <br />
               is making a grave mistake and they will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               her recovery will be very much quicker than they 
               <br />
               imagine. As heretofore, Newfoundland will be 
               <br />
               able to rely upon the mother country, whether 
               <br />
               under Commission government or not, not only 
               <br />
               for assistance in marketing our fish in the 
               <br />
               European countries and providing exchange for 
               <br />
               it, but also for a market for a great many of our 
               <br />
               products which found a market there prior to the 
               <br />
               recent war. This question of fostering a joint 
               <br />
               interest by Great Britain, the United States of 
               <br />
               America and Canada in our future development, 
               <br />
               in terms of giving them the right to use our 
               <br />
               strategically placed country for their own 
               <br />
               defence and the defence of democracy 
               <br />
               everywhere, should be carefully investigated 
               <br />
               before confederation is placed before the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland in any form. All opportunity of 
               <br />
               making Newfoundland a prosperous country 
               <br />
               reliant upon its own resources may be entirely 
               <br />
               lost if we act too quickly; and instead of enjoying 
               <br />
               a development of our own resources, we may be 
               <br />
               in the humiliating position of living upon a 
               <br />
               Canadian government with a much reduced 
               <br />
               population. It is my considered opinion that if 
               <br />
               Great Britain is sensible, and I believe she will be 
               <br />

               that in my opinion the strength of our people will

               In closing this address I will ask Mr.

               Smallwood and his supporters to reply to one 
               <br />
               single, simple question. That question is this, 
               <br />

               not offered by Canada, which have not resulted 
               <br />
               from any negotiations, and which many people

               confidently believe could be improved upon,

               question should be deferred for a speciﬁcally

               <br />
               very thorough investigation? I would like this

               When I left to go home to tea, sir, I was 
               <br />
               discussing the Labrador boundary situation. 
               <br />
               There has been some debate with respect to the 
               <br />
               Privy Council decision on the Labrador bound- 
               <br />
               ary. Mr. Cashin said that this decision would be 
               <br />
               upset, and Mr. Smallwood said that such an idea 
               <br />
               was fantastic, and that the only way that Quebec 
               <br />
               could take over Labrador was by raising an army. 
               <br />
               I know that Mr. Smallwood is not quite as naive 
               <br />
               as that. Mr. Cashin said he knew of three different 
               <br />
               ways by which Quebec might get Newfound- 
               <br />
