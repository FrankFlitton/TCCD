               Major Cashin’s on that point. I think after all the

               occasions on which Major Cashin has raised the

               <br />
               brought in to settle the matter once and for all.

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, when was the notice 
               <br />
               given of that second order of the day? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin It slipped in. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It was delivered to the table last 
               <br />
               night by Mr. Smallwood, so I am told. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett It was not presented to the House, 
               <br />
               so why should it be on the order paper? If people 
               <br />
               can stick in anything without notice to the House, 
               <br />
               I contend that it is out of order. I object strongly, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sur.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Just a minute, I like people 
               <br />
               before they get out of order to know what they 
               <br />
               are talking about. “Each person before giving 
               <br />
               notice of motion shall deliver at the table in 
               <br />
               triplicate.” 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Shouldn’t the Steering Committee 
               <br />
               ﬁx the order paper, sir? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It’s routine, really. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I did not notice the order paper. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The notice was properly given. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin It was slipped in. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Well, I hold it was properly 
               <br />
               given. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Well, if we both want to move the 
               <br />
               same motion I support, it is all right. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman You are agreed in principle, and 
               <br />
               it is quite immaterial, childishness, foolishness, 
               <br />
               no matter who brings it in. Let’s get on with the 
               <br />
               business of the House.
