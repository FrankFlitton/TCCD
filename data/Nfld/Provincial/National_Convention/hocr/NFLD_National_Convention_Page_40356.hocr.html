               Mr. Job ....I would like to refer to a remark made 
               <br />
               by my friend from the same district. He was 
               <br />
               referring to the settlements on the west coast, 
               <br />
               which I know very well, and I have had many 
               <br />
               talks with people from there. I am sorry to see that 
               <br />
               the Committee had not been able to contact very 
               <br />
               closely these west coast farmers. I talked with Mr. 
               <br />
               Tompkins, who has one of the ideal farms in the 
               <br />
               country.... He could do much more if he could get 
               <br />
               help. The reason is possibly that there is not 
               <br />
               enough attraction to the place itself.... They also 
               <br />
               stressed the fact that roads, roads, is what they 
               <br />
               want to make their farming a success. They have 
               <br />
               increased enormously their cleared land in that 
               <br />
               vicinity, and they have actual value there, but 
               <br />
               they don't get a very big thing out of it from a 
               <br />
               living point of View. 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I was interested in the appendix 
               <br />
               that the Committee brought in on the feed pool. 
               <br />
               You say the Dairymen’s Association pointed out 
               <br />
               that the costs of production were high because of 
               <br />
               the necessity of importing so much feed, hay, 
               <br />
               animals, etc.; as one man put it, what we are 
               <br />
               doing now is selling Canadian milk. He meant 
               <br />
               they imported the cow, the hay, the feed, etc., put 
               <br />
               them all together and got milk, but it all came 
               <br />
               from Canada. Iwonder if the Committee has gone 
               <br />
               into the question of a feed mill in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               If you look at the ﬁgures2 it is very discouraging 
               <br />
               as you look back over the years. Look what you 
               <br />
               ﬁnd. In 1945 we had, according to the census, 
               <br />
               14,000 cows. You go back ten years earlier, in 
               <br />
               1935, and again it has 14,000 cows. You go back 
               <br />
               to 1921 and it is 18,000 cows, and in 1901 we had 
               <br />
               14,000. The population has gone up from less 
               <br />
               than $250,000 in 1911 to 318,000, and still we 
               <br />
               have 14,000 cows. We are going backward very 
               <br />
               badly. Now you take pigs. In 1945 we had 11,400 
               <br />
               pigs, but in 1921 we had 14,500, and in 1901, 
               <br />
               34,000 —— 50% more population almost, and only 
               <br />
               one third as many pigs. Now it is true that in 
               <br />
               poultry there is a big <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increase...</span> The number of 
               <br />
               sheep has increased also, but it is down as against 
               <br />
               1935 and 1945. These are not very romantic, 
               <br />
               cows, pigs, hens, sheep, not very romantic at all. 
               <br />
               Some people don’t like the smell of them, but it 
               <br />
               is by these things that we live, and we are going

               I know a lot of the troubles back of it, but one 
               <br />
               of them is right here — we have to import our 
               <br />
               feeds, we have to import our hay, and the cows 
               <br />
               and the sheep and the pigs to begin with and the 
               <br />
               equipment used in the farm. They are duty free 
               <br />
               and it is a good thing, but are we importing feed 
               <br />
               in the most economical way we can?.... Why 
               <br />
               cannot we have a feed mill?.... Why cannot we 
               <br />
               import the grains separately and mill them here? 
               <br />
               We would need only a little hammer mill.... You 
               <br />
               could run a schooner to Montreal or Fort William, 
               <br />
               load up at the elevators, bring them down here 
               <br />
               and mix them here and cut the cost of feed. Why 
               <br />
               some businessmen are notdoing it, I do not know. 
               <br />
               Maybe there are too many ﬁrms on Water Street 
               <br />
               who are agents for the balanced feed. Why has 
               <br />
               not the Committee gone into this question — it is 
               <br />
               the crux of the whole business; that, plus the fact 
               <br />
               that we did not have any hay in Newfoundland. I 
               <br />
               know dairymen in the suburbs who imported 
               <br />
               from 60% to 90% of their hay. Just picture that! 
               <br />
               And all their feed... Importing that hay and sell- 
               <br />
               ing it in the form of milk at 80 cents and 90 cents 
               <br />
               a gallon. That is not a square deal to the farmer, 
               <br />
               nor to the consumer of milk. If we are going to 
               <br />
               raise our owu milk and livestock, there are two 
               <br />
               things we have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> First, we must grow our 
               <br />
               own hay. It is a good climate to grow hay. Look 
               <br />
               at the ﬁgures,3 the amount of land cleared, and 
               <br />
               then we call ourselves farmers. In 1901 there 
               <br />
               were 215,000 acres <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clearedvroughly</span> speaking an 
               <br />
               acre per person. In 1945 you are back to 124,000 
               <br />
               acres, with a population of 318,000. You expect 
               <br />
               to make a living out of that?.... In the course of 
               <br />
               three generations in Newfoundland we managed 
               <br />
               to get 15 acres of land cleared and cultivated, 
               <br />
               which has to support an entire family. It cannot 
               <br />
               be done. It could, if the price we get for the 
               <br />
               produce is way up high. Then who pays it? The 
               <br />
               consumer. Then up goes the cost of living. Ido 
               <br />
               not want to say one word against the farmer. I am 
               <br />
               one—eighth farmer myself —- at least, I have had 
               <br />
               ten acres under cultivation and worked like a dog 
               <br />
               until I knew the movement of every worm and 
               <br />
               insect; and I raised pigs and poultry. Clear more
