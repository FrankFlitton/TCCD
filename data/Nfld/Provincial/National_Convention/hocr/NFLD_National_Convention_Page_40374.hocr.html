               ﬁrst words of that line are “after the"; after the

               included in the expressions used by my friend

               things that may have been said in this assembly 
               <br />
               with regard to, as he said, the British people. 
               <br />
               There is no greater admirer in this assembly than 
               <br />
               myself of the British people as such, but I do not

               regard Dominions Ofﬁce as truly representing 
               <br />

               appear derogatory to the Dominions Office do 
               <br />
               not apply to the British people; like Major

               discuss the future of Newfoundland we are not 
               <br />
               going to be so very particular about some of the

               things we say.

               This afternoon there was a resolution passed 
               <br />
               that we send a delegation to Great Britain to 
               <br />
               interview the British government and not the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce. I would not be surprised if we 
               <br />
               did land in the Dominions Office, but 1 want it 
               <br />
               clearly understood that any delegation has not got

               to go over there with their fingers in their mouths, 
               <br />
               or in the conciliatory spirit that was proposed by 
               <br />
               my friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labrador.</span> That delegation is not
