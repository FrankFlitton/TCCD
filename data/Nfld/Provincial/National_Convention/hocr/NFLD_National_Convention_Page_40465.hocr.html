               Mr. Ashbourne That’s probably a government 
               <br />
               regulation about having their own doctors in the 
               <br />
               various localities. It is quite understandable. You 
               <br />
               could not have every doctor in every community 
               <br />
               on the hospital staff at $200 a month, it would run 
               <br />
               up the cost considerably. I take it that fee you pay 
               <br />
               the doctor, who is not associated with the cottage 
               <br />
               hospital, is a fee to have your name on his books 
               <br />
               as we used to say in years gone by, and whoever 
               <br />
               wanted his services, summer or winter, night or 
               <br />

               <br />
               pay him a certain annual fee. I will try to get that

               Mr. Crummey There are two points there, one

               <br />
               himself with the hospital in case his family has to 
               <br />
               go there and get special rates. If he is outside the 
               <br />

               doctor going into that hospital, although he has 
               <br />

               Mr. Vardy There are various scales of payment 
               <br />
               for these cottage hospitals. 1 think I have a receipt 
               <br />
               here from Walwyn Hospital1 for $15. There is 
               <br />
               also a fee for the X-ray, and the $ 10 is the nominal 
               <br />
               hospital fee, and there is a special medical fee for 
               <br />
               certain special services if you pay the extra $5 
               <br />
