               real money we had seen for over ten years. They 
               <br />
               were making efforts to rehabilitate themselves. 
               <br />
               But the Canadian government, in order to bolster 
               <br />
               up its own ﬁnancial position, influenced the 
               <br />
               Commission government to inaugurate this vi-

               cious and immoral legislation. Now again the 
               <br />
               story repeats itself, and we ﬁnd the Canadian

               government again ﬁnancially embarrassed, and 
               <br />
               they are compelled to stoop to a low level in order 
               <br />
               to curb our disbursement of our own moneys. Let 
               <br />
               me also remind you, Mr. Chairman, that just a 
               <br />
               few months ago, the ﬁnancial position of Canada 
               <br />
               became so acute that she was forced to seek aid 
               <br />
               from the American government. Yesterday, in 
               <br />
               answer to a question which I placed I received an 
               <br />
               answer, or the Convention did, from the 
               <br />
               Canadian government, an evasive answer, to the 
               <br />
               effect that they had made arrangements with the 
               <br />
               International Bank for $3 million. But they did 
               <br />
               not tell the truth. My question was, “How much 
               <br />
               did they apply for from the Americans, and how 
               <br />
               much did they receive?” The Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment asked for a temporary loan of around $700 
               <br />
               million but received temporary assistance by way 
               <br />
               of a loan of $300 million. This is the country with 
               <br />
               which we, as a solvent and prosperous people, are 
               <br />

               Before I enter into discussion of the attempted 
               <br />
               ﬁctitious budget presented by Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               over a month ago, which purports to cover the

               administration of the affairs of Newfoundland as 
               <br />
               a province, let me make a sort of recapitulation 
               <br />
               of the moneys and assets which would accrue to 
               <br />
               the Canadian government, as well as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disbur&lt;</span>

               sements which will be made by that government

               I have stated that the amount of $20 million 
               <br />
               shown in Annex IV of the Grey Book is not 
               <br />
               correct. In my opinion the amount would be 
               <br />
               closer to $30 million annually in the form of 
               <br />
               revenue that would be collected by the federal 
               <br />
               government. The Canadian government would 
               <br />
               assume our sterling debt, which would amount to 
               <br />
               some $64 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> This sterling debt would be 
               <br />
               added to the national debt of Canada, and it 
               <br />
               would appear that the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would not be liable for the interest and sinking

               <br />
               and interest. If that is not trying to deceive our 
               <br />
               people, I don’t know what is. It really means that

               <br />
               connection with the 15% tax on passengers, 
               <br />
               pointing out, he said, that the rate in Canada was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">31/).</span> cents, while it was 5-7 cents here. He forgot 
               <br />
               to tell us that at the present time both the CNR 
               <br />
               and the Canadian Paciﬁc are trying to get an 
               <br />
               increase amounting to 30%, which, if you add it 
               <br />
               to 31/2 cents would bring it close up to 5 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents.</span> I

               to take into consideration that every man who 
               <br />
