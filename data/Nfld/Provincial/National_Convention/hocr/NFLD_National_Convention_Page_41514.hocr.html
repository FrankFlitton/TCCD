               assisted me into the Chair on the afternoon of my

               <br />

               <br />
               many mistakes here, it was because we did much

               <br />
               many questions submitted to them, and I suppose 
               <br />
               most of all for the meticulous manner in which

               they have kept all the minutes of this Convention
