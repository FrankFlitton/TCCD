               ment in this country down to 1934, we borrowed 
               <br />
               many millions of dollars, but in all those years 
               <br />
               such a thing as a sinking fund, judging by their 
               <br />
               actions at least, never entered the minds of any of 
               <br />
               our governments. They just borrowed year after 
               <br />
               year, hoping that when each of the loans was gone 
               <br />
               through, either there would be a windfall or a 
               <br />
               stroke of luck, or else that they could go out on 
               <br />
               the market and borrow more to pay off the old 
               <br />
               loan as it came due; but there was no sinking 
               <br />
               fund. The ﬁrst sinking fund was established in 
               <br />
               1933 by law, and came into operation, as this 
               <br />
               reply tells us, in 1938. Now the idea, as I under- 
               <br />
               stand it, ofa sinking fund is this: ifa government 
               <br />
               goes out and borrows $5 million or $10 million, 
               <br />
               or any amount, for 20 years, or 25, or 30, or 50 
               <br />
               years, they have to pay interest on that loan every 
               <br />
               year until it matures. But when it matures there 
               <br />
               should be some other money accumulated, saved 
               <br />
               up, in a pot or a sinking fund, to meet the loan 
               <br />
               when it comes due. If not all of it, then as much 
               <br />
               of it as is humanly possible. If you have 20 years 
               <br />
               to go, then in that 20 years pour into your sinking 
               <br />
               fund as much as you can scrape together, so that 
               <br />
               when the 20 years are up and the loan falls due, 
               <br />
               you will have something saved up to pay on your 
               <br />
               principal. And so in 1938 a debt of some £70 or 
               <br />
               £80 million sterling, held in England, was 
               <br />
               guaranteed by the govemment’s own sinking 
               <br />
               fund. The loan comes due in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1963.</span> New- 
               <br />
               foundland has got to pay off that loan in 1963; 
               <br />
               she has to go out on the market and buy more 
               <br />
               money to pay off the old money, or she has to 
               <br />
               have a sinking fund. 
               <br />

               Now Mr. Chairman, when you come to create 
               <br />
               a sinking fund there are two ways to do it. You 
               <br />
               can set aside so much a year, say 2%, or 5% of 
               <br />
               the principal, and every year you will pay it to the 
               <br />
               sinking fund... What they did in this case was 
               <br />
               make it 1%. But 1% from 1948 to 1963 when the 
               <br />
               loan would fall due would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what?,...</span> You pay 
               <br />
               1% into the sinking fund every year for 20 years, 
               <br />
               from 1938 to 1963, and all you have saved up in 
               <br />
               our sinking fund to go against your debt when it 
               <br />
               falls due is 25%, and there is 75% left. So here is 
               <br />
               what they did. They appointed these trustees <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span>
