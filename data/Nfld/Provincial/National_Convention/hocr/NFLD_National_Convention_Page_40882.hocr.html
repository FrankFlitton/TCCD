               Mr. Butt Mr. Bailey’s point is that no matter 
               <br />
               what form of government there is in the nine 
               <br />
               provinces, you must ﬁnd the money for whatever 
               <br />
               services you have, and I agree with him. What I 
               <br />
               would like to know is this, if not after but before 
               <br />
               a debate on those acts and regulations, would it 
               <br />
               be not possible to have copies for members so that 
               <br />
               I, at least, could follow the debate intelligently?

               Mr. Chairman The position is that all the docu-

               <br />
               they will be forthcoming shortly. The request was 
               <br />
               made more than a week ago. We must assume 
               <br />
               they will be forthcoming before the debate is 
               <br />
               terminated. I can have another check made to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out if we can get any deﬁnite idea when the 
               <br />

               Before we went into committee of the whole the 
               <br />
               point was raised by Mr. Higgins as to what mode

               <br />
               was ultimately agreed that Mr. Smallwood would 
               <br />
               read the section, and give the interpretation of the 
               <br />
               section, but that he was not to revert to the Black 
               <br />
               Books unless any statement that he made was

               questioned or challenged and the answer was to 
               <br />

               responsibility is the Convention’s and not

               mine... .Mr. Smallwood now finds himself in the

               comparatively unfair position where he cannot
