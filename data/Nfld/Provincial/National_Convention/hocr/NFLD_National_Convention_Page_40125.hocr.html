               Mr. Cashin This Convention met on September 
               <br />
               11, and a week later we formed ourselves into 
               <br />
               nine committees for the purpose of ascertaining 
               <br />
               certain facts relative to the present financial and 
               <br />
               economic position of the country. Two reports 
               <br />
               were presented yesterday and immediately these 
               <br />
               reports had been presented, something upset the 
               <br />
               applecart. Yesterday afternoon I listened very 
               <br />
               attentively to Mr. Smallwood’s abuse, so to 
               <br />
               speak, of our country, and our people. Following 
               <br />
               which I listened to my friend, Mr. Harrington, 
               <br />
               who is a colleague of mine for the district of 
               <br />
               St. John’s City West, and following which I had 
               <br />
               the pleasure of listening to Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hollett,</span> Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has not repudiated the statements

               made by Mr. Harrington or Mr. Hollett and I 
               <br />
               want to know, what is behind the idea of offering 
               <br />
               senatorships and trips to Ottawa to try and in- 
               <br />
               fluence delegates? On whose authority is that 
               <br />
               being done? Is it on Mr. Smallwood’s authority 
               <br />
               alone? Is it on the Commission of Govemment’s 
               <br />
               authority? Is it on the Canadian government’s 
               <br />
               authority? Is it on the Dominions Office’s 
               <br />
               authority? Or whom? That is the thing that should 
               <br />
               be cleaned up now before we vote on this. If there 
               <br />
               are inﬂuences outside of this House about which
