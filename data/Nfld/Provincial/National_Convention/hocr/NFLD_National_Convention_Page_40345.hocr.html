               Mr. Smallwood The member for Grand Falls 
               <br />
               gave us the benefit of his researches into the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, which is the constitu~ 
               <br />
               tion of Canada. He quotes section 146.... It is 
               <br />
               surprising to me, the keen interest he has been 
               <br />
               showing in this matter of confederation... Per- 
               <br />
               haps he wants us to join the union. Let us take 
               <br />
               him at his word. Let us admit that is the way to 
               <br />
               join. I see the second senior member for St. 
               <br />

               <br />
               his name —— I think in the back of his mind he is 
               <br />
               hoping strongly we will have our own elected 
               <br />
               government in this country. So am I. Let us trace 
               <br />
               it. The delegation goes over to the British govem— 
               <br />
               ment and asks them to state what they are 
               <br />
               prepared to do for us if anything. They will tell 
               <br />
               us. We send a delegation to Ottawa and ask them 
               <br />
               what they are prepared to offer. We have both 
               <br />
               these pieces of information and we get down to 
               <br />
               talking about forms of government. Let us say we 
               <br />
               recommend this: (a) that Commission govern- 
               <br />
               ment be continued; (b) that we go back to respon- 
               <br />
               sible government; (c) that we have responsible 
               <br />
               government in union with Canada according to 
               <br />
               the terms handed to the National Convention by 
               <br />

               The referendum is held. You cannot go any 
               <br />
               higher than the people of Newfoundland. The 
               <br />
               gentleman from St. John’s West agreed on that.

               see those terms, they will say, “That looks pretty

               good, we will vote for it.” What are we up 
               <br />
               against? You have Commission of Government. 
               <br />
               They are here. But the referendum is held and the

               people have voted for confederation. Where do

               responsible government in the old country, and I 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood The point is this: responsible

               government by all means if it does not put too

               <br />
               make it pay, let’s have it. That’s whatl want to 
               <br />
               find out, what have they got to offer us. Maybe if 
               <br />

               what is the next step after the referendum? 
               <br />
               Simple enough. Call for a general election, issue 
               <br />
               your new Letters Patent, call the houses together, 
               <br />
               the upper house and the lower house and we 
               <br />
               will have our two houses of parliament. I can see 
               <br />
               the Major (is it against the rules to say that Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman?), I can see him bringing it in next 
               <br />
               January in this house, which would be the House 
               <br />
               of Assembly, “Whereas in the National Referen- 
               <br />
               dum the people of Newfoundland by a majority 
               <br />
               decided to accept union with Canada, therefore 
               <br />
               be it resolved that we now address a petition to 
               <br />
               His Majesty the King, praying that His Majesty 
               <br />
               may be graciously pleased to legislate New- 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation with Canada.” I can 
               <br />
               see myself scconding it.... It is legal and constitu- 
               <br />
               tional, and this is the nice thing about it, that if 
               <br />
               the decision is made it will be made by the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people. I am sure if the gentleman 
               <br />
               from Grand Falls were given a chance to decide 
               <br />
               for the people of Newfoundland, he would say, 
               <br />
               “Oh no, let the people decide that." Well; if the 
               <br />
               people decide it, what is wrong with it? Let the 
               <br />
               people’s will be done if the heavens fall, if they 
               <br />
               vote for it that’s the end of it. All we have to do 
               <br />
               is call our parliament, get both houses elected and 
               <br />
               send our address to the king.

               There may be other points that the Major 
               <br />
               brought in that I ought to deal with, but I don’t
