               have often wondered whether it was a good thing

               <br />
               to the technical methods of ﬁshing, but to the 
               <br />
               social or sociological; we have had 30, 40 and 
               <br />
               50,000 petty capitalists -~ whether it is a good

               thing to turn away from that and to industrialise 
               <br />
               the ﬁshing and increase the units of production; 
               <br />
               to increase mechanical processing; turn the

               only be called industrialism in the ﬁshery, reaching

               of concern and worry about future markets for 
               <br />
               fresh ﬁsh. I felt that in times of shortages of food, 
               <br />
               especially protein foods, we could ship ﬁsh into 
               <br />
               the United States and get our prices; leap over the 
               <br />
               duty and not feel it.... But what of the day when 
               <br />
               there will not be a world food shortage, when in

               the United States itself perhaps they will once 
               <br />
               again be ploughing under every third furrow of 
               <br />
               cotton, and the farmers will be paid by the 
               <br />
               government to destroy their pigs and their crops, 
               <br />
               or perhaps not to plant at all; when the coffee of 
               <br />
               Brazil will be used experimentally as fuel to run 
               <br />
               railways; when the trawlers dump their ﬁsh rather 
               <br />
               than block a market already glutted? What of the

               day when shortages will have disappeared, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly the shortage of protein foods? What then 
               <br />
               about our ﬁshery? What then of our fresh ﬁsh 
               <br />
