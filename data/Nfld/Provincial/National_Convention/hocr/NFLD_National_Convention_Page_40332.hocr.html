               for his products, it is really the amount of the 
               <br />
               necessities of life in return for his ﬁsh that counts. 
               <br />
               So I say that local industries such as factories, that 
               <br />
               handled a large part of the earnings of the people, 
               <br />
               obtained from all other major industries in- 
               <br />
               cluding the ﬁsheries, should be conducted in such 
               <br />
               a manner as to be a benefit to the poorest worker 
               <br />
               as well as to the richest of this country. When a 
               <br />
               person or corporation is about to start a so~called 
               <br />
               factory the ﬁrst thing is to take it up with the 
               <br />
               government with the aim and object of getting all 
               <br />
               the protection they can produce. That’s so they 
               <br />
               could prevent competition and be able to satisfy 
               <br />
               their dealers with a substantial discount and com- 
               <br />
               mission without any consideration of what any 
               <br />
               other industry would have to suffer by their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ar«</span> 
               <br />
               rangements. They do not care if the workers of 
               <br />
               the country starve to death as long as they could 
               <br />
               live in luxury. If that state of affairs is to be

               continued it will not matter what form of future 
               <br />
               government we may have. In other words, if we 
               <br />
               do not take our fishery as a guiding star in all our 
               <br />
               undertakings we are doomed to failure.

               In describing local industries there are two 
               <br />
               kinds. One that I am trying to describe and the 
               <br />
               other that is going on in the outports, for example 
               <br />
               sawmills that take the raw wood and convert it 
               <br />
               into commercial articles, and meet all kinds of 
               <br />
               competition and even help to keep the protected 
               <br />
               ones going. I must say that since the advent of 
               <br />
               Commission of Government the protective tariff 
               <br />
               has not been so great. But the sting of past years 
               <br />
               still lingers, demonstrated a few days ago when 
               <br />
               one of the members of the Board of Trade who 
               <br />
               attended a meeting of the Local Industries <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com»</span> 
               <br />
               mittee told the story of a person who was eating 
               <br />
               an article of food made in a Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fac'</span> 
               <br />
               tory; when that person was told it was a local 
               <br />
               product he spit it out. Doesn’t that story prove 
               <br />
               that it was not the taste of the article that made 
               <br />
               that person spit it out, but the sting of protective 
               <br />
               tariff? 
               <br />

               When the words local industries are even 
               <br />
               mentioned it sends a thrill through me. It brings 
               <br />
               back to my memory what happened over 20 years 
               <br />
               ago because of protective tariff. It was at a time 
               <br />
               when I had a shipment of goods landed here from 
               <br />
               New York bought in the regular way without any 
               <br />
               strings attached whatever. It happened to be the 
               <br />
               same kind of goods that were made in the local 
               <br />
               factories I could not make entry on my invoices

               without doubt that I could not buy from the local

               nesses by the protective tariff are the worst kind 
               <br />
               of a Jew — a Newfoundland Jew. I have no 
               <br />
               hesitation in saying that the protective tariff was 
               <br />
               never meant to foster industries that would give 
               <br />
               employment to the people, but is merely a con— 
               <br />
               cocted manipulation of trade. The consolation I 
               <br />
               have, that I can thank God for, is that my family 
               <br />
               was not raised by the protective tariff. If it was I 
               <br />
               would not be seen here in this assembly. I would 
               <br />
               be found home in an armchair shedding crocodile 
               <br />
               tears over the condition of the country. 
               <br />

               I do not believe there is another country under 
               <br />
               the sun that protects foreign products as we do, 
               <br />
               and I am fully convinced that these so-called 
               <br />
               factories that reap the beneﬁt of protection are 
               <br />
               really parasites on the ﬁshermen and workers of 
               <br />
               this country. I will stick to my conviction until 
               <br />
               such time as an independent accountant can con~ 
               <br />
               vince me otherwise. I predict that accountant’s 
               <br />
               report will show a loss to the public treasury of 
               <br />
               the tidy sum of approximately $2,000 a year at

               <br />
               tablishments where foreign material is processed. 
               <br />
               In other words, if the government would pay the 
               <br />
               employees of these establishments the full 
               <br />
               amount of their wages and let them go idle if they 
               <br />
               wish, and import the ﬁnished article, the govern- 
               <br />
               ment would save at least $2,000 a year on each 
               <br />
               individual so employed and in one or two cases 
               <br />
               it will be double that amount.
