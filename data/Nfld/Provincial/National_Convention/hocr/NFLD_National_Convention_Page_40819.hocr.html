               today? And I would have looked at the problem 
               <br />
               in such a way as to estimate the chances for the 
               <br />
               future as far as the ﬁshery is concerned I would 
               <br />
               have come to the conclusion that we are better 
               <br />
               organised today; prices are higher and are not 
               <br />
               likely to drop to where they were before, if the 
               <br />
               world keeps on a sound basis at all. I would have 
               <br />
               pointed out that there are a greater number 
               <br />
               employed directly in the fishery today than in 
               <br />
               1934 on a percentage basis. I would have pointed 
               <br />
               out that our ﬁsheries are more diversiﬁed than 
               <br />
               they have ever been, and I would have ended up 
               <br />
               by realising that the people of the world, as well 
               <br />
               as in Newfoundland, are in need of food and I 
               <br />
               would have then said, “We have got to make that 
               <br />
               better; we have to organise it better still and we 
               <br />
               have to convey that food to the people who need 
               <br />
               it". I would have concluded, so far as we are 
               <br />
               concerned in 1947, that we are somewhat better 
               <br />
               off in the ﬁsheries than we were in 1934. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I‘ would have looked at the forest resources - 
               <br />
               as the Committee did — and I do not propose to 
               <br />
               spend much time on them. We know our resour- 
               <br />
               ces are very much more considerably developed 
               <br />
               that they were in 1934. The people concerned 
               <br />
               with that development are putting more of their 
               <br />
               capital in it because they have some faith in the 
               <br />
               future of that industry. We have therefore 
               <br />
               developed our timber resources to a greater ex- 
               <br />
               tent than ever before in the history of the country. 
               <br />
               I would say we have extraordinary market 
               <br />
               prospects. There may be a drop in prices when 
               <br />
               things get back to normal. You cannot take your 
               <br />
               resources and blast them out of the earth without 
               <br />
               paying in higher cost of foodstuffs and higher 
               <br />
               cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">living,</span> If you take up any magazine from 
               <br />
               any country you will find that the high cost of 
               <br />
               living is worrying everyone, just as in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and will continue to worry us until we 
               <br />
               have worked out our stupidity as a world for 
               <br />
               causing such a war as in 1939. I would point out 
               <br />
               that as far as timber resources are concerned, that 
               <br />
               there are at least a number of people eamin g more 
               <br />
               wages than ever before in that industry.

               <br />
               1934. But I would say, we have not given to 
               <br />
               agriculture the thought and sympathy that it

               I think the Finance Committee was perfectly 
               <br />
               right in putting in the last part of its report this 
               <br />
               question of faith. You can call it faith or you can 
               <br />
               call it morale — and you would need to call it 
               <br />
               some other things in different circumstances ~— 
               <br />
               the one thing you must have in the economy is 
               <br />
               faith, the will of the people. If you look at Alfred 
               <br />
               Marshall‘s first book, in it he gives a definition 
               <br />
               of economics — “the study of wealth on the one 
               <br />
               hand and the study of man on the other". In the 
               <br />
               study of political economy you must take into 
               <br />
               consideration the human element which is the 
               <br />

               Now I shall look at our ﬁnancial and other
