               Mr. Smallwood St. Brendan’s Island is one of 
               <br />
               the largest islands on the coast of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               It is entirely a ﬁshing settlement. The people do 
               <br />
               some inshore ﬁshing, some Labrador fishing and 
               <br />
               some squid ﬁshing. This year they were en- 
               <br />
               couraged at the outset to concentrate on the squid 
               <br />
               ﬁshery. They were offered 35 cents a pound for 
               <br />
               dried squid, and many of them dropped every~ 
               <br />
               thing else and went at the squid ﬁshery. They did 
               <br />
               very well, but having caught and made the squid, 
               <br />
               they now find they cannot sell any of it whatever; 
               <br />
               that no buyer will take any of it; no shopkeeper 
               <br />
               will trade any food for it, and these people cannot 
               <br />
               get any food whatever for their squid. They are 
               <br />
               living, many of them, on the kindness of their 
               <br />
               neighbours. They have no food for the winter. 
               <br />
               There is now no flour in St Brendan’s and the 
               <br />
               people are at their wits’ end as to what they are 
               <br />
               going to do. They cannot get any labour; they 
               <br />
               cannot get work at Gander; they cannot get work 
               <br />
               in the lumberwoods; they cannot get it in St. 
               <br />
               John’s; the ﬁshery is over; the ﬁsh is useless to 
               <br />
               them; they have no food; they have no money, 
               <br />
               and yet these people are told it is a prosperous

               have no intention of making a speech. I was not

               permitted to read a letter describing at ﬁrst hand

               <br />
               very ﬁne people on the island of St. Brendan’s. 
               <br />
               So I have given you a description of it and now 
               <br />
               the country knows it.

               Mr. Butt ....l have listened attentively to the 
               <br />
               debate for the last four or five days, and whether 
               <br />
               this man is an optimist, whether this man is a 
               <br />

               <br />
               other words which can be so contentious; but I 
               <br />
               always ends up with the feeling, “So what"? 
               <br />
               Since we have been an island, our people have 
               <br />
               suffered. The millennium has not come for New— 
               <br />
               foundland any more than for any other country, 
               <br />
               and I beg leave to express my doubts on the future 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. I express my doubts on the 
               <br />
               future of UNO. I express my doubts on the wel- 
               <br />
               fare of the United Kingdom in the years to come. 
               <br />
               But what do I do? I sit down and think what I can 
               <br />
               do about it. I do not allow myself to get into the 
               <br />
               doldrums. I face up to the situation as I see it, 
               <br />
               hoping to God that I may be able to do something 
               <br />
               about it. 
               <br />

               <br />
               wound up by agreeing with it substantially, and I 
               <br />
               would not think of myself as either an optimist or 
               <br />
               a pessimist in ending up that way. I would have 
               <br />
               looked at the terms of reference and found that 
               <br />
               what we are supposed to do is to discuss the

               changes that have taken place in the ﬁnancial and 
               <br />

               would have asked myself, what was the position 
               <br />
