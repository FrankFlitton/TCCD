               Mr. Cashin Let them do it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington I started the ball rolling this 
               <br />
               afternoon in moving that you be overruled, be- 
               <br />
               cause I want to vote for this motion. I agree that 
               <br />
               there is not much going to come out of it. We have 
               <br />
               already been told off by the Secretary of State as 
               <br />
               regards trade... Ido not think the motion is going 
               <br />
               to get anywhere, but if it gives the Commission 
               <br />
               the privilege of turning it down, so much the 
               <br />
               better. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I would like to draw your attention 
               <br />
               to the ﬁrst paragraph of the ﬁnal memorandum 
               <br />
               given to the delegation by Lord Addison: 
               <br />
               I do not however regard it as me function of 
               <br />
               this Delegation to debate with me questions 
               <br />
               of the policy of the Newfoundland Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in current administrative and other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is«</span>

               sues, or to seek to negotiate trade 
               <br />
               arrangements between the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               and the Government of Newfoundland. In 
               <br />
               effect, the observations in your memoran- 
               <br />
               dum are criticisms of the conduct of the Com— 
               <br />
               mission of Government and the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom Government, and appear to me to 
               <br />
               be outside the proper purpose of this Delega- 
               <br />
               tion, nor are they likely to assist the National 
               <br />
               Convention in arriving at conclusions for 
               <br />
               their recommendations as to suitable forms 
               <br />
               of future Government in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               I take it that is the basis of your not agreeing? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No. Lord Addison may hold 
               <br />
               whatever views he likes. It was based on the 
               <br />
               contents of the Convention Act as I interpreted it 
               <br />
               ~— not as Lord Addison or anyone else told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I ﬁnd myself on the horns of a 
               <br />
               dilemma. I knew the bird would come home to 
               <br />
               roost. I think it came home to roost when they 
               <br />
               told us we could send a delegation to Canada. I 
               <br />
               have never thought we had the right to send 
               <br />
               delegations anywhere, more particularly when it 
               <br />
               comes to affiliating us politically with some out- 
               <br />
               side power. I want to refer you to the document 
               <br />
               of February 12, handed to the delegation which 
               <br />
               interviewed the Commission of Government, 
               <br />
               paragraph 4: “Upon the question raised in Clause 
               <br />
               1 of the Resolution respecting steps for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estab</span>

               United States and Newfoundland, your Commit- 
               <br />
               tee was informed that this question was one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be.</span> 
               <br />
               tween Governments through the regular 
               <br />
               diplomatic channels.” I think every man agrees 
               <br />

               that that is perfectly normal and correct. In going 
               <br />
               to Canada you cannot discuss terms of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion without bringing up these matters, or enter— 
               <br />
               ing into negotiations with Canada relative to 
               <br />
               economic matters. They say it is a matter between 
               <br />
               governments. We all agree with that. That is one 
               <br />
               of the bases on which I form my opinion that we 
               <br />
               never had any right sending any delegation to 
               <br />
               Canada with regard to political union, because 
               <br />
               political union must be tied up with economic 
               <br />
               discussions. Further, they say it was doubtful 
               <br />
               whether the subject matter of the clause came 
               <br />
               within the terms of reference. Even the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government had a doubt as to whether or 
               <br />
               not the matter of sending the delegation to the 
               <br />
               USA came within the terms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference.</span> The 
               <br />
               Convention Act, I946, definitely describes the 
               <br />
               duties of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention...</span> l hold that the exports 
               <br />
               of this country are tied up with any recommenda- 
               <br />
               tion which any reasonable man in this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion has to make in regard to forms of 
               <br />
               government. If we knew we could export so 
               <br />
               many tons of ore, or quintals of ﬁsh, to that or the 
               <br />
               other country, it would have a bearing on the form 
               <br />
               of government. We are to examine the position 
               <br />
               of the country — that is a broad statement. You 
               <br />
               cannot examine the position of the country if you 
               <br />
               do not examine its relations with outside 
               <br />
               countries. Now I am no longer on the horns of a 
               <br />
               dilemma. I support Mr. Penney’s motion, at least 
               <br />
               it will afford the Commission of Government an 
               <br />
               opportunity to make up their minds as to the 
               <br />
               terms of reference.

               that Great Britain could not guarantee to buy any

               <br />
               next year, or any year. They also told us, when 
               <br />
               we brought up the matter of the base deals, that 
               <br />
               they were not in a position to go to the US to
