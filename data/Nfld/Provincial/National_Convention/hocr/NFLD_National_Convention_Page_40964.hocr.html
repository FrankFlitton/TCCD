               discovered by Harry Oakes, a gold mining 
               <br />
               prospector who came up from the States many 
               <br />
               years ago. He prospected in Alaska, came into 
               <br />
               Ontario and what happened? He was trying to 
               <br />
               beat his way from Toronto to Montreal and was 
               <br />
               thrown off the train by the conductor. He fell in 
               <br />
               with a Chinaman and he discovered the 
               <br />
               Lakeshore. That is one of them. It was the 
               <br />
               pioneers in Canada who discovered its wealth. 
               <br />
               The government probably assisted them later on. 
               <br />
               They did it here. They do it everywhere. Let us 
               <br />
               look at Hollinger mine ~—— the one that is owned 
               <br />
               by Timmins. What happened? Hollinger controls 
               <br />
               probably the biggest gold mine in the world, 
               <br />
               founded by Benny Hollinger, staked by Mc- 
               <br />
               Martin. The government had nothing to do with 
               <br />
               that. As far as mining is concerned, you have to 
               <br />
               have the pioneer spirit, the men to go out in the 
               <br />
               wilds. Someone went to the Labrador and found 
               <br />
               the ore, the government did not ﬁnd it. The same 
               <br />
               thing applies to forestry. The government did not 
               <br />
               know what timber was on Crown lands. They 
               <br />
               give us some idea.

               Mr. Smallwood It was only a guess.

               <br />
               couver, I was there 40 years ago, they do not 
               <br />
               know what they have there yet. It is being dis- 
               <br />
               covered every day.... As far as the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada coming down here is concerned, our 
               <br />
               people have to do it themselves. We have to get 
               <br />
               over the idea, whether we have confederation, or 
               <br />
               under Commission government or under respon- 
               <br />
               sible government or any other form of govem— 
               <br />
               ment, that if we are not prepared to pioneer and 
               <br />
               work ourselves, no government is going to feed 
               <br />
               us. Someone has to pay for it and it is generally 
               <br />
               the taxpayer. Whilst we appreciate the Canadian 
               <br />
               govemment’s proposals — that is why I have 
               <br />
               sympathy with Mr. Smallwood here and it is 
               <br />
               unusual for me to say that — he is acting on 
               <br />
               behalf of the Canadian government. He is telling 
               <br />
               us what the Canadian government says --— he has 
               <br />
               no more idea than I have...
