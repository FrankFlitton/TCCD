               Mr. Vardy Mr. Smallwood referred to me being 
               <br />
               an authority on local roads, and I believe I can 
               <br />
               claim that honour somewhat, since I have been 
               <br />
               for many years connected with these schemes. I 
               <br />
               was chairman of the ﬁrst road committee around 
               <br />
               Random.1 I am chairman of that still and several 
               <br />
               others. Notwithstanding the fact that I have inter- 
               <br />
               ested myself in roads, I am not dead or ready for 
               <br />
               a cemetery, notwithstanding the remarks made 
               <br />
               on the radio last night where they referred to a 
               <br />
               dead Convention and a dead country. 
               <br />
               Regarding these local road committees, ﬁrst 
               <br />
               there is a magistrate of the district, who is really 
               <br />
               the local government ofﬁcer today, and very 
               <br />
               useful in that capacity. He has to interest himself 
               <br />
               first in some particular locality, go there, call 
               <br />
               together two or three people and ask them if they 
               <br />
               would interest themselves in forming a local 
               <br />
               roads <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committee,</span> There must be three, two mem— 
               <br />
               bers and a chairman. They must submit certain 
               <br />
               facts regarding mileage, etc, to the magistrate. 
               <br />
               He turns that over to the ofﬁcials in St. John’s, 
               <br />
               who in turn send back the authority for that local 
               <br />
               road committee to go on with the work, and 
               <br />
               allocate a certain amount of money to it. The 
               <br />
               amount is really very much better than $25 per 
               <br />
               mile or 25 cents per person. I may say that al- 
               <br />
               though I have been most critical of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government, I can hand it out to them 
               <br />
               there, they have done very good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work,</span> Never 
               <br />
               have I had a request turned down... I cannot ﬁnd 
               <br />
               words too hard to criticise them for their neglect 
               <br />
               of these outside places for ten or twelve years, but 
               <br />
               today I must be fair; if the people get together and 
               <br />
               show a spirit to help themselves, the Department 
               <br />
               of Public Works will definitely go the other half 
               <br />
               way and much farther to help them.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent Mr. Chairman, debating in this 
               <br />
               Convention, whether termed sensible or silly by 
               <br />
               the observer, is fast becoming as real as the 
               <br />

               Smallwood literally said, “Come on fellows

               <br />
               give ‘em all you’ve got.” However, try as he

               might, the chairman of the Transportation Com- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was a marked reluctance on the part of the Con-

               <br />
               that. It was my intention to reserve judgement 
               <br />
               until I had time to study other reports, but after a
