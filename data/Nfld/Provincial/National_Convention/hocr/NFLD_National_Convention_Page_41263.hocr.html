               places. I maintain that when prices get back to 
               <br />
               normal, we can’t reasonably expect 325,000 
               <br />

               <br />
               The progress of a country is limited to the amount 
               <br />
               of money the people can earn. As a government 
               <br />
               we shall want to balance our budget, or as near 
               <br />
               as possible. We realise that the amount of money 
               <br />
               that Canada is prepared to give us over the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               12 years of union will be a help in trying to get 
               <br />
               the provincial form of government operative, 
               <br />
               providing that the Newfoundland people decide 
               <br />
               to enter into confederation. Our surplus can be 
               <br />
               used if necessary for certain things which would 
               <br />
               help our province. There is a provision that a 
               <br />
               certain amount of it has to be put on interest. This 
               <br />
               surplus will be a great help to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               because there are certain things which we need 
               <br />
               to have done. We want a further extension of our 
               <br />
               road programme. We shall have certain other 
               <br />
               needs which will be evident from time to time. I 
               <br />
               don’t fear any great difﬁculty to arise from the 
               <br />
               change in taxation if we enter the Canadian con- 
               <br />
               federation. We’re going in with a country which 
               <br />
               is a big and wealthy country. The fact that Canada 
               <br />
               has got a seat on the United Nations Security 
               <br />
               Council this year proves that it is not immature 
               <br />
               politically; but that it is attaining full maturity 
               <br />
               amongst nations. I had the honour myself of 
               <br />
               attending one of the sessions last fall when I 
               <br />
               happened to be in New York. I went to the United 
               <br />
               Nations meeting. It was quite an experience. I 
               <br />
               found that the afternoon when I was there the 
               <br />
               committee on Palestine was meeting for its first 
               <br />
               session, and all the seats which were ordinarily 
               <br />
               available for visitors had been occupied...

               Mr. Ashbourne Sir, I was just going to say that

               It has been mentioned here about the duty 
               <br />
               that’s put on pork and beef coming into Canada 
               <br />
               from the States. Does any member think here that 
               <br />
               the cows that grow in the States are better then 
               <br />
               the cows that grow in Canada? Or the pigs that 
               <br />
               grow in the States are better then the pigs that 
               <br />
               grow in Canada? No. Years gone by, sir, I saw 
               <br />
               some of these animals slaughtered myself in the 
               <br />
               Canada Packers plant in Toronto, put out in huge 
               <br />
               quarters, some of them put out in cuts for the 
               <br />
               Royal York Hotel. Now it’s only reasonable to 
               <br />
               think that there would be some protection granted 
               <br />
               to Canada on pork and beef coming in there, and 
               <br />
               I think that if we could get all the beef that we 
               <br />
               want in Canada, there won’t be very much com- 
               <br />
               ing in from the States at a duty of $4 a barrel. 
               <br />
               Flour is being subsidised to a certain extent in 
               <br />
               Canada, with the result that the Canadian people 
               <br />
               are paying less for ﬂour than we are. Flour at $20 
               <br />
               a barrel in Newfoundland, it’s quite an item, quite 
               <br />
               an item. I believe also that they’re paying a 
               <br />
               subsidy on soap. You can buy a cake of soap in 
               <br />
               Canada for 8 cents... Somebody said the other 
               <br />
               day there was 126 taxes on a pair of shoes... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Mr. Ashbourne, I’d like to ad— 
               <br />
               dress myself to members generally on two points. 
               <br />
               One is, I would like members to be as brief as 
               <br />
               they possibly can. The time is running out and 
               <br />
               I’m not going to permit a filibuster. I’ll stop that, 
               <br />
               ifl have to put the closure motion... I’ve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with“</span> 
               <br />
               held this motion for 48 hours in order to permit 
               <br />
               members who had not had the opportunity of 
               <br />
               addressing themselves on the matter to be af- 
               <br />
               forded the opportunity of so doing... I have to ask 
               <br />
               members, will they please at this stage make their 
               <br />
               remarks as terse and as brief as possible, bearing 
               <br />
               in mind the fact that there are a number of mem- 
               <br />
               bers who have not had the opportunity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak‘</span> 
               <br />
               ing, and again bearing in mind that my purpose 
               <br />
               in deferring this motion is going to be defeated if 
               <br />
               one member is going to occupy the ﬂoor to the 
               <br />
               exclusion of other members who are entitled to 
               <br />
               equal treatment. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The next point, is a request thatI want to make, 
               <br />
               and it arises out of some remarks made by Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood before we went into committee this 
               <br />

               <br />
