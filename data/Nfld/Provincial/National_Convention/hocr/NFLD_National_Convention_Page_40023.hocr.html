               Mr. Bradley I would like to say that it was very 
               <br />
               fortunate that Mr. Miller raised some question in 
               <br />
               connection with section 39. Immediately on ad- 
               <br />
               journment yesterday afternoon, the committee 
               <br />
               met in the Council Chamber and considered the 
               <br />
               matter at length... The question had reference to 
               <br />
               the fact that this Convention may have to con- 
               <br />
               sider, not merely two alternatives, but one of 
               <br />
               several types of governments, and that we might 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the type of government which had the 
               <br />
               greatest number of votes, by no means had a 
               <br />
               majority; and that being the case, it might be that 
               <br />
               those members who had voted for a certain form, 
               <br />
               might on second choice have preference for some 
               <br />
               alternative which, joined with other votes, might 
               <br />
               better express the voices and plurality be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ob«</span> 
               <br />
               tained. The ﬁrst thing I have to observe is that this 
               <br />
               Convention decides nothing. We want to get that 
               <br />
               very clear in our motion. We decide nothing. We 
               <br />
               can only decide to recommend something; but 
               <br />
               any recommendation must not necessarily be 
               <br />
               adopted by the British government. So we make 
               <br />
               no unalterable decisions. In the next place you 
               <br />
               will not be asked to decide on any particular form 
               <br />
               of government, you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me</span> not voting for a particular 
               <br />
               type of government here, the thing to do is to vote 
               <br />
               that a type or types of government he put on the 
               <br />
               ballot paper. You will not be asked to choose 
               <br />
               between two, three or four forms of government. 
               <br />
               That is not the procedure, but each type of 
               <br />
               government under consideration will, when duly 
               <br />
               moved, and seconded, be put to the Convention 
               <br />
               by the Chairman and will require a majority vote 
               <br />
               of this Convention to put that type or particular 
               <br />
               form in our recommendations. That being done, 
               <br />
               some other member of the Convention may, and 
               <br />
               probably will, propose that some other form be 
               <br />
               put on the ballot paper and that will be submitted 
               <br />
               to the vote, and it will require a majority to be put 
               <br />
               in the recommendations, and so on. and in each 
               <br />
               case, no member who votes for one is precluded 
               <br />
               from voting for the other. It is possible we might 
               <br />
               move that they should all go on. It was not the 
               <br />
               intention of the committee to deprive the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Convention of the right to speak or to 
               <br />
               cast their vote. The idea is that whatever

               Mr. Jackman I do not agree with the terms of 
               <br />
               reference in regard to the form of government. 
               <br />
               The form of government was made not in 1932, 
               <br />
               it was made in 1855 and that decision was never 
               <br />
               rescinded by the people of Newfoundland The 
               <br />
               question was never put to a vote when we lost our 
               <br />
               democratic rights. Therefore, in my opinion, in 
               <br />
               regards to terms of reference for future forms of 
               <br />
               government, it should be strictly boiled down to 
               <br />
               the present system and responsible government. 
               <br />
               I have been informed by different people, 
               <br />
               lawyers, etc., that this form of government is 
               <br />
               constitutional. I am not a lawyer, and I don’t 
               <br />
               know very much about law, but I cannot see or 
               <br />
               ﬁgure out how we could discuss any forms of 
               <br />
               government other than responsible government 
               <br />
               and Commission of Government. For this reason, 
               <br />
               sir, when we lost our constitutional rights, I am 
               <br />
               pretty certain that at that time the matter was set 
               <br />
               forth this way to the people - that when New— 
               <br />
               foundland became self-supporting, and when 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders asked for the return of their 
               <br />
               government, that would be the end of it. As far as 
               <br />
               l can see, we may discuss federation, repre— 
               <br />
               sentative government, etc., but there are really 
               <br />
               only two things we can discuss, namely Commis— 
               <br />
               sion of Government or responsible government. 
               <br />
               I don’t know who is responsible for this, but if I 
               <br />
               am in order I beg to move that responsible 
               <br />
               government and Commission of Government be 
               <br />
               the only two issues.
