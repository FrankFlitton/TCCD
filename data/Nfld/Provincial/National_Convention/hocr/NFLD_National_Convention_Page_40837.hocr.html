               nostrils of our people. I estimate that if they had 
               <br />
               loaned that $ 12 million at current rates of interest, 
               <br />
               we should have earned nearly $2 million. On the 
               <br />
               other hand, if we had not had to pay the interest 
               <br />
               on the other $9 million we borrowed we should 
               <br />
               have received another $2 million. Working on the 
               <br />
               basis that a penny saved is a penny earned, this 
               <br />
               country has lost $4 million. We have been told 
               <br />
               that the United Kingdom did not ask us for these 
               <br />
               loans, and that the Commission government gave 
               <br />
               them as a voluntary gesture; but I do not think 
               <br />
               that there is anybody in the sound of my voice so 
               <br />
               gullible as to believe this. Behind it all can be 
               <br />
               seen the guiding hand of the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               government.

               Now, Mr. Chairman, we come to the matter of 
               <br />
               the sterling sinking fund. Mr. Smallwood admits 
               <br />
               that he had been hearing me talk about this matter 
               <br />
               for the past two years, and apparently he wants 
               <br />
               to hear me talk about it again. It is such a novelty 
               <br />
               to hear the member from Bonavista Centre say 
               <br />
               that he wants to listen to somebody else, that I 
               <br />
               think I should not lose the opportunity — I may 
               <br />
               never get it again, and I mean that. To those of us 
               <br />
               who can use ordinary intelligence, what 1 have to 
               <br />
               say will be an old, old story. In 1933 an act was 
               <br />
               passed which provided that beginning not later 
               <br />
               than July I, 1938, there would be paid into a 
               <br />
               sinking fund for the redemption of our outstand- 
               <br />
               ing 3% sterling stock an amount equivalent to 1% 
               <br />
               of that stock, in this instance an amount 
               <br />
               equivalent to £177,950. On'luly 1, 1938, the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               such payment was made. Each year this is paid 
               <br />
               to the trustees of the fund, and the trustees go out 
               <br />
               in the market and buy in the equivalent of this 
               <br />
               amount to the principal of our debt. They have 
               <br />
               been doing this for nearly ten years. Instead of 
               <br />
               reducing the principal of our debt each year by 
               <br />
               the amount of payment to the sinking fund, it is 
               <br />
               left to itself, consequently we have been sending 
               <br />
               over interest on interest. Therefore, if we com- 
               <br />
               pound these ten year payments at 3% each year, 
               <br />
               and allowing for the pound an average of $4.60, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that the fund as at July 1, 1947, should 
               <br />
               total in the vicinity of $9.5 million... I hold, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, that each year when this sinking fund 
               <br />
               amounting to £177,950 is sent to England, and 
               <br />
               the trustees purchase our 3% stock, that then the 
               <br />
               national debt should be reduced by this amount 
               <br />
               and the stock cancelled; but if we survey the 
               <br />
               estimates of expenditure we ﬁnd that no such 
               <br />

               John Doe of the British Treasury of putting this 
               <br />
               money into his pocket is, of course, ridiculous. 
               <br />
               What I intended to convey was that through the 
               <br />
               unbusinesslike methods of some person, the 
               <br />
               treasury of Newfoundland has been deprived of 
               <br />
               around $1 million.

               No ofﬁcial statement has been furnished 
               <br />
               regarding the handling of that particular fund, 
               <br />
               although I have requested the same, neither has 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood been able to give me this state— 
               <br />
               ment. He merely got an answer telling him what 
               <br />
               was happening. Also in the budget speech (last 
               <br />
               May) no statement was given, and the only state— 
               <br />
               ment given was in the annual statement of the 
               <br />
               Auditor General. Why should we lose this $1 
               <br />
               million? Are we so rich that we can afford to 
               <br />
               overlook it, or are we so generous that we can 
               <br />
               come out and defend it? That $1 million would 
               <br />
               do a lot of good over where Mr. Bradley, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood and Mr. Burry so often shed their 
               <br />
               crocodile tears. The position is that the people 
               <br />
               who control our cash are $1 million short, so to 
               <br />
               speak, in their bookkeeping. There may be a 
               <br />
               satisfactory explanation, but in this case, until 
               <br />
               they prove their innocence, I shall hold them 
               <br />

               Mr. Cashin Reverting back to the interest—free

               loans, there is another point which Ishould like 
               <br />
               to bring to your attention. At the time we were in 
               <br />
               London in May, there stood to the credit of this 
               <br />
               country as interest-free loans to Great Britain 
               <br />
               roundly $9 million. We discussed with Lord Ad- 
               <br />
               dison the possibility of applying this amount to 
               <br />
               the reduction of our sterling debt. Lord Addison 
               <br />
               made what I regard as a most astounding answer. 
               <br />
               He told us that the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               had recommended that these loans remain intact 
               <br />
               and should not be used for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpose.</span> Now, 
               <br />
               when these interest-free loans were given, the 
               <br />
               pound sterling was valued at $4.45 and conse- 
               <br />
               quently Britain received pounds based on that
