               <br />
               too much for these people who toiled and sup— 
               <br />
               ported a family, all of them raised large families, 
               <br />
               and contributed so much towards the general 
               <br />
               revenue of this country, that we should go on, as 
               <br />
               far as possible, increasing the amounts paid the

               <br />
               are, Mr. Smallwood, they are as I see it very 
               <br />
               stringent qualiﬁcations. You can get the pension,

               Mr. Smallwood I am glad Mr. Hickman raised

               <br />
               tion is this: there is an Old Age Pensions Act. 
               <br />
               Here it is. There was an amendment passed to it 
               <br />
               by the Parliament while we were in Ottawa. Here 
               <br />
               is is, July 1947, and then here are the statutory 
               <br />
               orders and regulations made under the Old Age 
               <br />
               Pensions Act, and it is the regulations that govern 
               <br />
               the conditions under which the whole thing is 
               <br />
               carried out. Now these regulations are made by 
               <br />
               the interprovincial Old Age Pensions Authority. 
               <br />
               Every province has its own old age pensions

               authority, say three men appointed to administer 
               <br />
               old age pensions. Every province has that. Now 
               <br />
               on top of all of them there is an interprovincial 
               <br />

               age pensions authorities of all the provinces.

               twice a year for that purpose, and all the provin-

               the provincial government can subscribe as much 
               <br />
               as it likes. For instance in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               today the old age pension is $40 a month, but the 
               <br />
               federal government only contributes $22.50 a 
               <br />
               month, and the rest is paid by the province. The 
               <br />
               province could make it $50 a month, but the 
               <br />
               federal government only gives $22.50. You see? 
               <br />
               Is that clear?
