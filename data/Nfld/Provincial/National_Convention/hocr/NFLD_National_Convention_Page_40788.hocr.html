               <br />
               having giving it due perusal, it wins my un- 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed praise. It was indeed a colossal under- 
               <br />
               taking... All over it shows reference to previous 
               <br />
               reports that were approved in this House as 
               <br />
               authority for its statements. In essence then, it is 
               <br />
               a summing up of our work which was approved 
               <br />
               and thus in its collective stage must win our 
               <br />
               accord if we are to be consistent. Criticism of 
               <br />
               course can be worthwhile, but to be worthwhile 
               <br />
               it must be sound, practical and fair. It can be 
               <br />
               perverted, fanatical even, when dealing with a 
               <br />
               question so important, so all important as this 
               <br />
               present one. In some instances our standard of 
               <br />
               criticism has not been hard. And one tends to 
               <br />
               disregard these, for we are here for constructive 
               <br />
               purposes, not destructive. In the argument set 
               <br />
               forth there are some points which we seem to 
               <br />
               accept in our ﬁnancial and economic set-up as 
               <br />
               being unavoidable and insurmountable. I feel it 
               <br />
               is unfortunate that these points should go unques- 
               <br />
               tioned... For instance, it is said in a manner 
               <br />
               foreboding ill, ours is an export economy, New- 
               <br />
               foundland must export to live. I say, what is 
               <br />
               wrong about that? Let me repeat brieﬂy these 
               <br />
               established facts about our natural resources and 
               <br />
               production. It has been proven to the satisfaction 
               <br />
               of the most critical, and it is thus no longer 
               <br />
               questioned, that our ﬁsh, ore, and paper industries 
               <br />
               are of the greatest potential value, are very sub- 
               <br />
               stantial in quantity and are being soundly and 
               <br />
               progressively administered. Demand in the 
               <br />
               foreseeable future is excellent for these products. 
               <br />
               Our equipment, wherewith we produce, has been 
               <br />
               greatly improved and enlarged during the war 
               <br />
               period and is now at a high point of efﬁciency. 
               <br />
               From this we could almost deduce certain issues. 
               <br />
               We could say that our production will be up and 
               <br />
               that our sales will be up. Consequently we shall 
               <br />
               go on living, go on exporting, but dark and 
               <br />
               sinister forebodings cannot easily be dispersed 
               <br />
               from the minds of those who would cherish them. 
               <br />
               And so a new insurmountable obstacle is intro- 
               <br />
               duced and in the calm air of “I told you so", they 
               <br />
               sit back to await the realisation of their horrors. I 
               <br />
               must pause here, Mr. Chairman, to say that a 
               <br />
               nation or a country so disposed, so devoid of all 
               <br />
               initiative and aggressiveness can only sink, sink 
               <br />
               to the low level of a kept people. Great God, what 
               <br />
               an answer. I feel, Mr. Chairman, that it is another 
               <br />
               type of people whose interest we serve here 
               <br />

               and self-support, in high sounding phraseology, 
               <br />
               is termed the vulnerability of our economy due to 
               <br />
               currency fluctuations. Yes, we are subject to just 
               <br />
               that. I admit it. But I cannot accept it as being 
               <br />
               insurmountable. True, we have in the past never 
               <br />
               tried to correct this situation. We have never 
               <br />
               fought back, we have never tried to forewarn 
               <br />
               ourselves and thereby forearm ourselves against - 
               <br />

               <br />
               because we were in no position to do so. I grant 
               <br />
               exception to this in one instance only, and I refer 
               <br />
               now to the effort of the present government in 
               <br />
               correcting to our advantage the situation which 
               <br />
               arose this year when Great Britain decided to 
               <br />
               suspend sterling conversion. Just so many years 
               <br />
               ago this would have been impossible and beyond 
               <br />
               our ability to correct. Today it appears in the light 
               <br />
               of ordinary business, nothing at all exceptional

               I believe to some extent were, by the business

               houses, they having the added advantage of being 
               <br />
               able to purchase English goods with sterling

               <br />
               regained her position in the export trade. Latest 
               <br />
               reports show her production to be increasing 
               <br />
               favourably. Added to this, there is a greater 
               <br />
               awareness in Canada and other countries of the 
               <br />
               necessity, for their own preservation, to increase 
               <br />
               their purchases from her, and that well describes 
               <br />
               our position too.

               One point relative to this subject warrants 
               <br />
               further comment and better understanding, and 
               <br />
               that is that when the government agreed to con- 
               <br />
               vert the sterling, no guarantee of the value the 
               <br />
               pound was made. At that time conversion was 
               <br />
               being negotiated on the basis of $4.03 for each 
               <br />
               pound sterling. It now appears that dollars will be 
               <br />
               made available only after sterling credits have 
               <br />
               been set up. This means that should the pound be 
               <br />
               further depreciated and is pegged at this artiﬁcial 
               <br />
               price, and subject to the whims of world ﬁnan-

               ciers, then the ﬁsherman or the exporter would 
               <br />
               get proportionately less for his ﬁsh. It would 
               <br />
               appear that conversion of the estimated dollar
