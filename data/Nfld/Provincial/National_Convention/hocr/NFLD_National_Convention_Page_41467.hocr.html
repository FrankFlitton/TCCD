               <br />
               was no way out. Nova Scotia appealed in vain to

               I will try to give a summary of the impact of 
               <br />
               the depression on Canada and her industries in 
               <br />
               the 1930 crisis. For the truth is, the whole 
               <br />
               economic life of Canada was dislocated by the 
               <br />
               industrial collapse. She was not alone. Following 
               <br />
               1930, Canadian currency in 1933 was inconver~ 
               <br />
               tible, like other currency. Then we had the perni- 
               <br />
               cious system of trade and exchange quotas that 
               <br />
               was strangling everything when the war brought 
               <br />
               it to a quick <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end.</span> Canada felt this to the full. First, 
               <br />
               because it still depends largely on exports from 
               <br />
               primary industries, like Newfoundland. The 
               <br />
               second reason she felt it was because, like New- 
               <br />
               foundland, she is exporting cash proﬁts out of the 
               <br />
               country because of the large amounts of foreign 
               <br />
               investments in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> It was estimated in 
               <br />
               1937 there was some $2,684,000,000 of British 
               <br />
               capital invested in Canada. This was held in ﬁxed 
               <br />
               obligations and in railway shares; besides this, 
               <br />
               there was $3,932,000,000 of American capital, 
               <br />
               held in common stocks, municipal bonds and 
               <br />
               investments in subsidiary companies. All in all, 
               <br />
               it represented a volume of interest payments, 
               <br />
               much of it contracted in the terms of foreign 
               <br />
               currency. This gave a total of $6,616,000,000 of 
               <br />
               foreign investment, which caused both <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem&lt;</span>

               this to the fore when people say Canada will 
               <br />
               invest money here. There is need for money in 
               <br />
               her own economy. Perhaps that is the reason, as 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy pointed out, that there is so little 
               <br />
               Canadian money invested here. They simply 
               <br />
               have not got it and they have furthered their own 
               <br />
               economy by handling our ﬁnances and insuran- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tive profession. In fact we have been a cow to get 
               <br />
               milked, and we have been milked very thorough- 
               <br />
               ly, and if this goes through we will be beefed as 
               <br />
               well. In coming back to this, I won’t go into the 
               <br />
               case of the individual John Doe Canadian citizen 
               <br />
               in this upheaval, but the farmers held out as best 
               <br />
               they could while new aid and relief, total or 
               <br />
               partial, extended to 870,000 persons in 1938. It 
               <br />
               took a war to wipe the slate clean, and I guess 
               <br />
               after the war a new slate will be wanted.

               Now I’ll come to the matter of the Canadian 
               <br />
               national debt. I shall not stress it. I think Major 
               <br />
               Cashin has done justice to that, but something has 
               <br />
               been left out. I agree with Mr. Smallwood that 
               <br />
               this is something that our people are afraid of. 
               <br />
               They have had some painful memories of nation- 
               <br />
               al debt and paying the interest on it. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has gone merrily along, telling us that 
               <br />
               it does not matter how large the national debt of 
               <br />
               Canada is, as it is held by Canadians. Strange to 
               <br />
               say, I agree with Mr. Smallwood to a point, that 
               <br />
               interest will circulate again in Canada when it is 
               <br />
               paid in Canada, but now I’m perplexed — how? 
               <br />
               Because if we go into confederation as new 
               <br />
               Canadians, with no bonds or very little bonds 
               <br />
               held here in Newfoundland, although we will 
               <br />
               shoulder our share of this debt, said to run from 
               <br />
               $900 per capita by the confederates to $1,500 per 
               <br />
               capita by the anticonfederates, how are we going 
               <br />
               to share in the cut of the interest take? Are we, 
               <br />
               after confederation, going to cut this island up in 
               <br />
               squares and fit the pieces into the nine provinces 
               <br />
               that hold the bonds? It seems to me Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood’s arguments are hogwash, for if we 
               <br />
               are a province, the money we send to pay the 
               <br />
               interest on the bonds in Canada will be just as far 
               <br />
               out of the island of Newfoundland and the 
               <br />
               Labrador as regards doing us any good, as the 
               <br />
               interest we send to England.

               Mr. Smallwood went to long lengths to
