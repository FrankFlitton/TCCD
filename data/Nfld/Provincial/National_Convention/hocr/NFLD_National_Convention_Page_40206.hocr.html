               at the Gander section you will see “the decision

               Gander is to us incomprehensible.” You will note 
               <br />
               that Mr. Neill was asked why the government 
               <br />
               made that decision cold—bloodedly, knowing it 
               <br />
               was going to cost $500,000 to $1 million loss 
               <br />
               merely to operate it; not counting the million for 
               <br />
               buying the installations; not counting the 
               <br />
               $300,000 for converting buildings to civilian use. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge I did not ask for that information. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know.</span> I was going to deal 
               <br />
               with it, if you have no objection. In addition to 
               <br />
               another $300,000 to buy still further equipment 
               <br />
               —— that is $1,600,000 on capital account since the 
               <br />
               war ended — on top of that to lose up to $1 
               <br />
               million a year; frankly I do not believe that the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government decided that in cold 
               <br />

               <br />
               a loss of $1 million a year. At the last session one

               categorically it was the first he heard of it. It was

               <br />

               government by the British; and he said it was the 
               <br />
               first he heard of it. When it was suggested to him 
               <br />
               that the British government was, in fact, footing 
               <br />
               the bills and paying the operating losses, he said 
               <br />
               it was the ﬁrst he heard of it. I say this, that I am

               very sorry we have not that privilege which 
               <br />

               <br />
               mind back to a year ago. The war was just about 
               <br />
               over, and the United States with a vast aircraft 
               <br />
               industry was ready to hurl a vast armada of pas- 
               <br />
               senger planes in the air, ready to seize control of 
               <br />
               the air trafﬁc of the world. Great Britain was not 
               <br />
               ready; we had no aircraft; she is not ready yet.

               <br />
               (I wish I could mention the name), that it would

               <br />
               Let’s work that down. That means that control 
               <br />
               over Gander was the great trump someone had up

               <br />

               bargain which Britain would be getting. There is 
               <br />
               the scandal. 1 find it not only incomprehensible, 
               <br />
               but beyond my power to believe. Now we find 
               <br />
               Mr. Neill said he had just recently, just a matter 
               <br />
               of days before, written a letter to the British 
               <br />
               government stating that, in his opinion. it was 
               <br />
               unthinkable that Newfoundland should be sad- 
               <br />
               dled with the operating losses of Gander. He had 
               <br />
               not gotten an answer. He was asked, “How long 
               <br />
               ago did you send it?” “Recently”, he said; and he 
               <br />
               added, “I made it a strong letter." He still has not 
               <br />
               gotten an answer... If they have saddled this 
               <br />
               country with a $1 million operating loss for the 
               <br />
               convenience of wealthy foreign airlines who 
               <br />
               operate up into millions a year — I find it un- 
               <br />
               believable — I do not believe it happened. If it 
               <br />
               did happen, instead of waiting for this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion to end sometime next year, before waiting 
               <br />
               for that, we ought to ﬁre out the government who 
               <br />
               did it, if they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did.</span> I am remembering I have no 
               <br />
               privilege — remembering it vividly. I find it 
               <br />
               impossible to believe that we are saddled with it. 
               <br />
               Out in Gander they have a trade union with 900 
               <br />
               members; another trade union with 100 members 
               <br />
               -— 1000 Newfoundlanders. They cannot live —— 
               <br />
               the cost of living is prohibitive. They got 10% 
               <br />
               increases, and since then the cost of living has 
               <br />
               eaten it up. Why? What is the game? Is it they 
               <br />
               cannot give more wages because we are saddled 
               <br />
