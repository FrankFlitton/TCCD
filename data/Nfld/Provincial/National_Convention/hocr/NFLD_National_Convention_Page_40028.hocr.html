               Honourable Mr. Wild came here in 1934 and 
               <br />
               occupied the important position of Comptroller 
               <br />

               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman there were many

               questions put on the paper yesterday relative to 
               <br />

               <br />
               and address this Convention, I feel that when he 
               <br />
               comes he should be prepared to give all the 
               <br />

               <br />
               has a great deal of that information ready. There

               Mr. Bradley Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the 
               <br />
               point made by Major Cashin, but another thought 
               <br />
               occurs to me: many of us are not so well ac- 
               <br />
               quainted with ﬁnancial matters as Major Cashin, 
               <br />
               and the sooner we can get some light the better. 
               <br />
               If Commissioner Wild can come tomorrow I 
               <br />
               believe he would have to speak to us for at least 
               <br />
               an hour, and there won’t be much time for Major 
               <br />
               Cashin to ask many questions, and in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mean»</span> 
               <br />
               time we can get some information. It might

               <br />

               <br />
               want him to be inconvenienced, and when he

               he can’t get it ready before the end of the week.

               <br />
               come tomorrow, but on other occasions. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Cashin I want it understood that if he is not 
               <br />
               prepared to come back the second time, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly when they don’t want to come before the 
               <br />
               public, the people here are entitled to every bit of 
               <br />
               information. The position the Commission has 
               <br />
               taken, is that they refuse to come before the 
               <br />
               public. Now on questions in the past I have gone 
               <br />
               through the ropes myself. When a question was 
               <br />
               directed towards a minister, the minister brought 
               <br />
               in a reply to that question, and if the answer did 
               <br />
               not suit the inquisitor, he questioned him further 
               <br />
               there on the ﬂoor of the House. I realise we have 
               <br />
               no right to subpoena people, but this is a different 
               <br />
               question. We are here to represent the people and 
               <br />
               they say, “we will only go up there privately”; 
               <br />
               and if we get information from them privately, 
               <br />
               the press, forinstance, cannot give it to the public. 
               <br />
               Now how are we to get it to the public? Are we 
               <br />
               to give it out as a kind of rumour? I contend that 
               <br />
               whilst we have no power to drag them here, every 
               <br />
               member of the Commission should come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before,</span> 
               <br />
               the Convention publicly. It creates more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁdence for themselves, because when the people 
               <br />
               ﬁnd out that they won‘t come publicly they feel, 
               <br />
               “Well, what has he to hide?” However, they have 
               <br />
               indicated they are not prepared to do that, so the 
               <br />
               next best thing is to get them before a committee 
               <br />
               of the Convention, but when that time arrives the 
               <br />
               questions, particularly these financial quesu'ons, 
               <br />
               have got to be answered properly. There is noth~ 
               <br />
               ing in it that is not in the public interest, and no 
               <br />
               excuses will be taken by me for any refusal to 
               <br />
               answer these questions... However, Mr. Wild
