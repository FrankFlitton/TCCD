               <br />
               tem is taken as one of the realities of the hour. 
               <br />
               During his recent speech outlining Britain’s new 
               <br />
               export targets, Sir Stafford Cripps said Britain 
               <br />
               would be forced into a large degree of bilateral 
               <br />
               trading, and in consequence bilateral balances of 
               <br />
               payments with various individual countries. The 
               <br />
               political arrangements that would result in one 
               <br />
               world seem as far away as ever. It will not be out 
               <br />
               of order if I relate such conclusions as may be 
               <br />
               drawn from the foregoing to the question of 
               <br />
               whether we are or are not self-supporting. It’s not 
               <br />
               so directed in our terms of reference that we 
               <br />
               should concern ourselves with that speciﬁc ques- 
               <br />
               tion, but the people have been led to expect us to 
               <br />
               come to some conclusion on the point, and that 
               <br />
               makes it a legitimate question for us to take into 
               <br />
               account. 
               <br />

               The question of whether or not we are self- 
               <br />
               supponing is one to which there are many facets. 
               <br />
               For the mostpart emphasis has currently been put 
               <br />
               upon the one side of the story, namely a balanced 
               <br />
               budget and a treasury surplus. It so happens that 
               <br />
               these things are not enough. Having considered 
               <br />
               the matter seriously, dispassionately and at 
               <br />
               length, I have come to the conclusion that I 
               <br />
               cannot honestly accept less than this minimum as 
               <br />
               evidence of self-support. We have come to where 
               <br />
               we can, out of our resources, provide ourselves 
               <br />
               with some view of the public and social services 
               <br />
               that are the proper inheritance of a western people 
               <br />
               in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arid-20th</span> century. It is little enough that 
               <br />
               we have advanced to, and no Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               will willingly see a single one of those services 
               <br />
               discontinued. And minimum evidence of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self</span> 
               <br />
               support is only this: reason to expect for a 
               <br />
               reasonable period of the future, gross national 
               <br />
               income of such dimension and distribution as will 
               <br />
               ensure a decent living for all Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               and leave them with enough over and to spare to 
               <br />
               maintain these services at not less than their 
               <br />
               present level. If any one of us wishes to contend 
               <br />
               that this last should not be attempted, maybe he 
               <br />
               would care to name for me which of the cottage 
               <br />
               hospitals he would close down if he were Mini- 
               <br />
               ster of Health in our new government.

               My emotions make me want to believe that the

               But neither is there any getting away from the fact 
               <br />
               that the future is loaded with a greater concentra-

               we and men everywhere have ever faced before.

               If next year the ﬁshery fails or we can’t sell fish, 
               <br />
               then we all know that many a family economy 
               <br />
               will go, out at the elbows and down at the heels 
               <br />
               overnight. It is all as simple as that. Fish in this 
               <br />
               island is still a matter of life or death. As things 
               <br />
               stand today, we find that our economy has 
               <br />
               received such ﬁllip as enables it to provide a 
               <br />
               luxury living for a few of us, a frugal living for 
               <br />
               some more of us, and a living on the margins of 
               <br />
               subsistence for the rest of us. We find the taxable 
               <br />
               capacity of our economy enhanced to such 
               <br />
               proportions as to be sufficient to defray the nor- 
               <br />
               mal costs of government, and yet finance a better 
               <br />
               number of public amenities and social services 
               <br />
               than ever before, even though the number be 
               <br />
               meager. And to whatever extent that may signify, 
               <br />
               we may not avoid the possibility of self-support. 
               <br />
               But it is, at its best, a hand-to-mouth self-suf—

               If these were normal times — the world is no

               would make a bulwark against economic regres-

               <br />
               of dollars and all the rest of it. i am not prepared

               <br />
               and social services we now know, or to accept as 
               <br />
               evidence of a condition of self-support less than 
               <br />
               some assurance that we can maintain those min-
