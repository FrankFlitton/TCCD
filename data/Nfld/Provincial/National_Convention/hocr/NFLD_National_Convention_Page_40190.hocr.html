               Mr. Vardy I wish it to be clearly understood that 
               <br />
               anything I say in reference to the Forestry Report 
               <br />
               is meant purely as constructive criticism with the 
               <br />
               idea of further extending or building it up and not 
               <br />
               with the idea of understanding the real value of 
               <br />
               what has been done either by the Committee or 
               <br />
               department concerned. Frankly, with the limited 
               <br />
               staff and lack of knowledge or interest displayed 
               <br />
               by the various Commissioners I consider the 
               <br />
               forestry branch has done a good job. Very few in 
               <br />
               this country have had a more personal contact 
               <br />
               with the forestry division than I have and I have 
               <br />
               always found them ready to hear any reasonable 
               <br />
               complaints or suggestions for the promotion of 
               <br />
               the industry or the conservation of our forests. It 
               <br />
               is not humanly possible for any group of ten men 
               <br />
               collectively to bring in a report for 45 to agree on 
               <br />
               every detail, it is the fundamental principles that 
               <br />
               count, and I am happy that most of the criticism is 
               <br />
               of a genuine constructive nature.

               It is alarming to find how little we have left of 
               <br />
               our natural resources which have not been 
               <br />

               <br />

               It is not correct to say that 200 saw mills are 
               <br />
               not paying any royalty because they saw less than 
               <br />
               10,000 feet annually. The facts are not one of the 
               <br />
               over 800 saw mills pay any royalty on the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               10,000 feet; but they all pay a license fee of $5 
               <br />
               per year for which they are allowed to saw up to 
               <br />
               10,000 feet. So in reality, the mill which only 
               <br />
               saws 5,000 feet pays a higher percentage of royal~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               to 100,000 feet. That is the true picture and in this 
               <br />
               respect the Committee is wrong.

               put the whole of these items I have mentioned at

               a very conservative estimate, apart from the 
               <br />

               <br />

               three or four thousand feet of wood put to the
