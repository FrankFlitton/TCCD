               us conclusively that Canada is on the hard dark

               this Convention as a body is not competent to

               deal with it. It is a matter for proper negotiation 
               <br />
               between two governments elected by the people 
               <br />
               of both countries.

               Again I state that this confederation issue has 
               <br />
               been deliberately engineered by both the 
               <br />
               Canadian government and the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment for the purpose of confusing the minds of 
               <br />
               our people in such a way as to convey to the world 
               <br />
               that we Newfoundlanders do not know what we 
               <br />
               want, what we really want in the form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment. People have come out from England during 
               <br />
               the past ﬁve or six years and went back, and said 
               <br />
               that we do not know what we want, and that is 
               <br />
               the way they want to keep us. It is a deﬁnite 
               <br />
               violation of the solemn pact made between the 
               <br />
               Government of Newfoundland and the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of the United Kingdom in 1933, and we as 
               <br />
               delegates to this National Convention have made 
               <br />
               ourselves parties to the violation of that agree— 
               <br />
               ment. Today, many of our people have forgotten 
               <br />
               about this agreement of 1933, but there are a great 
               <br />
               number of those who voted for that legislation in 
               <br />
               1933 still in this country, several of whom now 
               <br />
               occupy positions of trust in the service of New- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foundland.</span> I hold that these gentlemen who voted 
               <br />
               for that legislation in 1933 should now come 
               <br />
               forward in the interest of the country and give to 
               <br />
               our people the particulars of what happened at 
               <br />
               that time -—- what undertakings, if any, were 
               <br />
               given regarding the passing of this legislation I 
               <br />
               say, sir, that these gentlemen should come for-

               <br />

               they do not come forward, if they fail to do that, 
               <br />

               As I have stated before, the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               brought back no report to this Convention. The 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation has not been able to supply us 
               <br />
               with any deﬁnite or concrete replies to our 
               <br />
               numerous questions. There has been no effort by 
               <br />
               any other delegate of that delegation to enlighten 
               <br />
               us in any way with the exception of what we have 
               <br />
               been told by Mr. Smallwood. And even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Smallwood has admitted to the Convention and 
               <br />
               to the people of the country that these various 
               <br />
               estimates of expenditures and revenues were 
               <br />
               prepared for the Newfoundland delegation 
               <br />
               months before they arrived in Ottawa.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I have not. That is not true. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin We have not received any explana- 
               <br />
               tion of this from any other member of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation and we can only surmise that the Qt- 
               <br />
               tawa government had been supplied with various 
               <br />
               statistical information in advance by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Comv</span> 
               <br />
               mission <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> It is therefore apparent that 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation were acting more or less 
               <br />
               as a sort of international brokerage association on 
               <br />
               behalf of the Commission of Government. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Point of order. The Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation was sent to Ottawa by this Convention 
               <br />
               and acted for this Convention, not as agents of 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government. I ask him to take 
               <br />
               that back. If he is fair, he will retract that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The actual position is this: this 
               <br />
               Convention appointed and sent a delegation to 
               <br />
               Ottawa... Whether it did a good job or a bad one, 
               <br />
               two things are clear: 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               <br />
               circumscribed within the limits of fair comment. 
               <br />
               The status of the delegation was as agent of this 
               <br />
               Convention. It was the created representative of 
               <br />
               this Convention and nothing else in fact and in 
               <br />
               law, no amount of argument can convert it into
