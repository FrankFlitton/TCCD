               think that I am expressing myself too much, but 
               <br />
               in ordinary parliamentary procedure the Speaker 
               <br />
               was usually proposed by the Prime Minister and 
               <br />
               seconded in the House by the leader of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Op»</span> 
               <br />
               position, and was elected unanimously. If we 
               <br />
               decided to elect a man to become Chairman who 
               <br />
               is a member of this Convention, I think, sir, that 
               <br />
               no member would take the job unless he had the 
               <br />
               unanimous backing of every member, and if we 
               <br />
               can’t arrive at that decision then the only thing to 
               <br />
               do is throw it back on the government, and let 
               <br />
               them appoint someone from the Court or else- 
               <br />
               where. I am prepared to take the chance and 
               <br />
               suggest that this Convention suggest to the 
               <br />
               government that the act be amended to cover the 
               <br />
               appointmentof one of our delegates as Chairman, 
               <br />
               and that delegate would undoubtedly retain his 
               <br />
               vote. No man here would want to be Chairman 
               <br />
               and lose his vote. After all he is elected by the 
               <br />
               people and would want to vote on a matter of vital 
               <br />
               importance.

               Mr. Ashbourne I don‘t think it would be right

               have a member of our own Convention as a

               the point of a Supreme Courtjudge, if Mr. Winter 
               <br />
               appoints himself to the bench, as he has every 
               <br />
               right to do, we will have on the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               bench two judges who were ex-commissioners, 
               <br />
               one the Chief Justice and the other Mr. Winter 
               <br />
               himself. It seems to me that it would be wrong to 
               <br />
               have as Chairman of the Convention an ex- 
               <br />
               commissioner, an ex-member of the government 
               <br />
               which, amongst other forms of government, have 
               <br />
               to be reviewed by the Convention. That leaves 
               <br />
               only one Supreme Court judge, namely Judge 
               <br />
               Dunﬁeld. He, in addition to being a judge, is 
               <br />
               chairman of the Housing Corporation, a very 
               <br />
               large outfit which takes up just about every spare 
               <br />
               minute of his time when he is not doing court 
               <br />
               work, and I have heard a rumour to the effect that 
               <br />
               it is these two difficulties, ﬁrst that two of the 
               <br />
               judges would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eXucommissioners,</span> and second 
               <br />
               that the only remaining judge is also extremely 
               <br />
               busy apart from his court work, which promoted 
               <br />
               in the government the thought that perhaps the 
               <br />
               wisest thing to do would to be repeal the clause 
               <br />
               requiring a Supreme Court judge to be chairman. 
               <br />
               If we look around the town and around the 
               <br />
               country to ﬁnd someone who is capable of being 
               <br />
               Chairman, and in addition to being capable, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will“</span>
