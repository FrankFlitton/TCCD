               of taxation. Often the franchise to run a railway 
               <br />
               is worth something to the government that carries 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               cannot get out of the 1938 act and the 1944 act in 
               <br />
               regard to mining? Let us suppose, for the sake of 
               <br />
               argument, that the government has made a 
               <br />

               act they will get nothing. Now along they come

               that question, because i was going to raise it too, 
               <br />
               with a definite object in mind. if this railway is 
               <br />
               going to be a transportation company owned by 
               <br />
               the mining company and hauling their ore out, the 
               <br />
               haulage charges could be very great indeed with 
               <br />
               a consequent loss, or very little proﬁt out of the 
               <br />
               mining end of it, and our 5% on that might be very 
               <br />
               little. I can appreciate that any company going 
               <br />
               into an investment or gamble such as this must be 
               <br />
               assured of a certain proﬁt but it strikes me that 
               <br />
               this quotation referring to Lake Superior was six 
               <br />
               cents, which was the low. 1 notice they don’t give 
               <br />
               what the high would be. The way it seems it might 
               <br />
               be a bit of a red herring drawn across the deal. 
               <br />
               The inference that I get from the report is that the 
               <br />
               present company could not possibly operate 
               <br />
               under the agreement, and they would have to 
               <br />
               withdraw if a different form of royalty could not 
               <br />
               be worked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out.</span> The inference is that they would 
               <br />
               not be making the 10 cents proﬁt. Let us assume 
               <br />
               that they were going to make 6 cents on it. Further 
               <br />
               on, in the letter Mr. Timmins states that there 
               <br />
               should be a known quantity of at least 300 million 
               <br />
               tons, of which they will take out a minimum of 5 
               <br />
               million tons a year. If they take out 30 million 
               <br />
               tons they will make a proﬁt of $l8 million over 
               <br />
               a period of six years. That, on the original <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">investv</span> 
               <br />
               ment, would bring it about 11/2% proﬁt per year 
               <br />
               as a return on their investment. I can‘t believe 
               <br />
               they are going into it with that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">profit,</span> They have 
               <br />
               got to see a return on their investment, and I can’t
