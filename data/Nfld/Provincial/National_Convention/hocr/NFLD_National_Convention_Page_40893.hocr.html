               Mr. Smallwood I am familiar with the first 
               <br />
               point. I attended meetings of the Board of 
               <br />
               Transport Commissioners. Some friends of 
               <br />
               yours, Mr. Chairman, were participating as coun- 
               <br />
               sel for the various provinces they represented. 
               <br />
               One morning Mr. Higgins, Mr. Bradley and 
               <br />
               myself went up and attended the hearings of the 
               <br />
               railways who are applying to have their freight 
               <br />
               rates increased. They are applying to the Board 
               <br />
               for 30% increase ‘across the board’ as they call 
               <br />
               it. I attended day after day. It was never done. I 
               <br />
               am not saying it could not be done. All over North 
               <br />

               <br />
               Freight Rates Act. There has been 20% reduction 
               <br />
               on freight rates in the Maritime region, which is 
               <br />
               east of Lévis; but there has never been the 
               <br />
               slightest hint or suggestion of the abolition of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Freight Rates Act. Mr. Hickman is 
               <br />
               right, they have been trying to get an increase in 
               <br />
               freight rates. But the Maritime Freight Rates Act 
               <br />
               is there; it is a statutory act. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman It has been on the carpet for some 
               <br />
               time and I note from the papers that the question 
               <br />
               is up again of a 30% increase, and it specifically 
               <br />
               mentioned also the cancellation of the subsidy to 
               <br />
               the Maritimes. I do not know if that means the 
               <br />
               cancellation of the Maritime Freight Rates Act. 
               <br />
               This came up for decision since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood 
               <br />
               was in Ottawa. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Now I know what he is refer- 
               <br />
               ring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.</span> The Maritime Freight Rates Act is one 
               <br />
               thing; that is statutory. What Mr. Hickman is 
               <br />
               referring to is the subsidy paid on grains. There 
               <br />
               are two subsidies. All feeds, all animal and 
               <br />
               poultry feed grains from the Prairie provinces 
               <br />
               going into the Pacific coast and Atlantic coast are 
               <br />
               hauled freight-free... I do not want to anticipate 
               <br />
               it; but when it comes, that is to be applied to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as well. In addition to that, there 
               <br />
               has been something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">else.</span> During the war the 
               <br />
               government has paid the Prairie grain growers a 
               <br />
               subsidy of so much a bushel and the subsidy was 
               <br />
               to encourage them to grow the things that the 
               <br />
               government wanted to be grown during the war. 
               <br />
               They have now taken that off. But as to the 
               <br />
               hauling of it down through the Maritimes, it is 
               <br />
               hauled freight-free. Mr. Hickman is referring to 
               <br />
               the taking off of the subsidy given the Prairie 
               <br />
               provinces. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman I was referring to the subsidy on 
               <br />
               freight to the Maritimes on grains and other items 
               <br />
               you mentioned. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill On page 691 — I am not sure there 
               <br />
               is an error; but it says “It is noted that the staff of 
               <br />
               the railway at the present time numbers 2,990 and 
               <br />
               of the steamers 761, a total of 3,751”. I would
