               we directed at it. I can well understand Hon. Mr.

               Job’ s endeavour to get tariff concessions from the 
               <br />
               USA for our fish and ﬁsh products, and can 
               <br />
               assure Mr. Job that every member of this Con-

               <br />
               us must agree with the attitude taken by the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government, that the question is 
               <br />
               the active concern of the government of the day; 
               <br />
               who further point out and rightly so, that since in 
               <br />
               April of this year representatives of the majority 
               <br />
               of states forming the United Nations will meet at 
               <br />
               Geneva to discuss the formation of an intema-

               <br />
               ment on tariff and trade questions, it is scarcely 
               <br />
               likely that at this time a participating state would 
               <br />
               entertain proposals for separate tariff arrange-

               Turning now to clause three of the resolution 
               <br />
               and report thereon, it appears that the Commis-

               sion of Government would be prepared to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out from the Government of Canada whether the

               <br />

               that these are matters entirely for discussion be-

               <br />
               fail to see how any fair and equitable basis for

               Everyone in this country is familiar by now with

               the implications of his several recommendations.

               We have had a dozen years under their benign

               chieﬂy wish to refer will be found in section 634, 
               <br />
               subsection 4(g) and it reads as follows: “It would 
               <br />
               be understood that, as soon as the Island’s dif~ 
               <br />
               ﬁculties are overcome and the country is again

               quest from the people of Newfoundland, would 
               <br />
               be restored”. Up to a year or so ago, few people 
               <br />
               if any in this country ever doubted that promise. 
               <br />
               On the 17 February, 1934, the new Letters Patent
