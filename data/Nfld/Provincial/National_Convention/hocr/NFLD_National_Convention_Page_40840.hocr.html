               to the great possibilities of the Labrador. I asked 
               <br />
               what authority they had for saying that the Grand

               Mr. Cashin We got the survey from the files of 
               <br />
               the Department of Natural Resources. The survey 
               <br />
               was made by the Aluminum Company of Canada 
               <br />
               in 1941. It was nearly developed in 1940-41, and 
               <br />
               it was unfortunate it was not. When the 
               <br />
               Aluminum Company at Arvida went down to 
               <br />
               survey it, they were seriously contemplating it for 
               <br />
               the production of aluminum and other products. . .. 
               <br />
               It was held under agreement with the Labrador 
               <br />
               Mining Company. Undoubtedly an agreement 
               <br />
               could have been made. I was told that by the 
               <br />
               General Manager of the Royal Bank of Canada. 
               <br />
               That is my authority. It may not all be developed 
               <br />
               at once. When the mine is developed within ten 
               <br />
               years, we are informed, it will produce 10 million 
               <br />
               tons in ten years, probably more. They have to 
               <br />
               have water-power to run the railway, they are not 
               <br />
               going to run it on coal... I think the Committee 
               <br />
               felt justiﬁed in saying the water~power on the 
               <br />
               Labrador would be developed.

               Mr. Northcott wanted to know why the sub- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland took over the railway in 1923; up 
               <br />
               to that time the Reid Newfoundland Company 
               <br />
               had been operating the railway, though the 
               <br />
               government had been ﬁnancing it from 1920 or 
               <br />
               1921. Once the government took over the railway 
               <br />
               ofﬁcially, all subsidies were cancelled. I was a

               connection with this mercantile <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">marine...</span> The 
               <br />
               Amulree Report recommended that we should 
               <br />
               have a merchant marine, since we were shipping 
               <br />
               a lot of money out of the country annually. Now 
               <br />
               how much money does go out of the country on 
               <br />
               freights, etc.? Today we must have a gross busi- 
               <br />
               ness of some $70 million in and out, and I ﬁgure 
               <br />
               that at least 10% of that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freight...</span> That means 
               <br />
               $7 million a year in freight. How much of that 
               <br />
               goes out of the country today? Today we have 
               <br />
               nine or ten Clarenville ships which cost a lot of 
               <br />
               money, and now they are employing a lot of men 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland. We have two freighters, the 
               <br />
               Random and the Rockﬁeld Park. They employ 
               <br />
               about 50 Newfoundlanders between the two of 
               <br />
               them, and the other ships have ten men each. 
               <br />
               That’s only 140 seamen in the mercantile marine, 
               <br />
               apart from small ships that are operated by some 
               <br />
               local mercantile firms in the city who, I am glad 
               <br />
               to say, are going into the business further... Our 
               <br />
               suggestion of a mercantile marine is one of the 
               <br />
               best things in our Economic Report because, 
               <br />
               apart from the employment it will give, it will 
               <br />
               keep money in our country and keep our seamen 
               <br />
               employed. 1 am prepared to back a mercantile 
               <br />
               marine tomorrow if we had the necessary funds 
               <br />
               to do so, and I feel that we should have a mercan- 
               <br />
               tile marine. If a private outfit wants to buy it let 
               <br />
               them buy it, or let the government guarantee the 
               <br />
               money and take a mortgage on the ship, or estab- 
               <br />
               lish one of their own under a Crown company.
