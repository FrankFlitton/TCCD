               I contend that this resolution should not have 
               <br />
               been brought in at this time, ﬁrstly because it has 
               <br />
               sown the seed of distrust and misunderstanding 
               <br />
               among the members of this Convention when 
               <br />
               they should be working in harmony toward the 
               <br />
               completion of the ﬁrst and most vital task, the 
               <br />

               eclipse the facts that should be given careful 
               <br />
               study at this time. I feel that if there are people in 
               <br />
               this country interested in confederation, and if we 
               <br />
               believe in democracy, we must at the proper time 
               <br />
               give them the opportunity to express their desires. 
               <br />
               I think that had Mr. Smallwood awaited a more 
               <br />
               opportune time, and introduced his resolution in 
               <br />
               a different spirit, there could have been little 
               <br />
               reasonable opposition.

               gave me a clear mandate to vote according to the 
               <br />
               facts as I saw them. I went through that same 
               <br />
               district in 1932 as a strictly independent can—

               interruption or a sarcastic question in my whole

               <br />

               to clarify the issue and enlighten the public as far
