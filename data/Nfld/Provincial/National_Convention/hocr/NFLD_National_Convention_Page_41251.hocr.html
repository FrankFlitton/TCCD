               bait for ﬁshing, which services we agree meet the 
               <br />
               real need in this country and which I am afraid 
               <br />
               are threatened. The actual position is that the 
               <br />
               federal government does not operate or maintain 
               <br />
               any bait depot in Canada, or supply bait. Wishing 
               <br />
               to be sure on this point, I sought and obtained this 
               <br />
               information from two of Canada’s largest ﬁshing 
               <br />
               provinces — namely British Columbia and Nova 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia.</span> And I am sure Mr. Smallwood will agree, 
               <br />
               what the federal government does for one 
               <br />
               province, it must do for all. If the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment is not supplying bait for British Columbia 
               <br />
               and Nova Scotia, the federal government will not 
               <br />
               supply bait for the Province of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Both in Nova Scotia and British Columbia the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen have to buy their own bait from private 
               <br />
               operators, or catch and store it themselves. Those 
               <br />
               items mentioned in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194748,</span> $238,000. Now let 
               <br />
               us turn to item 9 —- erection of new bait depots. 
               <br />
               This is not paid for by the federal government in 
               <br />
               any province, and cost in 1947-48, $294,000. 
               <br />
               Item 11 — alteration and extension to existing 
               <br />
               bait depots, $30,000. This also is not a federal 
               <br />
               charge. In other words, we have roughly 
               <br />
               $562,000 excluded in this preposterous budget. 
               <br />
               Our ﬁshermen are to do without free services. 
               <br />
               Can they afford to do without them? The answer 
               <br />
               is clear —— no. The position therefore is this: we 
               <br />
               actually have expenses in these items alone totall- 
               <br />
               ing $562,000, for which nothing has been 
               <br />
               provided in Mr. Smallwood’s budget. So either 
               <br />
               we have a deﬁcit of $562,000 or we go without 
               <br />
               ﬁsh <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">services.</span> Such a thought to me is fantastic 
               <br />
               and unthinkable under any form of government 
               <br />
               this country might have. Mr. Chairman, if the 
               <br />
               record of ﬁgures, and the estimates of expendi- 
               <br />
               ture and revenue of the provincial budget, are as 
               <br />
               far astray as these are, then it follows the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               of other estimates of the same sort are just as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unreliable.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Some months ago I made the statement that 
               <br />
               sooner or later our American friends would be 
               <br />
               obliged to come to this country for their ﬁsh 
               <br />
               supply. Many people, I know, did not believe 
               <br />
               this. But today, much sooner then suspected, my 
               <br />
               forecast has come true. Last Monday, two 
               <br />
               trawlers with a crew of 18 men each sailed 
               <br />
               from St. John’s on their ﬁrst ﬁshing voyage from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland —— under the ﬂag of the United 
               <br />

               Kingdom Until a very short time ago, these 
               <br />
               splendid boats were sailing from the United 
               <br />
               States under the flag of Atlantic coast ﬁshermen. 
               <br />
               But due to many circumstances with WhiCh I am 
               <br />
               not familiar, they are now here. And in my 
               <br />
               opinion, they are the forerunners of many more 
               <br />
               -— if, and I say if, this country is permitted to run 
               <br />
               her own affairs. Now you might say, what do I 
               <br />
               mean by this? Well, in a nutshell it is this. Let us 
               <br />
               turn again to the federal government. In Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and other provinces, a licence is required 
               <br />
               before trawlers can be used. To obtain these 
               <br />
               licences, application must be made to the federal 
               <br />
               Minister of Fisheries himself at Ottawa. Now the 
               <br />
               Minister of Fisheries in Ottawa is a very busy 
               <br />
               man and has many pressing problems for his 
               <br />
               attention. He may not have time to consider im- 
               <br />
               mediately a request from Newfoundland for a 
               <br />
               licence to operate trawlers and draggers, and 
               <br />
               unintentionally the opportunity to progress is 
               <br />
               gone or delayed indeﬁnitely. Again, we all know 
               <br />
               New England interests are already coming to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in preference to Canada. Now is 
               <br />
               it likely that the Minister of Fisheries at Ottawa 
               <br />
               is going to issue licences to Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               operate trawlers etc., if pressure is brought to bear 
               <br />
               by Nova Scotia to have the business placed there? 
               <br />
               Of course he won’t, in my opinion. Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               is far more important politically then we are. So 
               <br />
               right away we run the risk of losing to one of our 
               <br />
               keenest competitors. Gentlemen, it is neither 
               <br />
               feasible or sensible for this country to have 
               <br />
               remote control. We have it now under Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government. Are we to trade one remote 
               <br />
               control system for another? It has taken Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia a lifetime, practically, to obtain a licence 
               <br />
               to operate six trawlers and eight draggers, which 
               <br />
               is all that operates from there today. Dr. Douglas 
               <br />
               1. Cooper, Director of Fisheries for the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Industry for Nova Scotia asked if they 
               <br />
               were going to expand to the limit of exploitation 
               <br />
               and were they going to modernise to the limit, or 
               <br />
               were they going to perish? Gentlemen, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia is now a case of progress or failure. There 
               <br />
               are three reasons for this situation. One, failure to 
               <br />
               recognise the ﬁshery as a whole was changing 
               <br />
               from saltﬁsh to fresh. Two, high taxation result— 
               <br />
               ing from the war. Three, the McLean Commis- 
               <br />
               sion decision condemning the use of modern 
               <br />
