               Consider the possibilities if such a position

               obtained in this country, if we adopted the stand-

               <br />
               for the Christmas recess, we were debating 
               <br />
               another section of the report of the Transportation 
               <br />
               and Communications Committee, namely the 
               <br />
               tourist trade. Consider what a boost such an in- 
               <br />
               novation in our railway system would mean to 
               <br />
               the growth of a great tourist trade. People from

               <br />
               railway cars until they reached their destination 
               <br />
               in whatever part of Newfoundland they desired 
               <br />
               to reach. Apart from that big consideration, there 
               <br />
               would be the added advantages of speed in 
               <br />
               transportation, so necessary in the world today.

               Travel time across the island could be cut to half 
               <br />
               the time, and less, for the trains could travel at

               twice their highest speed (40 mph) and more, 
               <br />
               without the danger of running off the rails. Bigger

               This may sound a triﬂe ambitious to some of

               to the future that we are looking. No matter how 
               <br />
               many roads we build, including a cross-country 
               <br />
               highway, we are still going to need a railroad, at 
               <br />
               least for another 50 to 100 years, unless the 
               <br />
               atomic energy commission can work out a speedy

               <br />
               other countries the roads did not supplant the 
               <br />
               railways, and there’s no reason to suppose it will 
               <br />
               happen here.

               Therefore, when I see and note that it is in the 
               <br />
               minds and plans of the Railway management to 
               <br />
               re-rail the main line, and purchase new locomo-

               <br />
               asking the question that has always bothered me 
               <br />
               in relation to the railway, “What about the stand— 
               <br />
               ard-gauge?” Has the Railway management given 
               <br />
               serious thought to the matter of introducing the 
               <br />
               standard gauge in this country? I have no doubt 
               <br />
               it has been thought about a lot, but has it been 
               <br />
               given serious thought? Have the whys and

               come when this matter must be considered if we 
               <br />
               are to make the progress we desire to make. It is 
               <br />
               not enough for someone, even someone in this 
               <br />
               Convention to get up and say the whole thing is 
               <br />
               impossible, prohibitive, and to raise a number of 
               <br />
               apparently insuperable obstacles. This is not 
               <br />
               meant to be critical of governments, past or 
               <br />

               <br />
               shared by many others. I make therefore no apol-

               ogy for these few comments, for our deliberations 
               <br />
               concern the future; they concern the costs of 
               <br />
               government in the future; they concern the costs 
               <br />
               of public utilities like the Railway, and whenever 
               <br />
               the costs are discussed, we should make every 
               <br />
               effort to see if the country is getting, and is going 
               <br />
               to get the maximum results from them.

               I can understand that neither Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               nor his Committee may be in a position to answer 
               <br />
               this question, nor prepared to discuss it; but I feel 
               <br />
               that the Convention should take note of it. If we 
               <br />
               are to spend some millions of dollars in the next 
               <br />
               few years to re—rail our main railway line, surely 
               <br />
               to goodness we might just as well go a little 
               <br />
               farther and adopt the standard gauge... I am 
               <br />
               hoping that my remarks may be termed a con- 
               <br />
               structive suggestion that may serve to bring this 
               <br />
               important matter more into the public gaze, 
               <br />
               where they can attempt to appraise the situation 
               <br />
               and express their views on the matter also...

               Mr. Smallwoocl Contrary to Mr. Harrington’s 
               <br />
               guess, the Committee did go into that very matter. 
               <br />
               When we met in the office of the General 
               <br />
               Manager of the Railway, that very question of 
               <br />
               narrow gauge versus standard gauge was dis— 
               <br />
               cussed. The difficulty is bridges; there are many 
               <br />
               between St. John’s and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Portvaux-Basques,</span> which 
               <br />
               were made to accommodate narrow gauge and 
               <br />
               would not now accommodate standard gauge. 
               <br />
               Not only would you have to replace the rolling 
               <br />
               stock, but the bridges. Consider what is involved 
               <br />
               in the replacing of rolling stock... All that would 
               <br />
               have to go as well as nearly all the existing 
               <br />
               bridges along the main line. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The main advantage would be in connection 
               <br />
               with the tourist trade. I, too, would like to see the

               Gulf crossed regularly by train ferry service. A
