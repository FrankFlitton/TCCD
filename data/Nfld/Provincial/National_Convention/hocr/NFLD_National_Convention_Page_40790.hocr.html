               Mr. Miller Yes, sir. Suppose we take a look at 
               <br />
               what Canada is doing under very similar cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> too, is an exporting country. 
               <br />
               In fact she is referred to as great exporting 
               <br />
               country. Turning our eyes to Great Britain, she 
               <br />
               too found it difﬁcult to market her produce due 
               <br />
               to the limited dollar credit available to the old 
               <br />
               country. And if the people of Britain had decided 
               <br />
               to tighten their belts another hitch, which inciden- 
               <br />
               tally they do willingly in their country’s interest, 
               <br />
               then we’d be buying Canadian bacon in New- 
               <br />
               foundland at a very low ﬁgure. However, Britain 
               <br />
               continued its collective purchasing and relied on 
               <br />
               currency control to reinstate her position, and 
               <br />
               Canada realising this decided there and then to 
               <br />
               reduce, curtail to the very skeleton of its agree- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and increase its trade with Britain. This was done 
               <br />
               of necessity to protect Canadian exports to Great 
               <br />
               Britain which amounted in the ﬁrst half of the 
               <br />
               present year to $352 million. What the loss of this 
               <br />
               market would have meant to the Canadian farmer 
               <br />
               can be best appreciated by the Newfoundland

               ﬁsherman when he remembers the uneasy time 
               <br />
               he has just passed through. True, Canada con-

               <br />
               porting country. All this gives little credence to 
               <br />
               Canada’s economic nationhood. And I’m glad,

               Mr. Chairman, that we too assist Canada in no

               Newfoundland’s balance of payments posi-

               <br />
               statistical material. The net balance of trade was 
               <br />
               positive throughout the thirties but the gains from 
               <br />
               the visible trade were more than offset by in- 
               <br />
               visible imports. During the war the balance of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               amounted to $77 million US. This money should 
               <br />
               directly be held in Newfoundland as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span>
