               Mr. Cashin To my mind that order should have 
               <br />
               been placed in Newfoundland. With regard to 
               <br />
               exchange, they have it right here. We pay them 
               <br />
               $3.25 million interest in sinking fund on our 
               <br />
               sterling debt. Consequently if they felt like giving 
               <br />
               us that order, it would not involve purchasing 
               <br />
               dollars in Great Britain; it would mean paying the 
               <br />
               interest and we in turn here would pay the dollars 
               <br />
               over to the ﬁsh exporters who supply the ﬁsh for 
               <br />
               that order. In my opinion that is a very ﬂimsy 
               <br />
               excuse for not buying fresh fish in New- 
               <br />

               I understand there were a few men — returned 
               <br />
               soldiers from the US --— who came here in a 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               from St. John’s or from Newfoundland, she had

               <br />
               Customs to sail for Halifax. Their intention was 
               <br />
               to bring in the seals and manufacture them and

               <br />
               I think six or seven years ago when Norwegians 
               <br />
               came out they were refused clearance — they 
               <br />

               Mr. Harrington The Fisheries Report has now 
               <br />
               been debated for 22 hours and 1 do not propose 
               <br />
               to keep it on the carpet much longer. There were 
               <br />
               a couple of points which struck me. On page 39 
               <br />
               — referring to the local consumption of ﬁsh in 
               <br />
               1946, 68.760 quintals worth almost $1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> 
               <br />
               The average family is given as 4.5, that makes 25 
               <br />
               pounds of ﬁsh per person per year, less than a half 
               <br />
               pound a week. We are a great race of fishermen 
               <br />
               but we do not each much of it. There is an 
               <br />
               argument there for a strong campaign of “Eat 
               <br />
               more ﬁsh" ora “National Fish Week“. lfthe local 
               <br />
               consumption amounts to $1 million in 1946, I see 
               <br />
               no reason why we would not be persuaded to 
               <br />
               treble that or double it, which would mean some- 
               <br />
               thing.

               On page 44 — this matter of centralisation. If 
               <br />
               this country has a problem, this is it. We have 
               <br />
               heard a lot of talk about it, most of the delegates 
               <br />
               know about it at ﬁrst hand. I am representing St. 
               <br />
               John’s but I have travelled a great deal of the 
               <br />
               coast ~— I have been on most of it. I have seen 
               <br />
               some of the places where our people live; I tell 
               <br />
               you it goes to your heart sometimes, it does to 
               <br />
               mine, what they have to do without, living in 
               <br />
               those places! There is a big argument there for 
               <br />
               this business of roads (which caused a lot of 
               <br />
               controversy). I am not taking sides; if it is a case 
               <br />
               of removing isolation, then by all means we 
               <br />
               should see what we can do about it. But 1 do not 
               <br />
               believe in this business of roads alone, just to link 
               <br />
               up all settlements. No government can possibly 
               <br />
               do that or attempt to do it. Mr. Vincent has 
               <br />
               referred to centralisation several times. I strongly 
               <br />
               support the idea. We have to get our people 
               <br />
               together into large communities or we are not 
               <br />
               going to get anywhere under any form of govern~
