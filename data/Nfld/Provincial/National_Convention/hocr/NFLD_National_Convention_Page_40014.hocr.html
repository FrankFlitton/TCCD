               <br />
               for this occasion in view of the epoch-making 
               <br />
               nature of this unique constitutional assembly. For 
               <br />
               history is being made today as well as yesterday, 
               <br />
               and Mr. Job is very much a part of that history. 
               <br />
               He is one of the few living members of the former 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, which in this very building 
               <br />
               less than a score of years ago made laws for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders. Further— 
               <br />
               more, two or three years past, when comment on 
               <br />
               our confused status was frequent, Mr. Job in 
               <br />
               communications to the daily press suggested a 
               <br />
               body somewhat similar to the present National 
               <br />
               Convention to discuss our affairs; and it must be 
               <br />
               a source of pride and satisfaction to him now to 
               <br />
               realise that his suggestions undoubtedly had 
               <br />
               some, if not considerable bearing on subsequent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">developments</span> Finally, Mr. Job comes from a 
               <br />
               family long associated with the life of this 
               <br />
               country in all its phases and aspects; he himself 
               <br />
               speaks with the wisdom of many years of the 
               <br />
               same experience and the sincerity of his words on 
               <br />
               this occasion cannot be questioned.

               For myself, I speak as a young man relatively 
               <br />

               My family too has had long associations with 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Their part may have been less 
               <br />
               Spectacular, but nonetheless heroic. They were 
               <br />
               the good ﬁshermen and farmers, tradesmen and 
               <br />
               sailors, the good wives and the good mothers. 
               <br />
               They worked hard for what they got; they loved 
               <br />
               this land for the work it gave them, and the

               each man here fall into one of these two groups. 
               <br />
               Now the wheel has come full circle and we are

               here to serve their memory.

               A moment ago I said history is being made 
               <br />
               today. It prompts me to wonder if men who make 
               <br />
               history truly realise it at the time. I doubt if they 
               <br />
               do for such a realisation is almost enough to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unmanthem.</span> Still, whether we realise it or not, 
               <br />
               history is being made and it will continue to be 
               <br />
               made when this Convention has been disbanded 
               <br />

               <br />
               of history, for good or ill, and for the inspiration

               Newfoundlanders have lived under many ad- 
               <br />
               ministrations and many forms of constitutional 
               <br />
               assemblies, but search as we may, we can find no 
               <br />
               precedent for the present body of which we are 
               <br />
               members. Yet that fact which may have been a 
               <br />
               concern to some of us, need not be a deterrent; 
               <br />
               for even the most conservative man will admit 
               <br />
               there must be a ﬁrst time for everything. Inas- 
               <br />
               much as a man, according to Warburg, “cannot 
               <br />
               be a conservative until he has something to lose," 
               <br />
               I might say, perhaps, that a man cannot be other 
               <br />
               things until he has something to gain. And I say, 
               <br />
               let no man in this house be swayed by the thought 
               <br />
               of what he may lose or gain at this most critical 
               <br />
               juncture of our history.

               knowledge of days that are past, and young men 
               <br />
               like myself, whose knowledge for the most part 
               <br />
               is conﬁned to what we have read and heard. There 
               <br />
               are men here who have been in government, and 
               <br />
               men who hope to be in it in the future. There are 
               <br />
               men here who cleave to certain ideas and turn 
               <br />
               away from other beliefs, and Walter Lippman 
               <br />
               remarks that “Men are much more likely to see 
               <br />
               the truth in that which they love than in that which 
               <br />
               they hate.” Therefore there is need for calmness 
               <br />
               and unprejudice; for patience and tolerance. 
               <br />
               What we need to bring to this Convention, more 
               <br />
               than an open mind, is a fair mind that will respect
