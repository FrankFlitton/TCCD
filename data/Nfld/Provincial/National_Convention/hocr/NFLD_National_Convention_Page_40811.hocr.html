               perfectly well that 90% of these homes are not 
               <br />
               equipped with the conveniences and comforts 
               <br />
               that people of this age and generation have come 
               <br />
               to expect. A great number of these homes are not 
               <br />
               equipped with furniture that might be described 
               <br />
               as the chesterfield suite, on which the breadwin- 
               <br />
               ner might be able to recline at the end of the day 
               <br />
               to rest his weary bones, or even on a Sunday 
               <br />
               afternoon. A lot of the furniture are hard—backed 
               <br />
               chairs, home-made couches; not only that, the 
               <br />
               kitchen range is still the Waterloo stove in a lot 
               <br />
               of them. I could take members of this Convention 
               <br />
               to homes where there are not even hard-backed 
               <br />
               chairs, but packing cases to sit on, and where 
               <br />
               stoves are still strung together with wire and 
               <br />
               sometimes local cement or mud. These are iso- 
               <br />
               lated cases perhaps, but yet they are cases we 
               <br />
               have to recognise. It was also said that even if our 
               <br />
               people do not make very much money, they do 
               <br />
               not need as much money as other people — they 
               <br />
               are able to get their own fuel by their own labour. 
               <br />
               That was true in my day, in our childhood days 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perhaps.</span> But it is not true in larger sections of our 
               <br />
               country, unless the man is willing to take a haul- 
               <br />
               ing rope on his back when the early snow comes 
               <br />
               in the fall and use it throughout the long winter 
               <br />
               months; then he might be able to do it, by hauling 
               <br />
               wood from long distances. There are very few 
               <br />
               places where ﬁrewood can be obtained without 
               <br />
               putting in the whole winter, and I am sure we are 
               <br />
               not prepared to have our people do that and say 
               <br />
               it is the justiﬁed and right thing for them to 
               <br />
               expect.

               I do not want to take up any more time on this 
               <br />
               debate. There are several things in the report I 
               <br />
               would like to call attention to, but the time is 
               <br />
               rapidly going I would like to know where they 
               <br />
               get their authority for some of the things that they 
               <br />
               have quoted here, especially the picture they have 
               <br />
               built up with respect to the Labrador Mining and 
               <br />
               Exploration Company’s work in Labrador and its 
               <br />
               possibilities for the future. I have always had an 
               <br />
               optimistic view of that future, but they have 
               <br />
               outdone me in my optimism. I wonder where they 
               <br />
               get some of the ﬁgures when they give this in- 
               <br />
               flated picture. It seems to me it is a proposition 
               <br />
               of great magnitude and we certainly hope it will 
               <br />
               mean a lot to the economy of this country and to 
               <br />
               Labrador. I wonder what they mean when they 
               <br />
               say, “Upwards of 10,000 Newfoundlanders and 
               <br />
               Labradorians will be able to ﬁnd employment in 
               <br />

               the production of iron ore".... It seems rather 
               <br />
               optimistic for them to say, “It further means, that 
               <br />
               the great Grand Falls water-power will finally be 
               <br />
               developed and from statistics shown by a survey 
               <br />
               conducted a few years ago by the Aluminum 
               <br />
               Company of Canada, it is estimated that this 
               <br />
               waterpower when developed will produce some— 
               <br />
               where in the vicinity of one and one-half million 
               <br />
               horsepower.” They are very optimistic, it seems 
               <br />
               to me, in saying that this water—power will be 
               <br />
               developed. 1 have not found anything to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en«</span> 
               <br />
               courage me to think that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water«power</span> is 
               <br />
               going to be developed by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">company...</span> The 
               <br />
               impression I have received from people in 
               <br />
               authority is that it is very doubtful yet; no con- 
               <br />
               clusion has been arrived at to lead anyone to 
               <br />
               believe this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water-power</span> will be tapped at all. It 
               <br />
               is a gigantic undertaking and if power for this job 
               <br />
               can be obtained at less expense, it will not be 
               <br />
               tapped at all. The Committee says it will be 
               <br />
               tapped. They say it will be 1.5 million <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">horse»</span> 
               <br />
               power when it is tapped. As I recall it the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee gives the estimate of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.16</span> million 
               <br />
               horsepower. Of course it is true that the Mining 
               <br />
               Committee did point out that if the waters of 
               <br />
               Michikamau Lake ﬂowing into the Hamilton 
               <br />
               River were tapped, 20% would be added. Since 
               <br />
               it is doubtful that the falls will be tapped, it is 
               <br />
               optimistic to say 1.5 million horsepower will be 
               <br />
               developed —— used in the production of iron ore 
               <br />
               and exportation of power to the Quebec area. 
               <br />
               There is just one other thing I would like to 
               <br />
               say. As far as this country’s being self-supporting 
               <br />
               is concerned, I am not in a position to admit that 
               <br />
               because the Secretary of State for Common- 
               <br />
               wealth Affairs makes a bare statement that we 
               <br />
               are self—supporting; or because a former Com— 
               <br />
               missioner for Finance also makes the bare 
               <br />
               statement, without any qualiﬁcation; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause the majority of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               makes the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement...</span> I am not able to 
               <br />
               accept that and many other things; it seems to be 
               <br />
               an inflated opinion of the economy. I do not feel 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in supporting the passage of this report 
               <br />
               through the House at the present time.
