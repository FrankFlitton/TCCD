               Mr. Ballam We all know that the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government made the statement 13 or 
               <br />
               14 years ago, that once Newfoundland became 
               <br />
               self—supporting again they would restore respon- 
               <br />
               sible government, if our people requested it. That 
               <br />
               is a big “it”. I have never had any doubt that the 
               <br />
               British government would honour their pledge. 
               <br />
               Some people have made out that they had some 
               <br />
               doubts on this point, or they pretended to have 
               <br />
               doubts. But there has never been any doubt 
               <br />
               whatever that the mother country would honour 
               <br />
               her pledge to us. In fact, that is one of the reasons 
               <br />
               why Britain is holding the referendum. We 
               <br />
               should remember, Mr. Chairman, that it is not this 
               <br />
               Convention or even the Commission of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment that is holding the referendum, but the 
               <br />
               British government. One of the reasons why 
               <br />
               Britain is holding the referendum is to give our 
               <br />
               people the chance to vote for it if they want to. I 
               <br />
               do not think the people will vote for responsible 
               <br />
               government — they have had plenty of it before 
               <br />
               and they know what to expect. But the point is 
               <br />
               that they can if they wish to, and the referendum 
               <br />
               is the method that has been arranged to enable 
               <br />
               them to do it. My belief is that even if this 
               <br />
               Convention did not recommend responsible 
               <br />
               government the British government would put it 
               <br />
               on the ballot. They made us a promise and as 
               <br />
               Britain always keeps her promises, I am con- 
               <br />
               vinced that responsible government will be on the 
               <br />
               ballot, even if this Convention votes against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put«</span> 
               <br />
               ting it on.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am strongly in favour of putting Commission 
               <br />

               <br />
               that I am strongly in favour of Commission, but 
               <br />
               only that it should be put on the ballot. I am trying
