               <br />
               hung on to them for dear life. People with a

               Not since 1919-20 had the taxable capacity of 
               <br />
               our economy been such as would enable us to

               <br />
               world depression had played such havoc with our 
               <br />
               economy as to have reduced it to where it could

               no longer provide many with the opportunity to 
               <br />
               make a living, and in consequence a quarter of 
               <br />
               the population came to be on relief. Such then 
               <br />
               was the ﬁx in which we found ourselves in 1934

               <br />
               the life of me, I cannot see what other conclusion 
               <br />
               there is to come to. To admit of more would 
               <br />
               involve gratuitous assumption. Not to admit to so 
               <br />
               much would involve downright <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evasion.</span> And so 
               <br />
               I say that a fair man must admit to the possibility

               of a precarious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-support</span> However, if it be a 
               <br />
               condition of self-support we have come to, we 
               <br />
               have to hold that the condition is precarious, 
               <br />
               because even the immediate future offers no 
               <br />
               surety that the basis upon which our improved

               <br />
               have arrived at, it is a meager enough thing. At 
               <br />
               its best, it is a condition ofself-support at the level 
               <br />
               of what we were used to —— perhaps even a little 
               <br />
               better than what we were used to. But that is not 
               <br />
               enough. It may well be that, for the most part, the 
               <br />
               standard of living is higher today than it ever was. 
               <br />
               But that is not all that is to be taken into con— 
               <br />
               sideration. The important consideration is — is it 
               <br />
               high enough? In the issue that confronts this 
               <br />
               nation, are we to be satisﬁed with that which is 
               <br />
               as good as what we were used to, or are we going 
               <br />
               to seek for the most that may be had? 
               <br />

               If anyone feels that the condition of our 
               <br />
               economy is sound and satisfactory. then the 
               <br />
               reason must be that he feels that our economy is 
               <br />
               adequate to provide us with as good as what we 
               <br />
               have been used to. That is one way of looking at 
               <br />
               it. Yet we may well find the average fisherman 
               <br />
               taking another view. The average ﬁsherman has 
               <br />
               always had his own cost of living index, which 
               <br />
               he has historically applied to determine the satis- 
               <br />
               factory condition or otherwise of our economy. 
               <br />
               That index has been this —— a barrel of ﬂour for a 
               <br />
               quintal of ﬁsh. In times when fishermen have 
               <br />
               been able to get a barrel of flour for a quintal of 
               <br />
               fish, they have been able to cope adequately with 
               <br />
               their family economies, and enjoy some measure 
               <br />
               of temporary security. In times when our fisher— 
               <br />
               men have been unable to get a barrel of ﬂour for 
               <br />
               a quintal of ﬁsh, they have found the national 
               <br />
               economy out of focus with their best interests, 
               <br />
               and have lived with their ﬁngers crossed against 
               <br />
               adversity. Today it takes two quintals of ﬁsh to 
               <br />
               pay for a barrel of ﬂour ~— and it is just possible 
               <br />
               that my last forgotten ﬁsherman on the bill of 
               <br />
               Cape St. George is not so happy over the condi-
