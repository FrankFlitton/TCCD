               heard people who have come back from the USA 
               <br />

               I would like to read if I have not lost it, an

               extract from a letter from a gentleman who has 
               <br />
               been living in the USA for the last 15 or 20 years, 
               <br />
               and is connected with one of the universities. He 
               <br />
               stresses that the great difficulty in the USA is that 
               <br />
               we are not known there. The public has no con- 
               <br />
               ception of what Newfoundland was, what it is, 
               <br />
               and what it expects to be, so it is very difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               get any public interest in this question... As you 
               <br />
               know, I published a pamphlet which I circulated 
               <br />
               among the members of the Convention a long 
               <br />
               time ago, and I have had some communication 
               <br />
               about it from the United States, they have been 
               <br />
               favourably impressed, and I think something will 
               <br />
               come if we can discuss matters with them. We 
               <br />
               can do nothing by sitting here, we have to get 
               <br />
               there. Difﬁculties will be raised by the authorities 
               <br />
               here, I think. They will say it is not within our 
               <br />
               terms of reference, and they can’t agree to it. It 
               <br />
               may be they will say, “Even if you pass this 
               <br />
               resolution, you will have to provide your own 
               <br />
               funds to go”. In that case we might pass around 
               <br />
               the hat.

               Mr. Jackman Over a month ago I introduced a 
               <br />
               resolution regarding a delegation to be sent to 
               <br />
               Washington. It received such a chilling recep— 
               <br />
               tion, and myself as well, that I am not properly 
               <br />
               thawed out yet. When I brought that resolution in 
               <br />
               here Ihad one thing in mind, and I still have it.... 
               <br />
               I had the concern of the working people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and I still have it. The people are 
               <br />
               looking for the wherewithal to live. I had that in 
               <br />
               mind when I brought in the resolution. I feel as I 
               <br />
               felt in the beginning, that I am a lone wolf in this 
               <br />
               Convention. I came with preconceived ideas and 
               <br />
               I have them today, and I am going to hold them 
               <br />
               despite the political groups in this Convention. 1 
               <br />
               have not said a word for the past while because, 
               <br />
               as I said before, I was frozen... I do not like the 
               <br />
               attitude of the Convention itself. When I entered 
               <br />
               this door I was not asking favours from anyone 
               <br />
