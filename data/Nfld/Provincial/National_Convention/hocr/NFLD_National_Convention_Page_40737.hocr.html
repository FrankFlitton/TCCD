               listened to a very rosy picture that has been

               painted of our economic future, which appears to 
               <br />
               have very little in the way of a solid foundation.

               the statement made by the last speaker, there are 
               <br />
               one or two ﬁgures I would like to quote. The last 
               <br />
               speaker was trying to insinuate that the economy 
               <br />
               is a wartime economy. I refer you to the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               in the Finance Report with regard to the exports 
               <br />
               of iron ore, and the value thereof. I quote you the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures:* 
               <br />
               ....Here we have two after the war years where 
               <br />
               the value of iron ore has doubled practically. Is 
               <br />
               that a wartime boom? 1 refer you to the ﬁgures in
