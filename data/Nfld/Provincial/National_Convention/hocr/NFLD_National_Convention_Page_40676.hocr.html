               Chadwick-Jones report,1 that excellent report 
               <br />
               that was tabled here very early in the Convention 
               <br />
               and then more or less discreetly forgotten by 
               <br />
               agreement between all parties ever since, I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that in 1943-44 we were spending in this country 
               <br />
               on relief and welfare approximately $1 million. 
               <br />
               I’m not here to advocate confederation with New

               Zealand; I’m putting forward this comparison in 
               <br />
               order to suggest that perhaps when the Finance 
               <br />
               Committee offers this opinion that our expendi- 
               <br />
               tures should be kept down to $21 million a year, 
               <br />
               there may possibly be greener pastures for our 
               <br />
               people that they’re not quite taking into account.

               There’s another point which I think is on page 
               <br />
               5 of the report in which the Committee is 
               <br />
               discussing the period from 1920-21 to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">193283,</span> 
               <br />
               the last 13 years of self-government. During this 
               <br />
               period the government raised loans on the credit 
               <br />
               of the country of $54 million, less approximately 
               <br />
               $11 million which was used for refunding loans 
               <br />
               maturing, thus leaving a net amount of loans 
               <br />
               actually raised of approximately $43 million. 
               <br />
               Again on reference to the Chadwick-Jones 
               <br />
               report, they give for the ﬁscal years 1918 to 1940, 
               <br />
               which covers that period — a few years on either 
               <br />
               end are added -- they tell us there that 7.5% of 
               <br />
               our total revenue was raised from income tax, 
               <br />
               whereas in 1945 28.8% was raised from income 
               <br />
               tax. Now, there’s no note taken of anything of that 
               <br />
               sort in the Committee’s report, because it works 
               <br />
               out something like this. My ﬁgures, subject to 
               <br />
               check, the total revenue for the period is 
               <br />
               $119,197,000, which gives you an average 
               <br />
               revenue of $9.1 million approximately; 7.5% of 
               <br />
               the total revenue came from income tax, which 
               <br />
               would give you approximately $690,000 average 
               <br />
               income tax per year.... We’re trying to search the 
               <br />
               past, to see if the country could have done better, 
               <br />
               and we’re trying to make some estimate as to 
               <br />
               what our ﬁnancial position will be in the future. 
               <br />
               I wonder if it’s just possible that we might have 
               <br />
               done a little more with raising money on our own 
               <br />
               in those days. I don’t want to startle you. But we 
               <br />
               have here several old parliamentarians and pos- 
               <br />
               sibly they could toss in an opinion on a point like 
               <br />
               that.

               <br />
               dealt with extensively already, so that you may 
               <br />
               think that I’m just labouring it to death. If we take 
               <br />
               into consideration the fact that during the past 
               <br />
               ﬁve years over $20 million has been expended on 
               <br />
               capital and loan account which ordinarily should 
               <br />
               be deducted from the total expenditure, the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               result for the period of nearly half a century 
               <br />
               should show approximately $15 million surplus. 
               <br />
               Now we had that thrashed out and there was quite 
               <br />
               a bit of debate and explanation given on it yester- 
               <br />
               day; but the chairman of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               made reference to the fact that people outside the 
               <br />
               Convention, perhaps people in it as well, have 
               <br />
               been getting some wrong ideas. We all know how 
               <br />
               easy it is for anyone of us to say one thing, and 
               <br />
               have somebody else the next morning tell you 
               <br />
               that you said something entirely different. I 
               <br />
               haven't kept my ear to the ground unduly, but I 
               <br />
               found a few people who seemed to have got the 
               <br />
               idea that we of the Convention feel that expendi- 
               <br />
               tures on capital account don’t matter, that they‘re 
               <br />
               just not expenditures at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all.</span> 1 think it would be 
               <br />
               wise for us to correct that impression. My own 
               <br />
               view is that capital expenditures have to be taken 
               <br />
               into account. I believe it is the custom that most 
               <br />
               commercial enterprises, if they invest say 
               <br />
               $100,000 in the building of a warehouse, and they 
               <br />
               ﬁgure that the warehouse will last them 20 years, 
               <br />
               to write off as against that capital expenditure 
               <br />
               each year, an amount say of $5,000 each year; 
               <br />
               that is ordinary depreciation. The capital expen- 
               <br />
               diture in that case is in no way to be regarded as 
               <br />
               an expense. Because the expense is spread over, 
               <br />
               in this particular instance, 20 years. I enquired 
               <br />
               privately from the chairman of the Committee 
               <br />
               yesterday and he informs me, and actually he 
               <br />
               conﬁrms, the impression that I already had, that 
               <br />
               governments do not do that. Our government 
               <br />
               makes no provision out of its annual expenditure 
               <br />
               for depreciation on any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buildings,</span> Is that right? I 
               <br />
               see Mr. Hollett over there shaking his head. I 
               <br />
               don’t know if that’s in agreement or in disagree- 
               <br />
               ment. But if that is so, that no depreciation expen— 
               <br />
               ditures are taken care of annually, then it would 
               <br />
               seem that if as a government, we spend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20,000</span> 
               <br />
               $25,000 on a hospital, that is very definitely 
               <br />
               expenditure, whether it’s capital expenditure or 
               <br />
               not, a necessary expenditure, and it’s something 
               <br />
               that we must take into account when we are 
               <br />
