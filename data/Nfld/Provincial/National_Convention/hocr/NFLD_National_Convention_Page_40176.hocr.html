               sory education. In that the government made a 
               <br />
               step in the right direction.1 If pupils cannot pay 
               <br />
               half for school books, the government should see 
               <br />
               that they are provided free. I believe that it would 
               <br />
               be a good move to have a university here. Also, 
               <br />
               it is essential to have regional schools provided 
               <br />
               in the larger outports. I regret to have heard the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures given out yesterday, namely, that there 
               <br />
               were 325 ungraded teachers and 1,788 graded. 
               <br />
               This is surely the outcome of the low salaries paid 
               <br />
               in the past; and I hope now that salaries have been 
               <br />
               increased somewhat teachers will come forward 
               <br />
               to get their necessary grades. Adult education has 
               <br />
               been also mentioned and I am pleased IO see the 
               <br />
               progress made. I would like to refer to political 
               <br />
               education; it is very necessary in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               We must aim at true democracy and that means 
               <br />
               that we must be responsible for our own affairs. 
               <br />
               But it devolves upon the government to see that 
               <br />
               the people are educated politically so far as is 
               <br />
               possible.

               provement in education, for everyone will agree 
               <br />
               that the ﬁrst requisite of a nation is the education 
               <br />
               of its children. The present estimates of slightly 
               <br />
               over $3 million for education is not at all adequate 
               <br />
               for the needs of such a sparsely populated country 
               <br />
               as ours, and, could our economy afford it, it might 
               <br />
               be double that amount. What of the future of the 
               <br />
               teaching profession? Are we agreed that the 
               <br />
               remuneration they receive is sufficient, and befits 
               <br />
               their high calling? Says the report, and I quote, 
               <br />
               “The median salary including augmentation and 
               <br />
               cost of living bonus is for 1945, $992.” The 
               <br />
               average teacher actually receives today the 
               <br />
               modest sum of a little in excess of $82 per month 
               <br />
               for 12 months (it must not be mistakenly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sup»</span> 
               <br />
               posed that a teacher doesn’t eat and spend some 
               <br />
               money in the holidays, which of course are 
               <br />
               without pay). Mr. Hollett spoke wisely when he 
               <br />
               affirmed that teachers’ salaries are ridiculously 
               <br />
               low. I know of schools in this island with but one

               <br />

               <br />
               regrettable situation is obvious — can we expect 
               <br />
               our teachers to continue in the calling for such a 
               <br />
               ridiculously low scale of wages? Take up your

               <br />
               then that school-teachers seek other zones of 
               <br />

               Mr. Jackman One of the most important mat-

               ters, if not the most important, we have to deal 
               <br />
               with is education because it deals with human 
               <br />
               value. The boys and girls of today are the men 
               <br />
               and women of tomorrow. They constitute our 
               <br />
               greatest national asset. Our teachers are equally 
               <br />
               important. What are we doing to see that those 
               <br />
               teachers, whom we depend so much upon, are 
               <br />
               getting enough pay to live on in order to educate 
               <br />
               the children of the country? I would say that we 
               <br />
               are doing very little over this injustice. I know 
               <br />
               we, as a Convention, cannot do much because we 
               <br />
               have not got the authority but I think this Con- 
               <br />
               vention should at least try and call the attention 
               <br />
               of the people to this very important matter. The 
               <br />
               conditions under which so many of our teachers 
               <br />
               have to exist is scandalous. As Mr. Vincent has 
               <br />
               said, “Is it any wonder we have a shortage of 
               <br />
               teachers?” And he struck the nail on the head 
               <br />
               when he said it was because of small pay. I can 
               <br />
               give several examples of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> I know a chap at 
               <br />
               Bell Island who taught school for a number of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> He was single at the time and managed to 
               <br />
               get along, but eventually he got married and was 
               <br />
               compelled to leave the teaching profession and 
               <br />
               go down in the mines shovelling ore in order to 
               <br />
