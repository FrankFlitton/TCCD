               I would like to refer brieﬂy to the beneﬁts 
               <br />
               which war veterans would receive. I‘ve already 
               <br />
               enumerated them. The great benefit is the war 
               <br />
               veterans’ allowance, by which a qualified veteran 
               <br />
               when he attains the age of 60 may get an al— 
               <br />

               <br />
               widow of a war veteran at the age of 55. If he is 
               <br />
               incapacitated and unable to earn before he 
               <br />
               reaches the age of 60, he may be able to get 
               <br />
               something then. This is a great thing for the war 
               <br />
               veterans of Newfoundland... We know that the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts extended to veterans by Canada were 
               <br />
               extra good. Provision was given for fishermen on 
               <br />
               provincial lands, whereby they would get a grant, 
               <br />
               which they didn’t have to repay, of $2,320. We 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland allowed them $700.

               generally follows <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inflationary</span> pressure. Rapid

               spending sometimes is the result when controls

               not mean that Canada is ﬁnancially or fundamen— 
               <br />
               tally weak. We recognise that the trend of the 
               <br />
               times is for greater union. Look at the British 
               <br />
               West Indies at the present time, see how they are 
               <br />
               beginning to confederate, how they are joining up 
               <br />
               and seeing how they can pool their resources and 
               <br />
               work together. We in Newfoundland have no 
               <br />
               control over export markets. Years ago, and in the 
               <br />
               depression, our exports dropped from about $39 
               <br />
               million to $23 million, and our ﬁsh exports 
               <br />
               dropped from $15 million to $6 million. Some 
               <br />
               people wonder when this economic recession 
               <br />
               may start again. The ebb and ﬂow of trade is after 
               <br />
               all —— trade is a two-way street so to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak.</span> It’s a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">onevway</span> street going backwards with trafﬁc 
               <br />
               going and coming on it. And we know that over 
               <br />
               in Europe they want our ﬁsh and they must 
               <br />
               naturally be able to give us something that we can 
               <br />
               use to convert into the means of buying what we 
               <br />
               require This was amply provided this fall when 
               <br />
               the difﬁculty of sterling exchange became most 
               <br />
               acute. Fortunately, we had the money on the other 
               <br />
               side and the Commission negotiated and the 
               <br />
               result has been a great thing for our ﬁshermen. 
               <br />
               We have other years ahead to look forward to, 
               <br />
               and we have to realise that in this matter of trade 
               <br />
               we are, so to speak, one world. We are dependent 
               <br />
               one upon the other. This was amply exempliﬁed 
               <br />
               this year when it was explained that our sale of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh in Spain depends upon the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               taking Spanish oranges. For awhile the sales were 
               <br />
               held up but ﬁnally, when Great Britain bought 
               <br />
               these oranges from Spain, it gave the Spanish 
               <br />
               some sterling in order to buy our ﬁsh. While we 
               <br />
               are dependent upon these markets in Europe and 
               <br />
               elsewhere, we realise what a great economic 
               <br />
               question is before us. We realise how these 
               <br />
               economic forces work, and that they, when not 
               <br />
               properly controlled, are the means of starting 
               <br />
               depressions. We are beneﬁtting from the result of 
               <br />
               war prices. The inﬂated prices of the war are still 
               <br />
               in effect, they’ve not yet subsided. Peoples of the 
               <br />
               world are trying to settle down in a changing 
               <br />
               world, and we know that after the last war a sharp 
               <br />
               collapse in prices resulted in many failures. Ex- 
               <br />
               port prices for ﬁsh were cut in half between 1920 
               <br />
               and 1923.... Relief was required in quite a few
