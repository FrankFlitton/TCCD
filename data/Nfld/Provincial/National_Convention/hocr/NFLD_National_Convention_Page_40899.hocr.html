               The Fisheries Prices Support Act was 
               <br />
               passed in 1944 and proclaimed in July, 1947,

               the Board under the Act then being named by 
               <br />
               the Government. The Act covers the ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               products of Canada as a whole, and if New- 
               <br />
               foundland were part of Canada, would apply 
               <br />
               there as elsewhere in the Dominion. In the

               event of Newfoundland entering Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, the Federal Government would wish to 
               <br />
               reconsider the present membership of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               named three Advisory Committees (one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rep&lt;</span>

               The Act outlines the powers of the Board 
               <br />

               <br />

               ....We had a meeting with the fisheries 
               <br />
               authorities who explained to us fairly thoroughly 
               <br />
               the idea of the Fisheries Prices Support Board. If 
               <br />
               the price of fish begins to slip, especially in 
               <br />
               foreign markets, the Board may step in and by 
               <br />
               buying a quantity of fish help to keep the price 
               <br />
               from sinking. A very striking example of the way 
               <br />
               that works happened while we were in Ottawa. It 
               <br />
               was not ﬁsh — but the same principle is used — 
               <br />
               it was the apple crop of the Annapolis Valley in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. They had a crop worth some $10 
               <br />
               million; Britain was buying the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apples.</span> Sud- 
               <br />
               denly Britain said it could not afford the dollars; 
               <br />
               they thought they could use the dollars on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some»</span> 
               <br />
               thing more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary.</span> They cancelled their order. 
               <br />
               The Canadian government stepped in and bought 
               <br />
               the entire crop and gave them away for relief 
               <br />
               in Greece and Italy and sent so many to Britain 
               <br />
               as a gift, to help out the apple growers of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. This Fisheries Board is supposed to
