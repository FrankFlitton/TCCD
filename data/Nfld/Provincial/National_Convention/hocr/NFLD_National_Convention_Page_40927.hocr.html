               Mr. Chairman Speaking for myself, I have al- 
               <br />
               ways felt that the manner in which the public 
               <br />
               approached the thing is all wrong. For example, 
               <br />
               the operating deﬁcits on the Railway have been 
               <br />
               met by the govemmentexchcquer. Assuming, for 
               <br />
               argument’s sake, that the operating deﬁcit for the 
               <br />
               year would be $1 million, everybody blandly 
               <br />
               assumes that it cost the country $1 million. We 
               <br />
               must bear in mind the fact that the Railway is the 
               <br />
               largest employer of labour. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,And</span> remember, on

               every article of foodstuffs and clothing, every

               Railway employee is indirectly, if not directly,

               paying revenue to the government. He pays his 
               <br />
               income tax. So that when we come to consider

               what the government raises in return it might
