               Mr. Hollett Now I have here the Letters Patent 
               <br />
               of 1934, and I want to read a section. You see just

               His Majesty King George V. He issued his Let-

               <br />
               made certain statements and if the British govem—

               <br />
               Patent under the Great Seal bearing date at 
               <br />
               Westminster, the 28th day of March 1876, 
               <br />
               Her Majesty Queen Victoria did constitute

               <br />
               Edward VII did amend the aforesaid Letters

               Patent, and Whereas (this is one of the impor—

               tant sections, sir) Whereas we have received 
               <br />
               an address from the Legislative Council and 
               <br />
               House of Assembly of the said Island, pray-

               <br />
               suspend the aforesaid Letters Patent, and to 
               <br />
               issue new Letters Patent, which would pro-

               vide for the Administration of the said Island 
               <br />
               until, until such time as it may become self-

               supporting again, on the basis of the recom-

               mendations which are contained in the 
               <br />
               Report of the Royal Commission appointed 
               <br />
               by us on the 17th day of February 1933. 
               <br />
               This is the Amulree Report, sir. Let us see what 
               <br />
               it says. If you have it in your possession, page 224 
               <br />
               under the heading “Summary of Recommenda- 
               <br />
               tions”, sub-section G: “It would be understood 
               <br />
               that as soon as the Island’s difﬁculties are over- 
               <br />
               come and the country is again self—supporting, 
               <br />
               Responsible Government, on the request of the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, would be restored.” 
               <br />
               And His Majesty King George V states deﬁnitely 
               <br />
               in the Letters Patent that he is graciously pleased 
               <br />
               to issue new Letters Patent, which would provide 
               <br />
               for the administration of the said island until such 
               <br />
               time as it may become self-supporting again on 
               <br />
               the basis of the recommendations. 
               <br />

               Now, if that is not plain to everybody there 
               <br />
               must be something wrong with everybody, or 
               <br />
               with me. Therefore this was the position. I have 
               <br />
               quoted the Evening Telegram, I have quoted Mr. 
               <br />
               Emrys-Evans, I have quoted the Letters Patent, 
               <br />
               and I have quoted from Lord Amulree’s report, 
               <br />
               and all these documents indicate just one thing, 
               <br />
               that our constitution was suspended in 1933, and 
               <br />
               a new form of government put into being until 
               <br />
               such time as this country again became self~sup- 
               <br />
               porting, and then, and then, whenever thereafter 
               <br />
               the people of this country wanted back the former 
               <br />
               status, all they had to do was to ask for it, and it 
               <br />
               would be given to them immediately. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Emrys—Evans said something else on that 
               <br />
               same date, 3 December, 1943, and it is important, 
               <br />
               very important. He said this: 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               As soon as practicable after the end of this 
               <br />
               present war machinery must be provided for 
               <br />
               enabling the Newfoundland people to ex— 
               <br />
               amine the future of the island, and to express 
               <br />
               their considered views as to the form of 
               <br />
               government they desire, having regard to the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial and economic conditions prevailing 
               <br />
               at the time. If the general wish of the people 
               <br />
               should be for the return of full responsible 
               <br />
               government, we, for our part, shall be very 
               <br />
               ready, if the island is then self-supporting, to 
               <br />
               facilitate such a change. If, however, the 
               <br />
               general wish of the people should be either 
               <br />
               for the continuation of the present form of 
               <br />
               government, or for some change of the sys~ 
               <br />
               tern which would fall short of full responsible 
               <br />
               government, we shall be prepared to examine 
               <br />
               such proposals sympathetically and consider 
               <br />
               within what limits the continued acceptance 
               <br />
               of responsibility by the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               could be recommended to Parliament. 
               <br />
               Their position is, therefore, “You have now Com— 
               <br />
               mission of Government, should you wish to 
               <br />
               retain it, very well. If you want return of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respon»</span> 
               <br />
               sible government, yes, or even if you want <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com»</span> 
               <br />
               mission government amended somewhat so that 
               <br />
               some representation may be given the people of 
               <br />
               your country, we will consider that,” So I say that 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins could have arranged his motion in 
               <br />
               such a way that we could put on the ballot paper 
               <br />
               responsible government or some amended form 
               <br />
               of Commission of Government, or he could do it 
               <br />
               as he has done it. Other than that, I see no room 
               <br />
               for any other matter to go on the ballot paper. 
               <br />
