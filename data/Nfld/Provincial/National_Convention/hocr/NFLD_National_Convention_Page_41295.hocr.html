               dissolved for all time or should it be prorogued? 
               <br />
               It seems very desirable from a number of 
               <br />
               standpoints, that when His Excellency comes to 
               <br />
               close the Convention, he should prorogue and not 
               <br />
               dissolve it, because, as pointed out, it may be- 
               <br />
               come necessary for the British government to 
               <br />
               come back to us and ask for information or advice 
               <br />
               on some point connected with the referendum. 
               <br />
               Well, if we are dissolved next week, the British 
               <br />
               government cannot come back to us — we will 
               <br />
               not be in existence, so that I think that is a matter 
               <br />
               which you, as Chairman, might take up if you 
               <br />
               have not already done it. I am sure you have 
               <br />
               already given the matter some thought, because 
               <br />
               I know it was in my mind even before it hap— 
               <br />
               pened. There is not a word in the act about 
               <br />
               dissolving the Convention. We can go home, but 
               <br />
               we are still a Convention until we are dissolved. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No, I can’t accept that posi-

               <br />
               seems to me that the Convention Act which 
               <br />
               created us leaves us in existence and does not 
               <br />
               provide for our dissolution. It only provides for 
               <br />
               the discharge of our duty. Once we have dis— 
               <br />
               charged that duty are we not still in existence as

               a matter to think over.

               though the transcript of the London proceedings 
               <br />
               I did not notice where Lord Addison did 
               <br />
               proceed on the presupposition that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conven‘</span>

               tion would be available for him to refer back any

               questions which may occur to him during the 
               <br />

               <br />
               tions and the holding of the referendum. My own 
               <br />
               opinion, for what it is worth, is that under the 
               <br />
               National Convention Act this Convention is 
               <br />
               brought to an end in either of two ways: either by 
               <br />
               repealing the legislation, the National Conven~ 
               <br />
               tion Act, or by this Convention completing its 
               <br />
               work as set forth in the prescribed act. In other 
               <br />
               words, that this Convention would cease to exist 
               <br />
               after the time it had made its recommendations. 
               <br />
               With these opinions in mind, I promptly took the 
               <br />
               matter up with His Excellency the Governor, and

               my respectful submission to him was that if my 
               <br />
               interpretation of the section was correct, then I 
               <br />
               was at a great loss to understand how Lord <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ad»</span> 
               <br />
               dison proposed to refer back, to a nonexistent 
               <br />
               body, questions which would arise between its 
               <br />
               dissolution and the holding of the referendum, if 
               <br />
               my contention was that this Convention would 
               <br />
               come to an end instantly when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommenda»</span>

               tions were made.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My opinion is that this Convention is in sub- 
               <br />
               stitution of a royal commission, and if a royal 
               <br />
               commission is set up to do a certain job, certainly 
               <br />
               it comes to an end after that job has been per- 
               <br />
               formed. Therefore, under the present state of the 
               <br />
               legislation constituting the Convention, the 
               <br />
               Governor has no discretion as to whether the 
               <br />
               house will be prorogued or formally dissolved. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think that if the Convention is to be 
               <br />
               prorogued or dissolved an amendment to the act 
               <br />
               is essential. Therefore, if it is the desire of mem— 
               <br />
               bers, I will contact the Hon. Mr. Walsh, who is 
               <br />
               now the Acting Chairman of the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, and I will place your views before 
               <br />
               him, ﬁrst for the purpose of determining whether 
               <br />
               or not he agrees with my interpretation of the act, 
               <br />
               and if not, whether or not he is prepared to have 
               <br />
               the necessary legislation put into effect to have 
               <br />
               the Convention dissolved, and I will pass his 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Bradley I am rather inclined to agree. This 
               <br />
               Convention was brought into existence by 
               <br />
               statute, and the ﬁrst observation I would like to 
               <br />
               make is that there is no such thing as prorogation 
               <br />
               of this Convention. It is not a legislature in any 
               <br />
               sense of the word, and the Governor has no more 
               <br />
               power to prorogue it than I have. Now when it 
               <br />
               was brought into existence by statute it was given 
               <br />
               certain powers —— to investigate and make re- 
               <br />
               commendations to the British government. Just 
               <br />
               when it will have made all its recommendations 
               <br />
               I don’t know. I understand that, within the next 
               <br />
               ten days or so, the intention of the Convention is 
               <br />
               to make certain recommendations to the British 
               <br />
               government with reference to forms of future 
               <br />
               government in this country, but I have no as- 
               <br />
               surance that by the date named all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommem</span> 
               <br />
               dations which the Convention will want to make 
               <br />
               will have then been made. If not, it seems to me 
               <br />
               that the Convention will still have a further func- 
               <br />
               tion, and consequently will be legally in exist- 
               <br />
               ence, sir, even if its functions have been 
               <br />
