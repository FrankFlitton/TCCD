               never quite free; never wholly independent.

               Mr. Chairman, I did not propose when I set out 
               <br />
               to speak on this motion to give the Convention or 
               <br />
               the country a history lesson. But it seems to me 
               <br />
               that without a study, even a cursory one, of that 
               <br />
               history, none of us can properly assess just what 
               <br />
               our maligned responsible governments did for 
               <br />
               this country. As I said at the beginning, our 
               <br />
               collapse of 1934 was deeply rooted in the facts 
               <br />
               of that history. As I pointed out the other day, the 
               <br />
               commission form of government was suggested 
               <br />
               for this country in 1895, when she was in ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial straits after the bank crash. But the men of 
               <br />
               that time were made of sterner stuff; they rose to 
               <br />
               the occasion, and Newfoundland weathered the 
               <br />
               storm and went on to the 20th century and an age 
               <br />
               of new and greater development. Although we 
               <br />
               are still very close to the events of 1933 and 1934, 
               <br />
               it is fair to admit, and has been admitted in many 
               <br />
               responsible quarters, that Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               asked to pay too high a price for her solvency. 
               <br />
               Professor Harold Innis, author of The Cod 
               <br />
               Fisheries, declared with reference to this,

               The decline of bankruptcy as a method of 
               <br />
               adjustment brought the collapse of respon- 
               <br />
               sible government. It was signiﬁcant that a 
               <br />
               banker occuped a prominent position on the 
               <br />
               Royal Commission which recommended its 
               <br />
               abolition. When Newfoundland’s dictator— 
               <br />
               ship as a whole refused to accept the highly 
               <br />
               questionable policy of one of its members, 
               <br />
               Mr. Thomas Lodge, he argued that, “To have 
               <br />
               assumed responsibility for the good govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland from altruistic mo- 
               <br />
               tives and to have achieved economic 
               <br />
               rehabilitation might have cost the British tax- 
               <br />
               payer a few millions. It would have added to 
               <br />
               the prestige of the British Empire." But that 
               <br />
               will not do. “For those who believe in 
               <br />
               democracy the prestige of the British Empire 
               <br />
