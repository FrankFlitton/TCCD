               about our economic condition generally. I am not

               allowing for human fallibility, presents a fairly 
               <br />
               comprehensive picture. However, I would like to 
               <br />
               compliment my colleague from St. George’s 
               <br />
               West who, while he did not see ﬁt to sign the 
               <br />
               Economic Report, nevertheless gave a very clear 
               <br />
               and concise expression of the point of view he 
               <br />
               holds as a co-operative worker, and which, also 
               <br />
               as a co-operative worker, I hold...

               On questions of economics there is bound to 
               <br />
               be disagreement, because we all see things from 
               <br />
               different points of view. Certainly, when we 
               <br />
               come to speak on the economic position of our 
               <br />
               country, which is a matter of grave concern for 
               <br />
               all of us, there is room for wide disagreement. 
               <br />
               The thing that bothers and annoys me is that we 
               <br />
               seem to have run into a son of iron curtain which 
               <br />
               separates us into different and opposing camps

               Economic Report and the discussions on it which 
               <br />
               we have tended to overlook. I think, like the rest 
               <br />
               of the world, we are a little too much concerned 
               <br />
               with money. That is one of the fallacies of the 
               <br />
               materialistic age... There are other things besides 
               <br />
               money. Let me say that I reiterate the views 
               <br />
               expressed by another delegate some time ago in 
               <br />
               discriminating between money and real value. I 
               <br />
               feel the discussions have, in other than one brief 
               <br />
               reference, overlooked the question of value. We 
               <br />
               have not taken into account in assessing 
               <br />
               economic value, the value of the dollar. Money 
               <br />
               is a standard of value. It is not wealth... We have 
               <br />
               to take into account such things as our $80 million 
               <br />
               in savings today, which may not have a great deal 
               <br />
               more purchasing power than the $25 million we 
               <br />
               had in the Savings Bank in 1934. I must hold the 
               <br />
               view that the war economy has affected the situa- 
               <br />
               tion. The effect of the war, in my view, was 
               <br />
               whilst it increased our cash savings, at the same 
               <br />
               time it placed a limit on the purchasing power of 
               <br />
               these cash savings.

               The question of real values was brought to my 
               <br />
               attention by a person who is not an economist -— 
               <br />
               he is a fisherman. They were arguing about the 
               <br />
               cost of providing twine for a fish net. Today, 
               <br />
               although you had to pay more for twine, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arv</span> 
               <br />
               gued, it was cheaper than it was ten years ago, 
               <br />
               because whereas it took ten cases of salmon to 
               <br />
               get it then, today you get it for the price of one. 
               <br />
               The difference in the price in salmon was brought 
               <br />
               about from the co-operative market.
