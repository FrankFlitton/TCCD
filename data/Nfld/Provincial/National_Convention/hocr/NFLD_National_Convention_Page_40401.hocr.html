               <br />
               and the saitfish industry too, handicapped for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as compared with Canada or the 
               <br />

               packages and equipment used in the industry, and 
               <br />
               second by the rising costs of the actual producers 
               <br />
               - the actual ﬁshermen? You go back to page i 
               <br />
               of the Appendix and you will note because of 
               <br />
               “The frozen blueberry industry was also a very 
               <br />
               substantial business and of very deﬁnite value to 
               <br />
               the country, owing to the fact that the cost of 
               <br />
               picking was very little and the number of pickers 
               <br />
               probably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thousands,</span> making for a wide distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of the cash paid out, which some years 
               <br />
               amounted to over $500,000." A man or woman 
               <br />
               goes out and picks one gallon or ten gallons of 
               <br />
               blueberries. I think the cost of producing that one 
               <br />
               gallon of berries, to that woman, is her cost of 
               <br />
               living. Similarly the ﬁshermen in competition 
               <br />
               with ﬁshermen of Iceland, Norway and Canada, 
               <br />
               have a higher cost of living which is due to some 
               <br />
               extent to taxation. Taking the two together —- 
               <br />
               taxation on what he and his family eat and wear 
               <br />
               and use; taxation on machines, plants, wrapping, 
               <br />
               canons, paper — all these things that enter into 
               <br />
               the ﬁsh industry. I do not want to anticipate your 
               <br />
               sealing report, but there you make that very point 
               <br />
               that taxation on things going into the seal hunt, 
               <br />
               coaling the ships, equipment and the ship itself, 
               <br />
               is making the cost of production high. To what 
               <br />
               extent is it true in the fresh ﬁsh industry? How 
               <br />
               can it be helped by reduction of taxation? 
               <br />
