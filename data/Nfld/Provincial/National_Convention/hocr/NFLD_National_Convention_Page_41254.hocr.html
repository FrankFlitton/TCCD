               during my recent visit to Twillingate, and during 
               <br />
               1947 I was there about three weeks of the year, I 
               <br />
               found in the minds of some of the people a certain 
               <br />
               amount of confusion. I hope that I shall be able 
               <br />
               in some way to bring some order to the minds of 
               <br />
               those who were confused. Personally I consider 
               <br />
               these proposed arrangements good, and do not 
               <br />
               see how we can afford to turn them down. I am a 
               <br />
               pro-confederate. If we turn down these arrange- 
               <br />
               ments that the Canadian government has sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to us, what have we to substitute for them? 
               <br />
               Canada is enjoying a marked degree of 
               <br />
               prosperity, has a record of savings accounts, 
               <br />
               plentiful employment there and business is 
               <br />
               booming. It is, as has already been said, one of 
               <br />
               the most fortunate countries in the world. And if 
               <br />
               we cannot manage to do it with Canada at our 
               <br />
               back, however are we going to do it by ourselves? 
               <br />
               There are pe0ple today who question our ability 
               <br />
               to stand alone. They remember the time was 
               <br />
               when we had to look for somebody to assist us. 
               <br />
               At that time Great Britain came to our help — for 
               <br />
               which we should never be too thankful, and 
               <br />
               which we should never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forget....</span> Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               unless we have Great Britain or Canada at our 
               <br />
               back, how long shall we be able to go alone? That 
               <br />
               is the question that is uppermost in the minds of 
               <br />
               some of the people today. They realise as Ido that 
               <br />
               we are a small number of people, a small number 
               <br />
               of producers in a large area, and with a consider- 
               <br />
               able amount of our area cut off during the winter 
               <br />
               months with consequent loss of employment. I 
               <br />
               know on the other hand that our geographical 
               <br />
               position is a strategic one, and Canada realises 
               <br />
               that as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well.</span> There are people who live in the 
               <br />
               outports, and the life is quite different than here 
               <br />
               in the city. I represent an outport district, and I 
               <br />
               know the conditions under which our people out 
               <br />
               there had to live. I do not think that the British 
               <br />
               government made any mistake when they had a 
               <br />
               proviso in electing members to this Convention 
               <br />
               that they had to reside in the district for which 
               <br />
               they were elected. I hope that when we get back 
               <br />
               our government there will be some such proviso, 
               <br />
               so that the majority of outport districts will not be 
               <br />
               represented by people who live in St. John’s and 
               <br />
               the Avalon Peninsula. How do you think the 
               <br />
               people in St. John’s would like to be represented 
               <br />
               by a man living down in White Bay? It is 
               <br />
               preposterous to think of it....

               Our economy is a limited economy. Our gross 
               <br />
               national earning power is far lower than the 
               <br />
               Canadian earning power. And I wonder how long 
               <br />
               our surplus is going to last us. I don’t think any

               member of this Convention has prophesied how 
               <br />
               long our surplus is going to last, and what we’re 
               <br />
               going to do when that surplus is gone. In my 
               <br />
               opinion, we just can’t do for the great majority of

               them the things that we would like to give them. 
               <br />
               We can’t close our eyes to economic factors. My 
               <br />
               advice to the members of this Convention is to 
               <br />
               examine these terms dispassionately, cooly and 
               <br />
               in the light of economics. We are a small number 
               <br />
               of people, yet we are a proud and sturdy race. But 
               <br />
               on the other hand, Mr. Chairman, Ido not see why 
               <br />
               we should always want to remain independent 
               <br />
               and isolated, particularly when there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neigh«</span>

               few years —- what would we have done if we 
               <br />
               hadn’t got them? Only last fall, as far as I under— 
               <br />
               stand we wanted 60,000 sacks of ﬂour. We sent 
               <br />
               up to Canada; the request was granted.

               Mr. Ashbourne Well, they’ve given to England

               what England certainly deserved after what she’s 
               <br />
               gone through... Canada has certainly backed her 
               <br />
               up, and certainly has done her share in order to 
               <br />
               help out the old country, that has been 
               <br />
               demolished and bore the brunt, and marched to 
               <br />
               victory for civilisation. Now surely the 12 million 
               <br />
               people in Canada can’t be wrong in the nine 
               <br />
               provinces when they joined up together. And as 
               <br />
               far as I’m concerned, the form of government 
               <br />
               which worked for 12 million people will work for 
               <br />
               12,327,000, if the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               decide to go in there. We would then have a 
               <br />
               country where our young men could go when the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery was over in the fall of the year, particular— 
               <br />
               ly if the ﬁshery was poor; they could go from 
               <br />
               Halifax to Vancouver and earn other monies 
               <br />
               rather than be unemployed. The whole range of 
               <br />
               Canadian cities would be open for them. And if 
               <br />
               some of them want to go there and settle down, 
               <br />
               and make homes like a lot of Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
