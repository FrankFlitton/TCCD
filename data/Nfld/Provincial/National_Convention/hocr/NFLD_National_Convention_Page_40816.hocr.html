               Mr. Banﬁeld Mr. Chairman, I will not take up 
               <br />
               much of the Convention’s time, but I feel that 1 
               <br />
               should express my sentiments on this Economic 
               <br />
               Report. The report is so optimistic, and so many 
               <br />
               optimistic speeches have been made in praise of 
               <br />
               it, that a man may well hesitate before he dares 
               <br />
               to express a word of doubt about the rosy future 
               <br />
               that is held out before us. No man likes to be 
               <br />
               called a traitor to his native land, but at the same 
               <br />
               time I look upon it as my duty to speak of facts 
               <br />
               as I ﬁnd them. It makes no difference whether 
               <br />
               these facts be bright or gloomy, they have to be 
               <br />
               expressed. The people do not expect us to hide 
               <br />
               unpleasant facts and concentrate on pleasant 
               <br />
               ones. They want to know the whole truth, and I 
               <br />
               do not feel that this report contains the whole 
               <br />
               truth. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have recently read through all the budget 
               <br />
               speeches delivered in the House of Assembly 
               <br />
               between 1920 and 1932. Those were probably the 
               <br />
               worst years this country ever went through. We 
               <br />
               all know how our people suffered during those 
               <br />
               years. Yet in all those budget speeches not one 
               <br />
               word, not one single word, admitted that times 
               <br />
               were bad. They were all hopeful and optimistic. 
               <br />
               To read them you would never guess that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was in the depths of depression. 
               <br />
               Those speeches were only trying to fool the 
               <br />
               people. Now, I want to be fair. When I say that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has had more prosperity in the 
               <br />
               past half dozen years than ever before in our 
               <br />
               history, I am only saying what everybody knows. 
               <br />
               We have experienced some prosperity these past 
               <br />
               few years, since the war broke out. So we did in 
               <br />
               the last war. But a year or two after the last war, 
               <br />
               hard times fell upon Newfoundland. Can 
               <br />
               anybody get up and tell me that the same thing 
               <br />
               cannot happen again? Is depression something 
               <br />
               that cannot happen to us in future? I think we 
               <br />
               would have a big job on our hands to persuade 
               <br />
               our ﬁshermen that depression is out of the ques— 
               <br />
               tion. I cannot agree with this report when it tells 
               <br />
               us that our present degree of prosperity is due to 
               <br />
               anything but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war.</span> I think it is very much due 
               <br />
               to the war, and our people know it.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The report tells us that our fishery exports will 
               <br />
               be worth $25 million three years from now. I 
               <br />
               wonder how they know that? Suppose the ﬁgure 
               <br />
               is only $20 million, or even $15 million. After all, 
               <br />
               they were worth only $8 million just eight years 
               <br />
               ago. I don’t suppose they‘ll fall that low again,

               but between $8 million and $25 million anything 
               <br />

               <br />
               drop again, in spite of the Finance Committee and 
               <br />
               the Economic Report. Of course, we all hope that 
               <br />
               fish prices will stay up, but we are not justiﬁed in

               I want to say a word to those who keep telling 
               <br />
               us how prosperous this country is today. I’m very 
               <br />
               much afraid that there are some amongst us who 
               <br />
               seem to know very little about some parts of this 
               <br />
               country. There are places in Newfoundland today 
               <br />
               where it is anything but prosperous. I will make 
               <br />
               you a prophecy right now, Mr. Chairman, and it 
               <br />
               is this, that this coming winter we will have more 
               <br />
               people on the dole than we have had at any time 
               <br />
               since the war broke out. Right in my native For- 
               <br />
               tune Bay the bright bloom has disappeared from 
               <br />
               our wartime prosperity. Many a family will be 
               <br />
               forced to take dole again in Fortune Bay this 
               <br />
               winter. And Fortune Bay is not the only part of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland where dole is lifting its ugly head 
               <br />
               again. With all the millions of money that poured 
               <br />
               into Newfoundland from the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada these past few years, some people had 
               <br />
               forgotten all about the dole -—- in fact some 
               <br />
               shortsighted people told us that we’d never see a 
               <br />
               poor day again. The way things are going in some 
               <br />
               parts of Newfoundland today, we’re in for 
               <br />
               another period of dole unless something is done 
               <br />
               to stop it, something to make dole unnecessary. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The picture is not all black. The paper mills 
               <br />
               will prosper for the next two or three years. The 
               <br />
               mines also seem to be pretty safe for the next year 
               <br />
               or two or even longer. And some day down in 
               <br />
               Labrador we’ re going to have a big development 
               <br />
               in iron ore. It is satisfying to see these bright 
               <br />
               spots, but we must not make the great mistake of 
               <br />
               imagining that because these industries are 
               <br />
               prosperous now, and will probably be prosperous 
               <br />
               for the next few years, that everything else is 
               <br />
               prosperous and will be prosperous. And we must 
               <br />
               never forget that over half our population lives 
               <br />
               out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁshery.</span> There can be no true prosperity 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland without a prosperous fishery. 
               <br />
               That is something which we must never forget.

               In conclusion, I want to say this: I am quite

               satisfied that our government is self-supporting 
               <br />

               self—supporting. I am satisfied that some of our

               main industries are prosperous and will stay
