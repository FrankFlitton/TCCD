               <br />
               tion of our political position. I have always

               regarded the setting up of a Convention such as 
               <br />

               <br />
               passes further confirms these beliefs. Ihave <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slow»</span> 
               <br />
               ly seen emerge into the light of day the duplicity

               and bad faith which underlies this whole busi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               deliberately sidetracked from the democratic 
               <br />
               highway that we thought we were on into a blind 
               <br />
               alley, where we can spend our time groping for 
               <br />
               progress and getting nowhere. As a result, I say 
               <br />
               that if we do not become aware of these things, 
               <br />
               and turn around on a new course, we are headed 
               <br />
               for danger.

               Let us review things This country was 
               <br />
               promised self-govemment when she became 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfvsupporting.</span> On December 12, 1945, in the 
               <br />
               House of Lords, the Dominions Secretary 
               <br />
               declared that Newfoundland was then self~sup- 
               <br />
               porting, and had been since 1941; and coming 
               <br />
               nearer home, we find that no less an authority 
               <br />
               than former Commissioner for Finance Wild told 
               <br />
               this Convention four months ago that we were 
               <br />
               self-supporting. All right then, we are self—sup- 
               <br />
               porting. These men say we are, and they should 
               <br />
               know. Now then, the first question we ask is, why 
               <br />
               was not this international contract carried out? It 
               <br />
               is a serious thing to break an international <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> 
               <br />
               ment, Mr. Chairman. Yet not alone was this done, 
               <br />
               but no reason was given us for such default. What 
               <br />
               does this mean and what impression must we, as 
               <br />
               sensible men, gather from this? I submit there is 
               <br />
               only one deduction we can make, and this is that 
               <br />
               the British government has not kept faith with us; 
               <br />
               that it was not in their interest that we should have 
               <br />
               control of our own country. And so determined 
               <br />
               were they to carry out their plan, that they did not 
               <br />
               hesitate to treat an international agreement as just 
               <br />
               another scrap of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paper.</span> Is this the situation which 
               <br />
               confronts us today? Must we look for duplicity 
               <br />
               where we should look for straightforward deal- 
               <br />
               ing? But let us go on and study the character of 
               <br />
               the thing further.

               <br />

               either ourselves or the work which we had under- 
               <br />
               taken? For myself, as a member of a committee 
               <br />
               of this Convention, 1 have been time and time 
               <br />
               again unable to get the information I requested. 1 
               <br />
               have been refused information, sometimes al- 
               <br />
               most insolently refused. Other committees have 
               <br />
               indicated that they have been greeted with the 
               <br />
               same hostility and lack of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co-operation.</span> [remem- 
               <br />
               ber one extraordinary instance, when the govern- 
               <br />
               ment refused information on confidential 
               <br />
               grounds, and shortly after I saw the whole thing 
               <br />
               published in pamphlet form in the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. Could there be anything more farcical? 
               <br />
               Here they tell us we are an assembly appointed 
               <br />
               and authorised to get facts, and yet when we go 
               <br />
               to the very people who so appointed as -— when 
               <br />
               we go to the normal source — we are, in so many 
               <br />
               words told to go about our business. I say again, 
               <br />
               does this conduct indicate anything? Does it not 
               <br />
               indicate beyond all reasonable doubt, that the 
               <br />
               Commission government and the Dominions Of- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               is today, and how our affairs are being managed? 
               <br />
               Does it not clearly show that we are regarded as 
               <br />
               a body without either importance or standing; 
               <br />
               that we are not being taken seriously; that they 
               <br />
               have given us the glory, but that the power 
               <br />
               remains with themselves? What would you say, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, if you were doing business with a 
               <br />
               man and he treated you that way? You would say 
               <br />
               that he was a trickster and a deceiver; refuse to 
               <br />
               have anything to do with him any longer. You 
               <br />
               would cease to put faith in him. But let us see if 
               <br />
               we cannot also prove what 1 have said in a dif~
