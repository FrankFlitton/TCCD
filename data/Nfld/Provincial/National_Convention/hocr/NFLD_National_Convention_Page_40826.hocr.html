               highly unfair to the intelligence of our people to 
               <br />
               bring up these matters. Everybody knows that in 
               <br />
               this country, as in every other country, there are 
               <br />
               people out of work. I am told that last fall in the 
               <br />
               Maritime provinces there were 30,000 people out 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work,</span> They had some work in Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec, and as a result 3,000 workers in the 
               <br />
               Maritimes had to migrate to Quebec to get work. 
               <br />
               You have it there, in the USA, in Great Britain, 
               <br />
               and all over the world. Let us look at the general 
               <br />
               aspect and not pick out a few isolated cases. It is 
               <br />
               unfortunate that we have those isolated cases, but 
               <br />
               you will have them under whatever form of 
               <br />
               government you have to rule this country. You 
               <br />
               are bound to have them. If the Finance Commit- 
               <br />
               tee were unfair in painting what has been called 
               <br />
               too rosy a picture of our economy, if they were 
               <br />
               not honest in that, does that smack more of 
               <br />
               dishonesty than getting up and picking out a few 
               <br />
               isolated cases, and holding them up to our people, 
               <br />
               and trying to persuade them that this country is

               rotten at heart?

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I said last night 
               <br />
               that I had no intention of making any further 
               <br />
               contribution to this debate, and I don’t intend to 
               <br />
               make a speech now. There are just two points 
               <br />
               made by Mr. Hollett in comrnent on the speech 
               <br />
               delivered here yesterday by Mr. Bradley, upon 
               <br />
               which I would like to offer my own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interpreta»</span> 
               <br />
               tion. Mr. Hollett referred to the fact that Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley took a period of 50 years of the 
               <br />
               govemment’s history, beginning 1890 and en— 
               <br />
               ding 1939, leaving the war, this late war. out of 
               <br />
               the picture altogether. Surely it was clear to 
               <br />
               everyone who heard that speech that Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               did that for a purpose, that he named his purpose, 
               <br />
               he described his purpose; he was examining the 
               <br />
               contention of the Economic Report that our 
               <br />
               present revenues are due to anything but the war. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman As a matter of fact, on that point 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller rose to a point of order and I ruled on 
               <br />
               it, and said that it was obvious that he was setting 
               <br />
               out to prove that very thing, or trying to prove it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, he pointed out how the 
               <br />
               Economic Report was claiming that our swollen 
               <br />
               revenues are due to anything but the war.... That 
               <br />
               was the whole point he was making, to show that 
               <br />
               the report was wrong in its conclusion, he giving 
               <br />
               his conclusion that the war did swell these 
               <br />
               revenues.

               I would not be attempting, Mr. Chairman, to

               <br />

               <br />
               He had not been out of doors for two weeks when 
               <br />
               he came here yesterday. He came here, delivered

               his speech and went back immediately to his 
               <br />

               that, and l remember also that I got this impres-

               sion from what he said: that it was not under the 
               <br />
               compulsion of the United States government, and 
               <br />
               I agree with him completely. The Government of
