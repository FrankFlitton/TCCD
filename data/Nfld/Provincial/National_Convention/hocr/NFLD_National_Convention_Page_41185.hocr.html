               Mr. Chairman, in 1933 we made an error. It 
               <br />
               has not taken me from 1933 to 1947 to realise 
               <br />
               that. I said so at the time to an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex«Commissioner</span> 
               <br />
               — an English Commissioner —— and I do not 
               <br />
               think I will be breaking conﬁdence if I say that 
               <br />
               he agreed that we had made a mistake on the 
               <br />
               grounds that we had gotten ourselves in a mess 
               <br />
               and we did not ourselves face up to it. What I am 
               <br />
               afraid of, in the approach to this problem, is that 
               <br />
               we will do exactly the same thing. There has been 
               <br />
               a lot of talk here about the Labrador....

               Mr. Butt Just before recess I was about to say a 
               <br />
               few words about clause 2. That is the one which 
               <br />
               deals with Labrador. I was saying we have heard 
               <br />
               a lot of talk about Labrador. “It cannot happen to 
               <br />
               us”, some will say, “it was all settled legally.” So 
               <br />
               was the case which led to the French ﬁshing 
               <br />
               rights of 1857 all settled legally, but as a result of 
               <br />
               the willingness of the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               — and I think none was for the party and all were 
               <br />
               for the state <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> Newfoundlanders got together 
               <br />
               and fought for the rights of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               citizens, and we got what is termed today, or what 
               <br />
               used to be termed, the “Magna Carta of New- 
               <br />
               foundland”. It has been referred to on two or three 
               <br />
               occasions in this chamber. It reads like this: “The 
               <br />
               proposals contained in the Convention having 
               <br />
               now been unequivocally refused by the Colony, 
               <br />
               they will of course’fall to the ground and you [the 
               <br />
               Governor] are authorised to give such assurance 
               <br />
               as you may think proper that the consent of the 
               <br />
               Colony of Newfoundland is regarded by His 
               <br />
               Majesty’s Government as an essential prelimi— 
               <br />

               <br />
               maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights."1</span> All very legal! What about the 
               <br />
               territorial rights given in 1940 at the expense of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland? Were we asked to give our con— 
               <br />
               sent to the modiﬁcation of our territory? The

               answer, of course, is “no”. Here is a point I do not 
               <br />
               like. If we ever as much consider that we, as 
               <br />
               young Newfoundlanders, should ask, should 
               <br />
               think about asking, for concessions of some kind 
               <br />
               or another on behalf of our people (this has hap- 
               <br />
               pened to me), we are treated as naive, simple 
               <br />
               schoolboys (age, Mr. Bradleyl). But not the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State! When we discussed the matter 
               <br />
               with him, what he said to us in effect was this: 
               <br />
               “There are political considerations why the 
               <br />
               Government of the United Kingdom should not 
               <br />
               approach the United States on this matter; but 
               <br />
               now, if you had your own government, you could 
               <br />
               make a try.” What is the relevancy of what I have 
               <br />
               just said to clause 2? In my opinion, just this: on 
               <br />
               paper, that clause is ﬁne. I have no doubt about 
               <br />
               it. It is perfectly legal. But in the world of power 
               <br />
               politics of the higher level, in the world of big 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial interests, there is only one force that can 
               <br />
               put teeth in a clause which looks all right on 
               <br />
               paper, and that is the willingness of the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, however small we may be in 
               <br />
               number, to ﬁght to keep our rights. Now, sir, 
               <br />
               when I use the word “ﬁght", I do not necessarily 
               <br />
               mean ﬁght <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">physically“.</span> If you look in the world 
               <br />
               of nations and power politics today, you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               there is (to use the new term) a cold war being 
               <br />
               fought today between the nations of the world. A 
               <br />
               cold war can be fought with material possessions, 
               <br />
               and it can also be fought with staying power on 
               <br />
               the part of the people. In this connection, I come 
               <br />
               back to my ﬁrst point, which is in my personal 
               <br />
               opinion the only thing that could put real teeth in 
               <br />
               a clause of this kind. Newfoundland and New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, at some time in our long history, 
               <br />
               should be able to stand together and say, “We 
               <br />
               have certain rights in this country; we are going 
               <br />
               to have those rights; insofar as we have the power 
               <br />
               we are going to ﬁght to see we keep them; if we 
               <br />
               do lose them we will know we have kept the only 
               <br />
               thing which matters, and that is the drive to go 
               <br />
               forward in the material and spiritual progress of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland."

               Now I would like to turn to the public services
