               about the terrible taxes they have in Canada 
               <br />
               federal taxes, provincial taxes and municipal 
               <br />
               taxes, income and corporation taxes, and estate,

               taxes, until he was almost out of breath reeling 
               <br />
               off the list. By the time he had ﬁnished he almost 
               <br />
               had us in tears for the poor, poverty-stricken 
               <br />
               Canadians, crushed beneath that awful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">burden.</span> 
               <br />
               We wondered how the Canadians manage to 
               <br />
               breathe, let alone live. The one thing we simply 
               <br />
               could not understand is how Canada managed to 
               <br />
               exist at all during the ﬁve years of war, for if they 
               <br />
               have this awful burden of taxation today, what 
               <br />
               must they have had during the war, because since 
               <br />
               the war ended three different reductions have 
               <br />
               been made in Canada’s taxes. The only trouble 
               <br />
               with Major Cashin’s list is that by changing the 
               <br />
               names of some of them it is our own New- 
               <br />
               foundland we would have thought he was talking 
               <br />
               about, for here in Newfoundland we have income 
               <br />
               taxes, bank taxes, excise taxes, mining taxes, 
               <br />
               lumber taxes, stumpage taxes, motor taxes, 
               <br />
               drivers’ taxes, restaurant taxes, hospital taxes, 
               <br />
               harbour taxes, radio taxes, death taxes, accident 
               <br />
               insurance taxes, game license taxes, waterpower 
               <br />
               taxes, insurance agents’ taxes, dog taxes, mining 
               <br />
               prospectors‘ taxes, boiler inspection taxes. We 
               <br />
               have our beautiful, our artistic, our delightful 
               <br />
               customs taxes which grab more out of us than all 
               <br />
               those other taxes put together. Mr. Chairman, let 
               <br />
               us not allow our common sense to become 
               <br />
               paralysed just by the mere mention of the word 
               <br />
               taxes. Let us keep our feet on the ground. There 
               <br />
               are taxes that fall heavily on the poorest of the 
               <br />
               poor, and taxes that fall lightly on the richest of 
               <br />
               the rich. For example, if you will turn to page 73 
               <br />
               of vol. 1 of the Black Books, you will see some- 
               <br />
               thing that should make you think. It is a table 
               <br />
               supplied us ofﬁcially by the Tax Assessor’s of— 
               <br />
               ﬁce and it shows us the proﬁts cleaned up in the 
               <br />
               year 1945 by our companies and ﬁrms in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. You will find that 105 companies 
               <br />
               declared a combined proﬁt between them that 
               <br />
               year of over $15 million.... And what tax did they 
               <br />
               pay the government on those $15.5 million? Just 
               <br />
               a third —— $5.5 million in taxes. That is not how 
               <br />
               they do it in Canada. But it is how we do it in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. We allow <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">100.0dd</span> concerns to 
               <br />
               clean up $15 million in just one year, and the 
               <br />
               government takes only $5 million from them in 
               <br />
               taxes -— but meanwhile our babies, our children,

               million distributed in dividends to a few

               talks about taxes in Canada!

               Major Cashin devoted himself also to the 
               <br />
               question of family allowances. He says they are 
               <br />
               held out as bait to Newfoundland. How can that 
               <br />
               be, when the fact of the matter is that family 
               <br />
               allowances came into force long before this con- 
               <br />
               federation talk started at all, long before this 
               <br />
               Convention was even thought of? Major Cashin 
               <br />
               must think Canada wants us pretty badly if they 
               <br />
               are willing to pay out $250 million a year in 
               <br />
               family allowances to her own peOple just to pro- 
               <br />
               vide a bait to Newfoundland. Then he gets off the 
               <br />
               prize one of all - he will never live it down as 
               <br />
               long as he lives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> when he calls family allowan— 
               <br />
               ces “immoral legislation”. I think that is the most 
               <br />
               grotesque statementl have heard in this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion since it began —— to call family allowances 
               <br />
               “immoral”. The churches in Canada have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sup</span> 
               <br />
               ported family allowances, the clergymen —— and 
               <br />
               speaking of clergymen, it was Father Labelle 
               <br />
               who was the great pioneer advocate of family 
               <br />
               allowances in Canada — the trade unions, co- 
               <br />
               operative societies, social welfare agencies and 
               <br />
               organisations, and all political parties and leaders 
               <br />
               of Canada have supported family allowances, 
               <br />
               and do so today. All these and many, many others 
               <br />
               have hailed family allowances, and praised and 
               <br />
               supported them as the best piece of legislation so 
               <br />
               far introduced into the New World; but Major
