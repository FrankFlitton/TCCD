               previous motion which had been brought to this

               political set-ups which were then introduced

               people wished that to be so. They do wish it in

               wish to have these political set—ups which I rose

               During my time in this Convention I have 
               <br />
               never committed myself to any political view. I

               <br />

               It is quite possible in this world of ours to think 
               <br />
               independently. We live and move and have our

               personal feeling that this is one time in ourhistory

               pendently after weighing the whole situation 
               <br />
               from every angle, and, having decided that we are 
               <br />
               on the right track, then it is an honourable thing

               As we look out upon world conditions, and as

               we consider Newfoundland’s general position, 
               <br />
               we consider the lack of industries in this country, 
               <br />
               and the irregular earnings of a large number of

               looking back on this Convention and what we

               have learned, and weighing matters in general in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland -— there is this burning question: 
               <br />
               for what shall I vote in the national referendum? 
               <br />
               And it is a reasonable question. It is a question 
               <br />
               which I ask myself, and I know of lots that are 
               <br />
               asking the same question... I am fully aware 
               <br />
               that whatever form of government New- 
               <br />
               foundland may have in the future, our path will 
               <br />
               not be strewn with roses. There is the possible 
               <br />
               aftermath of war. What shape it will take I know 
               <br />
               not, but history usually repeats itself. We had a
