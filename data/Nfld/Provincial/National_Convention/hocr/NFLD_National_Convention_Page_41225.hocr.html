               <br />
               province?" They don’t. What do they do? They 
               <br />
               simply put on a number of taxes. They have a 
               <br />
               number of taxes, but the bulk of the revenue 
               <br />
               comes from income tax and the corporation tax. 
               <br />
               The bulk of their revenue will naturally come 
               <br />
               from those parts of Canada where most of the 
               <br />
               very wealthy industries and corporations, and 
               <br />
               wealthy individuals are. Those places happen to 
               <br />
               be the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British 
               <br />
               Columbia. They pay 89% of all the revenue the 
               <br />
               Canadian government collects, and that leaves 
               <br />
               only 11% of the revenue to come from the six 
               <br />
               other provinces. This shows very clearly what 
               <br />
               truth there is in Major Cashin’s statement, that 
               <br />
               we would have to pay our proportionate share of 
               <br />
               the Canadian govemment’s revenue. In three of 
               <br />
               the provinces of Canada, the three I mentioned, 
               <br />
               the Canadian government collects much more 
               <br />
               money than they pay out; in the other six provin- 
               <br />
               ces the Canadian government pays out much 
               <br />
               more money than they collect —- the same as they 
               <br />
               will do in Newfoundland. I have explained all 
               <br />
               this before, and it is very tiring to have speakers 
               <br />
               telling us that we will have to pay our propor- 
               <br />
               tionate share of Canada’s revenue, but I suppose 
               <br />
               the anticonfederates must have something to use 
               <br />
               against confederation.

               I come to a really important subject, a matter 
               <br />
               about which Major Cashin had a great deal to say. 
               <br />
               I refer to the present commotion with regard to 
               <br />
               the shortage of United States dollars in Canada. 
               <br />
               He summed it up with a sort of epigram when he 
               <br />
               told us that Canada had sent out an SOS to Uncle 
               <br />
               Sam for ﬁnancial help. Now what is the truth in 
               <br />
               that matter? Last year the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               had a surplus of $352 million, nearly $1 million 
               <br />
               a day for every day of the year. That is, they met 
               <br />
               all their expenses as a government for the year 
               <br />
               and had $352 million left over. This present year 
               <br />
               does not end until the spring, yet already they 
               <br />
               have another surplus, but this time of over $500 
               <br />
               million and still climbing. Does that sound like 
               <br />
               the Canadian government being hard up, or any- 
               <br />
               thing like that? I would remind you that during 
               <br />
               the year the Government of Canada gave Great 
               <br />
               Britain free, free, a gift, ﬁrst of $800 million, then 
               <br />
               $1 million, and then $425 million. I would 
               <br />
               remind you that since the war ended Canada has 
               <br />
               loaned to Great Britain $700 million, and on top 
               <br />
               of that $125 billion. I would remind you that to 
               <br />

               other countries Canada has loaned another $3 
               <br />
               billion. These figures hardly sound like poverty, 
               <br />
               do they sir? That is the Government of Canada; 
               <br />
               but what about the people of Canada, her in- 
               <br />
               dustries, her general economy? Well, the answer 
               <br />
               is that never in history was Canada so well off, 
               <br />
               so prosperous, so booming as she is right now. 
               <br />
               Her industries this very year just past have set up 
               <br />
               new records for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">production.</span> Her exports of goods 
               <br />
               around the world have established a new record,

               greater even than during the war. A record num—

               <br />
               records have been established in the past year. 
               <br />
               They will be broken again this year, but in 1947 
               <br />
               new records were established in Canada for the 
               <br />
               number of brand new industries starting up. Do 
               <br />
               you know that there are in Canada today over 200 
               <br />
               entirely new products more being manufactured 
               <br />
               than there were three years ago? In many parts of 
               <br />
               Canada today things are booming so much that 
               <br />
               there is actually a shortage of manpower, and 
               <br />
               Canada is bringing immigrants and settlers in by 
               <br />
               the tens of thousands. They are even ﬂying them 
               <br />
               in, and they have plans to bring in hundreds of 
               <br />
               thousands of settlers from Great Britain and other 
               <br />
               parts of Europe.

               Sir, this will interest you. In the ﬁrst ten 
               <br />
               months of 1947, do you know how many people 
               <br />
               went into Canada from Newfoundland to settle 
               <br />
               down and become Canadians? Sir, I would ven-

               <br />
               number of Newfoundlanders who went to 
               <br />
               Canada in the ﬁrst ten months of 1947. Ihave not

               brothers of my own; two others are sisters of my

               out of Newfoundland, i like to see them stick it 
               <br />
