               Prince Albert. I would like the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               to have a look at that and then come back to 
               <br />
               criticise our own. Then if we take the whole 
               <br />
               Canadian railway system, we ﬁnd that the road- 
               <br />
               beds from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc have been 
               <br />
               overtaxed, particularly during the period of 
               <br />
               World War Two, and like our own New- 
               <br />
               foundland Railway which is now being re- 
               <br />
               equipped, the Canadian systems require 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions of dollars capital expendi— 
               <br />
               tures in order to put the roadbeds and rolling 
               <br />
               stock in proper shape. Again, I say, it would be 
               <br />
               interesting to know also, what the deﬁcits of the 
               <br />
               Canadian National Railways have been since 
               <br />
               1919, what capital expenditures have been in- 
               <br />
               curred on them, and then compare these deﬁcits 
               <br />
               and capital expenditures on a per capita basis 
               <br />
               with similar ones on our own Newfoundland 
               <br />
               railway system. I venture the offhand opinion 
               <br />
               that our own Railway, with its various sub- 
               <br />
               sidiaries, has been operated on a more economic 
               <br />
               basis than those of the Canadian National <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system,</span>

               delegation should have been informed during 
               <br />
               their three months’ stay at Ottawa. But it appears 
               <br />
               to me that instead of this delegation meeting the 
               <br />
               representatives of the Canadian government on 
               <br />
               equal, if not superior grounds, that they ap-

               proached the Canadians in a more or less subser- 
               <br />
               vient manner. It would appear from information 
               <br />
               dragged from Mr. Smallwood during the course 
               <br />
               of this long and somewhat tiring debate, that the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland delegation to Ottawa went there 
               <br />
               not as representatives of a proud and independent 
               <br />
               people, but rather did they talk as a delegation 
               <br />
               from a bankrupt country and a pauperised people. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No, we did not. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin You did not ask them anything 
               <br />
               about their own affairs. You tell us nothing about 
               <br />
               the CNR. I want to know what is behind their 
               <br />
               money. Before we go into partnership, we have 
               <br />
               to know what is the standing of the Bank of 
               <br />

               With respect to this railway situation, the point 
               <br />
               which concerns our people is, that should we go 
               <br />
               into confederation we will have to shoulder our 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood has everything painted a rosy 
               <br />
               pink. He apparently ran out of all his black paint 
               <br />

               There is mention made of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Airport which was bought by us from the 
               <br />
               Canadian government at a cost of $1 million. We 
               <br />
               are, it seems, supposed to throw this into the 
               <br />
               Canadian jackpot as a present to Canada. Here 
               <br />
               again is a case of our being deprived of a possible 
               <br />
               source of future income. This airport is valuable, 
               <br />
               not alone because of its commercial possibilities, 
               <br />
               buteven more so because of its strategic position. 
               <br />
               And it is my ﬁrm conviction that, properly 
               <br />
               operated and properly managed, it could be a 
               <br />

               Again, this precious Grey Book tells us that, 
               <br />
               under confederation, we will have to set aside one 
               <br />
               third of our accumulated surplus, which would 
               <br />
               amount to roughly $10 million, in trust with the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada — to be used only, so the 
               <br />
               orders run, only for expenditure on current ac— 
               <br />
               count of the Province of Newfoundland. The rest, 
               <br />
               we are told, we can use in the development of our 
               <br />
               local resources. But there is a string to this. We 
               <br />
               must not, and we will not be allowed to use our 
               <br />
               own money to subsidise our own sources of 
               <br />
               production if they compete with similar 
               <br />
               Canadian products. In other words, Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister King says we will not be allowed to assist 
               <br />
               with our own money our ﬁsheries, our forests or 
               <br />
               such other Newfoundland industries. This we are 
               <br />
               told we must agree with before we are granted the 
               <br />
               priceless privilege of being allowed to call our— 
               <br />
               selves Canadians. Is not this, I ask you, an ex- 
               <br />
               ample of unmitigated gall? For 14 years the 
               <br />
               agents of the British government have been doing 
               <br />
               what they like with our treasury, and now the 
               <br />
               Canadian government proposes to step in and do 
               <br />
               the same thing. In short, we are asked to exchange 
               <br />
               one form of dictatorship for another. Miss <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland seems to be in a position of a wealthy

               matrimony business seems to be a matter of 
               <br />
