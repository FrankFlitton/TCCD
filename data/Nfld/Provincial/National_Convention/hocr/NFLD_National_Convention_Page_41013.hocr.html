               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the 
               <br />
               gracious and chamiing things the Hon. Mr. Job 
               <br />
               has said. I think there is something utterly 
               <br />
               delightful in the naivete with which he suggests 
               <br />
               that we might perhaps drop this question of con- 
               <br />
               federation. And on what basis? On the basis that 
               <br />
               Major Cashin doubts the accuracy of one or two 
               <br />
               items in this table here compiled. Major Cashin 
               <br />
               has a right to doubt it. He has directed a question 
               <br />
               asking the Government of Newfoundland — no, 
               <br />
               sir, not to break down this same table, that is 
               <br />
               something completely different. This is a table 
               <br />
               compiled by the Government of Canada giving 
               <br />
               the estimate of what revenue they would collect 
               <br />
               from the people of Newfoundland if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New.</span> 
               <br />
               foundland became a province. in doing that they 
               <br />
               have tried to picture Newfoundland’s trade as a 
               <br />
               province, and on that basis they have compiled 
               <br />
               that table. Major Cashin has asked our govern- 
               <br />
               ment not to picture Newfoundland as a province, 
               <br />
               but only to picture Newfoundland paying the 
               <br />
               Canadian rates of tariff on the trade we are now 
               <br />
               doing, not on the trade that we would do if we 
               <br />
               were a province. I suggest this to Major Cashin 
               <br />
               now, that he ask the Government of Canada in 
               <br />
               reSpect of this table the same thing that Mr. Hol- 
               <br />
               lett has asked the Government of Canada in 
               <br />
               respect of the table on the next page. Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               has asked them to give us more details of what 
               <br />
               the Canadian government will spend in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Now I suggest that he or Major 
               <br />
               Cashin, or someone, ask the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada more detail of the estimate of what they 
               <br />
               will collect from Newfoundland. if it is suggested 
               <br />
               that this thing is so hopelessly wrong, let’s get at 
               <br />
               the bottom of it.

               Finance of the Government of Canada is served 
               <br />

               that when they compiled that table of $20 million 
               <br />
               they were just pulling it out of the air like a 
               <br />
               magician. Oh, no! It is based on solid, concrete 
               <br />
               information. And furthermore, don’t suppose 
               <br />
               that when they got that total of $20 million that 
               <br />
               they then took all their basic working pages and 
               <br />
               burnt them. I suggest that it is likely that the 
               <br />
               individual tables of statistics upon which each of 
               <br />
               these items are based are still extant, in the 
               <br />
               various ﬁnancial offices in Ottawa; and i suggest 
               <br />
               that if we sent to them and asked them, politely, 
               <br />
               because they are a friendly government to 
               <br />
               explain in a little more detail the estimate of$3.2 
               <br />
               million a year for income tax that they ﬁgure they 
               <br />
               would get from the people of Newfoundland; if 
               <br />
               you ask them to explain how they arrive at a 
               <br />
               ﬁgure of$7.5 million a year from Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in tax on the companies and corporations. I feel

               that they would give us more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">detail.</span> If you ask 
               <br />
               how they come to the figure of $2 million on 
               <br />
               customs duties and excise taxes. I have little 
               <br />
               doubt that they would give you that information, 
               <br />

               greatest, and don’t think for a moment that this is

               a table that is faked or fraudulent, or that they 
               <br />
               imagined it, that it is without foundation. You are

               talking about a table compiled by the government 
               <br />
               of a great nation. You can’t talk about them as
