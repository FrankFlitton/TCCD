               tonight, because there is just one point in Mr. 
               <br />
               Hillier’s very fair and honourable speech of 
               <br />
               yesterday, one point on which I wish to offer a 
               <br />
               word of comment. It was what he said about 
               <br />
               Canada’s old age pension scheme. Now I happen 
               <br />
               to know that Mr. Hillier is deeply interested in the 
               <br />
               subject of our senior citizens, our old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> I 
               <br />
               agree with Mr. Hillier absolutely when he says 
               <br />
               that the pensions should start before a man or a 
               <br />
               women gets to be 70 years of age. I think he’s 
               <br />
               perfectly right. And I’m sure that he’ll agree with 
               <br />
               me when I say that 75 is a criminal and shameful 
               <br />
               age limit to place on our senior citizens before 
               <br />
               they are entitled to the old age pension. And that’s 
               <br />
               the age, 75, an elderly person has to reach in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland today before we pay him the pen- 
               <br />
               sion. At least Canada is ﬁve years better off in 
               <br />
               that way than Newfoundland because she gives 
               <br />
               the pension at 70. And I agree with Mr. Hillier 
               <br />
               that $30 a month is not a cent too much to pay to 
               <br />
               our wom-out toilers, but surely he’ll agree with 
               <br />
               me when I say that $30 a month for one is a lot 
               <br />
               better then $30 a quarter for two. That’s what we 
               <br />
               pay here in Newfoundland for two elderly per- 
               <br />
               sons, $30 a quarter for the two of them, $10 a 
               <br />
               month. Just compare two elderly persons in the 
               <br />
               two countries. In Newfoundland they have to live 
               <br />
               to be 75 before they get the pension, in Canada 
               <br />
               70. In Newfoundland we pay two persons $30 a 
               <br />
               quarter between them, in Canada they pay $30 a 
               <br />
               month to each of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> What’s the difference? 
               <br />
               The old people in Canada get $60 a month be- 
               <br />
               tween them, whereas two old people in New— 
               <br />
               foundland get $10 a month between them. The 
               <br />
               old couple in Canada are $50 a month better off 
               <br />
               than our old couple, and that’s $600 a year. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I won’t go over the question of a pensioner’s 
               <br />
               property again. I've already explained that 
               <br />
               several times. It’s enough now to say this, that if 
               <br />
               that bit of property is worth $2,000 net or less, the 
               <br />
               pensioner is free to do whatever he likes with it, 
               <br />
               give it to whoever he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">likes.</span> It covers the vast 
               <br />
               quota of the 10,000 old people who would receive 
               <br />
               the old age pension if we go into confederation. 
               <br />
               I would ask Mr. Hillier to cast his mind over his 
               <br />
               own native home, and the other settlements he 
               <br />
               knows in his district, and ask himself how many 
               <br />
               persons of 70 and over have property that would 
               <br />
               fetch over $2,000 cash if it had to be sold. For that 
               <br />
               matter, I would ask all our members, apart from 
               <br />
               those from the capital city and perhaps Grand 
               <br />

               Falls and Corner Brook and one or two other 
               <br />
               places, I’d ask all our members to cast their minds 
               <br />
               over their districts and ask themselves the same 
               <br />
               question. And don’t forget, Mr. Chairman, that if 
               <br />
               an old age pensioner has property that would 
               <br />
               fetch over $2,000, the sons or other relatives still 
               <br />
               have a way to get that property when the old age 
               <br />
               pensioner passes away. They can contribute 
               <br />
               regularly and reasonably to the support of the old 
               <br />
               age pensioner for at least the last three years of 
               <br />
               his life. That’s fair enough, isn’t it?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I have only two more points. Ever since 
               <br />
               the confederation terms were laid before us, 
               <br />
               speaker after speaker amongst the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anticom</span> 
               <br />
               federates has harped and harped and harped on 
               <br />
               the matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> It’s been almost the second 
               <br />
               word in every speech. The impression aimed at 
               <br />
               is that our people would be smothered by taxes, 
               <br />
               that they’d be taxed to death if we enter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con«</span> 
               <br />
               federation. There may be a country somewhere 
               <br />
               in this world where they have no taxes. If there 
               <br />
               is, I’ve never heard of it, unless it’s a country 
               <br />
               without a government. All countries have taxes, 
               <br />
               as we know so well here in Newfoundland. They 
               <br />
               say there are two sure things for all mankind — 
               <br />
               taxes and death. I certainly don’t say that if we 
               <br />
               enter confederation there’ll be no taxes. Now 
               <br />
               there are many principles of taxation, but the 
               <br />
               greatest principles are these two. First, that there 
               <br />
               should be equality of sacriﬁce in paying taxes. 
               <br />
               The second principle is that it’s not so much how 
               <br />
               much taxes you pay, as what you have left after 
               <br />
               you have paid your taxes. These are the two 
               <br />
               greatest principles of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation.</span> I know of no 
               <br />
               country in the world that offends against those 
               <br />
               two principles as much as our own New- 
               <br />
               foundland does. Our chief way of raising taxes in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is through the customs tariff, the 
               <br />
               customs duties on our imports. This is called 
               <br />
               indirect taxation. Of course there are other kinds 
               <br />
               of indirect taxation as well as customs duties, but 
               <br />
               what do we mean by indirect taxes? If a govern- 
               <br />
               ment sends a bill to a man for a certain amount of 
               <br />
               money as his share of paying the cost of running 
               <br />
               the country, and if the man knows exactly how 
               <br />
               much it is and puts his hand in his pocket and pays 
               <br />
               the government himself, then that is direct taxa- 
               <br />
               tion. It is paid directly by the person who is 
               <br />
               supposed to pay it. It goes direct from the tax— 
               <br />
               payer to the government, so to speak... But with 
               <br />
               indirect taxation you have something altOgether 
               <br />
