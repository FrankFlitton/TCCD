               I mention these few facts to show the advan— 
               <br />
               cement made in this branch of the industry, and 
               <br />
               so that our people can realise that we have today 
               <br />
               a more solid and closely-knit operation of this 
               <br />
               part of our primary industry. The development of 
               <br />
               the cold storage division of the ﬁsheries, covering 
               <br />
               our fresh processing and ﬁlletting methods, is 
               <br />
               only now in its infancy, but has rapidly developed 
               <br />
               in the short period in which it has been operating. 
               <br />
               The investment of local capital monies in this 
               <br />
               branch of the ﬁsheries has been tremendous, and 
               <br />
               with the recent acquisition of two new trawlers 
               <br />
               from the USA, is still further providing proof of 
               <br />
               improvement in our ﬁshing methods, as well as 
               <br />
               increasing our production of not only codﬁsh, but 
               <br />
               of many other kinds which are in demand in our 
               <br />
               fresh frozen ﬁsh markets. New developments of 
               <br />
               recent years are the ﬁsh reduction plants, such as 
               <br />
               the herring oil and meal plant at Curling, and the 
               <br />
               one in course of construction at Belleoram. Here 
               <br />
               again we have a new source of national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produc»</span> 
               <br />
               tion which bids fair to become a big factor in the 
               <br />
               economic future. Increased and improved 
               <br />
               methods of whaling have added to our volume 
               <br />
               and value of exports. There is canning of fresh 
               <br />
               codﬁsh at Fogo and the new proposed plant at 
               <br />
               Bay Bulls, and the new herring and mackerel 
               <br />
               canning plant at Petries in Bay of Islands. These 
               <br />
               adventures are all of but a few years of age, and 
               <br />
               are extra developments and additional sources of 
               <br />
               income to our producers that we did not have 
               <br />
               prior to 1939. We live by what we produce and 
               <br />
               export, and these additional industries make our 
               <br />
               economy more solid than ever before.

               <br />
               tion of Newfoundland. Last November, I ex- 
               <br />
               pressed my opinion on this question of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s ﬁnances and its future and gave 
               <br />
               my reasons, together with ﬁgures; and I feel 
               <br />
               strongly that we have a promising, hopeful and, 
               <br />
               above all, a sound future as far as one may care 
               <br />
               to see in this world; and that is as much or more 
               <br />
               as can be said for any other country. If time 
               <br />
               permitted I could considerably add to and enlarge 
               <br />
               on these brief points which I have just covered. 
               <br />
               How any man in this country which has been 
               <br />
               known for its love of independence and re- 
               <br />
               sourcefulness, could fear the future under the 
               <br />
               improved economy and advancement in our in- 
               <br />
               dustries, is more than I can contemplate. We have 
               <br />
               an opportunity that never knocked at the doors of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland before. And if we do not avail of 
               <br />
               this opportunity now to speak for ourselves, 
               <br />
               govern ourselves, and be responsible only to our- 
               <br />
               selves, we will have failed in the greatest moment 
               <br />
               in that proud history.
