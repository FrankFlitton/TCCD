               they have been operating. $1 million out of a 
               <br />
               proﬁt of $18 million! Of course we are pleased 
               <br />
               that we did get that $2.5 million for customs duty, 
               <br />

               I am not inclined to turn handsprings of joy, I

               <br />
               went to work and made them themselves. That 
               <br />
               column for nine months is estimated, but we have 
               <br />

               <br />
               from the Buchans Mining Company for 1946 will 
               <br />
