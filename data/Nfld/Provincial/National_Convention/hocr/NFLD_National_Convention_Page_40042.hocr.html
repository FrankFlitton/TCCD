               It was most encouraging to see that the Con- 
               <br />
               vention did apply itself in the first instance to 
               <br />
               consideration of the economic. I must confess to 
               <br />
               some misgivings at the beginning as to whether 
               <br />

               want to get over the economic hurdle in a hurry

               <br />
               year of so ago I would have said that there was 
               <br />
               much surety of that. There seemed to be much 
               <br />
               surety, too, that the war had brought to us a great 
               <br />
               prosperity. All that wild talk of the great 
               <br />
               prosperity the war brought us was, as far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, just so much unmitigated rot. It was 
               <br />
               not prosperity, if by prosperity you mean full and 
               <br />
               plenty, and some left over that could be put aside. 
               <br />
               In'most cases where there was anything to spare 
               <br />
               it had to go to take up the slack, to replace and to 
               <br />
               restore what had rusted and rotted away in the 
               <br />
               years the locusts ate. All that came of the war jobs 
               <br />

               landers than ever before came a little closer than

               ever before to achieving a decent standard of

               living.

               It is encouraging to see today this great con- 
               <br />
               cern with the question of self-support; and, that, 
               <br />
               gentlemen, is a question upon which we must be

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-supportho</span> my mind, a surer measure of the 
               <br />
               extent to which we are self-supporting is the 
               <br />
               individuals‘ ability to balance his budget and 
               <br />
               have something to spare. This is the acid test, is 
               <br />
               every man who makes an honest effort to make a

               still be able to do so when conditions are no

               longer abnormal? And if you say to me that is 
               <br />
               taking an extreme view, I shall have to ask you 
               <br />
               just what men you are going to require to be 
               <br />

               mum standard of living consistent with human

               Newfoundlander should have to be so satisﬁed,
