               not be of very much value to Newfoundland if the

               United States lowered her customs tariff on ﬁsh

               powerful competitors. No, any concession to us 
               <br />
               along these lines must be given especially to us,

               advantage from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> The question is, just what

               practical chance is there of Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per»</span> 
               <br />
               suading the United States to give her such special, 
               <br />
               such preferential treatment? The argument used 
               <br />
               by those who say they see such a possibility is 
               <br />
               what I might call the bases argument. Nobody has 
               <br />
               yet suggested that out of the goodness of their 
               <br />
               hearts the Americans are likely, at our request, to 
               <br />
               give us such specially favourable treatment. 
               <br />
               Those who tell us of these possibilities of getting 
               <br />
               preferential treatment for our ﬁsh always use this 
               <br />
               bases <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument,</span> This is the quid pro quo argu- 
               <br />
               ment. The British government and the New- 
               <br />
               foundland government in 1941 signed 
               <br />
               agreements with the Americans giving them 99- 
               <br />
               year leases of certain small areas of our territories 
               <br />
               on which to construct defence bases. New- 
               <br />
               foundland got nothing in return —— save, I sup~ 
               <br />
               pose, what all those who are engaged on our side 
               <br />
               of the late war got, the advantage of the defence 
               <br />
               construction that was actually placed here by the 
               <br />
               Americans. But that is the argument, sir, New- 
               <br />
               foundland got nothing in return and so now we 
               <br />
               should go to the Government of the United States 
               <br />
               and ask for something that we should have had in 
               <br />
               1941; and the Government of the United States is 
               <br />
               likely to agree to our request, so we are told. That 
               <br />
               is the argument.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Sir, the ﬁrst hard fact that faces us when we 
               <br />
               consider this matter is that we are proposing to 
               <br />
               lock the stable door after the horse is gone. The 
               <br />
               lease agreements were signed in 1941. This is 
               <br />
               1947, nearly 1948. The lawful government 
               <br />
               signed the leases, not under any compulsion from 
               <br />
               the United States of America, but gladly, and 
               <br />
               with the feeling that they were doing something 
               <br />
               to help in time of dire peril, and with the feeling 
               <br />
               also that they had the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               with them in their action. The leases are signed, 
               <br />
               the deal is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closed,</span> The bases are here. There has 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 778 189 1322 1883">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               not been the slightest scrap of evidence to hint 
               <br />
               that the Americans would even consider opening 
               <br />
               up that deal again. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But suppose that in spite of these facts, the 
               <br />
               Government of the United States, who are not 
               <br />
               woolly-minded sentimentalists remember, but 
               <br />
               hard-headed men of affairs, suppose that they 
               <br />
               went so far as to agree that we had a good case in 
               <br />
               equity. Would they then give us that for which 
               <br />
               we ask? Certainly the high permanent ofﬁcials of 
               <br />
               the State Department and of the Department of 
               <br />
               Commerce, and of the United States Treasury, as 
               <br />
               well as the members of the Cabinet, would give 
               <br />
               careful consideration to all aspects of the matter 
               <br />
               before granting our request. And just as certainly 
               <br />
               as they would take those special aspects into 
               <br />
               careful account, so it is wise and prudent that we 
               <br />
               should consider‘ them in this Convention. One 
               <br />
               aspect which the Government of the United 
               <br />
               States would be bound to weigh is the fact that 
               <br />
               they have defence bases in other places besides 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Those bases were acquired by 
               <br />
               the United States at about the same time as those 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. If they give Newfoundland 
               <br />
               special trade concessions because they have 
               <br />
               bases here, must they not in consistency and 
               <br />
               justice give similar concessions to those other 
               <br />
               countries? That is something for us to consider. 
               <br />
               Another aspect which the United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> 
               <br />
               ment would take into account is their policy of 
               <br />
               never mixing trade concessions with military, 
               <br />
               naval, and air concessions. That is a definite 
               <br />
               policy of the United States of America. To do so 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland would be quite a novelty and 
               <br />
               would be to create a precedent which, as they 
               <br />
               would be quick to note, might be fraught with all 
               <br />
               kinds of possibilities for the future. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Still another aspect which the Government of 
               <br />
               the United States would undoubtedly consider 
               <br />
               carefully is the effect that special trade conces~ 
               <br />
               sions to Newfoundland might have upon the 
               <br />
               greatest cash customer the United States has in 
               <br />
               the world. I refer to Canada, which buys many 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods 
               <br />
               from her each year. The United States and 
               <br />
               Canada are each other‘s greatest customer. The 
               <br />
               trade, ﬁnancial, political, and defence relations 
               <br />
               between them are probably closer than any other 
               <br />
               two countries in the world. Each of these two 
               <br />
               great countries is represented by an ambassador 
               <br />
               in the capital of the other, and the relationship
