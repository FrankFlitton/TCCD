               <br />
               supply of United States dollars at a rate that began

               <br />
               they have done is this: the government has 
               <br />
               selected a list of things that Canadians are not 
               <br />
               allowed to import from the United States, not 
               <br />
               things that you must have, but things that you can 
               <br />
               do without. For the next year or so Canadians will 
               <br />
               have to do without such things or make them

               <br />

               <br />
               Canadian government has made up another small 
               <br />
               list of things, which they have not exactly 
               <br />
               prohibited from being imported from the United 
               <br />
               States, but they have put a higher excise tax on 
               <br />
               them to discourage people from buying them in 
               <br />

               <br />
               comes to an end. In the meantime, having

               adopted these temporary ways of saving the

               Canada from an agricultural economy into an

               very trying days of peace. Canada has deliberate-

               wheat, for example, and is selling it to Britain this

               <br />
               $1.55 for it. She could sell every bit of it for 
               <br />
               American dollars at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3.25</span> a bushel, and that

               would give her lots of American dollars. Instead

               of grabbing this opportunity to sell her vast 
               <br />
               products for American dollars, Canada prefers to 
               <br />
               continue her assistance to Great Britain, not only 
               <br />
               selling at lower prices than she could get else—

               very helpful to try and paint this temporary
