               fact that Newfoundland was suffering because of 
               <br />
               her debt, and England was now suffering because 
               <br />
               of certain debts contracted because of the war, 
               <br />
               and so were we, but at the same time we were 
               <br />
               asking for something to be done; and on that same 
               <br />
               date the daily newspapers carried the heading 
               <br />
               “Lord Dalton declares war on war debts”. Lord 
               <br />
               Addison had never heard of Alberta or Australian 
               <br />
               war ﬁnance. He had never heard of these things 
               <br />
               except insofar as Newfoundland was concerned, 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland was asked to pay.... The point 
               <br />
               is this: that the British government, and make no 
               <br />
               doubt about it, have already started to scale down 
               <br />
               these war debts, and in one way and another they 
               <br />
               will do it, and it is up to Newfoundland to see that 
               <br />
               our debts, no matter how contracted, which are 
               <br />
               having a disastrous effect, ought to have been put 
               <br />
               in the background. We were faced with an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un»</span>

               compromising, “This is a Newfoundland obliga-

               Now we turn to the interest-free loans. All we 
               <br />
               wanted to say was that by using these dollars over 
               <br />
               there Newfoundland would be helped and they 
               <br />
               would do the right thing by Newfoundland.

               I skip over the development loans — they are 
               <br />
               not really important at the moment — and come 
               <br />
               to the various base deals, and here I have no 
               <br />
               words to express my indignation at the way in 
               <br />
               which a government acting as trustees for the 
               <br />
               people violated our sovereign rights. Coldly they 
               <br />
               come back to us with this statement, “There is no 
               <br />
               reason to think that the United States government 
               <br />
               will be prepared to agree to any substantial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">varia</span> 
               <br />
               tion.” In other words, “Run along home. We did 
               <br />
               this and we are not going to ﬁnd out if there is 
               <br />
               any reason.” It was not like that in 1857.1 The 
               <br />
               French ﬁshermen were given a guarantee of an 
               <br />
               unlimited amount of bait. What happened then? 
               <br />
               The Newfoundland government protested 
               <br />
               strongly, and it resulted in a statement of an 
               <br />
               important principle. It reads like this:

               many years in my lifetime: “Oh but you get the 
               <br />

               <br />
               is true that we got the labour, but if your deﬁcit
