               eight years of our country’s history, the total 
               <br />
               value of the goods exported from Newfoundland 
               <br />
               was $359 million, and in those years the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">g0vem~</span> 
               <br />
               ment took from us in taxes $169 million, or 46%. 
               <br />
               Let us look just at the last three years. In 1945, 
               <br />
               the total value of all the goods exported from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was nearly $49 million, and the 
               <br />
               expenditure by the government — taxes taken 
               <br />
               from us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-——~</span> was $22.75 million or 46% of our total 
               <br />
               expenditure, our total exports. Now in 1946, the 
               <br />
               value of our exports was $61 million. It went up 
               <br />
               a bit. But the government that year look or spent 
               <br />
               $29 million or 48%. And in 1947, the total value 
               <br />
               of our exports was $62 million, thus the govem~ 
               <br />
               ment took $37 million or 60%. If you average it, 
               <br />
               for the last three years, you will ﬁnd that over 
               <br />
               51% of the total value of all the goods exported 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland was taken by the govem- 
               <br />
               ment and spent on public service.

               Mr. Cashin That is not correct. The ordinary

               <br />
               that there was about $50 million each year on 
               <br />
