               Mr. Butt I disagree entirely that the Chairman 
               <br />
               should have not only a vote, but the casting vote. 
               <br />
               I am a bit worried about the question of voting as 
               <br />
               far as the Chairman is concerned. I disagree also 
               <br />
               with Mr. Smallwood when he suggests that be— 
               <br />
               cause Mr. Winter was a member of the Commis— 
               <br />
               sion of Government it might be unwise to appoint 
               <br />
               him. In that particular case there would be no 
               <br />
               doubt at all about his impartiality, even though he 
               <br />
               has been a member of the Commission of 
               <br />

               <br />
               position would not be suitable, but I have no 
               <br />
               objection to the proposal of Major Cashin, 
               <br />
               provided we can consider the question of voting. 
               <br />
               The Chairman would be in a rather difﬁcult posi- 
               <br />
               tion when debate gets a bit heated and he would 
               <br />
               have to think about his position as chairman, and 
               <br />
               also of how he is going to vote, not only in the 
               <br />
               minor matters, but in the main decision, which in 
               <br />
               my opinion takes all of any man’s time. On the 
               <br />
               question of voting I would like to reserve our

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, the Speaker in 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the ofﬁcial seat where he sat as chairman. In 
               <br />
               the old days, and in any parliament, the Speaker 
               <br />
               vacated the Chair and occupied his private seat 
               <br />
               and took part in the debate. I have seen and heard 
               <br />
               Judge Fox do it, and Mr. Winter and Mr. Penney 
               <br />

               <br />
               have seen them vote. They don’t avail of their 
               <br />
               right to speak or vote on everything that crops up, 
               <br />

               should not give the casting vote.

               <br />
               opinion. I give such thought to it, and I hesitate 
               <br />
               to see him out of the position where he would be

               Mr. Ashboume I consider that every member

               of this Convention has been given by his people 
               <br />
               the power to vote, and whether he is in the Chair 
               <br />
               or whatever he is I don't think that vote should 
               <br />

               his position, and I don’t advocate that that power 
               <br />
               be given him of the casting vote, but rather than 
               <br />
               take away his power to vote at all, my idea would 
               <br />
               be to give him more power, that is the casting 
               <br />
               vote, certainly we ought not to deprive him of his 
               <br />
               vote. The Chairman, Judge Fox, was appointed 
               <br />
               by the government and he could not have a vote, 
               <br />

               <br />
               that was elected by the people, and naturally if 
               <br />
               the people sent him here, they sent him to exer-

               have to forget that this is not the government, but 
               <br />
               it is a Convention. When a Speaker is appointed 
               <br />
               by the government he is entirely in favour of the 
               <br />
               government, although he tries to conduct matters 
               <br />
               as best he can, but his opinions are definitely in 
               <br />
               favour of the government. If we appoint a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of this Convention immediately this man is in 
               <br />
               an analogous position. If he casts his vote he will 
               <br />
               always be partial. I can’t see how he can be 
               <br />
               anything else.

               Mr. Smallwood There is no objection to his

               <br />

               partial, he must have his oWn personal beliefs, but 
               <br />
