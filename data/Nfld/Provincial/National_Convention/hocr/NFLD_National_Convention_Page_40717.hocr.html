               <br />
               economy as I consider it. When I was a member 
               <br />
               of this Finance Committee considering this 
               <br />
               Economic Reportl stated at the start thatI did not 
               <br />
               think it necessary to introduce a budget. I was 
               <br />
               asked to draft a report, which I did — a very short 
               <br />
               report. It took me two days to do, but I produced 
               <br />
               this report at the Committee and Major Cashin 
               <br />
               said that he did not want to introduce it. He said 
               <br />
               that he wanted to make up this report and produce 
               <br />
               it. I did not blame him a bit, but I could not agree 
               <br />
               with what was going into it, and I simply 
               <br />
               withdrew. I thought it was read very well, was 
               <br />
               well prepared, and the only objection I have is 
               <br />
               that it may mislead people. In the short report that 
               <br />
               I prepared there were one or two things that are 
               <br />
               not in Major Cashin’s report, and I would like to 
               <br />
               call your attention to them.

               I would like to read first of all my reasons for 
               <br />
               leaving out the estimates. My suggestion was that 
               <br />
               the difﬁculty of furnishing really valuable ﬁgures 
               <br />
               was so great under present world conditions that 
               <br />
               any forecast might be considered a waste of 
               <br />
               time... We know what the present situation is, 
               <br />
               and we know that the situation we can see imme- 
               <br />
               diately ahead is very good, but I don’t think we 
               <br />
               can really forecast actual figures. One of the 
               <br />
               things that makes it clear, one of the points of 
               <br />
               difference, is what has recently occurred in con- 
               <br />
               nection with the saltﬁsh trade <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> the difﬁculty of 
               <br />
               getting exchange. A few months ago, before there 
               <br />
               was any question of the exchange, we all felt very 
               <br />
               happy about the situation. That situation has been 
               <br />
               temporarily solved by the government advancing 
               <br />
               the money themselves, but that is only a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">temper</span> 
               <br />
               ary cure. I am not, however, at all pessimistic 
               <br />
               about the future of the ﬁshery; and I believe that 
               <br />
               the fresh ﬁsh plants and the possibility of central 
               <br />
               curing stations, will make a great difference in 
               <br />
               our ﬁsh situation.

               ....One of the points that I thought should have 
               <br />
               been brought out very strongly was that the stand- 
               <br />
               ard of living of our people today is a very dif~ 
               <br />

               Today we ﬁnd the average Newfoundlander en-

               joying undoubtedly a much higher standard of 
               <br />
               living than ever before. My friend Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood over there read a letter from an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span>

               dividual fisherman, and Mr. Hollett rightly

               find the same thing in any city, but I think the 
               <br />
               general condition of our people today is very 
               <br />
               much improved. I think the people are becoming 
               <br />
               more accustomed to thinking for themselves, and 
               <br />
               this is largely due to factors such as the circulat- 
               <br />
               ing regional libraries, the adult education move- 
               <br />

               agricultural societies. the Jubilee Guilds, the 
               <br />
               Junior Red Cross Association, and our Memorial

               <br />
               tion the increased intelligence and diligence of 
               <br />
               the various unions all over the country. It is 
               <br />
               making people think more than they used to do, 
               <br />
               and that is one of our chief assets, a sign of 
               <br />
               improvement for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future.</span> I think it helps us to 
               <br />
               look at the future in a more hopeful way than we 
               <br />
               have done in the past. Undoubtedly the taxable 
               <br />
               capacity of the economy has been increased to 
               <br />
               where it can produce revenues which, in addition 
               <br />
               to being able to defray the normal costs of 
               <br />
               government, can support more public and social 
               <br />
               services than we have ever hitherto had, and yet 
               <br />
               leave a surplus of perhaps a million or so to spare 
               <br />
               at the end.

               ...I would like to refer to the comment in this 
               <br />
               report on the question of trade with the USA. This 
               <br />
               to my mind is the vital question in connection 
               <br />
               with our future economy unless we can do 
               <br />

               <br />
               connection with all the future of the ﬁsh <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade...</span> 
               <br />
               I have had the idea for a very long time that if we 
               <br />
               could get some round table conferences between 
               <br />
               representatives of Canada, Great Britain and the 
               <br />
               United States, we would get somewhere. Now 
               <br />
               this report indicates that would have to be done 
               <br />
               by a government of our own, and it might be so; 
               <br />
               but supposing for the sake of argument that the 
               <br />
               country did elect to continue Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, I don’t see any reason why, if there 
               <br />
               is a proper agitation, Commission could not have 
               <br />
               such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conference.</span> But this report indicates that 
               <br />
               it would have to be done by a constitutional 
               <br />
               government. That might not be necessary. Of 
               <br />
               course in case of confederation the thing would 
               <br />
               simply fall through. It would be impossible.
