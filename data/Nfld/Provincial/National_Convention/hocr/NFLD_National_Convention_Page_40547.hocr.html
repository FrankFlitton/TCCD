               the point brought out by Mr. Hickman: ifwe have 
               <br />
               made a bad deal so far, and any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water~power</span> they

               tially well! I will give you a comparison: up to 
               <br />
               recently the Newfoundland fishermen were 
               <br />
               charged an export tax of $10 per ton on codfish. 
               <br />

               <br />
               serious view of the change that was made from 
               <br />
               10 cents per ton royalty to 5% of the net income. 
               <br />
               We thought with 10 cents royalty we would cer- 
               <br />
               tainly get a considerable amount. We found they 
               <br />
               changed to 5% of net proﬁts, and there are so 
               <br />
               many suspicions of how big companies have a 
               <br />
               way of manipulating their profits to avoid taxes. 
               <br />
               We thought the 5% of the net profits they would 
               <br />
               declare would not give us much revenue.
