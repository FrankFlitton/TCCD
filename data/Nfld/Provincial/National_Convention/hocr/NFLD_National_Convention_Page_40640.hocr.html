               of this, the first opportunity, to publicly convey

               I do not think that I am unduly egotistic when 
               <br />
               I say there is no one in this Convention more

               qualiﬁed to appreciate the problems and the dif— 
               <br />
               ﬁculties which at times beset the Chairman than 
               <br />
               myself, for I occupied the post for a period of 
               <br />
               nearly 12 months and I had particular opportunity 
               <br />
               to observe those errors which contribute so large- 
               <br />
               ly to the Chairman’s problems. One of the very 
               <br />
               greatest of our errors has been a casual assump- 
               <br />
               tion that we are a political body, even a partly 
               <br />
               political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">body.</span> The method of our election by the 
               <br />
               people has tended to foster that illusion and our 
               <br />
               adoption of a parliamentary framework for our 
               <br />
               deliberations has tended to conﬁrm it. There is a 
               <br />
               tendency to assume that we may speak for the 
               <br />
               people in a representative capacity, where no 
               <br />
               such right exists. And that for two reasons: the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, in its nature double, I suppose, has to do with 
               <br />
               our election to the seats which we now occupy. 
               <br />
               A substantial number of us are here by acclama~ 
               <br />
               tion and received no votes. Many others of us 
               <br />
               received votes and hold our seats by the franchise 
               <br />
               of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25% of 
               <br />
               the electorate of our particular district. We can 
               <br />
               hardly then claim to have been sent here as a body 
               <br />
               by a majority of the electors of this country. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But there is an even greater reason for this. We 
               <br />
               were not elected to carry out any particular 
               <br />
               policy, for no such policy could properly exist. 
               <br />
               Far from pledging allegiance to any form of 
               <br />
               government or policy, our duty under the act 
               <br />
               which created us was nothing more or less than 
               <br />
               that of investigating and recommending, as a 
               <br />
               result of our investigations, to the Crown. We 
               <br />
               were and are in the nature of somewhat numerous 
               <br />
               royal commissions charged with duties as inves-

               <br />
               sion does. It is fair to say that in reality the only 
               <br />
               difference between this Convention and a royal 
               <br />
               commission is the method of our selection. Quite 
               <br />
               clearly, it is outside our province to advocate 
               <br />
               particular forms of government. It is quite 
               <br />
               human, of course, that we should have opinions 
               <br />
               as to forms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> I think l am not going 
               <br />
               too far if I say that any man who has not got 
               <br />
               personal opinions about forms of government is 
               <br />
               not a man ﬁtted to be in this Convention at all. 
               <br />
               But those views should not be allowed to obtrude 
               <br />
               themselves into our deliberations. Our duty is not 
               <br />
               to advocate, but simply and objectively to recom- 
               <br />
               mend, not the particular form of government 
               <br />
               which appeals to us, but those forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment which may be suitable in the circumstances. 
               <br />
               Ours is not the right to decide; we have nothing 
               <br />
               to do with decisions. It is ours to recommend 
               <br />
               forms upon which the people themselves will 
               <br />
               decide. Theirs is the duty, theirs alone the right to 
               <br />
               make the ultimate selection. 
               <br />

               Speaking for myself, as I see the position 
               <br />
               today, I shall have to recommend to His 
               <br />
               Majesty’s Government, insofar as my vote in this 
               <br />
               Convention goes, one form of government which 
               <br />
               ldo not altogether like, and another which I shall

               recommend them notwithstanding that I do not 
               <br />
               like them — I do not like the one and I am 
               <br />
               opposed to the other — because they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are'forms</span> 
               <br />
               which might be suitable and which the people 
               <br />
               might select; and I have no right whatever to 
               <br />
               debar the people from the right to vote for or 
               <br />
               against any form of government which might be 
               <br />
               suitable. If we could have kept that one point in 
               <br />
               view, many of our difﬁculties could not have 
               <br />
               arisen and much of the ill—will which has 
               <br />
               developed could have been avoided. Unfortu- 
               <br />
               nately it was not so. Political ideologies were 
               <br />
               adopted and fought for — sincerely enough, per~ 
               <br />
               haps, but deﬁnitely erroneous.
