               As for what I think about the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, I reserve that for a later date when 
               <br />
               forms of government are discussed. At this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par»</span> 
               <br />
               ticular time I am concerned with our terms of 
               <br />
               reference. When I contested St. John’s West I 
               <br />
               foresaw the stretching and manipulating of these 
               <br />
               terms of reference which could be carried out by 
               <br />
               unscrupulous or undisceming men. If I could 
               <br />
               have been assured that the terms of reference 
               <br />
               would be interpreted as I believed, I would not, 
               <br />
               most likely, be in this House today. But sensing 
               <br />
               then what I realise now, I could not leave that 
               <br />
               much to blind chance. One of the main reasons 
               <br />
               that impelled me to seek election was to help to 
               <br />
               forestall any move to submerge the identity of 
               <br />
               this country into any larger unit without our ﬁrst 
               <br />
               going through an intermediate state, in which the 
               <br />
               people of this country under a duly constituted 
               <br />
               and responsible government could thrash out 
               <br />
               vital and irrevocable issues in a state of complete 
               <br />
               autonomy.

               I have made this brief review for a very 
               <br />
               definite purpose. I wish to make it quite clear to 
               <br />
               everyone concerned that this attitude, this stand, 
               <br />
               which I have followed and intend to follow is not 
               <br />
               something born of recent months. It is to prove, 
               <br />
               if there is any doubt, that I have bowed to the line 
               <br />
               of those convictions surely and steadfastly, for a 
               <br />

               I believe in Newfoundland, in its people, in its 
               <br />
               resources, in its potentialities. I believe that an 
               <br />
               independent Newfoundland offers a far better 
               <br />
               opportunity for Newfoundlanders today than it 
               <br />
               ever did. I believe that the time for union, espe- 
               <br />
               cially with Canada, is past; that half a century 
               <br />
               ago, after the bank crash, or three-quarters of a 
               <br />
               century ago, when the Maritime provinces were 
               <br />
               going in, were far more appropriate times than 
               <br />
               now. We have come a long way since then. We 
               <br />
               have now the beginnings of acountry, of a nation; 
               <br />
               the increasing population, the diversification of 
               <br />
               industry, a strategic position with immense bar- 
               <br />
               gaining power, the spreading grasp of local and 
               <br />
               world affairs which was only the possession of a 
               <br />
               few. In short, we are now on the way to becoming 
               <br />
               a people, a real Newfoundland people, with a 
               <br />
               solidifying national consciousness, a national 
               <br />
               culture. Indeed, I fail completely to understand 
               <br />

               Others will differ, of course. Some of them 
               <br />
               will do so sincerely; others out of motive and 
               <br />
               design. So be it. I have said what I will say at 
               <br />
               much greater length and in far more detail when 
               <br />
               we reach the debate on forms of government. 
               <br />
               When the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Job introduced his motion 
               <br />
               some weeks ago1 I voted against it, for it included 
               <br />
               the confederation question which directly con— 
               <br />
               cerns the sovereignty of Newfoundland. I did not 
               <br />
               speak on the motion, because my previous at- 
               <br />
               titude on this matter was unequivocal; it was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plain.</span> I did not say I was an anticonfederate but 
               <br />
               thought we ought to see the terms when I opposed 
               <br />
               the October motion.2 For the question in my mind 
               <br />
               was, “What terms?" I shall have something to say 
               <br />
               later on that point. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I said then and l reaffirm now, that “the final 
               <br />
               decision on confederation must rest with the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, and that they should be 
               <br />
               asked to register that decision only after negotia- 
               <br />
               tions to secure the best offer of terms from 
               <br />
               Canada have been completed on their behalf by 
               <br />
               a sovereign government of their own choosing. 
               <br />
               If these negotiations were to be considered under 
               <br />
               any other auspices, the terms secured would be 
               <br />
               bound to be suspect, and even if confederation 
               <br />
               were achieved in this manner, it would leave a 
               <br />
               heritage ofdiscontent, which might well imperil 
               <br />
               the satisfactory operation of the agreement." That 
               <br />
               statement was made in an impartial paper on 
               <br />
               “The Political and Financial Implications of 
               <br />
