               That concludes this moming’s session, but I 
               <br />
               might briefly refer to the proposed procedure for 
               <br />
               this afternoon. The members will kindly as- 
               <br />
               semble in this chamber at a quarter to three to 
               <br />
               await the arrival of His Excellency the Governor 
               <br />
               at 3' o’clock. His Excellency has graciously con- 
               <br />
               sented to open the Convention. That being done, 
               <br />
               following His Excellency’s address, the Con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vention~will</span> remain seated until I return to the 
               <br />
               Chair; and then, possibly, we shall take an ad— 
               <br />
               journment until tomorrow afternoon, or other 
               <br />
               such time as you desire, when an address of 
               <br />
               loyalty to His Majesty the King, and thanks to His 
               <br />
               Excellency the Governor, will be proposed by 
               <br />
               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Job and seconded by Mr. Harrington, 
               <br />
               and, doubtless, supported by the various mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Convention. Then will follow the 
               <br />
               appointment of a committee to draft the address 
               <br />
               of loyalty to His Majesty and thanks to His Ex- 
               <br />
               cellency. Then, I suggest we might appoint a 
               <br />
               committee on rules and procedures; and as I shall 
               <br />
               mention to you then —— I shall not delay you now 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> we should propose a resolution making ap- 
               <br />
               plicable to the proceedings of the Convention

               parliamentary procedure in so far as it can be 
               <br />
               applied, pending the report of the committee on 
               <br />
               rules and procedure, which may take a week or 
               <br />
               ten days. But we must have rules to pursue our 
               <br />
               deliberations and I make that suggestion for your 
               <br />
               thought in the meantime. We shall now take 
               <br />
               recess until this afternoon at 2.45.
