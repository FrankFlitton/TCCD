               Mr. Chairman, it is all too plain to see that we 
               <br />
               are not now living in 1865. This year of 1948 
               <br />
               ﬁnds the following circumstances that were not 
               <br />
               evident at that time. The largest revenue that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has ever possessed against the 
               <br />
               meager pittances of those days. Highways and 
               <br />
               transport have progressed. Labrador has been 
               <br />
               legalised as Newfoundland territory. We have 
               <br />
               been termed the crossroads of the world so far as 
               <br />
               air trafﬁc is concerned. We have leased bases 
               <br />
               without credit of any kind, for 99 years, which 
               <br />
               employ our labour at lower rates of pay than 
               <br />
               outsiders. Fish marketing has been revolu— 
               <br />
               tionised and a market exists at our back door. 
               <br />
               Hospitals and general public health organisations 
               <br />
               have become increasingly evident. Bell Island 
               <br />
               and Buchans, not to mention other mining 
               <br />
               prospects have been inaugurated. Paper and pulp 
               <br />
               manufacture has become a fact. Lastly in this 
               <br />
               very vague comparison is the fact that we have 
               <br />
               been informed on the highest authority that we 
               <br />
               are a self-supporting country. 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman, we are not in the late nineties. 
               <br />
               Then we had admittedly little to offer toward an 
               <br />
               equitable basis for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union.</span> Now we are in a posi- 
               <br />
               tion that is coveted by many. We should need no

               <br />

               <br />
               one of us. Mr. Chairman, it is my ﬁrm conviction 
               <br />
               that two and only two types of government 
               <br />
               should be inserted on the ballot paper in the 
               <br />
               forthcoming referendum. Should any negotia-

               tions later take place between Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               any other country, let Newfoundland enter into 
               <br />
               those negotiations as free to barter as are her 
               <br />
               neighbours, for the best results, and may God 
               <br />
               guide our ship of state into kind waters, not in tow 
               <br />

               <br />
               rang with the word “union”, and if we had acute 
               <br />
               hearing today, we might still hear that word 
               <br />
               “union" echoing from these walls. All you heard 
               <br />
               25 years ago was the “union”, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“union”.</span> At that 
               <br />
               time, it was the Fishermen’s Union, which 
               <br />
               developed into one of the biggest and strongest 
               <br />
               political parties we ever had in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> That 
               <br />
               Union party was founded in 1908. Its founder 
               <br />
               used the slogan, “Down with the merchants; and 
               <br />
               up with the underdogs.” Needless to say, it was a 
               <br />
               very popular slogan. The union grew by leaps and 
               <br />
               bounds. Tall tales were told of what it would do 
               <br />
               for the ﬁshermen and to its support, I am told, 
               <br />
               nearly half a million dollars was subscribed by 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen.

               the proposer of this motion was, I am told, one of 
               <br />
               the most rabid promoters of that union, and by his

               as enthusiastic and fanatic a delegate to the old

               Well Mr. Chairman, as they say, time marches
