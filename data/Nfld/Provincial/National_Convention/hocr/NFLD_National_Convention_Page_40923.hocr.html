               <br />
               members in the House before we are ﬁnished, to 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Which is why the only argument 
               <br />
               against reading them is that it may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unneces»</span> 
               <br />
               sary; while on the other hand the reading or even 
               <br />
               a brief explanation might suggest to members 
               <br />
               questions which might perhaps otherwise escape 
               <br />
               them, and then when the time came to debate the 
               <br />
               whole thing, perhaps they would not be in as good 
               <br />
               a position as they would be if their attention had 
               <br />
               been drawn to them by brief explanation. Apart 
               <br />
               from that fact, I am in agreement with your 
               <br />
               suggestion, Major Cashin, that the debate as such 
               <br />
               should be deferred until the required information 
               <br />
               is forthcoming... I am prepared to rule that in the 
               <br />
               event of your deciding to defer the debate, not 
               <br />
               only on these section, but on other sections, it will 
               <br />
               be your right to revert back to other sections. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I want you to understand I am not 
               <br />
               trying to hold it up; but the matter is so important, 
               <br />
               that I think all these questions, particularly with 
               <br />
               regard to banks, the national debt of Canada, the 
               <br />
               CNR and the Trans-Canada Airways, should be 
               <br />
               forthcoming now.... This is supposed to be a 
               <br />
               partnership which we are to go into on equal basis 
               <br />
               in proportion to our assets. In order to do that, we 
               <br />
               have to know the assets of the other side of the 
               <br />
               picture, which are not here in these terms. The 
               <br />
               assets of Newfoundland only are here...

               Mr. Fudge Before Mr. Smallwood proceeds, 
               <br />
               there are a few questions l would like to ask him 
               <br />
               and to which the people of the country would like 
               <br />
               to know the answers. I have to take you back to 
               <br />
               unemployment insurance. I wonder if Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood could tell me what obligations, if any, 
               <br />
               the unemployed are placed under in the getting 
               <br />
               of this insurance? I have heard that the un- 
               <br />
               employed man must appear in person to get the 
               <br />
               insurance. However, if he appears in person and 
               <br />
               there is ajob available in any particular part of 
               <br />
               the nine provinces, he is obliged to accept that 
               <br />
               position, regardless of what the rate of wages may 
               <br />
               be. Should he refuse to accept that, he automat—

               Mr. Smallwood The position is that before a 
               <br />
               man can get the insurance, which is his by right, 
               <br />
               having paid into the fund, he must ﬁrst be un- 
               <br />
               employed. He must be in a condition to work, 
               <br />
               physically, and, thirdly, he must accept a job 
               <br />
               offered by the Insurance Commission which is 
               <br />
               suitable work. A painter offered work as a clerk 
               <br />
               or offered a job as a watchman. is not suitable 
               <br />
               work. Secondly, he must be willing to move. A

               logger must be willing to go to the lumberwoods 
               <br />

               <br />
               he cannot say the job offered in Bay of Islands or 
               <br />
               Badger is too far away. He cannot take that stand, 
               <br />
               if the job is reasonably suitable to him, in a place 
               <br />
               reasonably near, not too far away. The idea that
