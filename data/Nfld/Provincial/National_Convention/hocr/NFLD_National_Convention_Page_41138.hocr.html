               Now we come to the Department of Natural 
               <br />
               Resources, which we ﬁnd has an annual ordinary 
               <br />
               expenditure for the present fiscal year of 
               <br />
               $3,646,700. To begin with, Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               wipes out any relief to be given to the people of 
               <br />
               Labrador, shown in these estimates as amounting 
               <br />
               to $10,000 annually. I wonder what the Rev. Mr. 
               <br />
               Burry thinks of this, particularly in View of the 
               <br />
               fact that even though only $10,000 is voted in the 
               <br />
               estimates this year for such relief, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               because of the stupid policy of the Commission 
               <br />
               government and the Dominions Office, it will 
               <br />
               cost the treasury in the vicinity of $50,000. The 
               <br />
               extra relief was brought about because the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government refused to permit the 
               <br />
               Labrador Development Company to transfer 
               <br />
               from England some $200,000 for the purpose of 
               <br />
               continuing its woods operations on the southern

               <br />

               Now let us review the Department of Public

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the federal government, proceeds to lop off

               <br />
               roads built, although in another breath he said that 
               <br />
               he strongly favours the development of the tourist 
               <br />
               trafﬁc, which we all must admit is dependent 
               <br />
               upon the expansion of our road system. Then he 
               <br />
               also cuts out $15 million for the expansion of 
               <br />
               hospitals and other buildings, many of which are 
               <br />
               now under construction and which must be 
               <br />
               finished. Whilst he leaves the staff of the 
               <br />
               Geological Division intact, he cuts out $45,000 
               <br />
               which was used for ﬁeld work during the present 
               <br />
               year.
