               <br />
               their statements except in this chamber? I would 
               <br />
               urge that people should not be too critical when 
               <br />
               we voice our opinions about these different mat- 
               <br />
               ters. We know the roads are the arteries which 
               <br />
               carry the products of industry, and realise also we 
               <br />
               should have a good sound grant as regards our 
               <br />
               system of transportation. These roads help to 
               <br />
               open up the country and connect settlements with 
               <br />
               each other. The amount of money which this 
               <br />
               country can justifiably expend annually on roads 
               <br />
               and bridges is a matter for great consideration. I 
               <br />
               would like to have fixed in my mind what is the 
               <br />
               right percentage of our revenue that we can an~ 
               <br />
               nually expend on roads and bridges... It seems to 
               <br />
               me also that the transinsular road may be a good 
               <br />
               idea. Anyway, from Port-aux-Basques to Hum- 
               <br />
               ber there should be a good road. I believe there 
               <br />
               are a large number of Americans and Canadians 
               <br />
               — monied men — who are prepared to come with 
               <br />
               their wives and families and spend some of that 
               <br />
               money in Newfoundland, and I think it would be 
               <br />
               a good idea to have that section so that these 
               <br />
               people can come in with their cars and use our 
               <br />
               roads down to the Humber where they can go 
               <br />
               fishing. Another section which should be com- 
               <br />
               pleted is from Gander to Lewisporte. The 
               <br />
               Canadian government spent a large sum on that 
               <br />
               road, but it is not completed... Speaking of 
               <br />
               Lewisporte, I would like to take up'the matter of 
               <br />
               placing Lewisporte on the main line of railway. 
               <br />
               Whoever heard of a terminal not on the main 
               <br />
               line? There are nine miles of railroad and there 
               <br />
               should be a spur line. I advocated that 20 years 
               <br />
               ago.... I feel very strongly on this Lewispone 
               <br />
               matter because this year I had to leave the express 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               _ at Notre Dame Junction, and had to stay there 
               <br />
               overnight to go that nine miles. It would not be 
               <br />
               tolerated in a good many countries, and I hope the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government will consider the 
               <br />
               amount of traffic that goes through Lewisporte. 
               <br />
               It is a big terminus ~— the Imperial Oil Co. and 
               <br />
               the Shell Oil Co. have tanks there; there are a lot 
               <br />
               of boats; and now that the railway is to be con- 
               <br />
               verted from coal to oil, they would save money. 
               <br />
               They should make a detour and put Lewisporte 
               <br />
               on the main line...

               Mr. Ballam I concur entirely with the remarks 
               <br />
               of Mr. Fudge, my colleague here. It is not neces- 
               <br />
               sary for me to go further into the details of the 
               <br />
               road conditions in the Humber district. We are 
               <br />
               well aware of them. and you have been told a 
               <br />
               good deal about them by Mr. Fudge, and I want 
               <br />
               to go on record as supporting him heartily. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yesterday it was Mr. Jackman, 
               <br />
               I think, who wanted to have some information as 
               <br />
               to the rates of pay of workers on highroads 
               <br />
               work... The department tells me that their policy 
               <br />
               in employing men on the highroads for labour is 
               <br />
               to pay whatever rate of wages is prevailing in 
               <br />
               each area where any road work is done. They 
               <br />
               have a minimum of 40 cents an hour, but in St. 
               <br />
               John’s they pay 55 cents an hour. Out on the west 
               <br />
               coast they pay 58 cents, because that is the 
               <br />
               prevailing rate out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there,</span> In the Grand Falls area, 
               <br />
               where I understand the prevailing rate for com- 
               <br />
               mon labour is 70 cents an hour, I assume the rate 
               <br />
               paid common labour by the highroads division is 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same...</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman The prevailing rate on Bell Island 
               <br />
               unless it has changed during the past six or eight 
               <br />
               weeks, is 68 cents an hour, and the prevailing rate 
               <br />
               for highroads employees is 40 cents an hour.... 
               <br />
               That rate has been paid for the past five years. 
               <br />
               The union rate has been between 58 cents and 60 
               <br />
               cents, and the highroads rate has been 40 cents an 
               <br />
               hour up to September month <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anyway.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam The rate of 58 cents an hour paid 
               <br />
               the highroads workers in the Humber area is not 
               <br />
               the rate in the paper mills where it is 72.5 cents 
               <br />
               per hour.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It is 4.25 pm, and we appear not 
               <br />
               to have completed roads. I was hoping we could 
               <br />
               get on today to posts and telegraphs, and perhaps 
               <br />
               complete the report this week... I don’t know if 
               <br />
               it is the pleasure of the House to do that.
