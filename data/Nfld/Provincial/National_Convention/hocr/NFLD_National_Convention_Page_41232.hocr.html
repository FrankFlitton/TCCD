               cause for worry. I remember myself very well, 
               <br />
               living as I did at that time in the United States, 
               <br />
               when the public debt of the USA was something 
               <br />
               of the order of $42 billion. They came out of 
               <br />
               World War] with a public debt of something over 
               <br />
               $20 billion, and it rose to something around $42 
               <br />
               billion. Franklin D. Roosevelt, started his New 
               <br />
               Deal. He spent fabulous amounts of money he 
               <br />
               borrowed, the government of the USA borrowed 
               <br />
               fabulous amounts of money, and there were 
               <br />
               economists who said that when the USA reaches 
               <br />
               $100billion public debt, she’s ﬁnished, that’s the 
               <br />
               end of her. Well, sir, Congress passed a law that 
               <br />
               the public debt of the USA must not rise above I 
               <br />
               think it was $75 billion. They put a limit on it —— 
               <br />
               $45 billion, Major Cashin says, anyway they put 
               <br />
               a limit on their public debt. Now, what happened? 
               <br />
               They borrowed and they borrowed and they bor- 
               <br />
               rowed and they borrowed. And today the USA 
               <br />
               has a public debt, I think, of a billion dollars for 
               <br />
               every day in the year. Somewhere around $350 
               <br />
               or $360 billion — a fabulous amount, we can’t 
               <br />
               conceive that amount. But the USA doesn’t mind 
               <br />
               that public debt at all. They take it in their stride. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, there’s one ﬁnal point that needs to be 
               <br />
               made on this question of a public debt. It’s not the 
               <br />
               size of a country’s public debt that matters, if it 
               <br />
               is owed to its own people. Not that, but the total 
               <br />
               amount of taxes a man pays. A government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colv</span> 
               <br />
               lects a certain total amount of taxes from its 
               <br />
               people. It spends that money. Some of that money 
               <br />
               it spends to pay the interest on the debt -— but 
               <br />
               only some of it. What really matters, therefore, is 
               <br />
               the total amount of taxation that the people pay, 
               <br />
               or to boil it down still further, what matters to 
               <br />
               each individual is the total amount of taxes that 
               <br />
               he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pays.</span> A part is never as great as the whole: the 
               <br />
               interest on the public debt is only a part, whereas 
               <br />
               the total taxes a man pays is the whole... You see, 
               <br />
               we mustn’t imagine that if we go into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion the Government of Canada will then send 
               <br />
               each one of us a bill as our share of the public 
               <br />
               debt, or the interest on that debt. It’s not done that 
               <br />
               way. We pay our taxes mostly according to our 
               <br />
               income or our earnings, and out of what they take 
               <br />
               from us in taxes, they use so much to pay the 
               <br />
               interest on the public debt. We don't need to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worry</span> about the public debt. If we need to worry 
               <br />
               about anything, it’s about how much taxes we 
               <br />
               will pay, for those taxes will include something 
               <br />

               towards the public debt or the interest on the 
               <br />
               public debt. We’ll pay our share of the total taxes, 
               <br />
               and when we do, we can forget about the public 
               <br />
               debt because our taxes will help to take care of 
               <br />
               the public debt. And one of the really big things 
               <br />
               about confederation in my view is that most of 
               <br />
               our people, the great bulk of them, will pay less 
               <br />
               in taxes than they are paying now. That’s all I 
               <br />
               wanted to say about this public debt question just 
               <br />
               now. It’s nothing to get worried about. The 
               <br />
               Canadian people are not worried about their 
               <br />
               public debt, and we won’t need to be worried 
               <br />
               about it if we go into confederation. The people 
               <br />
               of Canada are living well in spite of their public 
               <br />
               debt. I can guarantee you, Mr. Chairman, that 
               <br />
               there’s more talk here in Newfoundland about 
               <br />
               Canada’s public debt in one day, one day, then 
               <br />
               there is in Canada in a year.... 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now this afternoon Major Cashin explained 
               <br />
               what he meant when he said that Canada would 
               <br />
               take not the $32 million a year that he told us at 
               <br />
               one point, but $75 million. He explained that he 
               <br />
               was referring to our share of the public debt. 
               <br />
               Now, when a country owes a public debt, it’s the 
               <br />
               interest on that debt that matters. And the interest 
               <br />
               on the public debt of Canada is around $400 
               <br />
               million a year. Three provinces of Canada — 
               <br />
               Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia — three 
               <br />
               provinces pay the Canadian government 89% of 
               <br />
               all the revenue that the Canadian government 
               <br />
               gets. That means that these same three provinces, 
               <br />
               if they pay 89% of all the revenue of the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada, then they pay 89% of the interest 
               <br />
               on the debt. Because the interest on the debt is 
               <br />
               only $400 million a year, whereas the whole 
               <br />
               revenue is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diree,</span> or four, or ﬁve times as much as 
               <br />
               that. So therefore these three provinces pay 89% 
               <br />
               of whatever it costs to service the public debt —— 
               <br />
               89% of that $400 million... That leaves only $40 
               <br />
               million to come from all the rest of Canada. What 
               <br />
               would our share of that $40 million be? Pretty 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">small.</span> But whatever it is, it’ll come out of the total 
               <br />
               taxes that we pay to the Government of Canada, 
               <br />
               which would be $20 million a year. Now, where 
               <br />
               does Major Cashin get his ﬁgure of $75 million? 
               <br />
               We’re still in the dark on that, at least I am ——— still 
               <br />
               in the dark. I don’t know where he got that ﬁgure. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Well, sir, that’s Major Cashin’s speech — 
               <br />
               what’s left of it. He spoke for part of four days. 
               <br />
