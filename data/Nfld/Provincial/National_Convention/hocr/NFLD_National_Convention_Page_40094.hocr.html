               Mr. Raddy I think this question of trade should 
               <br />
               be brought into this. We import from Canada $19 
               <br />
               million worth of trade; could we not inject it in 
               <br />
               the report. We keep 16 or 19 factories going on a 
               <br />
               million dollars each. I think that should be gone 
               <br />
               into thoroughly. The question of trade may help 
               <br />
               soften the Americans. I would like to see them 
               <br />
               more familiar with our trade. If Canada wanted 
               <br />
               to block it as she did in other industries, we could 
               <br />
               put up the question of trade.

               Mr. Job I take it it will be seen by the Commis-

               <br />
               not think We ought to take a pessimistic attitude. 
               <br />
               I listened to Mr. Smallwood and think he took a 
               <br />
               defeatist attitude. He referred to imports which 
               <br />
               America had from Iceland, but surely in the case 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland which has given 99 year leases 
               <br />
               of valuable concessions, we ought to have trade 
               <br />
               concessions different from Iceland.

               Mr. Cashin I did not propose to say anything on

               this matter because we are passing this interim 
               <br />
               report through the committee stage and it asks 
               <br />
               that the Commission of Government or the 
               <br />

               <br />
               getting for our ﬁsh favourable concessions into 
               <br />
               the United States. We have been working on this, 
               <br />
               reading it section by section —— one would think 
               <br />
               it was a bill being introduced into Parliament, 
               <br />
               whereas it is an interim report of the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Committee, suggesting we do something about 
               <br />
               our ﬁsh. Whether we can get the concessions or 
               <br />
               not we have to try, and we should pass this report 
               <br />
               without debate. We should be as one and forget 
               <br />
               whether the merchant or the ﬁsherman is going 
               <br />
               to get gypped. We have to get the concessions 
               <br />
               from the United States if we can, if not, we have 
               <br />
               to do something else about it. I suggest the debate 
               <br />
               be ﬁnished and let us be as one in this connection.

               Mr. Ballam I agree with Major Cashin but I am 
               <br />
               not content that we should, in dealing with fresh 
               <br />
               ﬁsh, leave the other ﬁsheries out. The report says 
               <br />
               “Herring and its by-products may be mentioned”, 
               <br />
               it is not “may be” it must be. They have a right to 
               <br />
               a place just as much as fresh frozen fish.

               tant as the fresh ﬁsh industry and there is a 
               <br />

               <br />
               UNRRA’S going out and we do not want to lose

               Mr. Bailey I take it all stages of the ﬁshery will 
               <br />
               be considered in the same way. One kind of ﬁsh 
               <br />
               is just as essential as the other. I believe we may 
               <br />
               be able to get our fresh ﬁsh onto a ﬁrm footing. I 
               <br />
               am sure this report is good and we should back it 
               <br />
               and try and get something. One of the hardest 
               <br />
               things we have to face is selling in a cheap market 
               <br />
               and buying in a dear market. We have to buy 
               <br />
               where we sell and if we cannot sell, we should 
               <br />
               not buy. We are the largest customer per capita 
               <br />
               the United States has and we are the best cus- 
               <br />
               tomer of Canada. They have to make way for us. 
               <br />
               In 1922 we imported goods to the value of $287 
               <br />
               million and they took goods to the value of 
               <br />
               $270,000 from us. How can we live like that? I 
               <br />
               do not believe anyone is ﬁghting for our markets. 
               <br />
               We just want to swop. I say to the men processing 
               <br />
               fresh fish, go ahead, and I say to this Convention, 
               <br />
               let us go ahead. Let us vote anyway.
