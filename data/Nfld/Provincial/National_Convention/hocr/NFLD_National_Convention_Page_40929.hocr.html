               Perhaps the Convention would be satisﬁed if I did 
               <br />
               not read it. If that were agreeable, I would explain 
               <br />
               the general principles of the tax agreement. The 
               <br />
               position is this: the Government of Canada is 
               <br />
               permitted under the British North America Act 
               <br />
               to raise its revenue by almost any kind of taxa~ 
               <br />
               tion; but the provinces are limited to direct taxa- 
               <br />
               tion to raise revenue. Most of the provinces up to 
               <br />
               1941 had their own provincial income tax. In fact, 
               <br />
               some town councils in some provinces had their 
               <br />
               own municipal income taxes. Up to the outbreak 
               <br />
               of the war, you would ﬁnd, in some cases, three 
               <br />
               income taxes -— one collected by your own town 
               <br />
               council, one collected by the government of your 
               <br />
               province, and the income tax collected by the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada... When the war broke 
               <br />
               out, the cost of the Canadian effort had to be 
               <br />
               borne by the federal government, not by the 
               <br />
               governments of the towns or provinces. They 
               <br />
               knew that it was going to be a very expensive 
               <br />
               proposition to ﬁght that war. I think Canada 
               <br />
               raised nearly half the money by taxes. The taxes 
               <br />
               were very high. They raised a little over half by 
               <br />
               borrowing from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peoplesAs</span> the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada was going to pay the cost of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war,‘</span> 
               <br />
               it went to the various provinces and said to them, 
               <br />
               “You are not going to have to pay the cost; we 
               <br />
               are going to pay the cost and we will make an 
               <br />
               agreement with you for the period of the war." 
               <br />
               They called in the premiers of the nine provinces 
               <br />
               and they said, “We will pay you a ﬁxed amount 
               <br />
               every year as long as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WM</span> lasts, the average 
               <br />
               amounts you collected for three years before the 
               <br />
               war broke out. We will pay it as long as the war 
               <br />
               lasts and a year after. In return, you must stop 
               <br />
               collecting corporation taxes, death duties and 
               <br />
               income taxes during the war and while the agree- 
               <br />
               ment is in force." The provinces agreed. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Begin‘</span> 
               <br />
               ning 1941 the only income tax collected in 
               <br />
               Canada was collected by the federal government, 
               <br />
               none by the provinces... The war came to an end, 
               <br />
               and the people of Canada were rather fond of the 
               <br />
               idea of paying one income tax. True, the 
               <br />
               Canadian government had the monopoly; they
