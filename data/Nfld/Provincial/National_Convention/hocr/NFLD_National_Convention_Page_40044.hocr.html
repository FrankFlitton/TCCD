               rather intimately familiar with government in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland from the year 1919 to the last day 
               <br />

               a Newfoundlander, I resent the suggestion that

               this Convention is rigged, that it is a bluff and a

               <br />
               woman who cast a vote on June 21, an insult to

               Mr. Hillier Mr. Chairman, I have not spoken 
               <br />
               since the opening of the Convention, but I would 
               <br />
               not be satisﬁed were I to leave this room this 
               <br />
               evening without endorsing the remarks of my 
               <br />
               friends from White Bay and St. George’s. They 
               <br />
               voice completely my sentiments and the senti- 
               <br />
               ments of the district from which I come, and I feel 
               <br />
               they are voicing the feelings of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland people. The great thing that worries 
               <br />
               many of our people is not so much the form of 
               <br />
               government we set up, it is the fact of being able 
               <br />
               to maintain their families and give them decent 
               <br />
               meals and clothing. We are very largely ﬁsher— 
               <br />
               men. I know all about the life and business and 
               <br />
               proﬁts of ﬁshermen. I have lived in many places 
               <br />
               in this country and have seen the hardships they 
               <br />
               undergo I lived through the dole period, and I 
               <br />
               hope we shall never again return to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state.</span> I 
               <br />
               don’t think there is anybody who knows better 
               <br />
               than I do the ﬁght they have from day to day to 
               <br />
               maintain their families... They said to me before 
               <br />
               going out, “Play your part to the best of your 
               <br />
               ability and in the best interests of the whole of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland.” I am not partial, my interest 
               <br />
               extends very far beyond my own district, to New- 
               <br />
               foundland as a whole. As my friends remarked, 
               <br />
               the economic standard of the individual is very 
               <br />
               important; how can the country be economically 
               <br />
               sound if the individual is the other way about? 
               <br />
               Mr. Burry Mr. Chairman, I stand this afternoon 
               <br />
               very shaky, being one of the junior members of 
               <br />
               this Convention, but I wish to express myself in

               a few words. I come from the most northerly 
               <br />
               district of this Convention, one that has gone 
               <br />
               through years of great strain and stress. 
               <br />
               Labradorians as a people are hard—working in the

               great majority of cases, and they deserve a good

               living, a living they have not had. They have sent 
               <br />
               me in to see that they get a government that gives 
               <br />
               them a decent living. They are not concerned with 
               <br />
               constitutional government, but with a govem~ 
               <br />

               myself on record that I am very heartily in favour

               of the last three or four men who spoke so forcib-

               <br />
               orations, and hope that out of this Convention 
               <br />
               will come some kind of government that will give 
               <br />
               our people in Newfoundland and Labrador a

               Mr. Brown Mr. Chairman, I have listened to so 
               <br />
               much oratory here this afternoon that I don’t 
               <br />
               know if it is wise to speak at this time or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not...</span> I 
               <br />
               have no prepared speech, Mr. Chairman, but I 
               <br />
               have listened quite attentively to all that has been 
               <br />
               said. I have for many years in this house listened 
               <br />
               to oratory, as you have yourself, sir, both as 
               <br />
               member and Speaker. Some of that oratory was 
               <br />
               wise words, some was dam foolishness. I have 
               <br />
               heard more about government and Commission 
               <br />
               of Government in the city of St. John’s than I 
               <br />
               have heard in the north of the country for two 
               <br />
               years. I wish it distinctly understood that as one 
               <br />
               who voted out responsible government (and I am 
               <br />
               the only one in this house, and I am not ashamed 
               <br />
               of it) lhave yet to ﬁnd the man who could tell me 
               <br />
               what better thing could have been done at that 
               <br />
               time when the country was on its uppers. What 
               <br />
               happened in 1930’? One afternoon I had in my 
               <br />
               possession $35,000 to the credit of my district. 
               <br />
               The next morning there was not a cent. No mem~ 
               <br />
               ber of any district handled his own money in cash. 
               <br />
               What he did was make out a requisition and send 
               <br />
               it to the government departments and had them 
               <br />
               send outenough money to build a wharf, or a road 
               <br />
               or something. There was a reason for that. In 1932 
               <br />
               when we came back as a legislative body we 
               <br />
               found the country could not get along. Our in- 
               <br />
               come could not meet our expenditures, and it 
               <br />
               boiled down to the question of giving up respon- 
               <br />
               sible government and letting Commission of 
               <br />
               Government come in, or letting 70,000 people, 
               <br />
               men, women and children in this country starve 
               <br />
