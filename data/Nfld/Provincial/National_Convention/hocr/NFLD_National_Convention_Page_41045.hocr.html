               Mr. Chairman Yes, your statement was that

               there were 256 employees presently employed

               their jobs. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood My reply was just as clearly 
               <br />
               that none of them would lose their jobs. I hope 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett says I have dropped $500,000, but 
               <br />
               I would ask Mr. Hollett to turn to page 94 of the 
               <br />
               estimates of the Government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               the third item down, D 8 and F4, and he will find 
               <br />
               that a total amount of $514,600 is a reconstruc- 
               <br />
               tion expenditure by the government, part of their 
               <br />
               three year reconstruction program; not per- 
               <br />
               manent but a program to spend $500,000 on the 
               <br />
               building of new schools and reconditioning old 
               <br />
               ones, and the building of regional libraries. So as 
               <br />
               it is only a reconstruction program I have omitted 
               <br />
               it as an ordinary expenditure, the idea being that 
               <br />
               it should be under capital expenditure ~— 
               <br />
               reconstruction expenditure... 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Excuse me, have you got a capital 
               <br />
               account in that budget? 
               <br />
               Mr.Smallwood No, it is an ordinary account 
               <br />
               budget, the ordinary expenditure for eight years, 
               <br />
               year by year. Anything else would have to be 
               <br />
               special. Now Mr. Hollett says that we have so 
               <br />
               many magistrates, and that l have cut seven of 
               <br />
               them down. That is true, because seven of them 
               <br />
               would not cease to be magistrates, but they would 
               <br />
               cease to be provincial and become federal. They 
               <br />
               would become county court judges, whose 
               <br />
               salaries are paid by the federal government. So, 
               <br />
               as the federal government would pay the salaries 
               <br />
               of seven magistrates, that would be seven 
               <br />
               magistrates that the provincial government 
               <br />
               would not have to pay for. The same thing exactly
