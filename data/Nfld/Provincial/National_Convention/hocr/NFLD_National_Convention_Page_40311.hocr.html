               this country and surely within the ﬁrst six months 
               <br />
               they would have taken immediate steps not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mere»</span> 
               <br />
               ly to ﬁnd out how much timber we had in New-

               foundland, but how much minerals, and how 
               <br />
               much waterpower. Today they still don’t know 
               <br />
               how much timber the Crown owns in this 
               <br />
               country; or how much waterpower is here. The 
               <br />
               other day the government decided to get a 
               <br />
               hydroelectric engineer to come and make a sur- 
               <br />
               vey of the waterpower — after 13 years! And 
               <br />
               here we are trying to make an appraisal of the 
               <br />
               value of the resources of the country, and we 
               <br />
               don’t know yet (a) how much timber we have, (b)

               debates for various reasons, chief of which was

               <br />
               etc., in their districts seem to think that those

               districts are going to have a lot of public funds 
               <br />
