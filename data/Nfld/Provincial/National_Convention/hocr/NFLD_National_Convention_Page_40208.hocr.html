               Mr. Smallwood Yes. They wanted to do that. I 
               <br />
               know that in February or March some people 
               <br />
               were down here from the States and held a num- 
               <br />
               ber of conferences. That took place at Gander 
               <br />
               with the Commissioner, Mr. Neill, the Director, 
               <br />
               Squadron Leader Pattison, and a number of 
               <br />
               others. I may say, Mr. Chairman, as each session 
               <br />
               of that conference ended I knew within an hour 
               <br />
               exactly what happened at it, and I learned in that 
               <br />
               way a lot of information about Gander. I believe 
               <br />
               if the airlines were running Gander at their own 
               <br />

               <br />
               wherever they can. The Americans are paying 
               <br />
               roughly $1 million in wages, along with the oil

               was a member of PICAO, which organisation
