               of government, like most governments in the

               <br />
               would give us a half-decent deal; but if they are 
               <br />
               wholly indecent, if they are just another “Hitler"

               outﬁt, they will plunge us down into poverty, 
               <br />
               they will just suck us dry like a lemon or an

               did say was, “What would be the position under

               we had a written reply, which you will ﬁnd some-

               where in the Black <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Books,</span> Their reply was this,

               “It would become part of the network of the 
               <br />
               CBC.” He said, “We would aim at improving it 
               <br />
               and enlarging it, and giving the people of New-

               which Mr. Watton refers, they would spend that 
               <br />

               that would be good for Newfoundland is another

               I think the people and the employees will get a

               <br />
               mission controlling it. I don’t believe one story in

               one hundred that you will hear of the “dictator-

               ship" and the way the Broadcasting Corporation 
               <br />
               is used by the government. I think, as a matter of 
               <br />
               fact, when you look back over the years since it 
               <br />
               was started, I think the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, the Commission of Government, has 
               <br />
               been very clean and decent about it. I don‘t think 
               <br />
               they have used it as a political tool.
