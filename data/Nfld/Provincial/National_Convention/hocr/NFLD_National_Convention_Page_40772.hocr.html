               Newfoundland Railway management and that he 
               <br />
               personally did not believe the Railway to be 
               <br />
               worth $72 million; so that when the ﬁgure of $72 
               <br />
               million was handed over to the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               he was of the opinion that it was an inﬂated

               Mr. Higgins The inference I got from what Mr.

               <br />
               and the other members of the delegation did give 
               <br />
               incorrect ﬁgures to the Canadian government. It

               Mr. Smallwood What Mr. Higgins said was I

               had used the words “fooling the Canadian

               government". I asked him to withdraw that and 
               <br />
               he withdrew it. Now Mr. Fudge has repeated the 
               <br />
               statement and I ask him now to withdraw it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I must sustain you on that. But

               in fairness to Mr. Higgins and to Mr. Fudge, I

               have to hold to my interpretation that you per~

               Mr. Smallwood That is correct. The Railway

               <br />
               value of the Railway and from that moment to 
               <br />
               this moment, I have never changed my mind. I 
               <br />
               did not think and I do not think the Railway to be
