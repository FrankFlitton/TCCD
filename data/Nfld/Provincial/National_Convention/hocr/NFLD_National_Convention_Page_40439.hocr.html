               it has exported quite a lot of salmon and lobster.

               <br />
               for the personnel, for which there is a budget of 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood A moment ago I asked Mr. Jones 
               <br />
               from Harbour Grace, who sits behind me, to work 
               <br />
               out a little mathematical table. I asked what per- 
               <br />
               centage $50,000 was of $30 million, and he 
               <br />
               handed it back —- 1.75%. The government is 
               <br />
               spending 1.75% of the total expenditure on the 
               <br />
               encouragement of the co-operative movement. I 
               <br />
               don’t like that, Mr. Chairman I think it is entirely 
               <br />
               wrong. I think that in the budget the co-operative 
               <br />
               movement ought to have spent out of public 
               <br />
               funds for the purpose of education and propagan- 
               <br />
               da three or four times that sum. I think there 
               <br />
               should be 50 ﬁeld workers or more. I think the 
               <br />
               whole tendency of the government ought to be 
               <br />
               the encouragement of the co-operative move- 
               <br />
               ment. That’s a lot better than communism, and if 
               <br />
               you don’t have a co-operative movement in this 
               <br />
               world, that’s what you are going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> There 
               <br />
               is no iron curtain shutting Newfoundland off 
               <br />
               from ideas around the world, and if we don’t do 
               <br />
               something to prevent it from happening, mind 
               <br />
               you don’t wake up ten or 15 years from now and 
               <br />
               find in Newfoundland a communist ideology. 
               <br />
               There is one thing that can prevent that, and that’s 
               <br />
               the co-operative movement. Mt. Hollett wanted 
               <br />
               to know if the co-operative movement competes 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">straight.</span> In this country for the past 400 years 
               <br />
               there have been merchants in charge of our 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries. Up to now we have not been able to do 
               <br />
               without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> They collect the fish. pack and 
               <br />
               export it, but I don’t suppose anyone thinks that 
               <br />
               when God created the world he ordained that the 
               <br />
               fish trade of Newfoundland had necessarily got 
               <br />
               to be in the hands of merchants. So long as there 
               <br />
               is no one to replace the merchants you have got 
               <br />
               to have them and be glad, but there is nothing 
               <br />
               to say that ﬁshermen should not be their own 
               <br />
               merchants through organising co-operatively, 
               <br />
               and that movement, spreading as it is throughout 
               <br />
               the earth, should be encouraged here in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and no government can do anything 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett In reply to thatexcellent speech we

               have studied the co-operative movement much 
               <br />

               Mr. Keough I am not here at the National <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span>

               <br />
               defence. For instance, when ten people get

               together to do a certain piece of business it is 
               <br />
               called private enterprise, but when two or three 
               <br />
               or four hundred people get together to do the 
               <br />
               same piece of business it suddenly seems to have 
               <br />
               an ideology involved. As to whether it is consis-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particularly.</span> In this country the government hap-

               pened to get involved, but in the ﬁrst instance it 
               <br />
               happened to get involved in the wrong way. It got 
               <br />
               involved in land settlements and suddenly one

               morning they woke up to ﬁnd they had a co—

               had a government store down there, and that’s 
               <br />
               now called a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> society. It is possible

               that the government may have lost a few
