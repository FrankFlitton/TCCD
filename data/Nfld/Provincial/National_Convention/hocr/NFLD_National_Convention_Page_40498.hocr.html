               point, I have some ﬁgures here that were given 
               <br />
               by Mr. W. E. Ralph, Director of the Geological 
               <br />

               <br />
               and for lead he says, “Based on present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span>

               <br />
               present time.” That’s four years of normal use. I 
               <br />
               understand, in fact I know, that the Buchans 
               <br />
               Mining Co. has signed an operation agreement 
               <br />

               present time. There is a section on La Manche

               Mr. Smallwood Before you pass on from

               Buchans, what I am a little nervous about is that

               as you read over each section there may not be an 
               <br />
               opportunity to come back to them. I know that 
               <br />
               theoretically there is, but practically there may 
               <br />
               not be. This Table III, compiled by Mr. Hollett I

               <br />
               like to make this point. This table in the ﬁrst

               <br />
               the Government of Newfoundland, and further 
               <br />
               over in the table there is a column showing the 
               <br />
               estimated amount of that total revenue that came

               the percentage, I have the feeling that upon this 
               <br />
               same basis you would find that 70 or 80 % of the 
               <br />
               revenue that the government receives each year 
               <br />
               is paid by those eight or ten large corporations.

               table if it were compiled for a large number of 
               <br />
               companies, because, as a matter of fact, the 
               <br />
               revenue is received mainly from the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and not from eight or ten com-

               over 7.5% of the revenue, almost a tenth of the 
               <br />

               of Buchans as an operation, but thinking of the
