               <br />
               we have been budgeting for surpluses and still

               <br />
               such fair and equitable basis of union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exists.</span> As 
               <br />
               for myself, Mr. Chairman, I have never believed 
               <br />
               there was a basis at all at this time. But heretofore 
               <br />
               I looked at it only from the economic viewpoint, 
               <br />
               from the point of view of our exports of fish and 
               <br />
               fish products, our ore and the products of our 
               <br />
               forests. Looking at it thus. I am compelled to say 
               <br />
               that the closer we can get to the USA the better 
               <br />
               will it be for the welfare ofour people. Last year 
               <br />
               Canada took from us $7 million worth of 
               <br />
               products <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-«</span> but how much fish'.7 How much 
               <br />
               paper? The United States took $20 million worth 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh, of ore from Buchans, and of paper. I say 
               <br />
               therefore, and I repeat, that the closer we can get 
               <br />
               to the USA the better will it be for the welfare of 
               <br />
               our people, and I advocate such a policy.
