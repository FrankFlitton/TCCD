               was at a time when we had not gotten anywhere 
               <br />
               in our studies of our own country’s affairs, but 
               <br />
               which up to that time we were all endeavouring 
               <br />
               to do, calmly and dispassionately. So it seems 
               <br />
               clear now, if it was not then, that there was 
               <br />
               something behind that move that certainly was 
               <br />
               not helpful to this Convention, because it 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely split us into two groups, and the gap 
               <br />
               created then has opened wider and wider through 
               <br />
               continuous confederation propaganda, until we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd ourselves today lined up in two opposing 
               <br />
               sides awaiting a ﬁnal decision. In pointing to the 
               <br />
               reason and cause why this Convention has not 
               <br />
               been able to perform the duties assigned it sooner 
               <br />
               can be definitely attributed to confederation 
               <br />
               propaganda, no matter what may be said to the 
               <br />
               contrary, I have come to believe that there was a 
               <br />
               planned scheme to try and sell out our country to 
               <br />
