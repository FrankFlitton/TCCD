               Look, the highliner ﬁshing boat on the south- 
               <br />
               west coast this year paid off her men at $2,200 a 
               <br />
               man, and for Newfoundland it was fine pay 
               <br />
               wasn’t it? Certainly, compared with what the 
               <br />
               other men got, $2,200 was very good. Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, Fortune Bay ﬁshermen, Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               from Fortune Bay were ﬁshing the same time 
               <br />
               aboard Nova Scotia vessels on the same grounds, 
               <br />
               and they got the same quantity of fish as the 
               <br />
               Freda M., or slightly below it, and they paid off 
               <br />
               at $3,000, and I am going to be told that the same 
               <br />
               taxable capacity lies in Fortune Bay as in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia? What kind of nonsense is that? Taxable 
               <br />
               capacity is measured by the earning power of the 
               <br />
               people, and men who earn $2,200 on the high- 
               <br />
               liner have not got the earning power of men who 
               <br />
               earned $3,000 for roughly the same quantity of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh the same year. Everyone on the southwest 
               <br />
               coast knows that, and they will hear it tomorrow 
               <br />
               night when it is broadcast. I make that statement 
               <br />
               now. Ask any ﬁsherman. Captain Bailey is a 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman, at least he used to be, and probably as 
               <br />
               he says, he will be again I have not a word against 
               <br />
               it. He is going to be a good confederate some day, 
               <br />
               but anyway he is a good man, but he is not the 
               <br />
               only fisherman. We have men along the south— 
               <br />
               west coast, ﬁshermen in hundreds, who for years 
               <br />
               and years and years have been fishing in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, and every man of them knows that in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia they earn more money for the same 
               <br />
               work. I am not going to try to explain the reason. 
               <br />
               Perhaps that is too big for me to explain, but you 
               <br />
               can’t compare the taxable capacity of Fortune 
               <br />
               with the taxable capacity of Shelbume. You can’t 
               <br />
               do it.
