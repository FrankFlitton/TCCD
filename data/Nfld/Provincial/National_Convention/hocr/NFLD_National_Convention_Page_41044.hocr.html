               a magistrate is somewhat lower in the judicial 
               <br />
               circle then a county magistrate in the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada, so I see no reason why that should be 
               <br />
               cut down. Shorthand typists, is cut down to three 
               <br />
               which means that three will be done out of work. 
               <br />
               Now I come to the Constabulary, $526,830. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood very magniﬁciently has left that 
               <br />
               as it is. I have been dealing with constables and 
               <br />
               police ofﬁcers for 25 years, and I know the con- 
               <br />
               ditions under which they live, and I know the 
               <br />
               salaries they are receiving even today, and when 
               <br />
               I tell you that a constable of 15 or 20 years 
               <br />
               experience receives $1,550, and a second grade 
               <br />
               clerk in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">department</span> here in St. John's with 
               <br />
               one year’s experience gets <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5</span> l .500, I ask you, are 
               <br />
               these constables being treated right? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood thinks they are. We won’t in~ 
               <br />
               crease that vote, we will leave it as it is. 
               <br />
               Penitentiary. Mr. Smallwood says the federal 
               <br />
               government will pay half that amount. The al- 
               <br />
               location is now $25,000, and it is cut down to 
               <br />
               $12,500. I take it that’s the amount that is re- 
               <br />
               quired to service and take care of the penitentiary 
               <br />
               as it exists today. We all know that that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peniten»</span> 
               <br />
               tiary is inadequate. I don’t think any of you 
               <br />
               gentlemen would get a bed there tonight if you 
               <br />
               wanted to. How can you cut down your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expendi‘</span> 
               <br />
               tures? Most of these men are sent there by the 
               <br />
               magistrates, and I take it under confederation our 
               <br />
               people are not going to become saints, and some 
               <br />
               will have to take temporary residence down 
               <br />
               there, and the amount of $25,000 is only just 
               <br />
               enough to get along. As a matter of fact, I don’t 
               <br />
               think it is ample. The travelling of magistrates is 
               <br />
               cut from $20,000 to $15,000. Why? Magistrates, 
               <br />
               or county magistrates, are they not going to 
               <br />
               travel? It there notjust as much travelling in this 
               <br />
               country for the magistrates under confederation 
               <br />
               as at the present time? How can he cut $5,000 off? 
               <br />
               These are only small amounts, gentlemen, but all 
               <br />
               added together will show you just how much we 
               <br />
               need to run this country, even as it was. General 
               <br />
               justice, $25,100 in the estimates, Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               has cut off another $5,000 there. Maintenance 
               <br />
               and operation of vessels. Last year that took 
               <br />
               $l1,200. Idon’t know what vessels that refers to, 
               <br />
               unless it is the vessel which takes the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court around the island. I don’t believe they can 
               <br />
               do it less than that, or we will have no Supreme 
               <br />
               Court travelling around the island from time to 
               <br />
               time. If we are going to have that we will need

               as made by our own government under the head- 
               <br />
               ing of Justice, which was $l,l77.700. is little 
               <br />
               enough, so 1 would suggest that instead of 
               <br />
               $1,053,000. you really must leave that ﬁgure of 
               <br />
               $1,177,700. That is as far as i care to go this 
               <br />
               afternoon, because there are other men who 
               <br />
               would like to speak. 
               <br />
               Mr.Smallwood I would like to reply to 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett. He says there are 256 men or women 
               <br />
               working in the Customs, and he says that most of 
               <br />
               them will be done out of work. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett i did not say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> I said some of 
               <br />
               them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Will you turn to page 5 of the 
               <br />
               Grey Book, clause l7, and the heading says 
               <br />
               “Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Employees.“</span> 1 will read it to you. 
               <br />
               It does not say that they will take over part or 
               <br />
               some of them, but it says: “Employees of the 
               <br />
               Government of Newfoundland in services taken 
               <br />
               over by Canada as provided for in clause 5 above 
               <br />
               will be offered employment in the corresponding 
               <br />
               Canadian service under the terms and conditions 
               <br />
               governing employment in that service, but 
               <br />
               without reduction in salary or loss of pension 
               <br />
               rights..." 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Where? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Look at clause 5 and you will 
               <br />
               get a list of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> Clause 5. sub-clause 1. New- 
               <br />
               foundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> Newfoundland Hotel, Cus- 
               <br />
               toms and Excise, etc, and in any department they 
               <br />
               take over they will take the employees with them, 
               <br />
               and obviously some of the employees of the 
               <br />
               Customs department will not lose their jobs. 
               <br />
               That’s quite clear isn’t it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Well, some of them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood So Mr. Hollett will not say that 
               <br />
               any more. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett 1 rise to a point of order. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is deliberately misquoting me. On 
               <br />
               that point I fail to see that they are going to need 
               <br />
