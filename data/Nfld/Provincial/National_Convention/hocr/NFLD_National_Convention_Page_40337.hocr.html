               as to be outside the realm of possibility? Yet this 
               <br />
               is the very outrageous procedure which is taking 
               <br />
               place in this oldest dominion today. But, in spite 
               <br />
               of even this, some people do not yet recognise the 
               <br />
               rough hand of dictatorship even when it is thrust 
               <br />
               in their face. As every man and woman in this 
               <br />
               island knows, if we could make some arrange- 
               <br />
               ments with the United States for the free entry of 
               <br />
               our fish into the great markets of that country, 
               <br />
               Newfoundland could become unbelievably 
               <br />
               prosperous. Will any person disagree that this is 
               <br />
               a matter which should have been dealt with by 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom government on our behalf 
               <br />
               when these base deals were first discussed? But 
               <br />
               it is evident that the interests of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               were not even a secondary consideration. This is 
               <br />
               the error we would now like to correct, the 
               <br />
               blunder we would try to rectify, the national loss 
               <br />
               which we would attempt to make good. But when 
               <br />
               we try to make our future brighter and more 
               <br />
               prosperous, what do we meet? We come up 
               <br />
               against a wall of opposition and a denial of our 
               <br />
               rights to make any such effort on behalf of New- 
               <br />

               Incidentally, there is another matter which 
               <br />
               comes to my mind at this point. If my memory 
               <br />
               serves me right, in the early days of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, the Chairman was asked if the Convention 
               <br />
               had the power to send a delegation from its mem- 
               <br />
               bership to the United States. On that question 
               <br />
               being directed by the Chairman to Professor 
               <br />
               Wheare, that gentleman stated that this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion had such powers. But today the Convention 
               <br />
               is informed through this report that we have no 
               <br />
               such power.

               Mr. Chairman I have to correct you there. The

               ruling of the late Chairman and of Professor 
               <br />
               Wheare was that this Convention had a perfect 
               <br />
               right to send a delegation to the United States to 
               <br />

               <br />
               country, should the United States be so minded 
               <br />
               to receive any such delegation, but he gave no

               tory statements? ls Professor Wheare right when

               he made that statement, or is the Commission 
               <br />
               right in denying his statement? What is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jus»</span>

               is right,- and I am inclined to believe he is, then 
               <br />
               the Commission is guilty of an inexcusable act in 
               <br />
               ignoring his ﬁndings.

               witnessed the birth of the Atlantic Charter. We

               when our people look back and consider its

               a square deal now. I go further and say that she
