               best—off countries in the entire world for its size 
               <br />
               and population. Next I considered the possibility 
               <br />
               that even though we were well-off now, what 
               <br />
               about the future? Could we stand up to the future? 
               <br />
               Can we carry on? I got my answer to that when 
               <br />
               the Economic Report was read. I saw that report 
               <br />
               viciously attacked with all the resources of the 
               <br />
               opposition. I heard a Newfoundlander many 
               <br />
               times run down his country to the dirt. I saw every 
               <br />
               effort being made to create despair and blue ruin. 
               <br />
               But I also saw the report stand up to all its 
               <br />
               attackers, and when the smoke cleared away its 
               <br />
               ﬁndings were just as staunch and undeniable as 
               <br />
               when it ﬁrst came before us. [found that not alone 
               <br />
               was our future bright with hope, but that hope was 
               <br />
               also accompanied with a definite assurance that, 
               <br />
               as far as human vision and foresight can 
               <br />
               reasonably expect to go, the future for New- 
               <br />
               foundland looms up as the brightest in its entire 
               <br />
               history. These were the facts presented to me. 
               <br />
               These were the facts which as a sane logical 
               <br />
               person I have to accept, and which for the same 
               <br />
               reason all our people have accepted unless we are 
               <br />
               afraid to face the truth. Having then accepted the 
               <br />
               facts of our present prosperity and our hopeful 
               <br />
               outlook, I began to ask myself, if these things are 
               <br />
               so, what is all this talk about out having to have 
               <br />
               someone else to take us in? Why should we think 
               <br />
               that someone would think of rescuing the perish- 
               <br />
               ing, caring for the dying Newfoundlanders? 
               <br />
               What is the reason for all this confederate 
               <br />
               propaganda which I see around me? I have asked 
               <br />
               that question to myself many times, and I have 
               <br />
               gotten no answer. I ask it again today, and I still 
               <br />
               get no answers. Day after day, week after week, 
               <br />
               month after month, you and I have listened to the 
               <br />
               endless speeches of the confederates, waiting to 
               <br />
               see if they would give us the explanation we 
               <br />
               wanted. Waiting, waiting to see if they would 
               <br />
               give us some sane reason why we, the people of 
               <br />
               this country, should sell our sovereignty, bury our 
               <br />
               national heritage forever in an obscure corner of 
               <br />
               the Canadian backyard...l But I repeat, we have 
               <br />
               never been given the answer and the reason is 
               <br />
               simply this -— they have no good reason to give 
               <br />
               us.

               pig in a poke, sight unseen, or we do no business. 
               <br />
               Now Mr. Vincent, yesterday I believe, made 
               <br />
               some reference to the difference in the price of 
               <br />
               hay in Canada and here in Newfoundland. I 
               <br />
               believe he stated that the price of hay in Canada 
               <br />
               was $30 a ton and that it was $60 a ton in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. New surely Mr. Vincent, who is 
               <br />
               a businessman, is not trying to impress upon the 
               <br />
               people that he has $30 proﬁt on a ton of hay. I 
               <br />
               don’t think he intended to do that. I did expect 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent to explain the difference between the 
               <br />
               $20 and the $30. I understand that the cost of 
               <br />
               transportation on hay is around $20. The duty on 
               <br />
               the hay is approximately $5. And he knows, as I 
               <br />
               find the ﬁgures, there’s about a proﬁt of $2 on the 
               <br />
               sale of hay. I want to impress upon the delegates 
               <br />
               that no matter whether we went into confedera— 
               <br />
               tion or not, the cost of transportation will be the 
               <br />
               same, whether in or out, unless somebody in this
