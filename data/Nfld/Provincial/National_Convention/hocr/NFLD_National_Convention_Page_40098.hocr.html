               The birth of the pulp and paper industry in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was when the government of the 
               <br />
               day under the premiership of Sir Robert Bond 
               <br />
               opened negotiations with the Harmsworth inter- 
               <br />
               ests of London, England, for the purpose of 
               <br />
               developing the timber areas in the Exploits Val- 
               <br />
               ley.I From an original capacity of 200 tons per 
               <br />
               day, the intervening years have seen this industry 
               <br />
               increased to around 500 tons daily, and I have 
               <br />
               been reliably informed that this same company 
               <br />
               has under consideration the further expansion of 
               <br />
               their operations, with the object of further in- 
               <br />
               creasing their production to 700 tons daily. This 
               <br />
               envisages a proposition which will distribute 
               <br />
               some $8 million dollars in earnings to our people 
               <br />
               annually. And so, in looking to the future of our 
               <br />
               country we see that we have in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mis</span> Grand Falls

               which will give the means of a decent livelihood 
               <br />

               We now come to the other great industrial 
               <br />
               development at Corner Brook. This did not start 
               <br />
               until nearly 20 years later, and the details of this 
               <br />
               undertaking have been adequately outlined in the 
               <br />
               report. When the present expansion plans of this 
               <br />
               company are completed, it is estimated that the 
               <br />
               total annual earnings of Bowater employees will 
               <br />
               be in the vicinity of $11 million. We see, there— 
               <br />
               fore, that in these two enterprises alone, New~ 
               <br />
               foundland can look to a total annual earning of 
               <br />
               around $18 million. This does not include proﬁts 
               <br />
               tax paid the government by both companies. It is 
               <br />
               my opinion, therefore, that such a source of in- 
               <br />
               come can be regarded as a permanent plank in the 
               <br />
               future economic security of the country.

               I now come to another matter which has never

               interested in developing the Gander areas. As a

               Reid Newfoundland Company. This corporation

               was called the Gander Valley Power and Paper

               proposition to develop another pulp and paper 
               <br />
               mill at Gander. They were deﬁnitely interested,

               however, in acquiring the properties and incor- 
               <br />
               porating them with the Comer Brook enterprise. 
               <br />
               The Reids were of the opinion that the promotion 
               <br />
               of another mill was a sound proposition and 
               <br />
               continued their efforts to interest other capital. 
               <br />
               Finally they succeeded in interesting the Hearst 
               <br />
               interests in the construction of a 1,000 ton mill on 
               <br />
               the Gander, and approached the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government to guarantee the project to the extent 
               <br />
               of $20 million. In addition, they wanted to ac- 
               <br />
               quire further timber limits on the Labrador, as 
               <br />
               there was not sufﬁcient wood on the Gander areas 
               <br />
               to feed such a mill as was proposed. This was in 
               <br />
               1930. l was Minister of Finance at that time, and 
               <br />
               together with the late Prime Minister Squires and 
               <br />
               the late Sir William Coakcr, had several con—

               conviction that Hearst had no sincere intention of
