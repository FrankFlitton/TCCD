               <br />
               questions by members throughout the debate. 
               <br />
               One question was to ask for statistics showing 
               <br />
               exports of salt dried codﬁsh from Canada to the 
               <br />
               foreign markets over a period of years, together 
               <br />
               with some explanation of why salt codﬁsh exports 
               <br />
               to the Mediterranean markets have fallen off in 
               <br />
               recent years. That answer, sir, is rather long, and 
               <br />
               I don’t think the copies are on the desks of the 
               <br />
               members, and if not they certainly will be. It says: 
               <br />
               Canada’s exports of salt cod to countries 
               <br />
               in the Mediterranean area were of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> 
               <br />
               able extent in the 1925-29 period, when they 
               <br />
               averaged about l5% of total Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex.</span> 
               <br />
               ports of this commodity. The ﬁsh involved 
               <br />
               was product of the Gaspé fisheries mainly, 
               <br />
               and almost all of it was exported to the Italian 
               <br />
               market, with negligible quantities to the 
               <br />
               Spanish and Portuguese markets. This trade 
               <br />
               declined after the period mentioned as a 
               <br />
               result of several <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">influences...</span> 
               <br />
               Then it goes on to say that the reason it fell off in 
               <br />
               Europe was that the hard times there dried up the 
               <br />
               demand for ﬁsh, and because of the sanctions that 
               <br />
               the League of Nations imposed on Italy at the 
               <br />
               time of the Ethopian war. It points out also that 
               <br />
               in the same time period the current exports from 
               <br />
               the Gaspé coast and Newfoundland exports fell 
               <br />
               off at the same time.
