               clear there. My experience is that before a culler 
               <br />
               can get a permit to cull ﬁsh, that application has 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               wanted a culler today I could not appoint any man 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood There is just one point that I 
               <br />
               want to make, and that’s about a plentiful supply 
               <br />
               of fresh water in the washing of ﬁsh. In looking 
               <br />
               at the tariff I ﬁnd that the duty on pumps <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> well, 
               <br />
               there are two rates, one for pumps for mining 
               <br />
               purposes, and one “for all other purposes”, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               cluding the ﬁshery. It is 20% full duty, 20% 
               <br />
               intermediary duty and 10% preferential. Well, if 
               <br />
               a pump is imported from the British Isles then the 
               <br />
               duty is 10%, but if it comes from Canada it is 
               <br />
               20%. Does anyone happen to know where most 
               <br />
               of the pumps come from —— Britain or this side of 
               <br />
               the Atlantic?

               Mr. Smallwood Well, that means that the duty 
               <br />
               will be 20%, so that the ﬁshermen using the 
               <br />
               pumps pay a price which I imagine would make 
               <br />
               the use of these pumps very strictly limited. We 
               <br />
               all know as far as the inshore ﬁshery is concerned 
               <br />
               there are not too many pumps used. I know places 
               <br />
               where they are used, and I take it that the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee puts a lot of value on that. What is wrong 
               <br />
               with the government, or the Fisheries Board ac- 
               <br />
               ting for the government, or some ofﬁcial body of 
               <br />
               the government, importing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1045,000</span> pumps 
               <br />
               from the manufacturer, getting them at a special 
               <br />
               price, bringing them in duty free and selling them 
               <br />
               at cost? If it is valuable for the fishermen to have 
               <br />
               a plentiful supply of clean water why not do the 
               <br />
               thing right, and why leave it to the individual 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman when the government could bring in 
               <br />
               lots of pumps and sell them at perhaps half the 
               <br />
               price that they are paying for mem now? Has 
               <br />

               Mr. Northcott I have been nibbling at the 
               <br />
               saltﬁsh business for the past 25 years, and 1 would 
               <br />
               like to remind the Convention that all that glitters 
               <br />
               in the saltﬁsh business is not gold. The past few 
               <br />
               years much money has been made by many 
               <br />
               people and ﬁrms from the ﬁshery, but a few years 
               <br />
               back I got the jitters from it, and not the gold that 
               <br />
               glitters. The same can be applied to many other 
               <br />

               Today, I am happy to see the ﬁsh plants com- 
               <br />
               ing to the fore, and I hope and pray that markets 
               <br />
               will be found to take care of our fresh frozen 
               <br />
               products, and that many more new factories will 
               <br />
               spring up and take care of the various other 
               <br />
               species of ﬁsh that we have around our coast. It 
               <br />
               will also give considerable employment that we 
               <br />
               need to make the dollar go round and round... 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent lthink we should have the specific 
               <br />
               amount of ﬁsh and the grades <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classiﬁed.</span> If the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board have these ﬁgures, it should not

               be difﬁcult to get them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jones ....I understand on the southwest 
               <br />
               coast, they use boats of ten tons —— one dory and 
               <br />
               three men — and I understand there is no bounty 
               <br />
               given for boats of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">size.</span> I think that is a great 
               <br />
               pity, if it is true. If they could get a bounty, more 
               <br />
               would be built. Do they get bounty under 12 tons? 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy Under 12 tons there is no bounty. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood What proportion are under 12 
               <br />
               tons? 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy Mostly they are over 12 tons.
