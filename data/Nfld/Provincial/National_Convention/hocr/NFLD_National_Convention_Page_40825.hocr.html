               One other statement in reference to the bases. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley said, “The base agreement was 
               <br />
               signed under no compulsion whatsoever”. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place I would like to point out that the base 
               <br />
               agreement was signed before the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland knew anything whatsoever about it. 
               <br />
               And we have been informed by people who were 
               <br />
               very close to things in those days, that when a 
               <br />
               couple of our Commissioners, very patriotically 
               <br />
               I thought, objected to signing these agreements 
               <br />
               on the grounds that something should have been 
               <br />
               put into it having reference to a future date when 
               <br />
               they might be considered, they were bluntly told 
               <br />
               by the Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill that he would 
               <br />
               have none of it —— sign on the dotted line, or else. 
               <br />
               If that is not compulsion, I don’t know what else 
               <br />
               to call it. More than that, they were signed 
               <br />
               without any reference at all to the people of this 
               <br />
               country. I just wanted to draw these facts to your

               attention, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, I don’t want them to go

               Mr. Bradley gave an excellent address yester- 
               <br />
               day, delivered in a masterly style for which he is 
               <br />
               well noted. I am not trying to make any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defama‘</span>

               Our friend, the Rev. Burry of the Labrador; 
               <br />
               with all due respect, I think he is more or less 
               <br />
               what we call half and half, or as we say in 
               <br />
               London, “an and awf’. He is half in favour of 
               <br />
               the report and he is half against it. He did say this 
               <br />
               though, and I got it down: “Those people who 
               <br />
               drew up this report and agreed with it, were not 
               <br />
               treating the people in a fair way”. Now that 
               <br />
               compares so closely to a statement which has 
               <br />
               been made here before, that it was not an honest 
               <br />
               report, that I have, sir, to draw your attention to 
               <br />
               that also. “The people who drew up that report 
               <br />
               gave such a rosy picture that they were not treat- 
               <br />
               ing the people of this country in a fair way.” Now 
               <br />
               whether Mr. 13tu meant to put it in that way or 
               <br />
               not I don’t know, but that’s exactly as he put it, 
               <br />
               and then he did go on to the homes in his own 
               <br />
               district, in Labrador. He deplored the fact that 
               <br />
               everybody on the Labrador has not got a Chester- 
               <br />
               ﬁeld instead of a home-made bench to sit or lie 
               <br />
               on. I think I ought to draw your attention to that 
               <br />

               because mese chesterﬁelds come after many, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               as far as Newfoundland is concerned, and as far 
               <br />
               as Labrador is concerned.

               He did speak about unemployment insurance 
               <br />
               also, and I would like to point out that that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un»</span> 
               <br />
               employment insurance, as I understand it in a 
               <br />
               neighbouring country, does not touch the ﬁsher~ 
               <br />
               men; so that if we are going to have unemploy- 
               <br />
               ment insurance in this country, get something 
               <br />
               which is going to be of some help to the ﬁsher— 
               <br />
               men. I grant you that our ﬁshermen have always 
               <br />
               had a pretty rough time of it, but they were always 
               <br />
               honest and rugged, and any time when a call 
               <br />
               came to ﬁght for our King and country, they were 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst to enlist. So the hardships and battles of 
               <br />
               life did not prevent them from being patriotic 
               <br />
               when it came to the point of defending that which 
               <br />
               they do enjoy, be it rough and tumble, be it 
               <br />
               sometimes hunger or whatnot. They did not 
               <br />
               hesitate at the call to arms, and they did not 
               <br />
               hesitate when it came to lay down their lives... 
               <br />
               So I do not think that even the rough times that 
               <br />
               our people had, have in any way undermined 
               <br />
               their moral attitude towards life and Christianity, 
               <br />
               and that is much better, much greater than having 
               <br />
               a Chesterﬁeld in your front room....

               I refer you to a statement made by Mr. Ban- 
               <br />
               ﬁeld yesterday, in which he referred to the people 
               <br />
               of Fortune Bay. I know a good many people from 
               <br />
               Fortune Bay, and I know you have not any better 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen in this country than in Fortune Bay, 
               <br />
               and that nine times out of ten they make a good 
               <br />
               voyage, and a pretty good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">living,</span> I am not saying 
               <br />
               all of them. In such a precarious trade as the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery there have to be some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">failures,</span> There have 
               <br />
               to be men who get sick during the voyage, and 
               <br />
               men who don’t seem to run into the ﬁsh — even 
               <br />
               neighbours. They make trip after trip and don’t 
               <br />
               strike the ﬁsh on the Grand Banks, but when they 
               <br />
               do they know how to catch it. And the Fortune 
               <br />
               Bay ﬁshermen are some of the best we have. All 
               <br />
               right, they have poor years, but is there any 
               <br />
               reason why, in considering the future of this 
               <br />
               country and the general aspect of the economy, 
               <br />
               we should bring up isolated cases of this nature, 
               <br />
               and try to tell the rest of our people that this is a 
               <br />
               pretty rotten country to live in? I tell you it is
