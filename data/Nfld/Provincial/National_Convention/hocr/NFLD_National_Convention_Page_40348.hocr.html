               facts is for the country as a whole. Why not stop

               like them or not? Why not get the terms from 
               <br />
               Canada if we can? Why not send a delegation to 
               <br />
               England and find out what they are prepared to

               Canada will offer us, or what the Government of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom will offer us. As a commis-

               Mr. Miller I rise to a point of information. It is 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely stated here, “it was doubtful whether 
               <br />

               want plain information on it. If the Committee 
               <br />
               can’t back up that word “doubtful” then I think it 
               <br />
               should be removed. I think it’s time we moved in

               Mr. Butt In presenting this Agricultural Report, 
               <br />
               I do not intend to make a speech. I hope the report 
               <br />

               <br />
               report is not a treatise on agriculture. It is rather 
               <br />
               an attempt to survey the national aspects of 
               <br />
               agriculture in Newfoundland in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">round.</span> You 
               <br />
               will note the report is divided into five parts. One 
               <br />
               is a slight introduction not intended to be a history 
               <br />
               of agriculture in Newfoundland, but the idea of 
               <br />
               the Committee as to some of the reasons why 
               <br />
               agriculture has not taken the part in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s economy that it should have. 
               <br />

               we had a memorandum from the Director of
