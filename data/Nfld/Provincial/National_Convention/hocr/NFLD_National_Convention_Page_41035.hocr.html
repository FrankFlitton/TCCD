               Mr. Hickman speaks about our surplus. In this 
               <br />
               estimate of mine I have pictured our $28 million 
               <br />
               surplus, which may be $30 million. It is proposed 
               <br />
               that the offer the Government of Canada has 
               <br />
               made be accepted, that that surplus be put on 
               <br />
               deposit, at 2 5/8% interest. Now should that be 
               <br />
               withdrawn once we would put it on deposit draw- 
               <br />
               ing interest every year, or left in there? Well, 
               <br />
               there are two schools of thought on that. One is, 
               <br />
               as Mr. Hickman just said, it should be left in there 
               <br />
               for the rainy day. What rainy day, sir? He says 
               <br />
               when there may be bread lines and unemploy- 
               <br />
               ment and destitution in the country. That’s one 
               <br />
               school of thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">——«</span> leave it for the rainy day. 
               <br />
               The other school of thought is this, and it is the 
               <br />
               one I have followed: not to leave it there forever, 
               <br />
               but to draw it out each year and spend it in such 
               <br />
               a way as not to have the rainy day. All right, when 
               <br />
               the laughing is thoroughly over, I will explain 
               <br />
               what I mean.

               <br />
               point out however, that if you don‘t draw it out 
               <br />
               at the rate of $3 million a year, your interest 
               <br />
               earning for the government will be that much 
               <br />
               greater each year, and your income from interest 
               <br />
               would be higher than is shown here, because 
               <br />
               what is shown in my table is the interest on the

               balance of the surplus that would remain each 
               <br />
               year after you had withdrawn $3 million... 
               <br />
               Another point I want to deal with that Mr. 
               <br />
               Hickman has made, and I dealt with it yesterday. 
               <br />
               I would expect any businessman anywhere in this 
               <br />
               Convention or in this country or out of it. to speak 
               <br />
               exactly as Mr. Hickman has spoken, because very 
               <br />
               few businessmen in the world appreciate the fun- 
               <br />
               damental difference in public finance and private 
               <br />
