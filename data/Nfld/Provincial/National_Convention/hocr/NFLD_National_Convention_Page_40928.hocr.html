               The other two-thirds would be for the use of the 
               <br />
               province for developmental purposes... There 
               <br />
               are two other points about that —— one is that the 
               <br />
               one-third, for eight years after we became a 
               <br />
               province, would have to be put in trust or it could 
               <br />
               be put on deposit with the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               drawing interest. And there is this point ~—- the 
               <br />
               whole amount of the dollar surplus, and the ster- 
               <br />
               ling surplus if we can get it turned into dollars, 
               <br />
               can be placed on deposit with the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada for as long as we wish to leave it there, 
               <br />
               up to ten years. That must begin within one year 
               <br />
               after becoming a province; while there the 
               <br />
               provincial government would draw interest at the 
               <br />
               rate of 25/s% per year. One other point only needs 
               <br />
               to be drawn to your attention. No part of the 
               <br />
               surplus can be used to subsidise production or 
               <br />
               sale of Newfoundland products in unfair com- 
               <br />
               petition with similar products of other provinces. 
               <br />
               That does not prevent the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland from helping industry by such means 
               <br />
               as development loans on reasonable conditions 
               <br />
               or by the ordinary provincial administrative ser- 
               <br />
               vices; it must not be a direct subsidy on similar 
               <br />
               products sold in competition with other provin~ 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt Naturally, the question of the surplus 
               <br />
               did come up when the delegation was discussing 
               <br />
               these questions with Canada. I wonder if the 
               <br />
               delegation could tell us why any restrictions at all 
               <br />
               should have been put on the use of our surplus by 
               <br />
               the province, if we did become a province?

               Mr. Smallwood The practice in the case of 
               <br />
               every province that joined the Canadian union 
               <br />
               was for the federal government to take over a 
               <br />
               certain share of the province’s public debt and its 
               <br />
               the accumulated cash surplus and assets. In our 
               <br />
               case they have not done that; they have left the 
               <br />
               surplus untouched. They could, on all the prece— 
               <br />
               dents established by all other provinces, take over 
               <br />
               the cash surplus in an amount corresponding in 
               <br />
               principal to the amount of the debt taken over. 
               <br />
               They have not done that. They said they did not

               want to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so.</span> In fact, they know that if we were

               to lose our surplus the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would not consider confederation. So the surplus 
               <br />
               is left intact to us; but one—third of it is earmarked 
               <br />
               — not for them, but for us, for the ordinary

               <br />
               is ours, but we must use it only in a certain way, 
               <br />
               for ordinary purposes, road building, if you like,

               That means only that the Government of

               <br />
               and scale of grants increased. And, secondly, 
               <br />
               would pay to our government $ l .1 million a year; 
               <br />
               and that is to take the place of certain statutory 
               <br />
               awards made to the Maritime Provinces. These 
               <br />
               statutory awards, as you undoubtedly know, are

               <br />

               <br />
               got $1 .3 million; New Brunswick, $900,000; and
