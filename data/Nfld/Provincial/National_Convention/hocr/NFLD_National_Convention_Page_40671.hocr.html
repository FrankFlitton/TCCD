               in our revenues for the last few years we had not 
               <br />
               been showing the monies that we received as 
               <br />
               grants-in-aid from the Colonial Development 
               <br />
               Fund; in other words that these revenues are not 
               <br />
               correct. I contend that loans of money or advan- 
               <br />
               ces are not revenues, but they are covered be- 
               <br />
               cause on the other side of the fence we showed 
               <br />
               the expenditures out of that money, but we take 
               <br />
               good care to point out that in the text. If we take 
               <br />
               into account the fact that over $20 million has 
               <br />
               been spent on the capital or long account, which 
               <br />
               ordinarily should be deducted from our own ex- 
               <br />
               penditure, the ﬁnal result for a period of half a 
               <br />
               century should show approximately $15 million. 
               <br />
               That shows that we did not try to cook this 
               <br />
               thing... Now if we took that $20 million from 
               <br />
               $469 million that leaves $449 million, conse- 
               <br />
               quently our revenue should be $469 million, 
               <br />
               which would leave us a surplus of $15 million. 
               <br />
               Now let’s go a little further. We are not like 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan at all, we are away ahead of them. 
               <br />
               Why? Up to September 30 1947, we collected in 
               <br />
               revenues $499 million. That leaves us a deﬁcit 
               <br />
               mind you, including these capital expenditures, a 
               <br />
               deﬁcit of $3.4 million—odd. Now today our na- 
               <br />
               tional debt is approximately $70 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> Against 
               <br />
               this we have $35 million in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cash.</span> That means if 
               <br />
               we paid it off tomorrow we would have a debt of 
               <br />
               $35 million. Now what have we got for that debt? 
               <br />
               To begin with we are lending money today free 
               <br />
               of interest, probably the only country in the world 
               <br />
               that is doing it, but what have we got for the $35 
               <br />
               million? Take that report brought back by the 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation, which shows we have a rail- 
               <br />
               way which is valuable to someone. I don’t think 
               <br />
               the Railway is worth $72 million, but that’s down 
               <br />
               in black and white. in addition we have all our 
               <br />
               public buildings today in the country, say $10 
               <br />
               million. 
               <br />

               <br />
               lion. Now if we deduct that $35 million which we 
               <br />
               owe, we have a deﬁnite surplus left (on paper, 
               <br />
               mind you) of $70 million in round ﬁgures. That 
               <br />
               is the position as far as the Government of New-

               report so long awaited with bated breath, for it is

               <br />
