               I move that immediately before the order of

               the day is called on Wednesday the 14th day 
               <br />
               of January, 1948, on resuming the debate on 
               <br />
               the motion, that the Convention resolve itself

               <br />
               consider and discuss the proposals received

               on November 6 from .the Right Honourable

               <br />
               debate shall not be further adjourned.

               Mr. Chairman Mr. Higgins, while I am not 
               <br />
               rejecting the motion, my feeling is that, being a 
               <br />
               closure motion, it should be deferred; that is to 
               <br />
               say, that I should defer receiving and putting the 
               <br />
               motion at the present time. As you, Mr. Higgins, 
               <br />
               particularly, and perhaps members generally will 
               <br />
               be aware, there is not, nor has there ever been, 
               <br />
               strangely enough, any statute covering closure in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Now, standing order 54 reads as 
               <br />
               follows: “Whenever any matter arises in the 
               <br />
               course of the proceedings of the Convention

               which, in the opinion of the Chairman, is not

               covered by these Standing Orders, reference shall
