               years of union the Government of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would receive from the Government of Canada, 
               <br />
               under that one heading $22,750,000. Divide that 
               <br />
               by eight, and it is an average per year of 
               <br />
               $2,843,746. Now, add these up, and it will come 
               <br />
               to $13,901,900. Now that would be, for the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               four years of union, the revenue of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland as a province from all 
               <br />
               sources, under all headings which leaves the 
               <br />
               provincial government short of balancing its 
               <br />
               budget, short $1,236,875. That amount, ifit were 
               <br />
               got by the provincial government, would enable 
               <br />
               it, in the ﬁrst four years of union, to balance its 
               <br />
               budget and break even; and that amount has got 
               <br />
               to be got, and that is the amount in fact of new 
               <br />
               taxation that would have to be placed on the 
               <br />

               new taxes. $1,236,875 and you would balance 
               <br />
               your budget for those four years, and in doing so 
               <br />
               the total picture would be this: the total provincial 
               <br />
               taxation on the Newfoundland people: 
               <br />
               $4,570,075; the total non-tax revenue, total 
               <br />
               revenue to the provincial government not from 
               <br />
               taxes: $10,568,700; and the two together, added 
               <br />
               up is $15,138,775. That is the ﬁrst four years of
