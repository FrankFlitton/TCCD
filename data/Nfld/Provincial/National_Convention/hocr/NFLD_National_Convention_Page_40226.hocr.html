               <br />
               this Mr. Oliver. He comes down and makes a 
               <br />
               study and looks over the various plans that the 
               <br />
               Board had drawn up, takes them back and sub- 
               <br />
               mits these plans to another man in Ontario, who 
               <br />
               is the manager of a firm which is catering to 
               <br />
               tourists, and operating a number of hotels, who 
               <br />
               looks over them with his expert eye and points 
               <br />
               out some weaknesses. For instance, the plan for 
               <br />
               Stephenville area... There they propose that a 
               <br />
               tourist hotel should be built. Their original idea 
               <br />
               was that it would be one large building but 
               <br />
               when Mr. Oliver submitted that plan to that 
               <br />
               tourist hotel manager in Ontario, up in Muskoka 
               <br />
               Lakes, he said, “Look, all the experience we have 
               <br />
               shows that it would be a mistake to have one 
               <br />
               building to house all your tourists. Instead of that 
               <br />
               have one building, and a series of small cabins 
               <br />
               scattered through the trees around that large 
               <br />
               building. They can sleep in the cabins and eat in 
               <br />
               the hotel. You cut down the cost of accommoda~ 
               <br />
               tion, heating, etc." Finally they got this report and 
               <br />
               presented it to the government. What are they 
               <br />

               <br />
               tourist hotels? No. They are asking for one only,

               They have taken that as a seeding ground. Now, 
               <br />
               they said that if the government would build that 
               <br />
               hotel as an example, then if it worked out private 
               <br />

               <br />
               cumulated over these rich war years, and if they 
               <br />
               would build just one, beginning at Stephenville, 
               <br />
               as an encouragement and an example to other 
               <br />
               people, then in the course of a few years we might 
               <br />
               end up by having a magnificent tourist trade.
