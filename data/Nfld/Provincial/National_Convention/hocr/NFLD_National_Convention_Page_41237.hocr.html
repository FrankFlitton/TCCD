               Now, touching on the matter of the old age 
               <br />
               pension, Mr. Harrington quoted a statement 
               <br />
               made in the House of Commons by Mr. John 
               <br />
               Bracken, leader of the opposition, in which he 
               <br />
               referred to the Canadian government’s plan to 
               <br />
               wipe out the means test in giving old age <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pen'</span> 
               <br />
               sions. I’m very glad that Mr. Harrington men- 
               <br />
               tioned this. What Mr. Bracken was talking about 
               <br />
               was something else altogether. The Government 
               <br />
               of Canada has a plan to take over the old age 
               <br />
               pension completely for all persons of 70 or 
               <br />
               over.... And then on top of that there would be a 
               <br />
               pension for all those who needed it between the 
               <br />
               ages of 65 and 70. In other words, there‘d be a 
               <br />
               means test for those between 65 and 70 and the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada would not pay all of it but 
               <br />
               only half, the government in each province 
               <br />
               paying the other half. That’s for persons between 
               <br />
               65 and 70 who needed it. But all who reached the 
               <br />
               age of 70 would receive it without any means test 
               <br />
               and the Government of Canada would pay the full 
               <br />
               amount. That’s the plan to which Mr. Bracken 
               <br />
               referred in his speech and that plan has not yet 
               <br />
               come into force. It’s expected to be put in force 
               <br />
               within the next year or two. Mr. Chairman, as we 
               <br />
               have only one stenographer, perhaps we might

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Harrington, in discussing 
               <br />
               the confederation election of 1869, tells us we did 
               <br />
               not have the secret ballot in 1869 when our 
               <br />
               people voted on confederation. But then, neither 
               <br />
               did the people anywhere else on this side of the 
               <br />
               Atlantic at that time. But what’s that got to do 
               <br />
               with it? The fact is that there was no secret ballot 
               <br />
               80 years ago when our people voted on con- 
               <br />
               federation. Every voter had to walk into a booth 
               <br />
               and in a loud voice declare whom he was voting 
               <br />
               for. There was nothing secret about it. The local 
               <br />
               merchant or his agent was right there in the booth. 
               <br />

               He was the agent for Charles Fox Bennett, the 
               <br />
               biggest merchant in Newfoundland, who was the 
               <br />
               leader of the anticonfederates. And it took a 
               <br />
               pretty brave ﬁsherman in those days long ago, to 
               <br />
               go against the local merchant. Now, what actual- 
               <br />
               ly happened in that confederation election 80 
               <br />
               years ago, what did happen? Thirty members 
               <br />
               were elected to the House of Assembly. Ten of 
               <br />
               them were confederates, 20 of them were an- 
               <br />
               ticonfederates. But that does not tell the story at 
               <br />
               all. One thousand votes more for confederation 
               <br />
               in that election, just another 1,000 votes, and it 
               <br />
               would have been 20 confederates and 10 anticon- 
               <br />
               federates elected. If only 1,000 of those who 
               <br />
               voted in that election had voted the other way, we 
               <br />
               would have become a province in 1869. Just a 
               <br />
               few hundred votes more in Bonavista Bay and 
               <br />
               three confederates would have been elected 
               <br />
               there. Just another couple of hundred votes or so, 
               <br />
               and three confederates would have been elected 
               <br />
               in Trinity Bay instead of the two confederates 
               <br />
               who were elected... And so it was in most dis- 
               <br />
               tricts. A mere thousand votes more for confedera- 
               <br />
               tion in the whole country and confederation 
               <br />
               would have won. You see, Mr. Chairman, I too 
               <br />
               have read the whole story of that famous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election.</span>

               <br />
               few months ago, to tell me of the last interview 
               <br />
               Sir Richard Squires gave before he died. It was 
               <br />
               given to the Winnipeg Free Press in 1938. In that 
               <br />
               interview Sir Richard Squires declared -— it was 
               <br />
               the last thing he ever said to the public —— that 
               <br />
               confederation was the only hope for New- 
               <br />

               Sir, Mr. Harrington touched on the question of 
               <br />
               education and referred to the clause about educa- 
               <br />
               tion in the terms of union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There"</span> s really only one

               point in his remarks on this subject that calls for 
               <br />
               any cement. He will not, I think, deny that the 
               <br />
               education clause protects all our rights as they are 
               <br />
               now. Every denomination with its own schools at 
               <br />
               the time of union will go right on with its own 
               <br />
               schools just so long as it wishes to. That right is 
               <br />
               guaranteed in the terms. Not only that, but each 
               <br />
               denomination is guaranteed its rights, to its share 
               <br />
               of the public money spent on education. Then 
               <br />
               again, if any two or more denominations should 
               <br />
               ever wish to unite or amalgamate their schools,
