               lion from us. Let’s say that I’m out as much as 
               <br />
               50% in my estimate. Let’s say it would be $9 
               <br />
               million a year that the provincial government 
               <br />
               would collect. In that case, stretching it like that, 
               <br />
               the two governments between them would take 
               <br />
               $39 million from us a year, or still $1 million less 
               <br />
               then we’re paying now. Mr. Northcott may say 
               <br />
               that in that case, we’d only be $1 million dollars 
               <br />
               better off under confederation, just $1 million 
               <br />
               dollars a year better off. But that is not so. Besides 
               <br />
               that $1 million a year, 120,000 of our children 
               <br />
               under the age of 16 would be getting $8.5 million 
               <br />
               a year in family allowances, and 10,000 of our 
               <br />
               senior citizens would be getting $2.5 million a 
               <br />
               year in old age pensions. Our railroaders would 
               <br />
               be better off, our civil servants would be better 
               <br />
               off, our cost of living would be lower than it ever 
               <br />
               could be without confederation, and our people 
               <br />
               would have the satisfaction of knowing that their 
               <br />
               country was linked up with that great British 
               <br />

               Mr. Northcott asks me to say something on the 
               <br />
               question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">divorce...1</span> I am trying to fathom why 
               <br />
               Mr. Northcott is so interested in the question of 
               <br />
               divorce. I know Mr. Northcott is happily married, 
               <br />
               and that’ 8 why I’ve been trying to ﬁgure why he’s 
               <br />
               been so interested in having me say something 
               <br />
               about divorce in case we go into confederation. 
               <br />
               I’m sure that he has no motive except a perfectly 
               <br />
               good one. And so for that reason I’m going to say 
               <br />
               something about divorce in case we become a 
               <br />
               province of Canada. Sir, we have no divorce laws 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> We never did, and 1 hope we 
               <br />
               never will. Those provinces of Canada that are in 
               <br />
               the union now, some of them had divorce laws 
               <br />
               before confederation was started in 1867. They 
               <br />
               took their own laws into the union with them... I 
               <br />
               don’t think that any other province since then has 
               <br />
               passed any divorce law of its own. If New~ 
               <br />
               foundland goes into confederation, I would give 
               <br />
               it as my opinion that it’s very unlikely, highly 
               <br />
               unlikely, that we’ll ever get a House of Assembly 
               <br />
               elected here that will pass a divorce law, I don’t 
               <br />
               think that’s likely to happen. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Northcott was 
               <br />
               a member of that provincial House of Assembly, 
               <br />
               I don’t think he’ll vote for any law to grant 
               <br />
               divorce in Newfoundland. I know I won’t. I don’t 
               <br />
               think Mr. Starkes or Mr. Vincent or Mr. Harmon 
               <br />
               or Mr. Jackman or Mr. Watton or any of us who 
               <br />
               should happen to be in the provincial legislature 
               <br />

               law. That's very unlikely. But even if we don’t, 
               <br />
               we might still be able to get divorced, that is true. 
               <br />
               We could do as the people do in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. Quebec has no divorce law — never did 
               <br />
               have one and I don’t suppose she ever will have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one....</span> There are only two possible grounds for 
               <br />
               divorce — adultery and desertion. And if a per— 
               <br />
               son in Quebec wishes to get a divorce, what he’s 
               <br />
               got to do, or she, is this: go to the Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada, the Parliament mind you, and get the 
               <br />
               Parliament to pass an act for him or for her, one 
               <br />
               law for him or for her, not a law for everyone or 
               <br />
               for a lot of people, just for him or for her. First of 
               <br />
               all the application is put before the Senate of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> There’s a committee of the Senate — 
               <br />
               they’re poisoned with it, they hate it, it stinks, 
               <br />
               they don’t like it, this committee —— but it has to 
               <br />
               go before that committee. The committee passes 
               <br />
               on it, like a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">court,</span> And if the committee agrees 
               <br />
               that the evidence that’s produced is good enough, 
               <br />
               they will pass a law in the Senate, then from the 
               <br />
               Senate it goes to the House of Commons and if 
               <br />
               they agree with it, the Govemor—General of 
               <br />
               Canada signs that bill, and that one person is 
               <br />
               divorced. Or rather, I should say those two per- 
               <br />
               sons are divorced. If we become a province we 
               <br />
               can do that. A person in Newfoundland wishing 
               <br />
               a divorce can hire a lawyer, and the lawyer can 
               <br />
               prepare his case. If he can prove to the Senate of 
               <br />
               Canada either adultery or desenion, the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment may pass an act divorcing that one person 
               <br />
               from his spouse. That costs from $1,000 to 
               <br />
               $1,500. So while I am not prepared to guarantee 
               <br />
               that under confederation there would never be 
               <br />
               anyone divorced, I am ﬁrmly convinced that if 
               <br />
               you have one or two or three people getting 
               <br />
               divorced, it’s as many as you’ll have. If you take 
               <br />
               this country in the last number of years you’ll ﬁnd 
               <br />
               this, that although we have no divorce law there 
               <br />
               are still Newfoundlanders who get divorces. Oh 
               <br />
               yes, there are Newfoundlanders who get divor- 
               <br />
               ces, not in Newfoundland, and they marry again. 
               <br />
               We have people who have been divorced from 
               <br />
               their ﬁrst wives and who are now married to a 
               <br />
               second wife although we have no divorce law. So 
               <br />
               under confederation there might be one or two or 
               <br />
               three cases. I don’t think we need to worry about 
               <br />
               it. We needn’t lose any sleep.
