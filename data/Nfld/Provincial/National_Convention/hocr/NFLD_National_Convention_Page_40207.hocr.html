               <br />
               the statement that the operating costs will be

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Neill said he had recently 
               <br />
               written a very strongly worded letter, “as strongly 
               <br />
               as any one of you would word it. 1 have just 
               <br />
               written that letter to the British government." In 
               <br />
               view of that, I am expecting an announcement 
               <br />
               before this Convention closes to the effect that 
               <br />
               the British government has generously agreed to 
               <br />
               relieve the Newfoundland people of that burden. 
               <br />
               And I believe it will be retroactive. From April 1 
               <br />
               in my belief, the cost of the losses of operating 
               <br />
               Gander will not have cost the Newfoundland 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Hollett On page 4 of the report, “Mr. Neill, 
               <br />
               the Commissioner for Public Utilities, was asked 
               <br />
               why the Commission of Government had made 
               <br />
               this decision. His reply was that it was because 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was a member of the Provisional 
               <br />
               International Civil Aviation Organization 
               <br />
               (PICAO) which organisation decided that 
               <br />
               Gander should be kept open by Newfoundland.” 
               <br />
               Where did you get the idea that the Government 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland decided it should be kept open? 
               <br />
               On page 1 it says the British government paid 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fivevsixths</span> of the cost of the airport and paid 
               <br />
               $100,000 a year operating expenses prior to the 
               <br />
               war; the British government surely had some 
               <br />
               equity there, how has the equity been liquidated, 
               <br />

               As to the equity, it was understood and agreed

               from the beginning that the British government

               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood The Chicago meeting was the

               one at which the dispute occurred between

               <br />
               foundland had very little part in that, except to

               listen. I believe PICAO is the subsequent 
               <br />
               development of the Chicago conference. It was 
               <br />
               at that conference that the lst, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 
               <br />
               5th freedoms were enunciated —— the right to ﬂy 
               <br />
               over territory, right to land passengers, right to 
               <br />
               pick up passengers. They have had conferences 
               <br />
               since and have sub-committees meeting from 
               <br />
               time to time. There was one recently in Ireland. 
               <br />
               Squadron Leader McGrath attended that, but he 
               <br />
               was merely a technical observer in the British 
               <br />
               delegation. No one attended as a full-fledged 
               <br />
               representative of Newfoundland. Very few men 
               <br />
               attended who had more technical knowledge than 
               <br />
