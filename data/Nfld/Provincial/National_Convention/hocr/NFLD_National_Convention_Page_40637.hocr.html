               Mr. Chairman It is usual for the Clerk to read 
               <br />
               the report. In this particular instance the report is 
               <br />
               rather voluminous, and at a meeting of the Steer- 
               <br />
               ing Committee this morning it was suggested that 
               <br />
               perhaps the better way would be to read the 
               <br />
               introduction only, and the matter could then be 
               <br />
               dealt with and a decision made as to how this 
               <br />
               report would be handled It was further sug-

               gested, and I don’t imagine that either of our 
               <br />
               secretaries will object, that in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood is more or less familiar with the

               thought of the Steering Committee this morning

               was that the best time to read this whole report

               would be after the terms themselves have arrived 
               <br />
               from the Government of Canada; then the terms 
               <br />
               and this report can be taken together, because one 
               <br />
               belongs to the other.

               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation. He made that motion. 
               <br />
               Before he sat down, he took occasion to refer to 
               <br />
               an attack which had been made by the Daily News 
               <br />

               <br />
               of privilege; but he has not the right to raise it 
               <br />
               immediately upon moving a resolution. Mr. 
               <br />
