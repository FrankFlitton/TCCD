               John’s, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">90,000«odd</span> people, yet it is a province... 
               <br />
               It is just one big farm, and it has only a handful 
               <br />
               of people. Ever since they came into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion in 1873 they have been clamouring and 
               <br />
               clamouring for more and for more from the 
               <br />
               federal government, and they have been getting 
               <br />
               more and more from the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               Since 1917, the Government of Canada has spent 
               <br />
               $40 million to provide that little island with a 
               <br />
               ferry service. In 1917 they built them a train ferry 
               <br />
               at a cost of$1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million...</span> In I927 the government 
               <br />
               built them a new ferry —— a $2 million ferry. Just 
               <br />
               two years before that we thought we did very well 
               <br />
               when we got the Caribou on the Gulf. She cost 
               <br />
               half a million dollars... They ran that from 1927 
               <br />
               until she was lost last year. They ran that for the 
               <br />
               people of Prince Edward Island at a loss of $1 
               <br />
               million a year, after spending $2 million to put 
               <br />
               her there. And this year they gave them a brand 
               <br />
               new ferry at a cost of $5 million; and on top of 
               <br />
               that they spent another $6 million to build <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upto-</span> 
               <br />
               date wharves and terminals at each end of that 
               <br />
               ferry run. Let’s look at the ferry. She is the biggest 
               <br />
               ice-breaker ferry in the world today; carries 750 
               <br />
               passengers, 60 motor cars, and 20 train cars. Now 
               <br />
               I don’t know how many that would be equal to of 
               <br />
               our cars for our railway. The Canadian cars are 
               <br />
               bigger than ours, and 20 Canadian cars would 
               <br />
               perhaps be equal to something between 20 and 
               <br />
               30 of our cars.... On top of all that, sir Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island has another ferry that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government subsidises every year. 
               <br />
               Now what is their complaint? In 1945 they did 
               <br />
               not have the big new one, they still had the $2 
               <br />
               million ferry and the extra ferry that the Canadian 
               <br />
               government was subsidising. What was Premier 
               <br />
               Jones’ complaint made at the annual provincial 
               <br />
               council that Mr. Higgins was quoting from? 
               <br />
               What was his complaint? That the ferry boat 
               <br />
               would not take trucks and buses while the other 
               <br />
               one would, so that you could load up your truck 
               <br />
               somewhere on the island and run her right on to 
               <br />
               the ferry.... The main ferry would not take it, but 
               <br />
               the other one would, the one that the Canadian 
               <br />
               government was paying a subsidy to. $40 million 
               <br />
               since 1927 the Government of Canada has spent 
               <br />
               to provide that little farming province with a

               Mr. Chairman Well, I don‘t know what you are 
               <br />
               doing, but I want to make this clear. I did state 
               <br />
               that Mr. Higgins was entitled to quote from the 
               <br />
               Premier of Prince Edward Island upon the rail- 
               <br />
               way and steamship service, but I insisted that he 
               <br />
               should quote, and not attempt a paraphrase. If, to 
               <br />
               cover his point, he was compelled to deal with 
               <br />
               other matters, I had to decide that we would hear 
               <br />
               his quotation or we would not. In view of the fact 
               <br />
               that the quotation in part had a bearing upon the 
               <br />
               discussions, I ruled he was entitled to quote. I did 
               <br />
               not hold that Mr. Higgins was entitled to go into 
               <br />
               the general terms of confederation as existing
