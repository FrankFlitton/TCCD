               There is a story behind that clause, which the 
               <br />
               members no doubt might like to hear. We had got 
               <br />
               fairly well along in our talks when I raised what 
               <br />
               I thought was a matter of fundamental impor- 
               <br />
               tance to Newfoundland. I said, “Mr. St. Laurent, 
               <br />
               as long as I remember I have been hearing a 
               <br />
               certain phrase used by people, and that is about 
               <br />
               opening the country up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-—~</span> opening up New- 
               <br />
               foundland. That is a sort of old-fashioned, home- 
               <br />
               ly way of saying that we would like to have 
               <br />
               Newfoundland developed —— expanded and 
               <br />
               developed. Now", I said, “what would confedera- 
               <br />
               tion do to open up Newfoundland, to open up her 
               <br />
               resources, to develop her resources and expand 
               <br />
               her economy?” I did not get very far at that ﬁrst 
               <br />
               meeting. One member only of the conference 
               <br />
               supported me, and that was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Brooke 
               <br />
               Claxton. I said it again, and still did not get very 
               <br />
               far, but at the third one they agreed to insert a 
               <br />
               clause covering the situation, and that clause is 
               <br />
               here: the Government of Canada would provide 
               <br />
               the services of technical personnel and agencies 
               <br />
               to assist in the work. In what work? In the work 
               <br />
               of making an economic survey of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to see what resources may be developed, and 
               <br />
               what new industries may be established, or exist- 
               <br />
               ing industries expanded, and then it says: “As

               soon as may be practicable after union the 
               <br />

               a few comments with regard to that particular 
               <br />
               section. The ﬁrst thing I notice is the phrase

               “Should the government of the province institute 
               <br />

               problematical. l go on further: "As soon as may 
               <br />
               be practicable“ — God only knows when that 
               <br />
               will be —— “As soon as may be practicable after

               <br />
               ﬁx in their minds the provinces of Nova Scotia. 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. They

               <br />
