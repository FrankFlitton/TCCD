               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood There are one or two things I 
               <br />
               would like to say in reply to Major Cashin and 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett. With one thing Major Cashin said, I 
               <br />
               am in the deepest and profoundest agreement. I 
               <br />
               jotted down his words: “The fate of this country 
               <br />
               does not rest with this Convention, but with the 
               <br />
               common <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.”....</span> The fate of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will be decided by the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               when they vote in the national referendum some- 
               <br />
               time this present year, and not in the dim, hazy 
               <br />
               future that Mr. Hollett has referred to. All this 
               <br />
               Convention can do is what the law gives it 
               <br />
               authority to do; and the authority is the National 
               <br />
               Convention Act under which we were all elected. 
               <br />
               Two pieces of authority we got when elected — 
               <br />
               one, to look into the condition of the country, 
               <br />
               economically and ﬁnancially. How is she likely 
               <br />
               to shape up in the next 15 or 20 years? The second 
               <br />
               piece of authority was this; that having taken as 
               <br />
               good a look as we know how, to suggest and 
               <br />
               recommend to the Dominions Ofﬁce a number of 
               <br />
               forms of government to be laid before the New- 
               <br />
               foundland people; so that they will be able to 
               <br />
               decide for themselves, what form of government 
               <br />
               they think they want. That is quite a lot of 
               <br />
               authority.... In connection with the forms of 
               <br />
               government that we may recommend, Mr. Job 
               <br />
               very wisely and in the spirit of statesmanship, 
               <br />
               brought into this house a couple of weeks ago a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion,</span> And what did that motion say? That it is 
               <br />
               essential that this National Convention take im- 
               <br />
               mediate steps to find out what Britain might be 
               <br />
               prepared to do for us if we went on under Com- 
               <br />
               mission government or if we went back to 
               <br />
               responsible government or if we had some other 
               <br />
               kind of government. And it was essential for us 
               <br />

               to find out also what fair and equitable basis there 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland...</span> Mr. Job’s motion went on to 
               <br />
               say that we should appoint a committee to go and 
               <br />
               meet the Governor and the Commission to get 
               <br />
               their advice as to what steps we can take to get 
               <br />
               that information. The Committee met the govern- 
               <br />
               ment and they gave us their advice. Their advice 
               <br />
               was, “Send over and ask the Government of 
               <br />
               Britain what they are prepared to do; with regard 
               <br />
               to ﬁnding out what fair and equitable basis there 
               <br />
               may be fora union of Newfoundland and Canada, 
               <br />
               send to the Government of Canada and ask 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,”</span> They went further and said, “If you want 
               <br />
               to send a delegation to London and a delegation 
               <br />
               to Ottawa, the Convention should ask us to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out whether the British government and the 
               <br />
               Canadian government would receive such 
               <br />
               delegations If they say they will, we will pay the 
               <br />
               expenses of those two delegations.” That is the 
               <br />
               report that has come in here. Major Cashin pays 
               <br />
               little attention to the advice of the government. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett pays even less. Mr. Hollett is 
               <br />
               prepared to send one to London, but not to send 
               <br />
               one to Ottawa. Major Cashin has not made it clear 
               <br />
               whether he is in favour of sending one delegation 
               <br />
               or another. This Convention has gone on record, 
               <br />
               with a small number of us voting against it, not 
               <br />
               including myself, in adopting Mr. Job’s motion, 
               <br />
               to say we consider it essential that immediate 
               <br />
               steps be taken to secure this information; also, 
               <br />
               whether it is possible to take up discussions with 
               <br />
               the United States. In justice to the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government, I must refer to what Major 
               <br />
               Cashin said about that. He states the government 
               <br />
               says this business of tariffs, trade treaties and 
               <br />
               trade are matters for government and govem- 
               <br />
               ment, they should be handled through diplomatic 
               <br />
               channels. Then he says the late Chairman and 
               <br />
               Professor Wheare both said that you can send a 
               <br />
               delegation to Washington. Then you, sir, inter- 
               <br />
               rupted him and pointed out that what the late 
               <br />
               Chairman and Professor Wheare referred to was 
               <br />
               a delegation going to the States, not to deal with 
               <br />
               customs or trade matters, but to deal with the 
               <br />
               federal union of Newfoundland and the United 
               <br />
               States. He acknowledged this, then went straight 
               <br />
               on and argued it was inconsistent. Professor 
               <br />
               Wheare, he continued, said we could and the 
               <br />
               government says we cannot. Two entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent kinds of delegations were referred to; one 
               <br />
