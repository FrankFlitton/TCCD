               Mr. Starkes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">....Mr.</span> Chairman, I wonder how 
               <br />
               some of our large mercantile ﬁrms on Water 
               <br />
               Street look at the report. I ask members in their 
               <br />
               own minds to pick out one of the largest ﬁrms on 
               <br />
               Water Street today. Before the war that ﬁrm was 
               <br />
               selling so many goods and making so much 
               <br />
               proﬁt. Suddenly the war comes along and that 
               <br />
               ﬁrm’s sales start to jump, and they keep on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               creasing. That ﬁrm sells more goods and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> 
               <br />
               fore becomes more prosperous. They pay their 
               <br />
               clerks and other employees more wages; they do 
               <br />
               twice as much business as they did before the 
               <br />
               war, and are therefore two or three times as 
               <br />
               prosperous. Now if you went to the principals of 
               <br />
               that firm and asked them one simple question — 
               <br />
               what has caused this great prosperity that they are 
               <br />
               now enjoying? ~— would those principals say that 
               <br />
               it had nothing to do with the war? Would they say 
               <br />
               that it all came about from the normal growth of 
               <br />
               the business? If you go to any of our large fish 
               <br />
               ﬁrms, or to either of our paper mills or mining 
               <br />
               companies and ask them the same question, what 
               <br />
               would their answer be? Would any of them say 
               <br />
               that their present prosperity is not due to the war? 
               <br />
               Of course they wouldn’t. Ask the people who 
               <br />
               have extra money in the bank, or the people who 
               <br />
               have taken out extra life insurance in the past few 
               <br />
               years, won’t they tell you right away that they 
               <br />
               thank the war for it? The commonest saying you 
               <br />
               hear in Newfoundland when people mention the 
               <br />
               prosperity we have had, is that the man to thank 
               <br />
               for it all is Hitler. But when we turn to this 
               <br />
