               in the hearing of my voice knows there was only 
               <br />
               a portion of our trade monopolised under respon- 
               <br />
               sible government, which can, at this enlightened 
               <br />
               age, be remedied by ourselves. But to give 
               <br />
               Canada, or any country, a monopoly of all our 
               <br />
               trade is ridiculous. What is behind it all? Are 
               <br />
               there any selﬁsh motives? That is the question we 
               <br />
               may ask ourselves also. What do we see in the 
               <br />
               Canadian proposals that may cause us to throw 
               <br />
               in our all to them, and give them the monopoly 
               <br />
               of all our trade, and leave it to the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada to say who we shall deal with or who 
               <br />
               we shall not deal with? To me, the idea is 
               <br />
               ridiculous. I have come to the conclusion that the 
               <br />
               information that we now have is not conducive 
               <br />
               enough to cause us to leap in the dark by voting 
               <br />
               for confederation with Canada.

               I may have the privilege of rising in this chamber

               today who will be back. I would like to ask them 
               <br />
               that whenever anything arises that is not in the 
               <br />
               best interest of the country, such as monopolies,

               the discretion of withholding or putting that mo-

               Thursday the 22nd inst. there was a resolution
