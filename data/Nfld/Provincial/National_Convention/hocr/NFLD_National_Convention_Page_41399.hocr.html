               Mr. Starkes Mr. Chairman, I am not going to 
               <br />
               make a long speech on the two forms of govem—

               <br />
               we are not here to make any decisions, and 
               <br />
               secondly because the decision that is to be made 
               <br />
               will be made, so we are told in the National 
               <br />
               Convention Act, by the electorate of this country 
               <br />
               at a national referendum. I am supporting the

               motion now before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chain...</span>

               I am not voting to try and force any one form 
               <br />
               of government on the people. [personally realise 
               <br />
               my responsibility. What can we do, Mr. Chair— 
               <br />
               man? The National Convention Act tells us that 
               <br />
               we have to make recommendations to the British 
               <br />
               government. We have to recommend what forms 
               <br />
               of government will be submitted to our people for 
               <br />
               the referendum. This motion is now doing just 
               <br />
               that. I am in favour of supporting this resolutiOn 
               <br />
               as it is now, so that the people may have a chance 
               <br />
               to decide the form of government they think best, 
               <br />
               and I am happy to leave the choice of our future 
               <br />
               government in the hands of our people. I am glad 
               <br />
               that we, as a National Convention, are not asked 
               <br />
               to make the final decision on such an important 
               <br />
               question. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to be 
               <br />
               misunderstood in this thing. I will be voting to 
               <br />
               recommend that these two forms of government 
               <br />
               should be submitted to our people for their 
               <br />
               choice. I am not now called upon to vote for any 
               <br />
               one form of government, but when the referen- 
               <br />
               dum is held, and I have to cast my vote like all 
               <br />
               the rest of the people, I will certainly give it some 
               <br />
               deep thought before I vote for either responsible 
               <br />
               or Commission government. Both myself and the 
               <br />
               people have seen quite a lot of both kinds of 
               <br />
               government, and I would certainly never vote for 
               <br />
               either of them if I had a chance to vote for 
               <br />
               something better. There is one thing I am sure 
               <br />
               about, and it is this, that our people certainly want 
               <br />
               something better than we have had under respon-

               <br />
               the ﬁrst six or seven years until the war started,

               and our prosperity improved considerably,‘ 
               <br />
               through the war. They still remember, and what

               they want now is some form of government that 
               <br />

               <br />
               we have yet had. We have been told a lot about

               the Amulree royal commission and about Letters 
               <br />
               Patent, and all that sort of thing. Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               our people do not worry their heads about such 
               <br />
               things. All that is now past, and our people are 
               <br />
               not worried about legal documents made years 
               <br />
               and years ago. They have more important and 
               <br />
               personal matters to worry about. Their hope is 
               <br />
               that they will be able to get three square meals a 
               <br />
               day for themselves and their families, and a dollar 
               <br />
               in their pockets when they want it. What our 
               <br />
               people are worried about is how they are going 
               <br />
               to get a form of government that will give them 
               <br />
               a better chance to live. They are worried about 
               <br />
               what is going to happen when world depression 
               <br />
               comes back again. They are worried what is 
               <br />
               going to happen to them should the price of ﬁsh 
               <br />
               take another fall in price.

               I suppose, Mr. Chairman, that every member 
               <br />
               has made up his mind by now what form of 
               <br />

               this country, and so have I, but that has nothing 
               <br />
               to do with the motion before us today. We are 
               <br />
               asked to say what form of government we favour. 
               <br />
               The motion does not say that no other form of 
               <br />
               government cannot or should not be submitted to 
               <br />
               the people, but that these two forms of govern-

               decision at the national referendum will be the 
               <br />
               sons and daughters of fathers and mothers who 
               <br />
               had to exist, through no fault of their own, on dole 
               <br />
               through the dying days of responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and for six or seven years after the present 
               <br />
               form of government was borne into the country.

               Some of the people who will be called upon to
