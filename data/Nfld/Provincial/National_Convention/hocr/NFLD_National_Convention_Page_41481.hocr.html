               <br />
               was driven into the Convention’s proceedings 
               <br />
               with as much diplomacy as a battering-ram, and 
               <br />
               kept swinging with all the power that fanaticism. 
               <br />
               over—eagemess and agitation could muster. Un- 
               <br />
               derlying the whole issue was the insistent effort 
               <br />
               at every turn to prove that Newfoundland was in 
               <br />
               a hopeless mess, that she would never get out of 
               <br />
               it, in fact that it would get worse, and the only 
               <br />
               hope for Newfoundlanders was to have sense 
               <br />
               enough to come in out of the wet —— under the big

               cloud the real issues at stake by this smoke-screen 
               <br />
               of emotionalism, and by an appeal to the under- 
               <br />
               dog, will not succeed, Mr. Chairman. I resent this 
               <br />
               line of argument by the delegate from Bonavista 
               <br />
               Centre. It is an insult to the intelligence and the 
               <br />
               integrity of myself and others who do not see eye 
               <br />
               to eye with him. Of course, he is not trying to 
               <br />
               convince us; he tells us that every time he speaks 
               <br />
               into the microphones it is to the people, his 
               <br />
               masters, he is speaking. I solemnly warn the 
               <br />
               people to beware, to “beware the Greeks, when 
               <br />

               I resent also his statement that he is getting 
               <br />
               ready to go out and tell them the truth, which they 
               <br />

               called terms, this basis for confederation has been 
               <br />
               the storm—centre of such a prolonged discussion. 
               <br />
               What kind of truth is Mr. Smallwood going to 
               <br />
               bring to the people when he begins his crusade? 
               <br />
               Is it the same sort of inflammatory doctrine that 
               <br />
               he spewed forth on Friday last? If that is the kind 
               <br />
               of truth the people are to hear, then I say, God 
               <br />
               help them and God guard thee, Newfoundland!

               as I see it, the line of least resistance in this

               <br />
               everything in sight, every form of government on 
               <br />
