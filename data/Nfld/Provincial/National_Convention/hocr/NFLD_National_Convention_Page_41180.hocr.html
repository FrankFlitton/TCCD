               my limitations and I have not gone very 
               <br />
               thoroughly into the high finance of the question 
               <br />
               which has been, in any case, dealt with very 
               <br />
               effectively by other speakers. It is argued that we 
               <br />
               are too small to stand alone; yet other countries 
               <br />
               as small, and smaller, notably Iceland, have done 
               <br />
               so; and Iceland is not in half as important a part 
               <br />
               of the world as we are, and her position is not as 
               <br />
               quarter as strategic as ours; nor does she have 
               <br />
               even a fraction of the bargaining power that we 
               <br />
               possess. Even though there are 60 to 70 miles of 
               <br />
               deep Atlantic water between us and the mainland 
               <br />
               at the end that counts most, it is argued that we 
               <br />
               are a part of the Canadian mainland, when it 
               <br />
               would be equally correct or incorrect to argue that 
               <br />
               we are a part of the American mainland. The truth 
               <br />
               of the matter is, we are no more an intrinsic part 
               <br />
               of the mainland than is England of the continent 
               <br />
               of Europe, and I would recall to your attention 
               <br />
               how barely 25 miles of water made all the dif— 
               <br />
               ference for England in 1940. The attempt to foist 
               <br />
               confederation on us is to ignore the facts of 
               <br />
               geography and international politics, which 
               <br />
               makes us as much a part of the United States as 
               <br />
               of Canada. The men who voted for a delegation 
               <br />
               to Ottawa on the grounds that they were con- 
               <br />
               cerned with the people’s welfare, will not be able 
               <br />
               to reconcile their concern for that welfare with 
               <br />
               their refusal to vote to send a similar delegation 
               <br />
               to the United States.

               Mr. Vincent ML Chairman, if my introductory 
               <br />
               comments are just so much water under the

               bridge now, 1 yet cannot refrain from making 
               <br />
               reference to them. Some of us, after more than a 
               <br />
               year of bickerings, divisions and not too digniﬁed 
               <br />
               debates, had fondly hoped that with the passing 
               <br />
               of 1947 would come an eclipse of such shortcom- 
               <br />
               ings that would be as permanent as it was total. 
               <br />
               Unfortunately such has not been the case, and 
               <br />
               1948 brought no angel of light presenting this 
               <br />
               assembly with a certificate of freedom from 
               <br />
               having such millstones around its neck, and so 
               <br />
               the debates meander on.
