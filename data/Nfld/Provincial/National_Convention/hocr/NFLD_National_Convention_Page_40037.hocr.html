               <br />
               conception as to our actual status. We must 
               <br />
               realise that we are not in any sense a legislative 
               <br />
               assembly and that we have no power to make 
               <br />
               binding decisions. There has been much mis- 
               <br />
               guided talk about our far—reaching responsibility, 
               <br />
               but the fact of the matter is we have no legal 
               <br />
               responsibility whatever, for the simple reason 
               <br />
               that the Dominions Ofﬁce will not permit us to 
               <br />
               exercise any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility</span> As for the opinions 
               <br />
               or representations we may present to the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State for the Dominions, if such do 
               <br />
               not suit he can and probably will throw them in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wastevpaper</span> basket. Our status is simply that 
               <br />
               of a mock parliament, a discussion group, a study 
               <br />
               club, and that’s where our power and respon— 
               <br />
               sibility begins and ends. Under present circum- 
               <br />
               stances the responsibility for Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               future rests ﬁrstly in the hands of the British 
               <br />
               government, and secondly in the hands of our 
               <br />
               people themselves, provided they are permitted 
               <br />
               to vote in a plebiscite authorised by Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attlee,</span> 
               <br />
               For ourselves, we are simply third <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paru'es</span> to the 
               <br />
               whole transaction. Some people who are as not

               yet aware of the tme nature of this Convention 
               <br />
               may be surprised to hear me speak of it in what 
               <br />
               they may regard as a disrespectful manner, but 
               <br />
               mark my word, and note, that as time goes on, 
               <br />
               and the true nature of this whole thing emerges 
               <br />
               from the impressive stage-settings with which it 
               <br />
               is dressed up, they will fully endorse the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">semi»</span> 
               <br />
               merits I have expressed today. They will realise 
               <br />
               that in their dealings with Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               Mr. Attlee, the Dominions Ofﬁce, and the local 
               <br />
               Commission, have stolen the vocabulary of 
               <br />
               democracy, but they have deliberately sidetrack- 
               <br />

               misunderstanding as to my unchanging attitude 
               <br />
               in this matter. I did not wait until I was elected to 
               <br />
               condemn this Convention idea. From its first 
               <br />
               announcement, I have consistently denounced it 
               <br />
               as being conceived with the deliberate idea of 
               <br />
               indeﬁnitely prolonging the rule of Commission 
               <br />
               government in this country. I told the people of 
               <br />
               my district in St. John’s West, that I came before 
               <br />
               them as a 100% advocate of responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment; that if they elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me,’I</span> would use every 
               <br />
               effort to see that the Dominions Office and the 
               <br />
               British government carried out the pledge made 
               <br />
               to this country in 1933. It is for these things that 
               <br />
               the people have sent me to this assembly, and I 
               <br />
               do not intend to fail them. Again, I emphatically 
               <br />
               condemn the motives which inspired this Con- 
               <br />
               vention, and I equally condemn the purposes for 
               <br />
               which the Dominions Ofﬁce would use this as- 
               <br />
               sembly of Newfoundland representatives. But we 
               <br />
               have to be realists, we have to make the best of 
               <br />
               the situation thrust upon us; and, as good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> 
               <br />
               times comes out of evil, I at least hope to see in 
               <br />
               this assembly an opportunity for a long silenced, 
               <br />
               long subjugated country to recover its voice. I see 
               <br />
               in it the first opportunity given our people in 14 
               <br />
               years to lawfully come together and consider the 
               <br />
               fate of their common country, and by the personal 
               <br />
               contacts thereby created to strengthen the bonds 
               <br />
               of their blood and soil. 1 see in it an opportunity 
               <br />
               for giving birth and outlining plans for the freeing 
               <br />
               of our country from her present state of national 
               <br />
               dishonour, of laying the cornerstone of a new 
               <br />
               freedom and making the first advances towards 
               <br />
               that new and brighter future so long denied and 
               <br />
               desired by us. And it is with the desire of assisting
