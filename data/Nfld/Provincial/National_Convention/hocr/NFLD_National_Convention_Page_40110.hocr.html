               Mr. Hollett I rise to speak against the motion, 
               <br />
               but in case there is any doubt in the mind of my 
               <br />
               friend, Mr. Smallwood, I am not speaking for the 
               <br />
               amendment against the motion. It seems to me 
               <br />
               that I have seen this motion in a different form 
               <br />
               than what was brought before us today. Appar- 
               <br />
               ently there are some discrepancies behind the 
               <br />
               motion, as to who is or is not the proper authority. 
               <br />
               The form in which I saw that motion deﬁnitely 
               <br />
               states that His Excellency the Governor be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap~</span> 
               <br />
               proached to make the necessary arrangements to 
               <br />
               assure us whether or not the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada would receive a delegation in order to 
               <br />
               discuss the terms of confederation. The bringing 
               <br />
               in of this motion at this particular juncture in our 
               <br />
               deliberations is so premature as to be positively 
               <br />
               indecent. Before we have had time to consider 
               <br />
               and discuss among ourselves the economic and 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial position — before we have had time to 
               <br />
               glance over the initial reports brought in, our 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Smallwood ﬂew to Quebec and else- 
               <br />
               where and came back from Canada thoroughly 
               <br />
               prepared to ﬁght this thing to the bitter end with 
               <br />
               the idea that when this Convention was over it be 
               <br />
               committed deﬁnitely to confederation.

               proached the members of this Convention and 
               <br />

               gentlemen, these manoeuvres are positively in-

               decent. We are self-thinking individuals elected

               <br />
               various things at issue. On the other hand, who 
               <br />
               are the appropriate authorities of this country? 
               <br />
               Who are the proper authorities to whom we shall

               appeal as to whether or not we should send a 
               <br />
               delegation to Canada to ﬁnd out the terms of 
               <br />
               confederation? Here we are, elected by the 
               <br />
               people, and unfortunately we find we have not 
               <br />
               even the right to go into public offices and 
               <br />
               demand certain information. Do you mean to tell 
               <br />
               me that Canada would discuss with an un- 
               <br />
               authorised body the terms of confederation? 
               <br />
               There is a chance that these terms will be even~ 
               <br />
               tually turned down. Do you think that any ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               body in Canada would do anything that would 
               <br />
               make them appear so ridiculous in the eyes of

               confederation and terms and conditions of con- 
               <br />
