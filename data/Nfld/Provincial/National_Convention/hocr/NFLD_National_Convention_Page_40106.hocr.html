               The Convention has been in session now 
               <br />
               something over six weeks. The committees have 
               <br />
               been working something over four weeks. One 
               <br />
               interim report has been referred to its committee. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst two actual reports, the education and 
               <br />
               forestry reports have just this day been submitted 
               <br />
               for debate. Yet, it is at this point, that Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Small‘</span> 
               <br />
               wood, the “self-appointed apostle of confed- 
               <br />
               eration” as he has been called, chooses to 
               <br />
               introduce his resolution. In other words before 
               <br />
               the Convention has been given even half a chance 
               <br />
               to get a true picture of the Newfoundland scene, 
               <br />
               it is proposed that we should send a delegation 
               <br />
               post-haste to ﬁnd what Canada will give us if we 
               <br />
               are well-behaved and come round as quickly as 
               <br />
               possible to Mr. Smallwood’s way of thinking. 
               <br />
               Yet if the Convention agrees on its ﬁndings that 
               <br />
               the country is self-supporting, and can continue 
               <br />
               to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfvsupporting,</span> then there is no necessity 
               <br />
               for us to seek aid from anyone. On the other hand 
               <br />
               if the ﬁndings are negative and assistance must 
               <br />
               be sought, then it is sound logic that we may have 
               <br />
               to go to the United Kingdom, as well as Canada 
               <br />
               and perhaps even the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.</span> But all this 
               <br />
               is still somewhat in the future, and I submit that 
               <br />
               the motion is premature — it is in plain everyday 
               <br />
               language “jumping the gun.” 
               <br />

               I do not propose to go into the constitutionality 
               <br />
               of the matter at this stage, for that would be just 
               <br />
               as premature as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood‘s resolution. But 
               <br />
               I would like to make one observation in this 
               <br />
               regard. The terms of reference, which are begin- 
               <br />
               ning to look pretty sick as time goes on, have been 
               <br />
               stretched, twisted and shrunken to suit every 
               <br />
               point of view, so that they may be said to permit 
               <br />
               almost anything, and at the same time allow 
               <br />
               nothing. On the one hand the Convention has no 
               <br />
               powers. It is not a governing body; it cannot 
               <br />
               subpoena witnesses to come before it; it cannot 
               <br />
               compel public servants to divulge what should be 
               <br />
               public information. On the other hand a member 
               <br />
               of the Convention seeks at this stage, in the midst 
               <br />
               of the very preliminaries, to endow it with the 
               <br />
               sovereign powers of a government to enable a 
               <br />
               delegation of its members to go to the capital of 
               <br />
               another country and there discuss terms of union. 
               <br />
               It is very inconsistent.

               damental question and preferred not to express 
               <br />
               any personal opinions. His impartial paper dealt 
               <br />
               only with the political and ﬁnancial set-up in the 
               <br />
               event that Newfoundland were to ever enter the 
               <br />
               confederation. But this he did say: “At the outset, 
               <br />
               I would, however say that in my opinion, the 
               <br />
               ﬁnal decision on Confederation, as far as New— 
               <br />
               foundland is concerned, must rest with the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, and that they should be asked 
               <br />
               to register that decision only after negotiations to 
               <br />
               secure the best offer of terms from Canada have 
               <br />
               been completed on their behalf by a sovereign 
               <br />
               government of their own choosing. If these 
               <br />
               negotiations were to be conducted under any 
               <br />
               other auspices the terms secured would be bound 
               <br />
               to be suspect, and even if confederation were 
               <br />
               achieved in this manner, it would leave a heritage 
               <br />
