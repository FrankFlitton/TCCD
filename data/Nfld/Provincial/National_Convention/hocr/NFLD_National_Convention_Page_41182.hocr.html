               During the Christmas recess I was approached 
               <br />
               by a very intelligent ﬁsherman. Walking into my 
               <br />
               store, he greeted me with, “Merry Christmas, 
               <br />
               proﬁteer". I had long ago joined “the customer is 
               <br />
               always right club", so I couldn’t say a thing about 
               <br />
               it. In his hand he carried copies of a Montreal 
               <br />
               daily and the Maritime Merchant. “What have 
               <br />
               you there?", I asked. “Something for you to carry 
               <br />
               back to the Convention", he rejoined, and then he 
               <br />
               let loose with a barrage. “Is this correct,” he 
               <br />
               asked, “Maritime Merchant — flour, 98 pound 
               <br />
               bag, $4.75 at St. John, New Brunswick?" I tried 
               <br />
               to explain the subsidy. He then quoted “Hay, $30 
               <br />
               per ton”. This was November 8, 1947. “What are 
               <br />
               your prices?”, he asked. Flour $10; hay $60. He 
               <br />
               pointed to a footnote which said a subsidy of $2 
               <br />
               had recently been removed from flour; the earlier 
               <br />
               price was exactly $2.78. He then quoted retail 
               <br />
               prices from page 6 of a Montreal daily — 
               <br />
               emperor grapes, 8 cents per pound. “What’s your 
               <br />
               price?" he asked. “Only 30 cents,” I said. I tried 
               <br />
               to explain disparity in prices. My only reward 
               <br />
               was “swindler”, and I might as well have tried to 
               <br />
               swim the Atlantic as to convince that fellow. I 
               <br />
               trust you will pardon me, sir, for talking about 
               <br />
               such mundane things as grocery prices, but since 
               <br />
               we all must eat, grocery stores are very important 
               <br />
               places, and it is in the grocery stores and ﬁshing 
               <br />
               boats that the government of tomorrow will be 
               <br />
               decided. Mr. Smallwood may not be a mile and 
               <br />
               a year ahead of his noisiest critic, as someone has 
               <br />
               written, but if he can intelligently show that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con«</span>

               federation means a lowering of the cost of living,

               as an elected representative of this assembly, I am

               going to weigh the issue dispassionately, basing

               Major Cashin and Mr. Higgins recently made 
               <br />
               two ﬁne speeches, both of great length and signal 
               <br />
               distinction. The Major said, in so many words, 
               <br />
               that the Canadians want the Labrador. In this 
               <br />
               connection will someone tell me just how many 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders have gotten work in our big 
               <br />
               northern dependency? Actually, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               as far as I am aware, Bonavista North sent its ﬁrst 
               <br />
               deputation of labourers this past summer, when 
               <br />
               through the kind ofﬁce of my good friend, Mr. 
               <br />
               Claude Howse, a number of our fishermen 
               <br />
               secured work at Knob Lake with a Canadian 
               <br />
               company doing preparatory prospecting in that 
               <br />
               area. Major Cashin has already stressed that this 
               <br />
               was a Canadian company interested in the 
               <br />
               development of Labrador. That, to my mind, 
               <br />
               sounds like a very good argument for the afﬁnit— 
               <br />
               ative of the motion. The Major further stressed, 
               <br />
               with a rather alarming use of superlatives, the 
               <br />
               very awkward position which, in his opinion, 
               <br />
               Canada ﬁnds herself at the moment. So far as I 
               <br />
               am concerned, that was simply the Major’s 
               <br />
               opinion. I was particularly struck, however, by 
               <br />
               his application of the term “immoral” to the 
               <br />
               Canadian system of family allowance. I am quite 
               <br />
               sure that the Major was not at all serious when he 
               <br />
               used this, for surely a subsidy of $60 or $70 per 
               <br />
               year that will ensure some worried mother the
