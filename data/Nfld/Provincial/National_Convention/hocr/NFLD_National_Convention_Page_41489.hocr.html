               written in the bond. What was written in the bond 
               <br />
               was that I should recommend possible forms of 
               <br />
               future government to be put before the people at 
               <br />
               a national referendum It was not mentioned that 
               <br />
               I should express a personal preference. And in- 
               <br />
               deed, the whole idea of expressing preference is 
               <br />
               repugnant to me. For by expressing preference, 
               <br />
               this Convention will register a majority approval 
               <br />
               of one form of government to the exclusion of all 
               <br />
               others, and thereby inﬂuence the result of the 
               <br />
               referendum. Little as we are thought of by all the 
               <br />
               holier—than—thous who are so certain that they 
               <br />
               could have done better, there are still many who 
               <br />
               would likely be inﬂuenced by a majority vote of 
               <br />
               the Convention But for the Convention to take 
               <br />
               advantage of that likelihood and register a 
               <br />
               majority opinion, seems to me like a distortion of 
               <br />
               its purpose; and consequently I will not be a party 
               <br />
               to the expression of preference. For my part I 
               <br />
               would prefer that the people should go to the 
               <br />
               referendum with their minds unbiased by any 
               <br />
               majority declaration of preference by this Con-

               As far as I am qualiﬁed to judge, I cannot see 
               <br />
               why the issue of union with Canada upon the 
               <br />

               go in the matter at this moment. But I do have to 
               <br />
               face the query as to whether or not it is ﬁtting and 
               <br />

               To begin, let me say that I do not pretend to 
               <br />
               be an expert, an authority, or even a novice in 
               <br />
               constitutional law. To tell the truth, I don’t know 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst thing about it. My concern most of the 
               <br />
               days of my life has been with trying to help the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               leave discussion of the constitutional position “at

               confederation being placed on the ballot paper is

               much ado about nothing. I am not prepared to 
               <br />
               accept the argument that makes the placing of 
               <br />
               confederation upon the referendum ballot a 
               <br />

               <br />
               all to say that it is not constitutionally proper for 
               <br />

               <br />
               all that is distortion of the realities of the matter. 
               <br />
               To me such an argument makes as much sense as 
               <br />
               it would to say that two and two make ﬁve ——

               I have said that in determining upon referen-

               dum alternatives we are bound in conscience, by 
               <br />
               tradition, and in fact and by right reason in all 
               <br />
               things. I can ﬁnd no cause therein to exclude 
               <br />
               confederation from the consideration of the 
               <br />
               people. It is not legitimate to contend to the 
               <br />
               contrary, on the grounds that proper constitution— 
               <br />
               al procedure requires return to responsible 
               <br />
               government before the people are approached to 
               <br />
               discover if they desire union with Canada. That 
               <br />
               is not the case. It may be that we should have to 
               <br />
               have some measure of restoration of responsible 
               <br />
               government before the act of passing into the 
               <br />
               Canadian confederation could be ofﬁcially con- 
               <br />
               cluded. But that is a different matter, and in no 
               <br />
               way concerns the referendum.

               The referendum, to my mind, is a device in— 
               <br />
               tended purely and simply to ﬁnd out what the 
               <br />
               people desire in the way of government. No 
               <br />
               considerations of constitutional propriety can 
               <br />
               conceivably be involved. It’s to be a simple mat- 
               <br />
               ter of asking the people just what they prefer in 
               <br />
               the way of government ~— a matter every bit as 
               <br />
               simple as asking them what they would prefer in 
               <br />
               the way of pie. And there are no constitutional 
               <br />
               strings attached to the act of ascertaining the 
               <br />
               desired constitution, anymore than there would

               be constitutional strings attached to the act of

               ascertaining the desired pie — whether itbe apple

               pie or blueberry pie, or pie by and by from 
               <br />
               Ottawa. Unless it can be shown that confedera-

               tion per se is not a proper alternative, we may not

               consideration of constitutionality which do not

               enter into the matter. What the proper procedure
