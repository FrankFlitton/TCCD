               that day say?.... But there is a test. It is not enough

               for the government of that day to say, “We need

               foundland people more burdensome than in the

               having to put on more taxation more burdensome

               having regard to their capacity to pay.... That’s 
               <br />
               the clause: “having regard to capacity to pay".

               Don’t lose sight of that clause in all your con-

               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I still can’t understand a royal com-

               that this country will be able to be run for $72, I

               Mr. Bailey $75 instead of $122. Well it’s only 
               <br />
               $3 out. Now then, we will take capacity to pay. I 
               <br />
               think if anybody here understands these two 
               <br />
               places I do. We will take Fortune and Shelbume. 
               <br />
               We will take the municipal taxes in the two 
               <br />
               places. I believe they have got a town council in 
               <br />
               Fortune and I believe the government is paying 
               <br />
               half of that town council for the current year, 
               <br />
               Then if we go over to Shelbume, a town with 
               <br />
               practically the same earning capacity as Fortune, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd they have got a population of 1,605, they 
               <br />
               have 50 sidewalks, 3.5 miles of asphalt, and no 
               <br />
               stone or gravel roads. And we ﬁnd out they are 
               <br />
               spending $19,299 for municipal purposes, and 
               <br />
               $16,200 to educate their children. They have a 
               <br />
               total tax levied of 61%. The cost for each pupil is 
               <br />
               $61 per year. The total tax is $36.1 17. In the light 
               <br />
               of that, if a royal commission comes down here 
               <br />
