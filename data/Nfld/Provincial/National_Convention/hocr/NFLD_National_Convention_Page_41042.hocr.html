               Mr. Smallwond There are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin There are. You told us about some 
               <br />
               in the Steering Committee the other day. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The first I heard of it —— only 
               <br />
               the one showing the public debt of Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Why was it not in the Black Book? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well, we have it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Yes, but it has to be blasted out of 
               <br />
               you. There’s other documents they have going 
               <br />
               back two or three years, and we should have 
               <br />
               them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I don’t know, and if any other 
               <br />
               member knows of any secret document I ask him 
               <br />
               to name it. There are seven of us, and I don’t 
               <br />
               know of any document going back three years. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I believe what Mr. Cashin is refer- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> ring to is the one you referred to in the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee the other day. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood What document? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins That Blue Book. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin You mentioned some document we 
               <br />
               have not seen, and l think we should have it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood That’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">true.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin We did not send you people up to 
               <br />
               Ottawa as a beggarly delegation — we sent you 
               <br />
               to Ottawa representing what I consider a fairly 
               <br />
               prosperous country, and what you did, you went 
               <br />
               up with your hat in your hands and said, “What 
               <br />
               are the best terms you can give us?” That’s what 
               <br />
               happened. I bring that out right now, but as I go 
               <br />
               along I just want to make this clear: I ﬁnd now 
               <br />
               that there’s ten or 15 people who will be laid off, 
               <br />
               but there is nothing deﬁnite laid down as to where 
               <br />
               they will be employed. Those people who are 
               <br />
               included in the Black Book will ﬁnd that when 
               <br />
               the provincial government (if we ever get one, 
               <br />
               and I doubt it) takes over the affairs of the 
               <br />
               province, that their jobs are gone, and they will 
               <br />
               have to go with their hats in their hands looking 
               <br />
               for similar employment. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Before you take your seat, 1 
               <br />
               would like to draw your attention to the fact that 
               <br />
               the document which occasioned so much mystery 
               <br />
               was, at my request, turned over to the secretarial 
               <br />
               staff. and is being mimeographed at the moment, 
               <br />
               and I understand it will be available to members 
               <br />
               tomorrow or the next day at the latest. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I hope we get them all. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I want to make a very brief 
               <br />
               reply to Major Cashin. He says that in the Finance

               <br />
               true, but I would draw Major Cashin’s attention 
               <br />
               to the fact that here in Newfoundland the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada would open up a number of 
               <br />
               federal departments over and above the depart- 
               <br />

               over and run... Iestimate that the Government of

               <br />
               they take over with them the employees that are 
               <br />
               in them) would have to take on at least LOOO civil 
               <br />
               servants in the new ofﬁces and departments that 
               <br />
               they would have to open up. and any civil ser-

               government departments that would be opened 
               <br />
               up. It is true that in departments that would be- 
               <br />
               come provincial departments there will be fewer 
               <br />
               employees, so many will have to go; but they and 
               <br />
               many more will be taken on in entirely new 
               <br />

               One other point only: Major Cashin tells us 
               <br />
               that the number of employees in the Customs 
               <br />

               are employed in the Department of Customs to 
               <br />

               need employees to collect that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money.</span> Let me tell 
               <br />
               Major Cashin that if the Government of Canada.

               when it takes over the Customs Department, if in

               <br />
               only $2-4 million a year, they will need just as

               will have the same number of collectors and title
