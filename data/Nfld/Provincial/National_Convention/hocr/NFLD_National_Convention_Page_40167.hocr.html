               possible question that could be asked about 
               <br />
               education in Newfoundland. In going back to the 
               <br />
               question of what we were sent here for, I think 
               <br />
               we were to examine and inquire into the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               and economic condition of this island. In view of 
               <br />
               this we felt that we had to inquire mostly into the 
               <br />
               amount that was being spent on education. We 
               <br />
               have that in black and white. We have certain

               <br />
               discuss the philosophy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education.</span> Everybody 
               <br />
               has ideas on this, and we could probably have 
               <br />
               gone on at great length discussing such things. I 
               <br />
               have supplementary information here which may

               Mr. Job Sometime ago when the Chadwick- 
               <br />
               Jones report1 was being considered, I think 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller made the suggestion that when any 
               <br />
               report came up we might perhaps consider the 
               <br />
               ﬁndings of the Chadwick-Jones report in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com</span> 
               <br />
               junction with the new report. Mr. Newell <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ade»</span> 
               <br />
               quately stated that the report was based mainly 
               <br />
               upon giving the information as to the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               standard of the education business. I noticed in 
               <br />
               looking into these f1 gures here a rather interesting 
               <br />
               comparison. In the Chadwick—Jones report the 
               <br />
               subsidies, grants, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc,</span> for 1935-36 are given as 
               <br />
               $696,000; in your report, the total education grant 
               <br />
               is given as $956,000, a difference of nearly 
               <br />
               $300,000, and the same applies to 1941 and 1942 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood That matter did come up 
               <br />
               before. When the report of the Education Com 
               <br />
               mittee went before the Steering Committee, 
               <br />
               before being presented to this house, the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee noted these apparent discrepancies to 
               <br />
               which Mr. Job has just referred and returned the 
               <br />
               report to the Education Committee, pointing 
               <br />
               them out. The Education Committee, in good 
               <br />
               humour and without rancour, looked at the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures and were quite content that its OWn ﬁgures 
               <br />
               were accurate. It had gone to great pains to make 
               <br />
               them accurate and was rather suspicious of any 
               <br />
               difference in the Chadwick-Jones report. Being 
               <br />
               quite conﬁdent of our ﬁgures, we felt that it was 
               <br />
               the Chadwick-Jones ﬁgures that were wrong. We 
               <br />
               found that they deal with two entirely different 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amounts.</span> Our ﬁgures include the same things as 
               <br />
               the Chadwick-Jones report, but they include 
               <br />
               other things as well... Our figures include <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every"</span> 
               <br />
               thing. You may take it that the ﬁgures in this 
               <br />
               report are quite accurate. They may not be com~ 
               <br />
               pared because the two tables deal with different 
               <br />
               matters.

               Mr. Newell The figures for the graded and un- 
               <br />
               graded teachers are: graded teachers 1,788, un- 
               <br />
               graded teachers 326. All grades from third up to 
               <br />
               university grade are lumped together in graded 
               <br />
               teachers. That would give about 20% roughly of 
               <br />
               ungraded teachers. That was at June 30, l944. I
