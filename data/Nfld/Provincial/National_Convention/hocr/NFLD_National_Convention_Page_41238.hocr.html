               guaranteed. We have in Newfoundland what is

               Mr. Harrington does not deny this. But what he 
               <br />
               does suggest is that under confederation this 
               <br />
               guarantee might be upset or cast aside. And what 
               <br />
               reason does he suggest? The Manitoba school 
               <br />
               case, which was one of the most famous cases of 
               <br />
               its kind in North American history, about as 
               <br />
               famous as the Oregon school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case.</span> The Manitoba 
               <br />
               school case brought the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               toppling down when it happened And that case 
               <br />
               taught all the governments of Canada a lesson 
               <br />
               they‘ll never forget. It taught them this lesson — 
               <br />
               not, not to meddle in educational matters in the 
               <br />
               provinces. Why, you couldn’t dynamite the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada today into getting itself 
               <br />
               mixed up in educational matters. They won’t 
               <br />
               touch <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.r..</span> In our clause on education all 
               <br />
               denominational rights are guaranteed and our 
               <br />
               provincial government is not allowed to make 
               <br />
               any laws or changes that would prejudicially 
               <br />
               affect the rights of any denomination. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supv</span> 
               <br />
               pose some provincial government ever tried to do 
               <br />
               so. What then? Would the denomination con- 
               <br />
               cemed have to go to the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               seeking redress? No, they would not. The 
               <br />
               Government of Canada wouldn’t be in the picture 
               <br />
               at all. They would go to the Supreme Court of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and there they would get justice. 
               <br />
               The Supreme Court would have to carry out this 
               <br />
               clause, which guarantees the rights of all the 
               <br />
               denominations. And if by any chance, if by any 
               <br />
               remote chance, our own Supreme Court failed to 
               <br />
               carry out this clause, that would not end it either. 
               <br />
               For then, the case could be appealed to the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court of Canada itself. That, sir, is a 
               <br />
               vast improvement over the Manitoba <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clause,</span> It’s 
               <br />
               not with governments or cabinets or parliaments 
               <br />
               we’d have to deal, but with the very seat of justice 
               <br />
               — the Supreme Court <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itselfi</span> Mr. Harrington can 
               <br />
               rest his mind in this matter. I can tell him this. I 
               <br />
               for one would not be so foolish, so short-sighted 
               <br />
               as to advocate confederation if this education 
               <br />
               matter had not been ﬁxed up to the satisfaction of 
               <br />
               all concerned. Not for one split second would I 
               <br />
               waste my breath advocating confederation if this 
               <br />
               education matter had not been thoroughly and 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               absolutely ﬁxed up. I know my country, sir, 
               <br />
               believe me. I know the deep and unshakeable 
               <br />
               loyalty of our people —- all our people — to their 
               <br />
               denominations. I know the loyalty of our people 
               <br />
               to their various school systems. We have a school 
               <br />
               system which is a Newfoundland system, that has 
               <br />
               grown up out of our Newfoundland ideals, our 
               <br />
               Newfoundland outlook on life. It is a system that 
               <br />
               has grown up naturally, and I am the last person 
               <br />
               who would upset it or allow it to be upset. Believe 
               <br />
               me, I went to Ottawa with that thought uppermost 
               <br />
               in mind. I cared not what material advantages 
               <br />
               there might be for us in confederation. My mind 
               <br />
               was made up. I was detemiined not to advocate 
               <br />
               confederation unless and until all denominational 
               <br />
               rights were fully guaranteed. Sir, it’s bad enough 
               <br />
               to have to ﬁght prejudice, but the one thing I will 
               <br />
               not ﬁght is the deepest loyalty of our people. 
               <br />
               Thank God I do not have to do it, for the school 
               <br />
               rights of all our denominations have been fully 
               <br />
               protected and guaranteed. All education matters 
               <br />
               under confederation have been left just where 
               <br />
               they belong — right here in Newfoundland. So 
               <br />
               that’s one question that won’t turn our people 
               <br />
               against confederation.

               I turn to Mr. Butt. I am frankly puzzled to 
               <br />
               understand what Mr. Butt was getting at when he 
               <br />
               mentioned the Sacco-Vanzetti case. He was 
               <br />
               speaking at the time about the Privy Council’s 
               <br />
               Labrador boundary award, and the impression I 
               <br />
               gathered from his remarks was that he was trying 
               <br />
               to make out that maybe the Privy Council award 
               <br />
               is not binding and ﬁnal seeing what happened in 
               <br />
               the Sacco-Vanzetti case... I agree with you, sir, 
               <br />
               it is a matter for smiling. What the Sacco-Vanzet- 
               <br />
               ti case in Boston has to do with the Privy Council 
               <br />
               of Great Britain, is frankly more than I can see. 
               <br />
               Sacco and Vanzetti were sentenced to death by a 
               <br />
               court in Massachusetts in the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> It 
               <br />
               was admittedly a terrible miscarriage of justice 
               <br />
               But what has that got to do with the character or 
               <br />
               the nature of the Privy Council, or with a decision 
               <br />
               of the Privy Council of Great Britain? Instead of 
               <br />
               hinting, why doesn’t Mr. Butt come right out and 
               <br />
               say deﬁnitely that he places no dependence on the 
               <br />
               decision of the Privy Council? 
               <br />
