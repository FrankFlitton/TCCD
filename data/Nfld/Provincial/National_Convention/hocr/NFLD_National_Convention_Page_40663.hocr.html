               Mr. Smallwood Well sir, it is a question,

               whether the chairman of the Finance Committee, 
               <br />
               Major Cashin, cares or whether all the members 
               <br />
               of the Convention care or whether the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland care to answer it in their own 
               <br />
               minds; it’s an oraton'cal question, if you like. To 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed in my own mind, what! want to know 
               <br />
               is this. From 1900-1947, there is the story of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. From 1947-2000, or to 1997, for 
               <br />
               the next 50 years, what are the prospects of more 
               <br />
               windfalls? Are there any more paper mills, any 
               <br />
               more Buchans mines? Are there any more branch 
               <br />
               railways that can be started? Or if not, must we 
               <br />
               wait for more world wars? Must the whole world 
               <br />
               be deluged in blood so that we may prosper? 
               <br />
               What windfalls may we fairly and honestly ex- 
               <br />
               pect in the next 47 years to make us equal our 
               <br />
               condition in the last 47 years? 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Mr. Smallwood, I am reluctant~ 
               <br />
               ly compelled to remind you that we’re now dis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Economic Report. As far as I’m concerned, 
               <br />
               there is no such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report...</span> I must therefore request 
               <br />
               you to conﬁne yourself to the report itself, rather 
               <br />
               then to go outside of it and ask questions which 
               <br />
               are not covered, or not intended to be covered, by 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I will abide by your ruling 
               <br />
               there, sir. I would like to point out, a propos of 
               <br />
               the ﬁnances of the country to date that in the 
               <br />
               time that I’ve been alive, our population in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland has increased to be half as much again 
               <br />
               as it was the day I was born. It’s increased <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">50%.</span> 
               <br />
               But in the same 47 years, our exports have in- 
               <br />
               creased six times.... But, and here’s the but, the 
               <br />
               expenditure of the Newfoundland government is 
               <br />
               now 19 times greater then it was the year I was 
               <br />
               born. Let me repeat that. Our population has 
               <br />
               increased half as much or more as it was when I 
               <br />
               was born. Our exports have increased six times. 
               <br />
               But our government, our government is taking 19 
               <br />
               times as much from us in taxation as they took 
               <br />
               from us 47 years ago. Now what I’m going to 
               <br />

               <br />
               They’re taking too much from us. In the last three 
               <br />
               years, they’ve taken over 51%, over half the

               upon the ﬁgures and facts contained in the

               Finance Report. I have summarised the statistics 
               <br />
               given in the report and drawn from them a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deducv</span> 
               <br />
               tion. I’ve made an interpretation of them. That 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has now come to the point where 
               <br />
               she must either reduce expenditure or she must 
               <br />
               increase the value of her exports; that today 
               <br />
               government expenditure is eating up too much of 
               <br />
               the value of what we produce. That today in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland the government is too heavy a 
               <br />
               burden on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> We can’t carry it. And either they 
               <br />
               must reduce the burden of taxation, or they must 
               <br />
               increase the value of our exports. Now can we do 
               <br />
               that? That is a matter that will come before us, as 
               <br />
               you have suggested, when the Economic Report 
               <br />
               is presented. I don’t propose to try to guess or 
               <br />
               estimate what we can do in the future. But I do 
               <br />
               pose this problem now that faces us, that must be 
               <br />
               solved. Namely that Newfoundland is in what my 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Keough would call an extremely vul- 
               <br />
               nerable position when just this past year 60% of 
               <br />
               the total value of all our exports was taken by the 
               <br />
               government and spent on public services. We 
               <br />
               must reduce the cost of government or we must 
               <br />
               increase the value of our wealth production in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Now sir, I don’t know what the 
               <br />
               intentions are. All this talk... 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood All that I have been saying this 
               <br />
               afternoon is nearly one point. And it’s a long

               my notes by me, and if I were to do it, we would
