               time is not ripe to get these terms; we must first 
               <br />
               set our house in order, and until then we should

               Mr. Dawe Mr. Chairman, I have no prepared 
               <br />
               speech. I happen to have had the honour to rep- 
               <br />
               resent Newfoundland at the Imperial Ottawa 
               <br />
               Conferences at the request of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Board of Trade on timber in 1932, and I have had 
               <br />
               an ofﬁce in the Ottawa House of Parliament 
               <br />
               building. I know something of the tricks of the 
               <br />
               trade and political intrigue. I have been in 
               <br />
               England, and I know some of the senators of 
               <br />
               Canada, the late Senator Webster of the British 
               <br />
               Coal Corporation, with whom I negotiated the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst barter deal of pitprops with England for 300 
               <br />
               years, and later through Senator Webster 250,000 
               <br />
               tons of Wabana ore. The basis of our Ottawa 
               <br />
               agreement was contingent on Newfoundland 
               <br />
               selling 500,000 tons of Wabana ore. Baldwin and 
               <br />
               Thomas promised Mr. Alderdice they would do 
               <br />
               their best, and I succeeded in breaking down the 
               <br />
               prejudice of the blast furnace owners in England 
               <br />
               with the result that Wabana ore is going there 
               <br />
               today. Baldwin and Thomas did not do it, and I 
               <br />
               have the correspondence for it.

               <br />
               days ago brought in by Mr. Smallwood, I made 
               <br />
               it plain I stood here opposed to confederation at 
               <br />

               to responsible government, and for that reason 
               <br />
               suggested when speaking on the resolution, that 
               <br />
               we also should ascertain from the British House 
               <br />
               of Parliament what they are prepared to do for us 
               <br />
               in the way of cancelling our national debt, or any 
               <br />
               other handouts that we should be prepared to 
               <br />
               consider valuable, having in mind our very close

               I am definitely opposed to the present form of

               Commission of Government as we had it forced 
               <br />
               upon us and had to endure it during the past 13 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> I said “forced upon us”, because we all 
               <br />
               know that the government of thatday, before they 
               <br />
               went to the country, made a pledge when present- 
               <br />
               in g their manifesto that before they would change 
               <br />
               our constitution, they would ﬁrst submit the 
               <br />
               change to the people in a referendum. This they 
               <br />
               did not do, they did not stand by their pledge 
               <br />
               made to the electorate, but voted for and insti-

               ment. I must confess that many of our people 
               <br />
               have during those years lost interest in the public 
               <br />
               affairs of this country, probably brought about by 
               <br />
               this so called prosperity that our country now 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enjoys.</span> We are all conscious of the fact that this 
               <br />
               prosperity is not going to last forever, and God 
               <br />
               knows, everyone here must feel in their own 
               <br />
               hearts that we now must determine the future 
               <br />
               destiny of our people bearing in mind the prob—

               ability, almost the certainty, that hard times will 
               <br />
