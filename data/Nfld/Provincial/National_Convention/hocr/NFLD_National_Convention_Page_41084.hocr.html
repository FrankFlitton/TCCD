               Mr. Smallwood Yes, but a conclusion, 1 hold, 
               <br />
               utterly without foundation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is another matter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood We had a reply here which 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett read yesterday, a reply from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland govemment...that in case we became 
               <br />
               a province, the principals in the bases’ treaty 
               <br />
               would be the Government of Canada and the 
               <br />
               Government of the United States. That of course 
               <br />
               is true, because defence is a federal matter. There 
               <br />
               is a Joint Defence Board of the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada, and all defence matters relating to 
               <br />
               Canada and the United States come under that 
               <br />
               Board -——- they are acting together as partners in 
               <br />
               western <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hemispheric</span> defence. But from that can 
               <br />
               it be inferred, can it be presumed that Canada 
               <br />
               would request the United States to withdraw from 
               <br />
               these 99—year bases? Can it be argued that they 
               <br />
               would order the United States people to leave 
               <br />
               Newfoundland so that Canada could place her 
               <br />
               own troops on that base? And above all can it be 
               <br />
               presumed that Newfoundlanders working on the 
               <br />
               bases would lose their jobs? I have a little some- 
               <br />
               thing here to back up that. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins or any 
               <br />
               of the members of the delegation are in the House 
               <br />
               they will either affirm or deny <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> I raised that very 
               <br />
               question in Canada and we were assured by the 
               <br />
               , Government of Canada that no such thing would 
               <br />
               happen. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Is it in the Books? 
               <br />
               Mr.Smallwood It will be better than in the 
               <br />
               Books within a matter of weeks. Every New- 
               <br />
               foundlander will be assured deﬁnitely and finally 
               <br />
               that under confederation they will go on being 
               <br />
               employed on the bases as if confederation had 
               <br />
               never come at all. That will come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out...</span> I have 
               <br />
               down here a note I made while Mr. Hollett was 
               <br />
               speaking. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I am not bound to take notice of 
               <br />
               your notes; please refer to remarks made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett in the course of his address.

               Mr. Smallwood All right, Mr. Hollett in the 
               <br />
               course of his remarks said that under confedera- 
               <br />
               tion the town councils would have the right to 
               <br />
               attach your house, your land, your boats, your 
               <br />
               fishing gear, even your fur coat. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman He said, “possibly your fur 
               <br />
               coat". 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Very well, but the other state-
