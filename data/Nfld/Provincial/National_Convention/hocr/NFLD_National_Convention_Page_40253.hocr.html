               Mr. Penney The subject of roads touches the 
               <br />
               hearts and minds of every settlement in the 
               <br />
               country. I do not know just how the late policy of 
               <br />
               the government affects the different settlements 
               <br />
               in the outports, but I do know how it affects the 
               <br />
               people of Carbonear and vicinity. Fourteen years 
               <br />
               ago the local roads in the town of Carbonear and 
               <br />
               outside were in good condition owing to the 
               <br />
               painstaking efforts, of our local road boards, with 
               <br />
               grants so small and limited that they really had to 
               <br />
               scratch for it. Today all these local roads are 
               <br />
               washed out and destroyed at a time when money 
               <br />
               is flush in government departments; so much so 
               <br />
               that if the people only could know the actual cost 
               <br />
               of the two to three mile section of the Tilton 
               <br />
               highway for the past four years, the surprise 
               <br />
               would be really greater proportionately than the 
               <br />
               revelation of the cost of the nine mile Topsail 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">highway,</span> In the town of Carbonear, the roads are 
               <br />
               not only destroyed, but the public sewer serving 
               <br />
               the court house building is in such a condition 
               <br />
               that it is now a menace to public health as well as 
               <br />
               being a dangerous trap for pedestrians. A town 
               <br />
               council is the answer, they say! For some of us 
               <br />
               who have been repairing local roads at our own 
               <br />
               cost for a decade, a town council could have been 
               <br />
               negotiated if our citizens had been helped in their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">endeavours.“</span> Anyway, we are hoping for better 
               <br />
               results in the near <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future.</span> Outside our town I

               I listened yesterday with much interest, but the 
               <br />
               debate was not of a very high order; to me it 
               <br />
               ﬂavoured too much of politics, and too little of 
               <br />
               its economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">signiﬁcance,</span> It reminded me of the 
               <br />
               old political days, when the man who could talk 
               <br />
               the most about roads and make the most 
               <br />
               promises, had the edge on the other fellow. I feel 
               <br />
               it is our business to raise the discussion of this 
               <br />
               report from the mire of politics to the realm of our 
               <br />
               country’s economy, and discuss it purely in that 
               <br />
               light. It is time for us to realise that unfortunately 
               <br />
               there is nothing we can do regarding the policy 
               <br />
               of the present government, but the facts con- 
               <br />
               tained in this report should be stressed insofar as 
               <br />
               they effect our economy, and will likely in- 
               <br />
               fluence our ﬁnal recommendations. I would state 
               <br />
               here, however, that I consider the allocation of 
               <br />
               public monies for roads altogether dispropor- 
               <br />

               At the opening of the Convention I sought 
               <br />
               information relative to the government’s policy 
               <br />
               in respect to local roads. I am pleased to find that 
               <br />
               in the appendix to this report, their policy for 
               <br />
               local roads as introduced in 1943 is fully outlined, 
               <br />
               and I hope that the public will avail of the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of becoming conversant with it, because I 
               <br />
               fear it is a scheme to which the labouring man 
               <br />
               very often finds it difficult to reconcile himself, 
               <br />

               <br />

               I contend that the Commission of Government

               have neglected the local roads and allocated far 
               <br />

               <br />
