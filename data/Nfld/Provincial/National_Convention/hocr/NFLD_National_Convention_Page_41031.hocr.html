               Mr. Smallwood I have just told you, assuming

               that $20 million that the federal government

               glad I had the second chance to say it. Now then,

               compare that with the per head taxation that we 
               <br />
               had on us in 1943-44. Our government taxed us 
               <br />
               in the year 1943-44, $28.5 million. Our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popu1a~</span>

               capita taxation was $90, in 1943—44. Now take 
               <br />
               this present year. They tell us that the taxation put

               <br />
               that is $122 per head. $122 per head is our taxa- 
               <br />
               tion here in Newfoundland this very year, $122 a 
               <br />
               head on the average, remember. We know there 
               <br />
               are thousands of people in Newfoundland that are 
               <br />
               not paying $122, and there are other thousands 
               <br />
               that are paying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$23,000</span> a head, but on the 
               <br />
               average it is $122 a head today, whereas if my 
               <br />
               estimates are anywhere near the truth, and if the 
               <br />
               Canadian government’s estimates of what they 
               <br />

               somebody is going to say to me, and very fairly,

               “Aha, your provincial estimate may be some-

               <br />
               Canadiangovemment'sestimate of$20 million." 
               <br />
               Major Cashin thinks it is 20% out. In other words, 
               <br />
               if he were making it he would add another $4 
               <br />
               million to it, and make it $24 million that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government would take from us. All 
               <br />
               right, 1 will go a step further and put $5 million 
               <br />
               on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Then what do you get? 1 will stick $1

               million on provincial taxation and another $5

               <br />
               taxation then is $93 compared with $122 per 
               <br />
               head that we are paying this very year, and I agree 
               <br />
               that we are paying far too much. $40 million is 
               <br />
               far too much to take out of these 327,000 living 
               <br />
               souls. Too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much,</span>

               Well, sir, that’s the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">story.</span> I could go on and on

               and on like Tennyson’s brook if there was any 
               <br />
               end of it. Tomorrow 1 will have these figures of 
               <br />
               revenue mimeographed, and they will be on 
               <br />

               <br />
               as 1 went along to explain these revenues. 1 hold, 
               <br />
               in conclusion, that if we become a province of 
               <br />
               Canada with our own provincial government. 
               <br />
               with the Government ot'Canada taxing us and the 
               <br />
               Government of Newfoundland taxing us, two 
               <br />
               governments taxing us where we only have one 
               <br />
               government taxing us now, 1 hold that the provin- 
               <br />
               cial government will pay its way for the ﬁrst eight 
               <br />
               years of union, and that’s all 1 am required to 
               <br />
               show. I don’t have to go a day beyond the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               eight years, because, inside of eight years there‘s 
               <br />
               to be a royal commission to assess. or reassess 
               <br />
               our financial position to see if we need more 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subsidies.</span> I hold that l have shown that for the 
               <br />
               first eight years of confederation the provincial 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland can pay its way. 
               <br />
               and can do so without putting burdensome taxa- 
               <br />
               tion on our people. I will take that back, all 
               <br />
               taxation is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">burdensome,</span> Further, sir, they can pay 
               <br />
               their way without reducing our public services, 
               <br />
               but on the other hand, instead of reducing them, 
               <br />
               increasing them, giving our people more and 
               <br />
               better public services than we have now: that the 
               <br />
               provincial government can do that and pay its 
               <br />
               way for the ﬁrst eight years of union, and sir, that 
               <br />
               being the Case, 1 think 1 have shown what I was 
               <br />
               expected to show. and there is not much point in 
               <br />
