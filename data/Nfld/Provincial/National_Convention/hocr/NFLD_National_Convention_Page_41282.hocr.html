               Most people don’t give a second thought to social 
               <br />
               legislation which, a generation ago, would have 
               <br />
               been damned as rank socialism. Indeed, right, left 
               <br />
               and centre may hardly be said to be positions in 
               <br />
               politics and economics, forever ﬁxed by im-

               <br />
               mined from time to time, and we’re witness that 
               <br />
               what is held to be extreme by one generation is 
               <br />
               often held to be conservative by another. There- 
               <br />
               fore, it may be said that the centre itself has lately 
               <br />
               come to be a little left of centre.

               In our owu land one doesn’t have to go very 
               <br />
               far out of one’s way to observe what has come of 
               <br />
               the movement of men’s minds to the left. There 
               <br />
               was ﬁrst of all the organised attempt to secure a 
               <br />
               wider distribution of the cake to the various 
               <br />
               unions of ﬁshermen, loggers, labourers, clerks 
               <br />
               and so forth...1 Now I grant you that the cake we 
               <br />
               have to cut in this island is no Christmas cake; 
               <br />
               rather it is mostly a ﬁshcake'. But I am ready to 
               <br />
               agree with Mr. Newell, that cut into such slices 
               <br />
               as social justice would dictate, it could provide a 
               <br />
               frugal living for our people, and in that the labour 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> movements apparently concur. 
               <br />
               Otherwise they would merely be engaged in the 
               <br />
               rather futile endeavour of butting their heads 
               <br />
               against the stone wall. And there has come of the 
               <br />
               desire of men in this island to achieve a wider 
               <br />
               handing out of the cake some social legislation, 
               <br />
               but not nearly enough of it, and some admission 
               <br />
               by management of the common man into a 
               <br />
               greater return from the increment of production. 
               <br />
               In evidence of the same, witness old age pen~ 
               <br />
               sions, workmen’s compensation, minimum wage 
               <br />
               legislation, improved public health services and 
               <br />
               so on, and many union working agreements, 
               <br />
               higher wages and improved working conditions. 
               <br />

               But as Mr. Newell has already pointed out, 
               <br />
               social legislation is not enough. Social legislation 
               <br />
               is merely stop-gap legislation. Family allowan— 
               <br />
               ces are merely something that a man must have, 
               <br />
               because the character of the economy is not such 
               <br />
               as enables him to provide adequately for his 
               <br />
               family out of his own efforts. Old age pensions 
               <br />
               are something that the aged must have, because 
               <br />
               the character of the economy in which they lived 
               <br />
               was not such as to permit them in their youth to 
               <br />
               provide adequately for their old age. Unemploy-

               The common man of this island now has ideas

               about a larger slice of the cake. He will likely

               become insistent, beyond the point of merely 
               <br />
               pounding the table, as time goes on. I know of but

               two methods of approach to the resolution of that

               <br />
               unrest, which we want to avoid at all costs. Ihave

               distance. It will go as far as taxation related to 
               <br />
               capacity to pay will go, which is a considerable
