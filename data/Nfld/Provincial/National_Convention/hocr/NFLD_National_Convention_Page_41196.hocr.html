               The point that I’ve been trying to make is this: 
               <br />
               that it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">positively</span> stupid, wicked, to ask a group

               cause we have not had the experience, deal with 
               <br />
               matters of this kind, and to ask the people of this 
               <br />
               country, who spend their time catching their ﬁsh, 
               <br />
               tilling their farms, going to church to decide a 
               <br />
               matter of this kind. The only way in which it can 
               <br />
               be done is to get a properly organised group, who 
               <br />
               understand all the implications of these matters, 
               <br />
               to lay it out so as the people can understand.

               A number of things have been said here I 
               <br />
               would like to refer to, but I want to pick one or 
               <br />
               two only. Mr. Vincent said he was ashamed of 
               <br />
               the price of a loaf of bread in this country. I would 
               <br />
               point out that if you were to go to Puerto Rico, 
               <br />
               that the Puerto Rican would probably be equally 
               <br />
               ashamed at the price that he has got to charge the 
               <br />
               poor Puerto Ricans for Newfoundland salt cod- 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. Instead of being ashamed of a thing like that, 
               <br />
               it is up to you to ﬁnd out why these things cost as 
               <br />
               much, and see if it can be settled so that it will 
               <br />
               not. I think it is up to you to point out that the 
               <br />
               wheat, that price of the flour that sells in New— 
               <br />
               foundland did not originate in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               but in Canada. And that’s the reason why the 
               <br />
               price of a loaf of bread has got to be 18 cents. 
               <br />
               There are dozens of other things which have been 
               <br />
               told to this country which are wrong in essence 
               <br />
               and in spirit. I cannot and will not take the time 
               <br />
               now, but they will, I am sure, be said to the people 
               <br />
               of this country. We’re going to have, I think, an 
               <br />
               extra 1,000 employees in the government if we 
               <br />
               become a province. In 1937, Prime Minister 
               <br />
               Mackenzie King pointed out that one of the big 
               <br />
               problems of Canada was the fact that they had 
               <br />
               such a small population in such a big area. And I 
               <br />
               would only point out this one thing. If New- 
               <br />
               foundland is going to have an extra 1,000 
               <br />
               employees because we’re going to have an extra 
               <br />
               government imposed upon us, then presumably 
               <br />
               it’s equally true all the way across Canada; which 
               <br />
               means that in time the civil service is bound to 
               <br />
               cost the people of Canada, including the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, much, much more than is 
               <br />
               necessary.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Before I sit down I go back to one thing that I 
               <br />
               spoke about yesterday. I laid some emphasis on 
               <br />
               the question of morale. I expect it to be sneered 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 776 185 1316 1875">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               at in certain quarters. I expect it to be said that 
               <br />
               you can‘t eat morale. I am well aware of the fact 
               <br />
               that you cannot eat morale, that it is all very well 
               <br />
               to have morale in a family, but that a child has 
               <br />
               got to have boots and shoes and clothing. But I 
               <br />
               would say this, and I want to repeat it. That if the 
               <br />
               scrounging for material things is important, so is 
               <br />
               morale. When England was practically on her 
               <br />
               knees in 1940, she didn’t ask where the materials 
               <br />
               were coming from, in fact she didn’t have them. 
               <br />
               But she did have guts. As a result, you got the 
               <br />
               salvation of England. What happened? Once they 
               <br />
               produced the morale, the material was forthcom- 
               <br />
               ing. I leave you with this thought. The people of 
               <br />
               England today are facing up to their problem, and 
               <br />
               as a result of it, in the end they will come out on 
               <br />
               top, in spite of the fact that at the moment they do 
               <br />
               not know where the material things are coming 
               <br />
               from. What I am ﬁghting against in this country 
               <br />
               is inertia, against something taking hold of the 
               <br />
               whole world — gross materialism. That’s why I 
               <br />
               spent the time that I did yesterday on the question 
               <br />
               of morale. That’s why I say to you, that if you 
               <br />
               give away the advantage that might come from 
               <br />
               your strategic position; if you give away your 
               <br />
               control of your communications; if you give 
               <br />
               away control of your ﬁsheries; if you give away 
               <br />
               the right to settle your own taxation and methods 
               <br />
               of taxation; if you give away the right to discuss 
               <br />
               as an entity in the family of nations your 
               <br />
               geographical position in an age which is just 
               <br />
               coming; if you give yourself into the hands of 
               <br />
               Canada so that you will be bound by laws and 
               <br />
               regulations to purchase your goods solely there 
               <br />
               instead of in the open market; if you give away 
               <br />
               these things to ﬁnd the easiest way out, then 
               <br />
               you’ve lost your morale and you’ve lost the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad</span> 
               <br />
               vantages which give you the material things 
               <br />
               which bring about the social welfare and progress 
               <br />
               of this or any other country. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Northcott I have not used up much of the 
               <br />
               Convention’s time over the proposed terms of 
               <br />
               confederation now before the Chair. I ﬁgure that 
               <br />
               it is a job for an elected government, and that is 
               <br />
               why I voted against sending a delegation to 
               <br />
               Canada. Now sir, none of the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               said very much about the Canadian divorce law. 
               <br />
               This is a very important matter. The Good Book 
               <br />
               still says, “What God has joined together, let no 
               <br />
               man put asunder.” This, gentlemen, this is very 
               <br />
               important. Surely we’re not going to allow this to
