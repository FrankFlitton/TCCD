               will have our system of taxation. It is not because 
               <br />
               one province does it one way that all provinces 
               <br />
               must do it the same way, and I am prepared to 
               <br />
               argue it. There is a tremendous variation in some 
               <br />
               respects from one province to another. We would 
               <br />
               be still another variation. We have our ways of 
               <br />
               doing things. There is one limit laid on us, one 
               <br />
               condition laid down, and it is a good condition. 
               <br />
               No province is allowed to put any taxes on its 
               <br />
               people except direct taxes... Indirect taxes are 
               <br />
               not allowed. Now with that one condition it is 
               <br />
               entirely our own business as a province how we 
               <br />
               levy our taxes, what kind of taxes they will be, 
               <br />
               and how much we will collect in each kind of 
               <br />

               Mr. Bailey could stand here for three hours 
               <br />
               listing the different kinds of taxes they have in 
               <br />
               the different provinces, and that would havejust 
               <br />
               as much to do with Newfoundland as if he had 
               <br />
               spent the time talking about the different kinds of 
               <br />
               taxes they have in Timbuctoo, Somaliland, 
               <br />
               Tanganyika, Nyasaland or out in the Gobi desert 
               <br />
               of China. Let them have what kinds of taxes they 
               <br />
               want, we will have the kinds of taxes we want, so 
               <br />
               long as they are direct taxes. That’s our business,

               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, I want members to 
               <br />
               turn to page 4 of the Grey Book, “Reassessment 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland’s Financial Position”. Now I 
               <br />
               take it that this paragraph is a deliberation of the 
               <br />
               delegation to Ottawa, and as such each and every 
               <br />
               man who went on that delegation is responsible 
               <br />
               for what is there. I want to read this clause 14:

               Mr. Chairman Before you go on Captain 
               <br />
               Bailey, I don‘t ﬁnd myself in agreement with 
               <br />
               your observation that the Ottawa delegation, as 
               <br />
               such, are directly responsible for everything in 
               <br />
               this, and that the members of the Convention are 
               <br />
               indirectly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible...</span> It must be remembered 
               <br />
               in fairness to the members of the delegation, and 
               <br />
               to the members ofthe Convention, that this docu~ 
               <br />
               ment was prepared and forwarded to the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion some considerable time after the delegation 
               <br />
               had left <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ottawa,</span> Had this been presented to the 
               <br />
               delegation before they left Ottawa and they had 
               <br />
               then approved it in principle, then I feel that your 
               <br />
               criticism that they would be responsible to this 
               <br />
               Convention for everything that went into this 
               <br />
               document would be a perfectly fair statement to 
               <br />
               make. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey If they had accepted it, sir? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If this had been placed in the 
               <br />
               hands of the delegation before they left Ottawa 
               <br />
               and they had accepted it, either expressly or 
               <br />
               without disagreement, in any way, shape or form, 
               <br />
               then 1 would say, “Yes, they are directly respon- 
               <br />
               sible for everything contained <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therein,"</span> But that 
               <br />
               is not the position. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey But if we accept it, I should have 
               <br />
               added that. As far as it stands now it is a pig in a 
               <br />
               poke. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman All right, on that supposition, 
               <br />
               all right.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I feel I must emphasise that as far as the

               arrangements go as far as the government can
