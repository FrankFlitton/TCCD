               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, we have come to the 
               <br />
               famous “diaper bonus" and I was surprised at the 
               <br />
               complacent attitude of Mr. Smallwood that Mr. 
               <br />
               Job would pay. As a layman, I was wondering 
               <br />
               how Mr. Job would pay, since when I am ﬁnished 
               <br />
               with this job I intend to go ﬁshing, and to land 
               <br />
               and sell at Bonavista Cold Storage, of which, I 
               <br />
               am informed, Mr. Job and associates are the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">owners.</span> Now, I am perplexed. Will Mr. Job for- 
               <br />
               get he has a “diaper bonus” to pay and give me 
               <br />
               the full value for the ﬁsh I’ll land, or go in a dory 
               <br />
               and ﬁsh for the bonus himself, or will he, with 
               <br />
               that bonus in mind, take it out of me? I’m afraid 
               <br />
               he will. I have dragged up my family, and it looks 
               <br />
               like I’ve got to help bring up others. You have 
               <br />
               always got to pay it, even a young man today, 
               <br />
               when he gets up to the age of 40, with kids up to 
               <br />
               16; you go on paying the “diaper bonus” until you 
               <br />
               are 70, when you get the “whisker bonus”. 
               <br />
               Another vicious circle.

               I have been doing a little delving this past

               could subscribe to it, but I must have used up all 
               <br />
               my optimism on the Economic Report. Why the 
               <br />
               pessimism? It’s simply this: ever since I came 
               <br />
               into this Convention l have heard nothing but the 
               <br />
               hardships of our system of taxation, and I had 
               <br />
               really hoped that in the leap towards Zion that 
               <br />
               tough road would be smoothed over; but I am 
               <br />
               disappointed! First <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁxings</span> ﬁrst. I don’t want to go 
               <br />
               meandering around from Quirpon to Grand Falls, 
               <br />
               so here it is. We heard a royal address about 
               <br />
               taking from the rich and giving to the poor. I’ll 
               <br />
               say more about that later, for that's up my alley, 
               <br />
               but this before us unfortunately is not so, for I’m 
               <br />
               going to lump the two big social sums together, 
               <br />
               the “diaper bonus" and the “whisker bonus”. 
               <br />
               They cost, together, $342 million. 
               <br />
               Now in that grand Dominion they have a sales 
               <br />
               tax and I’ll quote:2 
               <br />
               The sales tax hitherto has always been con— 
               <br />
               sidered as one of the most vicious forms of 
               <br />
               regional taxation. It hits every man, woman, 
               <br />
               child and babe in arms, totally regardless of 
               <br />
               income; but the federal government plans to 
               <br />
               collect $325 million in sales tax this year, 
               <br />
               against $298 million collected last year, for 
               <br />
               the major taxpayers in Canada are the poor 
               <br />
               people of Canada, not only in the income tax 
               <br />
               as the ﬁgures readily prove, but in the fact 
               <br />
