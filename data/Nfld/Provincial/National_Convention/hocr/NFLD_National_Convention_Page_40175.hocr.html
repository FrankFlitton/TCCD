               Mr. Ashbourne .. ..The money spent on schools 
               <br />
               and teacher training has been discussed. They are 
               <br />
               both very important and necessary, complemen-

               <br />

               ther attention. Brainy people can command good

               wages, and if teaching does not offer the neces—

               services are more adequately compensated. If we

               expect to have as leaders to train our youth, to

               <br />
               induce them to remain in the teaching profession. 
               <br />
               In some outport schools we lack teachers who can

               satisfactorily teach certain languages and 
               <br />
               science. Teachers who cannot give instruction in 
               <br />
               these subjects will be at a disadvantage and the

               pupils also....

               various heads of the Department of Education

               is to be regretted that the building program has

               been temporarily halted owing to lack of nails

               calls for comment is school medical examination, 
               <br />
