               To some it may seem a truly strange form of 
               <br />
               political thought to drag food into politics, to 
               <br />
               speak of stomachs in the same breath as ballot

               vote. But those who have followed through his-

               <br />

               <br />
               who know history know, for instance, that all the 
               <br />
               great revolutions began in the pits of men’s 
               <br />
