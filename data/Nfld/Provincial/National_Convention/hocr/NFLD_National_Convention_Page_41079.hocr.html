               million a year for years to come, a lot of which 
               <br />
               goes in for labour. Let us forget all that, and go 
               <br />
               on to Public Health and Welfare, and this too is 
               <br />
               our obligation as a province. One would have 
               <br />
               thought that since the Ottawa delegation had cut 
               <br />
               out $3.5 million road and building construction, 
               <br />
               they would have budgeted for an increase in the 
               <br />
               estimate for Health and Welfare. That, to me, 
               <br />
               would have been the obvious thing to do. But no, 
               <br />
               this is what they do: they cut out $235,000 on 
               <br />
               account of reconstruction, and $828,000 on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac»</span> 
               <br />
               count of assistance to the poor and allowance to 
               <br />
               widows and orphans, maintenance of hospitals 
               <br />
               and general public health services and reduce the 
               <br />
               estimate from $5,830,239 to $4,767,239 as the 
               <br />
               amount required. For the moment let us turn to 
               <br />
               page 60, book 2. They cut out assistance to in- 
               <br />
               digents, $250,000; general public health service, 
               <br />
               $50,000. If I remember correctly it was intimated 
               <br />
               to us that $278,000 maintenance to hospitals was 
               <br />
               cut out by the delegation to Ottawa because under 
               <br />
               confederation supplies coming in for hospitals 
               <br />
               would cost less, and we would be able to reduce 
               <br />
               the amount by cutting off $278,000. They have 
               <br />
               intimated that. I see nothing in the estimates for 
               <br />
               the maintenance of servicing of the Corner Brook 
               <br />
               hospital. You cannot see where they cut out 
               <br />
               $50,000 except for nutrition for schools and child 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing of our hospitals simply for the honour of 
               <br />
               being a province of Canada? I have the greatest 
               <br />
               respect for the Dominion of Canada for what she 
               <br />
               did in the last war. You may respect a person or 
               <br />
               a country, but that does not justify your cutting 
               <br />
               out services to your own people and reducing 
               <br />
               them to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paup-erism.</span> This is something we cannot 
               <br />
               pass over lightly, and so we must add to this 
               <br />
               estimate of theirs $1,068,000, even if we allow 
               <br />
               for no further improvements and allow no in- 
               <br />
               crease whatever by way of relief. That brings to 
               <br />
               my mind that they also cut out $10,000 for relief 
               <br />
               on Labrador. The minimum on account of 
               <br />
               expenditures with Newfoundland as a province 
               <br />
               would be:*
