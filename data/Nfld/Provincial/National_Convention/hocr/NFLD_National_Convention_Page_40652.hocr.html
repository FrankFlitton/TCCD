               The point I wish to make is that overnight two 
               <br />
               acts completely external to this country brought 
               <br />
               into prejudice the very livelihoods of many of our 
               <br />
               people, and we couldn’t raise a ﬁnger to help 
               <br />
               ourselves. There is nothing much that we can do 
               <br />
               to lessen the vulnerability of our economy. The 
               <br />
               devices that nations of greater economic power 
               <br />
               may resort to, such as deﬁcit ﬁnancing and cur- 
               <br />
               rency manipulation, are beyond our means. And 
               <br />
               already there has been done as much as could be 
               <br />
               done. Until quite recently we used to put a great 
               <br />
               deal of effort into cutting our own throats on the 
               <br />
               world’s ﬁsh market. The disastrous competition 
               <br />
               among local ﬁsh dealers in the days of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consign“</span> 
               <br />
               ment shipping generated a considerable internal 
               <br />
               vulnerability in our economy. Fortunately an end 
               <br />
               has come of all that, and now in the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Associated Fish Exporters Ltd. we 
               <br />
               have an instrument to prevent us from cutting the 
               <br />
               ground from under our own feet in the foreign 
               <br />
               markets. Our economy has retained its essential 
               <br />
               characteristic of an export economy, but a new 
               <br />

               <br />

               rendered by Newfoundlanders at the military 
               <br />

               It is not possible at this moment to rate Gander 
               <br />
               in the same category. The last report we had of 
               <br />
               Gander in this Convention gave reason to believe 
               <br />
               that it would be a charge upon the treasury for 
               <br />
               some time to come. Under these circumstances 
               <br />
               the increment to our economy from the earnings 
               <br />
               of individuals at the airport must be viewed as 
               <br />
               something for which this country pays through 
               <br />
               the nose, so that those employed there may have 
               <br />
               the privilege of earning what they do in that 
               <br />
               particular way — whereas they might be 
               <br />
               employed in other productive work that would 
               <br />
               yield a similar income. Since the incidental in- 
               <br />
               come at Gander, by which I mean that which 
               <br />
               derives from purchases made by transients and 
               <br />
               other than ofﬁcial services rendered to them for 
               <br />
               which they tip and pay extra, is an unknown 
               <br />
               quantity, the absolute value of Gander to the total 
               <br />
               economy of the country must remain in question 
               <br />
               until such time as the airport is paying its own 
               <br />
               way. Maybe that time is now. I confess to no 
               <br />
               knowledge of the latest ﬁgures, but i understand 
               <br />
               that the number of daily ﬂights through Gander 
               <br />
               has increased considerably these last few months. 
               <br />
               In any case,just to what extent the pay in Gander 
               <br />
               could be depended upon as a stabilising agent in 
               <br />
               our economy must ever remain in doubt. For 
               <br />
               there could never be any certainty that planes 
               <br />
               would not take to overﬂying the airport, in which 
               <br />
               case Gander would become a ghost town and we 
               <br />
               should ﬁnd on our hands the greatest white 
               <br />
               elephant in the world since the Maginot Line.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               To sum up then, it may be said that our 
               <br />
               economy would stand a ﬁghting chance of sup- 
               <br />
               porting us in the manner to which we have lately 
               <br />
               become accustomed, given the right kind of 
               <br />
               world conditions. But there‘s the hitch. Given the

               George will probably starve again, only the next 
               <br />
               time I hope he won’t be so persistent about it. The

               best formula ever put forward to stabilise the

               such a world, wherein the great currents of trade 
               <br />
               and commerce would ﬂow freely, could New-

               economic security. And what are the chances for
