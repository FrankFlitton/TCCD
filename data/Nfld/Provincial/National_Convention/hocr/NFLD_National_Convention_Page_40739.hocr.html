               newsprint. There is a world shortage of newsprint 
               <br />
               that is going to last two or three years. Beyond 
               <br />
               that no one can prophesy. There is a shortage of 
               <br />
               everything, and a tremendous demand for it, and 
               <br />
               the price has gone up, all due to the war, not due 
               <br />
               to the normal growth of our industries. Let’s face 
               <br />
               the truth for once. This boom, which is still on in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, begins to have some holes ap- 
               <br />
               pearing in it just now, but it is still on... It will 
               <br />
               last another two or three years. No one knows. 
               <br />
               This boom is directly and entirely and exclusive- 
               <br />
               1y the result of the war, and who is foolish enough 
               <br />
               not to believe it? Of course Bell Island is as 
               <br />
               prosperous as she is today because of the war. 
               <br />
               Our ﬁsheries are commanding the price they do 
               <br />
               because of the war.... Our paper is commanding 
               <br />
               the price it does because of the war. Are we blind, 
               <br />
               or are we trying to kid ourselves? Any ﬁsherman 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, in Bonavista Bay knows it. 
               <br />
               Any common, ordinary man in the island knows 
               <br />
               it is all because of the war. The same thing applies 
               <br />
               to the United States and to Canada. Europe can’t 
               <br />
               buy because she has not the money to buy. 
               <br />
               Canada is paying it into Europe, and USA is 
               <br />
               paying it into Europe, and Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               paying it into Europe (or would be if they had the 
               <br />
               dollars to pay for it). Europe has been levelled off 
               <br />
               by the bombs, and the demand is there and is 
               <br />
               insatiable, and will continue for the next two or 
               <br />
               three years. That’s why, and who is going to tell 
               <br />
               me that is not the result of the war? What kind of 
               <br />
               trash and nonsense is that?

               Mr. Higgins I wonder if Mr. Smallwood will 
               <br />
               agree that the present high revenue of New- 
               <br />
               foundland will continue then for at least three 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood My answer to that is that it may 
               <br />
               continue for six years, it may continue for one 
               <br />
               year. Mr. Higgins did not know, Major Cashin 
               <br />
               does not know, I don’t know, when all the 
               <br />
               economists of the world are wondering just this. 
               <br />
               Let me tell you something. During the war install- 
               <br />
               ment buying came practically to an end... Why? 
               <br />
               So much cash. Already in the United States, 
               <br />
               already in Canada installment buying is back 
               <br />
               again... What does that mean? It means that great 
               <br />
               backlog of money saved up during the war is 
               <br />
               beginning to peter out, and what the economists 
               <br />
               are wondering is, are we due for another 1929 in 
               <br />
               the States? Every statesman in Great Britain is 
               <br />
               worried about it. Prices are gone mad in the

               we expect to make these swollen wartime 
               <br />

               ment nearly $40 million? We are wondering if we 
               <br />
               are awake or asleep. $40 million! I remember 
               <br />
               when the whole revenue of the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was only $7 million for the whole 
               <br />
               year, and $5 million of that was to pay the interest 
               <br />
               of the debt. That left $2 million for everything. 
               <br />
               How long ago was that? 1932. So this year it is 
               <br />
               $40 million, and maybe next year it will be $100 
               <br />
               million. Some miracle may happen. But on the 
               <br />
               other hand next year it may be only $30 million, 
               <br />
               and the next year $20 million. 
               <br />

               <br />
               again —- it is $10 or $11 now, but it may be 
               <br />
               anywhere between $3 and $l 1. If that happens
