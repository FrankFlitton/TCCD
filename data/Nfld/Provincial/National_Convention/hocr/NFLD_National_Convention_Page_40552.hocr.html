               warning from this assembly that will reverberate

               Mr. Smallwood When it was brought out by the 
               <br />
               Mining Committee that a very important change 
               <br />
               had been made in the taxation that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would get out of this mining company, a change 
               <br />
               from the 1938 act of 10 cents a ton on every ton 
               <br />
               of ore that company has exported from Labrador, 
               <br />
               to the 1944 act, which cut out the 10 cents a ton 
               <br />
               and puts in its place 5% of the proﬁts, I must 
               <br />
               admit that I shared the feeling Mr. Penney has 
               <br />
               just expressed. I too was disgusted with it, and I 
               <br />
               so expressed myself on Friday last. Since then I 
               <br />
               have been reading the 1938 act and the 1944 act 
               <br />
               and also the Quebec act, and whatever other

               We know, the Mining Committee tells us, that

               passed this act. We are told there are two mines,

               <br />

               They say Mr. Timmins is a very wealthy man,

               <br />
               very wealthy men also, but nobody supposes for 
               <br />
               one single minute that Mr. Timmins and his 
               <br />
               friends are going to ﬁnd out of their own pockets 
               <br />
               one quarter of a billion dollars to develop this 
               <br />
               great iron mine, which means that they have got 
               <br />
               to sell shares on the money markets. No doubt 
               <br />
               here in Newfoundland there will be hundreds of 
               <br />
               people buying shares in that great corporation. In 
               <br />
               Canada and the United States there will be 
               <br />
               thousands. It will be a great corporation with 
               <br />
               possibly tens of thousands of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shareholders.</span> 
               <br />
               Would any of us, assuming that we had money, 
               <br />
               buy those shares if we were not completely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satis»</span> 
               <br />
               tied that they were a good buy, that we were 
               <br />
               going to make a proﬁt, and that we were going to 
               <br />
               get dividends? So that to sell shares they have got 
               <br />
               to prove that the ore is there, second that it is in 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient quantities, third in sufﬁcient quality, 
               <br />
               and fourth that after putting in quarter ofa billion 
               <br />
               dollars, that they will be able to run that mine at 
               <br />
               a sufficient profit — not the 1% to which 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman referred on Friday; but around 
               <br />
               $10 million a year since they have to sell the 
               <br />
               shares, and that they cannot do unless they can 
               <br />
               show the public that there is a good chance of 
               <br />
               making a proﬁt. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now the next question is whether there is a 
               <br />
               way in which they can hide that profit in such a 
               <br />
               way that when the Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               gets 5% of the net proﬁt, that that 5% won’t give 
               <br />
               them any money. Can they hide it in such a way 
               <br />
               that when the tax assessor starts to collect income 
               <br />
               tax, their proﬁts will be so hidden that he cannot 
               <br />
               collect income tax from them? Well, maybe so. 
               <br />
               It would not be the first time it was done, but on 
               <br />
               that point we have this reassuring fact, that part 
               <br />
               of the company will be operating in Quebec, and 
               <br />
               the Government of Quebec is well used to 
               <br />
               dealing with great corporations. Not only that, 
               <br />
               but you have the probability of the federal 
               <br />
               government of Canada itself needing to know 
               <br />
               what proﬁts that corporation makes. All right. 
               <br />
               Cannot the Government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               whether it be the present Commission, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responv</span> 
               <br />
               sible government, or confederation, could not
