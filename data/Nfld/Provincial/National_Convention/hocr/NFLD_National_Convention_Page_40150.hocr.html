               postpone all consideration of the question

               whether we shall or shall not send a delegation to

               federation or ﬁnancial assistance from the United

               <br />
               appointed and working here in St John’s now. I 
               <br />
               want them to be ready to go at the opportune time, 
               <br />

               position of this country as disclosed by the

               various committees we have appointed, then we 
               <br />
               will not be ready when that ﬁnancial information 
               <br />
               is at hand. We will then have to start in and get 
               <br />
               this other information from Canada and from the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I quite understand Mr. Penncy’s motion, and 
               <br />
               have a great deal of sympathy with him, but it is 
               <br />
               so utterly indefinite it leaves the whole thing in 
               <br />
               the air. It means we shall simply spend two or 
               <br />
               three days here debating this subject for exactly 
               <br />
               nothing. It means that at some future unknown 
               <br />
               date we may again introduce a resolution, and 
               <br />
               discuss the question as to whether we shall send 
               <br />
               a delegation to Canada or not, and I think that the 
               <br />
               best way out of this is to pin down the situation 
               <br />
               in a manner which I think can be objectionable to 
               <br />
               nobody. The objection is to prematurity. It is, I 
               <br />
               presume, contended, that this information which 
               <br />
               it is proposed to obtain from the Canadian 
               <br />
               government will not be of any avail to us or the 
               <br />
               people until we have ascertained our own finan- 
               <br />
               cial position. There may be something in that 
               <br />
               argument. It sounds as if it had some reason in it. 
               <br />
               But the point that I want to make clear is that by 
               <br />
               throwing this resolution in the air, as will happen 
               <br />
               if Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Penney”s</span> amendment passes in its present 
               <br />
               form, we shall still be nowhere When we have 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial position we shall not be ready to 
               <br />
               discuss it either in comparison with confedera- 
               <br />
               tion or anything else, and it was for that reason I 
               <br />
               intimated an hour ago that unless somebody else 
               <br />
               did it, and quickly, that I myself proposed to 
               <br />
               introduce a resolution for the purpose of making 
               <br />
               inquiries from the United Kingdom, because I 
               <br />
               want the machinery put into action now. My only 
               <br />
               object is to see that when we have all available 
               <br />
               information collected, a delegation leaves here 
               <br />

               perhaps during the latter part oflanuary. And that 
               <br />
               when we have that information, we also have the 
               <br />
               necessary information about the confederation 
               <br />

               <br />
               able to give in certain eventualities. For that 
               <br />
               reason I propose to make a few observations on 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               First I would like to refer to Mr. Hollett’s 
               <br />
               quotation where he pointed out that section 146 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act was defined in 
               <br />
               a way which makes provision for Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to become a province. You will notice I said “a 
               <br />
               way” not “the way”. There are several ways 
               <br />
               usually of doing the same thing. It is perfectly 
               <br />
               true that in 1867 when the British North America 
               <br />
               Act was passed, section 146 was inserted setting 
               <br />
               up the machinery by which Newfoundland might 
               <br />
               be included as a province. But the conditions of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland then and now are different and, 
               <br />
               consequently, section 146 is inapplicable. Today 
               <br />
               there is no House of Assembly and no Legislative 
               <br />
               Council to pass any resolutions. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman I must diSpute your statement 
               <br />
               that there is no legislature in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               There <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> There is no responsible government in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, but there is a legislature. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Bradley Yes, but not a legislature which 
               <br />
               would ever undertake to do any such thing as to 
               <br />
               legislate this country into confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada. Thus the position today is that whatever 
               <br />
               method may be adopted to bring about confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, if the people so desire it, it will not be 
               <br />
               brought about by the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               which is inapplicable and could not be utilised for 
               <br />
               the purpose. I doubt if this country can go into 
               <br />
               confederation unless we get responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment back. But suppose we never get responsible 
               <br />
               government back; are the people of this country 
               <br />
               to be precluded from voting for confederation? Is 
               <br />
               it legally possible that this country cannot vote 
               <br />
               for confederation simply because the people do 
               <br />
               not want responsible government? Furthermore, 
               <br />
               I am prepared to stake whatever reputation I may 
               <br />
               have as a lawyer in stating that the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment can, if it so desires, legislate this country 
               <br />
               into the Dominion of Canada tomorrow, with or 
               <br />
               without our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consent.</span> I feel sure she would not 
               <br />
               without our consent; but with the consent of the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland she would, provided 
               <br />
               always that Canada was an assenting party. It has 
               <br />
               been said that the Commission government was
