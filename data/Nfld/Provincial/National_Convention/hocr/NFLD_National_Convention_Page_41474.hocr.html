               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I would like ﬁrst 
               <br />
               to refer to Mr. Smallwood’s opening speech on 
               <br />
               Friday afternoon when he introduced the motion 
               <br />
               now before this Convention. Mr. Smallwood has 
               <br />
               referred here before to politics being present in 
               <br />
               this National Convention, but I think, sir, that he 
               <br />
               topped it all with his speech to which I have just 
               <br />
               referred. In my opinion he did not clearly outline 
               <br />
               just what those terms that have been offered by 
               <br />
               Canada would mean to the people of this country,

               The address, to my mind, was the start of a 
               <br />
               political campaign. He endeavoured to divide the 
               <br />
               country and set class against class. This is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">old.</span> 
               <br />
               time political practice, and endeavours to set the 
               <br />
               poor against the rich and the middle class against 
               <br />
               which ever side is most beneficial to the political 
               <br />

               decision on the question that is to be put to the 
               <br />
               people. The whole speech, sir, sounded familiar 
               <br />
               to me, and only after listening to it for a while did 
               <br />
               it remind me of the tirades that I have heard from 
               <br />
               soapbox orators in Hyde Park in London and in 
               <br />
               New York.

               Mr. Smallwood states that if the majority of 
               <br />
               this Convention had their way, the country would 
               <br />
               vote for nothing else but responsible government, 
               <br />
               but I think that the people will realise that by the 
               <br />
               unanimous passing of Mr. Higgins‘ motion to put 
               <br />
               before the people both responsible and Commis-

               sion of Government, Mr. Smallwood’s conten- 
               <br />
               tion is completely wrong. He also stated that it 
               <br />
               was abattle to get the Convention to debate these 
               <br />
               terms. Here again I cannot agree in any way with 
               <br />
               his statements, as I know of no time when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem»</span> 
               <br />
               bers did not wish to have these debated and I, for 
               <br />
               one, was very much desirous of having these 
               <br />

               dangerous they were to the future economy of the

               <br />

               <br />
               of burdensome taxes, I would be very glad indeed 
               <br />
               to recommend it; but on these so-called terms 
               <br />
               which we have been offered, I fail to ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               security for which the people of this country are 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood states that those people who

               <br />
               from Canada, have been harping on the property 
               <br />
               taxes that the people will have to pay. The proper- 
               <br />
               ty taxes, while they mean something to those who 
               <br />
               have to pay, yet are only a part of what the people 
               <br />
               will pay in taxes. The federal tax that will go to 
               <br />
               the Canadian government and the provincial 
               <br />
               taxes necessary to maintain administration of this 
               <br />
               provincial government will be a large source of 
               <br />
               worry, as well as taxes on property or school tax. 
               <br />
               Nobody here has intimated yet that the federal 
               <br />
               government will collect any property taxes. That 
               <br />
               has not been stated. Mr. Smallwood says that the 
               <br />
               provincial government never will collect proper- 
               <br />
               ty taxes because they would be thrown out of 
               <br />
               ofﬁce if they attempted to do this; and he went on 
               <br />
               to say that the town councils -— if you wish to 
               <br />
               have a town council -—- would perhaps collect 
               <br />
               these property taxes if they so desired. But let me 
               <br />
               point out, sir, that if there is no town council in a 
               <br />
               settlement, then the roads and public works or 
               <br />
               other services in that community have to be main— 
               <br />
               tained by the provincial government, and they in 
               <br />
               tum must tax to collect the money which they will 
               <br />
               spend. If those communities that have town <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coun«</span> 
               <br />
               oils are to progress and maintain their townsites, 
               <br />
               then they must collect taxes to do so, and whether 
               <br />
               you pay a property tax to the federal government, 
               <br />
               provincial government or town council, it does 
               <br />
               not matter. You will be taxed just the same, and 
               <br />
               whoever collects it will not help to ease the 
               <br />
