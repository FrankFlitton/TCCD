               Mr. Cashin Referring to the pulp and paper 
               <br />
               companies, there is considerable bitch on their 
               <br />
               property. They will not allow us to go in and cut 
               <br />
               where they are cutting at the present time, but I 
               <br />
               understand that they are only too delighted for the 
               <br />
               people to go in and cut on what has already been 
               <br />
               cut over. By “material assistance” I don’t mean 
               <br />
               that the government should ﬁnance that venture, 
               <br />
               but they should encourage it by tariffs, etc. We 
               <br />
               have found out that there are markets in Canada, 
               <br />
               as well as in the United States, for birch. It is a 
               <br />
               wood which is very difficult to handle because it 
               <br />
               is very heavy, but at the same time the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity is there for men making furniture, veneer, 
               <br />
               etc., and I understand that quite an industry can 
               <br />
               be developed in that. I think Messrs. Wm. Dawe 
               <br />
               and Sons did export some of that over 20 years 
               <br />
               ago. I did not mean that it should be ﬁnanced, but 
               <br />
               that it should be encouraged.

               <br />

               Grand Falls was built up it brought in revenue in

               <br />
               there was over $1 million collected in Corner

               man, under the heading of “Labrador", in the 
               <br />
               second paragraph, there has been no reliable sur- 
               <br />
               vey made of the amount of timber on Labrador 
               <br />
               and the opinions vary. What estimates, or whose? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I have seen various surveys of 
               <br />
               Labrador areas, some were not so good, others 
               <br />
               fairly good. Ihappened to see an aerial survey of 
               <br />
               Labrador some years ago, but I am not able to 
               <br />
               express an opinion as to the amount of wood in 
               <br />
               the various areas, but some people say 100 mil- 
               <br />
               lion cords. Other people say 50 million cords. 
               <br />
               There was a survey in Hamilton Inlet some years 
               <br />
               ago, and the gentleman in charge down there 
               <br />
               ﬁgured 50 million cords. I have seen the survey 
               <br />
               of the Sandwich Bay area and Eagle River on 
               <br />
               properties owned by the McMaster interests of 
               <br />
               Toronto, and these areas have over 10 million 
               <br />
               cords of wood. I know that the Hamilton River is 
               <br />
               heavily timbered. I would say that in those 300 
               <br />
               sq. miles there is some 1.5 to 2 million cords of 
               <br />
               wood. There is also the Double Mer property. A 
               <br />
               survey was made some 30 years ago and shows 
               <br />
               it carries 6 million cords of wood. Ibelieve there 
               <br />
               is only 2 million on it. 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett I might say that I read this report

               through when it was presented and remember l 
               <br />
               noticed there was a noticeable lack of statistics 
               <br />
               with regard to the earnings of our people general— 
               <br />
               ly from forestry, and of the amounts of revenue 
               <br />
               collected by the government down through the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span> It would have been wiser if the Forestry 
               <br />
               Committee had brought in some statistics over a 
               <br />
               period of years since they would give us a broader 
               <br />
               idea of the value of our forests and our financial 
               <br />
               and economic set—up, and also the possibilities 
               <br />
               for the future. I can ﬁnd nothing in this report 
               <br />
               which shows me those ﬁgures. I wonder if Major 
               <br />
               Cashin can tell me why.
