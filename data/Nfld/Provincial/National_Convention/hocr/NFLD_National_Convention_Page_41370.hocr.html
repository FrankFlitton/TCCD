               Mr. Higgins As Iintimated yesterday afternoon, 
               <br />
               I proposed, with the consent of the House, to 
               <br />
               introduce this evening a motion whereby mem— 
               <br />
               bers absent through illness or for good and sufﬁ— 
               <br />
               cient cause, would have the right to have their 
               <br />
               wishes recorded at this stage of the proceedings. 
               <br />
               As you will remember, sir, I intimated some 
               <br />
               months ago that Mr. KM. Brown had made a 
               <br />
               request to me that provision be made whereby his 
               <br />
               vote could be recorded. You are aware of the 
               <br />
               details of our application at that time time to make 
               <br />
               provision in this respect. Because of that, and I 
               <br />
               think it is imperative, if the House is satisﬁed to 
               <br />
               receive the motion I think we should pass it as 
               <br />
               soon as possible, and perhaps I could make the 
               <br />
               motion now. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman In that case, I will try and en— 
               <br />
               deavour to ascertain the wishes of the House. As 
               <br />
               the House is aware, this is a motion of urgency, 
               <br />
               but I am not expected to receive a motion without 
               <br />
               previous notice. In this particular connection the 
               <br />
               matter was gone into at a private session held 
               <br />
               approximately a month ago, and I think it was 
               <br />
               agreed that some machinery should be set up 
               <br />
               whereby Mr. Brown, because of illness, would 
               <br />
               not be deprived of the privilege of recording his 
               <br />
               vote. In fact, I would be prepared to record it now 
               <br />
               under rule 39. I must assume Mr. Brown is in 
               <br />
               good standing, at all events, and the nature of the 
               <br />
               motion has already been made known to the 
               <br />
               house... The motion therefore is that the opera- 
               <br />
               tion of rule 13 be suspended so as to permit Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins to introduce the motion, the substance of 
               <br />
               which has already been made known to the 
               <br />
               House, without the necessity of giving notice.
