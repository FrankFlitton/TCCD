               <br />
               am not too clear as to just exactly what the poets 
               <br />
               and the politicians have in mind when they take 
               <br />
               to being sentimental over our sacred heritage. I 
               <br />
               remember that I did one time see a ﬁsherman's 
               <br />
               wife shovel ﬁsh guts into a brin bag and spell it 
               <br />
               on her back to her gardens a mile away. I feel 
               <br />
               certain that that is not what they have in mind by 
               <br />
               our sacred heritage. I remember that I did one 
               <br />
               time spend February in a most picturesque little 
               <br />
               cottage nailed to a cliff beside the sea. I didn’t get 
               <br />
               warm for a month, and I feel certain that the 
               <br />
               people living there didn’t get warm for the winter. 
               <br />
               I feel that that is not the sacred heritage over 
               <br />
               which our poets work themselves up into 
               <br />
               ecstasies, and over which our politicians work 
               <br />
               themselves into a lather. Indeed, it must be some— 
               <br />
               thing altogether different than the most of what 
               <br />
               one comes across in making the rounds of this 
               <br />
               country. But if by our sacred heritage the poets 
               <br />
               and the politicians mean that we know in this 
               <br />
               island a culture and civilisation so different, and 
               <br />
               so much more advanced than the culture and 
               <br />
               civilisation of the North American mainland that 
               <br />

               <br />

               people and learn how the people live. You know. 
               <br />
               it could be that the best authority on the

               I have come to conclude that there would not 
               <br />
               be involved in confederation any issue of the 
               <br />
               preservation of a distinct national culture and 
               <br />
               civilisation. Now that is not to say, mind you, that 
               <br />
               we have not evolved our own customs, our own 
               <br />
               institutions, our own peculiar way of life. We 
               <br />
               have. It so happens that we are the inheritors of 
               <br />
               what I have sometimes called a ﬁsh and brewis 
               <br />
               culture, of which the apex in song is the “come- 
               <br />
               all—ye” and of which as good an example in folk 
               <br />
               custom as any other is a Codroy Valley “mill- 
               <br />
               ing”.1 Of that ﬁsh and brewis culture I am as 
               <br />
               proud as any Newfoundlander. It is true that we 
               <br />
               are the inheritors of a great national tradition of 
               <br />
               bravery against the seas, of heroism defying the 
               <br />
               sea to do its worst — bravery and heroism ex— 
               <br />
               empliﬁed for all time on a bleak October day on 
               <br />
               the bleak Labrador coast when a man named 
               <br />
               Jackman did 27 times head into the storm and 27 
               <br />
               times come ashore with a human life on his back.2 
               <br />
               It is true that in this land we are the inheritors of 
               <br />
               a great Christian tradition; that at the end of every 
               <br />
               week, after we have braved the sea and dug the 
               <br />
               land and cut the pulpwood, we do still after the 
               <br />
               manner of our fathers land gather in a thousand 
               <br />
               churches to pray as our fathers prayed... All these 
               <br />
               things are true. It is true too that all these things 
               <br />
               can remain to be so in the event of confederation. 
               <br />
               The things dearest to our hearts in this land will 
               <br />
               not in the event of union be at issue. I give it to 
               <br />
               you as my considered opinion, for what it is 
               <br />
               worth, that if the confederation alternate shall 
               <br />
               come to confront us in the referendum, that there 
               <br />
               shall be involved therein no issue involving our 
               <br />
               distinct character as Newfoundlanders, no issue 
               <br />
               involving our national honour, no issue involving 
               <br />
               our distinct culture and way of life.

               submitted to the Newfoundland people. I can say 
               <br />
               in conscience I know of no good and sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               reason why the Newfoundland people should not
