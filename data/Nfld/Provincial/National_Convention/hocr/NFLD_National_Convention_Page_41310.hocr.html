               <br />

               Some people say, Mr. Chairman, that respon- 
               <br />
               sible government means political freedom, but 
               <br />
               not economic security; some people say mat 
               <br />
               Commission government means economic 
               <br />
               security, but not political freedom... I don’t 
               <br />
               believe it. If responsible government failed to 
               <br />
               give us economic security, and it has failed, then 
               <br />
               it is precious little political freedom we would 
               <br />
               have. How can we have political freedom if we 
               <br />
               have no economic security and stability? What is 
               <br />
               the good of a vote to a man who is hungry? What 
               <br />
               is the good of elections to a man on the dole? No, 
               <br />
               I am afraid it is very little political freedom we 
               <br />
               would have as a people under responsible 
               <br />
               government if we had not full bellies and decent 
               <br />
               clothes to protect us, or what my good and 
               <br />
               respected friends Mr. Newell and Mr. Keough 
               <br />
               call three square meals a day, and a suit of clothes 
               <br />
               and a roof over their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heads...</span> Oh yes, it is all right 
               <br />
               to have the glorious right to vote and take part in 
               <br />
               elections, but I am afraid an awful lot of the glory 
               <br />
               just oozes out of it when you are hungry, and your 
               <br />
               children are hungry, and you have nothing to 
               <br />
               depend on but the dole. No, Mr. Chairman, I 
               <br />
               don’t think it is true at all to say that responsible 
               <br />
               government means political freedom without 
               <br />
               economic security, because without economic 
               <br />
               security you just can’t have political freedom, 
               <br />
               and I think there is very little in the other part of 
               <br />
               the saying that Commission government means 
               <br />
               economic security without political freedom. I 
               <br />
               think that day is gone, if we ever had it. Just when 
               <br />
               did Commission government give us economic 
               <br />
               security or stability? Cormnission government 
               <br />
               came here to Newfoundland in the winter of 
               <br />
               1934. For the ﬁrst six years they were here they 
               <br />
               certainly did not give Newfoundland any 
               <br />
               economic security. Don’t forget that right up to 
               <br />
               the outbreak of the war we had tens of thousands 
               <br />
               of our people on the dole under Commission 
               <br />
               government. Don’t forget that just a bare eight or 
               <br />
               nine years ago the total value of all our ﬁsh and 
               <br />
               ﬁsh products exported out of Newfoundland, the 
               <br />
               whole lot of them together, had a value of a paltry 
               <br />
               $8 million —— just eight years ago. Don’t forget 
               <br />
               that in the ﬁrst six years of Commission govem- 
               <br />
               ment at job was the hardest thing in this world to 
               <br />
               get here in Newfoundland, that we had thousands 
               <br />
