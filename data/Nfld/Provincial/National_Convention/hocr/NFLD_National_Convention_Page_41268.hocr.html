               <br />
               gentleman gave a very clever explanation as to 
               <br />
               why that is, but Mr. Chairman, you know and I 
               <br />
               know and even the simplest child knows, that one 
               <br />
               usually borrows money because one hasn’t got it. 
               <br />
               In this connection I read an article in the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               section of the New York T imes a couple of weeks 
               <br />
               ago, which says that the ﬁnancial position that 
               <br />
               Canada finds herself in today is not, as Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood says, because the Canadians have 
               <br />
               been spending money lavishly, but the Canadian 
               <br />
               government (the article says) has been on a 
               <br />
               spending spree, and careless of public interest, so 
               <br />
               that the government is now in the embarrassing 
               <br />
               position of trying to ﬁnd some US dollars, and is 
               <br />
               forced to go to the USA and borrow them. That 
               <br />
               is the ﬁnancial section of the New York Times, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood to the contrary. In the Geneva 
               <br />
               conference recently there were certain reductions 
               <br />
               made on goods coming from the USA to Canada 
               <br />
               to lighten the ﬁnancial burden of the Canadian 
               <br />
               taxpayer. But the same day that these tax reduc— 
               <br />
               tious were announced, an embargo came into 
               <br />
               effect in Canada on various other facets of US 
               <br />
               merchandise. So that according to the Canadian 
               <br />
               papers, the advantages of the reductions brought 
               <br />
               about by the Geneva conference were completely

               The Canadian terms of union have been 
               <br />
               presented to us with the implication that they are 
               <br />
               something that are permanent and unchangeable 
               <br />
               and everlasting. In my own lifetime I have seen 
               <br />
               terms and agreements among the biggest nations 
               <br />
               amended, watered down, and even torn up when 
               <br />
               it suited the su'ongest of the contracting parties. 
               <br />
               We all know that the famous Atlantic Charter, 
               <br />
               agreed to only six years ago by Mr. Churchill and 
               <br />
               the late President Roosevelt at Argentia, is now 
               <br />
               not only forgotten, but its terms are being 
               <br />
               honoured in their breach and not in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obser'</span> 
               <br />
               vance. So that is were we in confederation; when 
               <br />
               it suited Canada, she could place a new inter- 
               <br />
               pretation on any clause of the agreement that she 
               <br />
               wanted to, and we could do nothing about it. 
               <br />
               There would be loopholes in the agreement big 
               <br />
               enough, as the lawyers say, to drive a horse and 
               <br />
               buggy through. There is an old saying that 
               <br />
               premises are made to be broken, and if we have 
               <br />
               learned anything. we know that agreements like 
               <br />
               promises are made to be broken. There is nothing 
               <br />
               permanent in this world except death and taxes.

               For instance, the well-known Yalta agreement 
               <br />
               between Britain, the USA, and Russia. It was 
               <br />
               signed by all three, and all three were agreed. But 
               <br />
               hardly was the ink dry when they started arguing 
               <br />
               about the meaning of this clause and that clause, 
               <br />
               and it is generally understood now that they will 
               <br />
               never agree on what the words of this treaty 
               <br />
               meant. Britain and the USA say it meant one 
               <br />
               thing, and the Russians say it meant something 
               <br />
               entirely different. And the men who made this 
               <br />
               treaty were, all of them, experts. And yet we are 
               <br />
               asked to believe that seven inexperienced New— 
               <br />
               foundlanders went to Ottawa to confer with some 
               <br />
               of the cleverest, keenest, ﬁnancial experts, and 
               <br />
               that our delegation was a match for the clever, 
               <br />
               able, and political men that they met in Canada. 
               <br />
               Surely no one can be so simple as to believe this. 
               <br />
               And while I haven’t a great deal of intelligence, 
               <br />
               the little experience I have tells me that an
