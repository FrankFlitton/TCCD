               Mr. Higgins I may be anticipating parts of the

               report, butI note that the only reduction in operat- 
               <br />
               ing costs that Mr. Smallwood’s Committee has 
               <br />
               suggested might be caused by increasing these 
               <br />
               companies that have special rates. What is the 
               <br />
               real trouble with the Railway that they are losing 
               <br />
               money? Has the Committee any real reasons to 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I thoughtthat I had one. He will 
               <br />
               recall I said that every railway in North America 
               <br />
               is losing money, unless they increase their 
               <br />
               freight rates, which the railways in America and 
               <br />
               Canada are desiring right now to do... If we 
               <br />
               increase the freight rates the general public will 
               <br />
               have to bear the cost of operating the railway. If 
               <br />
               we do not, the government has to pay the loss. 
               <br />
               Whether the people pay it or the government pay 
               <br />
               it, the people of Newfoundland in general have

               to stand the loss.... As for the other point he

               of one pocket into another, and the Railway 
               <br />
               would have been much better off if it had got that

               continue to get subsidies, particularly since war- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               should be segregated from the Railway. All boats

               <br />
               by subsidiaries — the dock is making money,

               shipping losing money. The dock is kept up by 
               <br />
               the ships. If they put a ship on the dock they credit 
               <br />
               it to the dock. If they put a locomotive in the 
               <br />
               machine shOp, they credit it to the machine shop.

               Another point, in 1939-40, shortly after the 
               <br />
               outbreak of war, the government gave the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rail~</span> 
               <br />
               way $500,000 out of the Colonial Development

               <br />

               <br />
               Development Fund still owing was wiped out by 
               <br />
               the British government, yet I notice the Railway 
               <br />
               is being charged with interest on a debt that has 
               <br />
               been cancelled. I presume there is some explana-

               tion for it. I think the Railway situation today has ' 
               <br />
               to be handled with care. Let us look at it this way; 
               <br />
               they paid $5,400,000 in wages, and 30% of that 
               <br />
               comes back in customs duties - $1.5 million. 
               <br />
               The Railway costs $1.75 million, therefore the
