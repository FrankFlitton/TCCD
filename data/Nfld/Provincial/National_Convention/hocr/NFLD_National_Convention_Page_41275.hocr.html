               conclusion that if I wanted to ﬁnd out the facts of 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood and have recourse to other sour-

               ces, and to facts which would enable me to come

               When I ﬁrst came here it was in the fond hope 
               <br />
               that this gathering of Newfoundlanders could 
               <br />
               function as an impartial body of examiners of the 
               <br />
               condition and prospects of our country; that in 
               <br />
               friendliness and co-operation we would pursue 
               <br />
               our labours and within a matter of months we 
               <br />
               would be able to present a report of our delibera— 
               <br />
               tions to the country. But what happened? Before 
               <br />
               we could get settled down to our job at all, we 
               <br />
               had this issue of confederation shoved across the 
               <br />
               table. At that time it struck me that it seemed 
               <br />
               strange, strange indeed, for this matter to come 
               <br />
               before us, seeing that we had neither examined 
               <br />
               nor reported on the matter of our own country, or 
               <br />
               whether it would be necessary for us to consider 
               <br />
               going in with any other country. It was obvious 
               <br />
               to me then that the parties responsible for intro- 
               <br />
               ducing this confederation issue were not con- 
               <br />
               cerned with what this Convention thought was 
               <br />
               best for the country, or what its ﬁnal decisions 
               <br />
               might be. They apparently did not care what a 
               <br />
               survey of our accounts would show. Whether we 
               <br />
               were prosperous or insolvent did not seem to 
               <br />
               matter anything to them, because they acted 
               <br />
               without waiting for these things to be decided. In 
               <br />
               effect their actions seem to say, no matter what 
               <br />
               the ﬁndings of the Convention might be, no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat.</span> 
               <br />
               ter whether we wanted confederation or not, they 
               <br />
               were there for the express purpose of hanging it 
               <br />
               around our necks... Talk about your closed 
               <br />
               minds, Mr. Chairman. Here is a case where we 
               <br />
               seem to have the mind which has never been 
               <br />
               anything else. We all know the unhappy results 
               <br />
               of this misguided action on the part of the con— 
               <br />
               federates. It destroyed the efﬁciency of this Con- 
               <br />
               vention before it could get down to business. It 
               <br />
               did away with any possibility of harmony or 
               <br />
               co-operation. It set the seed of political mis- 
               <br />
               guidance. In a word it sabotaged this Convention, 
               <br />
               and at the same time any hope which we might 
               <br />
               have entertained of obtaining beneﬁcial results 
               <br />
               for our people. It is quite plain now that these 
               <br />
               people have placed their political aspirations

               before the interest of the country. Can we wonder 
               <br />
               then, can we be surprised at the state of things 
               <br />
               which resulted? Some outsiders are inclined to 
               <br />
               blame all of us for the unsatisfactory manner in 
               <br />
               which this Convention has conducted its ses- 
               <br />
               sions. But I ask, how could it be otherwise? Did 
               <br />
               they expect the delegates to allow this confedera- 
               <br />
               tion issue to be shoved down their throats without 
               <br />
               making their judgement known? Refusing to ac- 
               <br />
               cept the high pressure sales talk which the agents 
               <br />
               of our bartering of our country rained on them? 
               <br />
               The main reason we are here at all as a group is 
               <br />
               the desire of Newfoundlanders to live in freedom, 
               <br />
               to resolve the future in their own way. Yet before 
               <br />
               they had hardly taken their seats, we ﬁnd them 
               <br />
               subject to this four-speeding Canadian pact. For 
               <br />
               myself, I can only congratulate my fellow mem- 
               <br />
               bers on their tolerance and forbearance in the face 
               <br />
               of the threat of dictatorship.

               Mr. Chairman, as one who was born in this 
               <br />
               country, who is proud of the name New- 
               <br />
               foundlander, whose lifetime has been spent in her 
               <br />
               forests and on her sea, and who loves every inch 
               <br />
               of her soil as such a one I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               understand the mentality and the outlook of those 
               <br />
               who call themselves Newfoundlanders, yet are 
               <br />
               working for the end that Newfoundland shall no 
               <br />
               longer be Newfoundland, who are prepared to see 
               <br />
               her and all that she stands for passed into the 
               <br />
               hands of strangers, who are ready to make those 
               <br />
               who share its blood and toil servants in the house 
               <br />
               of another, instead of being masters in their own. 
               <br />
               To me at least there seems to be something wrong 
               <br />
               about it. It seems to violate some law of happi- 
               <br />
               ness. It seems to be a sin against morality itself. 
               <br />
               Yet that is the spectacle which I am witnessing 
               <br />
               here day after day. 
               <br />

               Now let me say that in spite of anything which 
               <br />
               I may have said, I am capable of viewing things 
               <br />
               fairly, and in the present instance I have tried to 
               <br />
               apply my sense of fairness to the present matter 
               <br />
               of the transfer of our sovereignty. Perhaps, I ask 
               <br />
               myself, we Newfoundlanders are a country that 
               <br />
               cannot stand alone, perhaps we are too small to 
               <br />
               survive as a country. But when the Financial 
               <br />
               Report was presented, what did I ﬁnd? I found 
               <br />
               that every page in that report gave the lie to the 
               <br />
               questions I had asked. There I found undeniable 
               <br />
               figures and inescapable conclusions which 
               <br />
               proved to me beyond the shadow of a doubt that 
               <br />
               my country is not only solvent, but is one of the 
               <br />
