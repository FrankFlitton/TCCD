               Mr. Lewin appeared before the Forestry Commit—

               tee and gave an estimate of what they have been

               <br />
               out say in 1948 and maybe 1949, which is very

               encouraging. He also makes the statement in your

               Mr. Cashin At the present time, as far as I know, 
               <br />
               the rates or prices paid for newsprint are based on 
               <br />
               a price fob New York, and that is at present $84 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ton.</span> If they send it to South America they pay 
               <br />
               more for it, but the basic price is $84 per ton fob 
               <br />
               New York, and the prospects for the next few 
               <br />
               years are that it will not go below that price. I 
               <br />
               don’t know what the Bowaters contract calls for, 
               <br />
               but the price is the usual market price. Sometimes 
               <br />
               they get more than market price and sometimes

               less.

               Mr. Smallwood I think it is only fair to touch on 
               <br />
               that for a moment. I have here a copy of World 
               <br />
               Reporter which is a very well known publication, 
               <br />
               for November 5, and there is an article here called 
               <br />
               “Newsprint still fails to meet the world’s need.” 
               <br />
               They are running short in the world at the rate of 
               <br />
               1,200,000 tons a year. Canada will turn out 
               <br />
               4,200,000 tons this year, setting a new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">record,</span> 
               <br />
               Three quarters of that goes to the United States, 
               <br />
               and the Canadian plants have reached their 
               <br />
               capacity. Perhaps 250,000 tons could be 
               <br />
               squeezed out of the Canadian mills by speeding 
               <br />
               up their machines, but it says “widespread expan- 
               <br />
               sion is not planned because the industry regards 
               <br />
               the present market as a passing phase." This 
               <br />
               present world wide shortage, and the high price 
               <br />
               based on that shortage, is, they think, a passing 
               <br />
               phase. Newfoundland produces 350,000 tons a 
               <br />
               year, but most of it goes to the United States and 
               <br />
               Great Britain. Expansion of capacity by 75,000 
               <br />
               tons will be completed by 1948. That’s the 
               <br />
               Bowaters expansion is it not? 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood It speaks of Finland, Scan~ 
               <br />
               dinavia, Germany, Poland, etc., and it winds up 
               <br />
               by saying, “Regardless of price, however, there 
               <br />
               is ample evidence that the current shortage of 
               <br />
               newsprint on a worldwide basis will carry 
               <br />
               through 1947 and may reach 1948." The indica- 
               <br />
               tion is that the worldwide shortage will be over- 
               <br />
               taken in 1947 or 1948, they will catch up with the 
               <br />
               need. Bearing on that also, the January 25 issue 
               <br />
               ofthe Financial Post has this on newsprint: “pulp 
               <br />
