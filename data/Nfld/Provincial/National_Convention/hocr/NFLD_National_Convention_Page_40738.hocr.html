               cost of living enquiry was $30 million and two 
               <br />
               years too late. But on the North American con~ 
               <br />
               tinent they put ceilings on, in addition to which 
               <br />
               there were tremendous shortages of everything, 
               <br />
               and all their activity went into war production. 
               <br />
               The result was that millions of people saved up 
               <br />
               money out of their wages that they could not 
               <br />
               spend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> nothing to spend it on, shortages of 
               <br />
               everything. Even here in Newfoundland we felt 
               <br />
               something of the shortages, but nothing like on 
               <br />
               the continent. The result was that many billions 
               <br />
               of dollars were accumulated in the pockets of the 
               <br />
               people. And now there is a great backlog of 
               <br />
               purchasing power, and as fast as industry can turn 
               <br />
               out washing machines, vacuum cleaners, motor 
               <br />
               cars, trucks, locomotives, steamships — every- 
               <br />
               thing that is based on steam, which is based on 
               <br />
               iron ore — it is bought. They can‘t turn it out fast 
               <br />
               enough. Why? Because this great backlog of 
               <br />
               earning created by the war is now being spent. So 
               <br />
               therefore we sell our iron ore, and we sell our
