               In the early stages of this Convention, when 
               <br />
               this confederation matter came up, we passed an

               member forBonavista Centre that until all reports

               were prepared, there would be no discussion or 
               <br />
               conversation regarding sending a delegation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out~</span> 
               <br />
               side the country. These reports cannot be 
               <br />
               prepared until we get information from the 
               <br />
               government in the United Kingdom, because the 
               <br />
               Commission is not the government. We have 
               <br />
               asked the Commission government for deﬁnite 
               <br />
               information regarding the economic condition of 
               <br />
               this country — they have refused that informa-

               After <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Penney’s amendment was passed, 
               <br />
               we went along fairly smoothly. Finally we come

               to Mr. Job’s motion1 that we go to Government 
               <br />
               House to have a discussion with the Commission 
               <br />

               position in a few remarks which were evidently 
               <br />
               construed that I was trying to hold up the work of 
               <br />
               the Convention. But Mr. Job brought in a resolu-

               tion of some kind regarding the same matter and 
               <br />
               it was kicked out. We get back from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis'</span>

               sion government the answer that we cannot deal

               with the United States — it is a matter for 
               <br />
               diplomatic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiations.</span> We agreed on that. We 
               <br />
               get the answer that they are prepared to ask the 
               <br />
               Dominions Office or the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               government whether they would receive a 
               <br />
               delegation from this Convention to discuss mat~ 
               <br />
               ters, and also they would be prepared to ask the 
               <br />
               Canadian government whether they would be 
               <br />
               prepared to receive a delegation -— not to get or 
               <br />
               discuss terms, because the answer distinctly 
               <br />
               states we have no authority to discuss fiscal, 
               <br />
               financial or economic matters, As I see it, the 
               <br />
               delegation going to Ottawa would mean going up 
               <br />
               as postage stamps. We meet the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               and say, “We are here to find out if you have any 
               <br />
               offer to make regarding confederation." The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of Canada says, “Here, you take 
               <br />
               that and bring it back. You cannot open it and say 
               <br />
               whether or not you accept it.” We have no 
               <br />
               authority. There is only one authority — a New- 
               <br />
