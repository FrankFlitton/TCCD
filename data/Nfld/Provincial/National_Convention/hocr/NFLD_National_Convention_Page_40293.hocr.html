               us not why we should go to Canada, but why 
               <br />
               Canada should want us at all. Is anyone within

               the reach of my voice, I wonder, so innocent as

               not done, we shall live to deeply regret it. Let us

               remember that we cannot escape the verdict of

               brieﬂy sum up the message I would leave with 
               <br />
               you. That message is that there are grave reasons,

               <br />
               forestall the disaster which looms ahead. To the 
               <br />
               best of my ability I have given you these reasons.

               <br />
               present is one for action. I do this because of my 
               <br />
               sense of duty to the people who sent me here; to 
               <br />

               just and decent; and above all, for the love which

               delegates stressed the great need of roads in their 
               <br />
               districts. I think it is my duty to do likewise in 
               <br />
               fairness of the district I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represent.</span> Whatever the 
               <br />
               form of government is in we must have roads 
               <br />
               and more roads. Roads should be, sir, foremost 
               <br />
               in any form of government. I would like to see a 
               <br />
               trunk road across this country, but the big ques- 
               <br />
               tion is just where is the money coming from. 
               <br />
               Gentlemen, I really and truly think it would come 
               <br />
               if we had more faith in ourselves and our country, 
               <br />

               but then “Faith without works is dead”. The 
               <br />
               delegates have not all agreed or approved of the

               <br />
               sir, we have all agreed on this one point, and that 
               <br />
               is, the great, and urgent need for more and better 
               <br />
               roads in the outport settlements. I would like to 
               <br />
               see all our local roads connected from settlement 
               <br />
               to settlement, and connecting up to the railway. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman, I want now to refer brieﬂy to 
               <br />
               a small settlement in Lewisporte district, known 
               <br />
               as Laurenceton, where no train, no steamer calls. 
               <br />
               There are approximately 80 or 90 families living 
               <br />
               there, without any government transportation, 
               <br />
               yet these same people always pay their taxes, and 
               <br />
               are all independent, and further they do not know 
               <br />
               the meaning of dole. To get their supplies, or 
               <br />
               freight, these people have to go all the way to 
               <br />
               Botwood, a distance of 12 or 14 miles, blow high 
               <br />
               or blow low. All you gentlemen know where 
               <br />
               Botwood is, as usually every November month 
               <br />
               the Kyle is ordered there by the Railway to keep 
               <br />
               the port of Botwood open so that the AND Co. 
               <br />
               can load their paper and ship it, while the Kyle 
               <br />
               keeps the channel free of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ise.</span> This same channel 
               <br />
               the Laurenceton people must use to get their 
               <br />
               freight along in the late fall. This is not good 
               <br />
               enough, and provision should be made for them. 
               <br />
               I may say, sir, these same people are only four or 
               <br />
               ﬁve miles away from the Lewisporte - Brown’s 
               <br />
               Arm road, and if these people could be connected 
               <br />
               to that road it would eliminate all this unneces— 
               <br />
               sary risk and hardship. When once joined to the 
               <br />
               road they would get their freight by way of 
               <br />
               Lewisporte in half an hour by truck. Those people 
               <br />
               also are the salt of the earth, and are entitled to 
               <br />
               better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treatment.</span> 
               <br />

               Some 18 or 20 years ago the Lewisporte -

               Boyd’s Cove road was surveyed, or partly sur- 
               <br />
               veyed, and not a great deal more has been done 
               <br />
               to it since, although some settlements have been 
               <br />
               extended a little here and there. This road is of 
               <br />
               paramount importance, not only to Lewisporte 
               <br />
               district, but to Twillingate district, Fogo district, 
               <br />
               and Bonavista North to Weslcyville. This road, 
               <br />
               therefore, when completed, can and will serve 
               <br />
               more than 30,000 people... Freight then can be 
               <br />
               landed at Lewisporte or Wesleyville, and trucked 
               <br />
               from either end of the road as the need arises.
