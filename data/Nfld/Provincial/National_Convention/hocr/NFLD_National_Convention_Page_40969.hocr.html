               constitution of a province is a matter for that 
               <br />
               province. We often hear the question, “Under 
               <br />
               confederation, how many members would New- 
               <br />
               foundland elect to the House of Assembly?” You 
               <br />
               often hear the question, “Would there be two 
               <br />
               houses?” “Would it be ‘bicameral’, or 
               <br />
               ‘unicameral’?” “Would there be a lower house 
               <br />
               and an upper house?” Then again you often hear, 
               <br />
               “How many districts would there be?" All these 
               <br />
               matters are in the provincial constitution of New- 
               <br />
               foundland if we become a province, and we are 
               <br />
               the masters. We decide for ourselves whether our 
               <br />
               general elections shall be every four years, or ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six; whether our House of Assembly shall 
               <br />
               consist of 15 members of 50, or anything be- 
               <br />
               tween. We decide whether we shall have an upper 
               <br />
               house or just an elected house. All these matters 
               <br />
               are our own business... The only thing is that
