               <br />
               members of this Convention feel. I am extremely 
               <br />
               pleased myself to be able to have the honour of 
               <br />
               moving this, particularly as a brother member of

               tion of a group of citizens from all over the island 
               <br />
               assembled here in a Convention of which you 
               <br />
               have been such an able guide and guardian. I can 
               <br />
               say quite truthfully that at times matters have not 
               <br />
               been altogether in due decorum from the 
               <br />
               members’ point of View. But you, I am sure, felt, 
               <br />
               with strong feelings running as they were bound 
               <br />
               to on matters such as we have had to debate, they 
               <br />
               would of necessity provoke an expression that at 
               <br />
               times might not be in accord with all that par-

               happened in the best regulated parliaments, and

               I feel that the members here have nothing to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be,</span> 
               <br />
               ashamed of in this respect. But even at times 
               <br />
               when tempers were on edge, you managed to 
               <br />
               preserve your impartiality, and treat members 
               <br />
               with your well-known courtesy, and the motion 
               <br />
               speaks of the able manner in which you have 
               <br />
               presided. I feel there is very little that needs be 
               <br />
               added to that. You carried out your duties here in 
               <br />
               the same able and professional manner that you 
               <br />
               carry out your professional duties, and for that 
               <br />
               reason I have much pleasure in moving this mo- 
               <br />

               from all the delegates, and I very much appreciate 
               <br />
               this. I have been referred to, sir, as the father of 
               <br />

               sir, when you took the Chair, that I regard you as 
               <br />
               one of our country’s most brilliant sons, a bril—

               <br />
               sir, I am full of admiration for the way in which 
               <br />
               you took hold of this job and mastered it, in spite 
               <br />
               of the fact that all your training for the last 12 or 
               <br />
               15 years was in a place and at work which is so 
               <br />
               very different from the work you had to take on 
               <br />
               when you became Chairman of this Convention. 
               <br />
               I refer of course to your work and training in the 
               <br />
               courts, where they have a tradition and a proce— 
               <br />
               dure running back for a thousand years, and to 
               <br />
               take on work with a very different tradition, and 
               <br />
               in many respects very different procedure, that is 
               <br />
