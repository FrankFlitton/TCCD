               apply with greater or lesser merit under different 
               <br />
               circumstances. To state my position clearly, I 
               <br />
               would not recommend a form of government for 
               <br />

               <br />
               Ifeel, be very lax in my duty and indeed, it would 
               <br />
               be plain deceit to do other than that. Sixteen

               months ago I might have said I think the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland are desirous of voting on cer-

               <br />
               the same, nor am I under duty to ﬁnd out. But I 
               <br />
               am under duty to recommend what in my opinion 
               <br />
               should be put before the people. Obviously, to 
               <br />
               determine the wishes of the people was a purely 
               <br />
               mechanical matter; but to secure a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommenda‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion necessitated study, hence the Convention 
               <br />
               and its undertaking, and surely now, after all its 
               <br />
               cost to the country, our recommendation will 
               <br />
               have foundation on the facts as we saw them. Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, are we shirking the ﬁrst call of duty? 
               <br />
               Are we seeing enacted before our very eyes the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst scene in the further degradation of our 
               <br />
               country? Must our way be still harder? Given the 
               <br />
               task to do, will history record us as having dis- 
               <br />
               charged that duty faithfully, or will it relate a 
               <br />
               gruesome story of putrefaction and prostitution 
               <br />
               of a great obligation? Sometimes I fear it has 
               <br />
               happened.

               This country of ours has fought a hard ﬁght 
               <br />
               down through the years, and progress and 
               <br />
               development were greatly retarded by outside 
               <br />
               forces. Despite all this, the great courage of its 
               <br />
               people and their determination to establish here 
               <br />
               a country fashioned to their own liking, made the 
               <br />
               task, though a difﬁcult one, a desire of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heart,</span>

               Here in the quiet though frugal comfort of their 
               <br />
               homes, they planned their undertakings —- under- 
               <br />
               takings that would undoubtedly bring them great 
               <br />
               dangers. But danger to them created a more 
               <br />
               colourful existence. In this and many similar 
               <br />
               ways, a way of life was born. Meanwhile, what 
               <br />
               of our leaders? We hear, from those who would 
               <br />
               tear down the whole structure of our national life 
               <br />
               and culture, repeated attempts made to blacken 
               <br />
               our Newfoundland leaders of the past. The dark 
               <br />
               spots of our history are always held to the front, 
               <br />
               for fear can be instilled in our hearts by such a 
               <br />
               policy. Mr. Chairman, we had great men as 
               <br />
               judged in the age in which they lived. These men 
               <br />
               laid the foundation of the trade and commerce of

               <br />

               <br />
               to dwell for long in history’s pages. What of our 
               <br />
               trade and commerce? What of our leaders in this 
               <br />
               ﬁeld? Notice, I make no mention of the producer, 
               <br />
               the ﬁsherman, farmer, logger, miner. I want to 
               <br />
               deal, if possible, with those inﬂuences of govern-

               <br />
               fully aware and quite willing to believe that our 
               <br />
               producers will do their part, and thus I dispose of 
               <br />
               that part of the subject. Time does not permit me 
               <br />
               to deal with more than one of our primary in- 
               <br />
               dustries, and I shall refer only to the ﬁshing 
               <br />
               industry which is and will continue to be the chief 
               <br />
               industry of that section of Newfoundland from 
               <br />
               where I come.

               The ﬁshing industry emerged from the war 
               <br />
               period without any great shock. It could ill afford 
               <br />
               a shock —— let that be fully appreciated. The war 
               <br />
               period, no one need be reminded, was abnormal 
               <br />
               in its demands both in quantity and price, and a 
               <br />
               serious falling off could have easily been the 
               <br />
               order of the day. This did not happen, and it was 
               <br />
               no accident that it did not — neither was it just 
               <br />
               good luck. It was, let there be no mistake about 
               <br />
               it, due to the vision, the constructive policy of our 
               <br />
               leaders in that ﬁeld. True, we had an exchange 
               <br />
               problem, but even in this matter local suggestions 
               <br />
               capable of solving the problems of the day were 
               <br />
               readily forthcoming. We have gone a long way 
               <br />
               in the development of our ﬁshing industry and in 
               <br />
               our marketing methods, and the future gives even 
               <br />
               further encouragement, for our next move 
               <br />
               promises to be the solving in part at least of that

               exchange of currency <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">problem,</span> If that can be once 
               <br />
               taken care of, then the Newfoundland producer 
               <br />
               will have considerably less to worry about. This 
               <br />
               is our problem. We have to have it solved in 
               <br />
               particular reference to this country; we should 
               <br />
               trust it to no other country to do it for us.

               And now I feel I should dwell for a few 
               <br />
               moments on the effect of union with Canada on 
               <br />
               this industry. The first and perhaps the all-con- 
               <br />
               demning feature is that the control of all trade and 
               <br />
               commerce would rest in the hands of the federal 
               <br />
               government, as it is today in Canada. New- 
               <br />
               foundland is small in comparison with Canada; 
               <br />
               we are always reminded of that, but what we are 
               <br />
               not asked to be mindful of is that in the competi-

               tive market which exists, we are taking care of 
               <br />
               ourselves well. Union with Canada, as I see it,
