               <br />
               produce that ﬁgure? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I have the statement made by 
               <br />
               him, which will be passed or rejected by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem.</span>

               Mr. Starkes Mr. Chairman. the other day when 
               <br />
               Major Cashin was talking, he got up on his high 
               <br />
               horse and put up a wonderful kick because I just 
               <br />
               said a few words ~— once, and I was stopped. It 
               <br />
               seems that there’s something getting under his 
               <br />
               skin this afternoon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Did you say the people of Verdun 
               <br />
               said that they were in favour of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               going into confederation? 
               <br />
               Mr. Starkes Mr. Chairman, I have the floor, not 
               <br />
               Major Cashin. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I had to rule you out of order 
               <br />
               when you interrupted Major Cashin at that par- 
               <br />
               ticular time, I recall the incident quite clearly... 
               <br />
               I ruled against you on that occasion and consis- 
               <br />
               teney will not permit me to do otherwise now. I 
               <br />
               have to rule Major Cashin out of order.

               Mr. Starkes Unemployment. There is un- 
               <br />
               employment at the present time in Canada as well 
               <br />
               as in Newfoundland, the number there being 
               <br />
               around 65,000 or a half of 1%. The number 
               <br />
               unemployed in Newfoundland is very much 
               <br />
               higher proportionately. Canada is bringing 
               <br />
               monthly over 10,000 people from Europe, so this 
               <br />
               would indicate that the country is in flourishing 
               <br />
               condition. Prime Minister King stated some time

               ago that there were more people employed than 
               <br />
               at any other time. The federal government has set 
               <br />
               up an advisory committee of experts who are 
               <br />
               advising on public works to be started in a period 
               <br />
               of recession. They have allocated in the last few 
               <br />
               months $400 million worth of new public works 
               <br />
               to cushion this recession period, and they propose 
               <br />
               some very large expenditures this year. Taking 
               <br />
               all in all, if conditions get bad in the world the 
               <br />
               Canadian unemployed will be better off than in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. For instance in 1934 there were 
               <br />
               80,000 unemployed Newfoundlanders living on 
               <br />
               6 cents a day. At that period, in the whole of 
               <br />
               Canada, you could not ﬁnd from coast to coast 
               <br />
               80,000 living in such poverty. This is a very 
               <br />
               serious matter, and the people should endeavour 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd out the truth for themselves, and not be 
               <br />
               guided by the ravings of a few who may not be 
               <br />
               working in the best interests of the people as a

               whole.

               Mr. Burry As this debate proceeded I found 
               <br />
               myself, sir, more and more satisfied with the 
               <br />
               conclusion that I was able to come to from a few 
               <br />
               months ago, after we ﬁnished our work in Ot~ 
               <br />
               tawa. That conclusion is that the political, 
               <br />
               economical, and industrial life of this country 
               <br />
               should be more closely tied in with the great 
               <br />
               neighbour of ours to the west, if we are to avoid 
               <br />
               some of the pitfalls that we have experienced in 
               <br />
               the past. I am very conscious that it is easy to 
               <br />
               make a statement like that. But I can assure you 
               <br />
               that I have not come to that position easily, or by 
               <br />
               any haphazard process of reasoning. It has not 
               <br />
               been a hasty decision, and I don’t think I have 
               <br />
               been persuaded by sentiment. I certainly do not 
               <br />
               have any political aspirations. I have been often 
               <br />
               kidded since I went to Ottawa that I might get a 
               <br />
               senatorship but I have no aspirations for that at 
               <br />
               all. I certainly do not want to take any part in 
               <br />
               federal or provincial politics.
