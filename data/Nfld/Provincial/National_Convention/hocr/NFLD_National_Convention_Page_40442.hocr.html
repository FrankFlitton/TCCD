               Some 15 or 16 years ago, a co-operative move—

               Carbonear, representing all denominations,

               the younger members could not give it the time

               <br />
               distribute the assets to the people. During the time 
               <br />
               it was in operation members competed in public 
               <br />
               exhibitions in St. John’s and won many cups and 
               <br />
               prizes. These souvenirs are still held in the homes 
               <br />
               of the winners. This co-operative society did not

               have the privilege of radio propaganda or special 
               <br />

               <br />
               the people a nest-egg until disbanded. I believe 
               <br />
               Canon Rusted will bear me out, and also Father 
               <br />
               Coady of Tors Cove, through whose efforts we 
               <br />
               were able to obtain a pedigreed Jersey bull, the

               fat and milk of a quality second to none 
               <br />
               anywhere, and this was in keeping with the

               quality of fresh eggs known so well all over the

               Mr. Newell I am anxious not to create false

               figures — I hope nobody will get the impression 
               <br />
               that, because there is such a discrepancy in prices 
               <br />
               paid by local buyers and by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperatives,</span> local 
               <br />
               buyers are deliberately holding down the prices. 
               <br />
               I think the local merchants were paying as big a 
               <br />
               price as they could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay</span> This is important in the 
               <br />
               point of view of the fisheries... With reference to 
               <br />
               competition, I remarked there was one or two 
               <br />
               firms which paid as much as 26 cents or 27 cents 
               <br />
               this year. Ever since the co-operative movement 
               <br />
               has gotten strong enough to have fairly large 
               <br />
               quantities of salmon on the market, there have 
               <br />
               been chartered boats to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> It has been common 
               <br />
               practice for local dealers collecting certain 
               <br />
               amounts of salmon to get space on boats 
               <br />
               chartered by the co-operative society, and to 
               <br />
               enable them to pay practically the same prices as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co-operatives.</span> Most of the businessmen say they 
               <br />
               feel it is a good thing if the earnings of the 
               <br />
               fishermen can be increased, then the business-

               Mr. Roberts 1 would like to say a word or two 
               <br />
               in regard to the co-operative movement on the 
               <br />
               northwest coast. with regard to the lobster

               sive ﬁshery would deplete fish. It can, especially 
               <br />
               in regard to lobsters. Fifty years ago lobsters were 
               <br />
               a nuisance, a pest, no one knew about canning 
               <br />
               lobsters. Their only use was for fish bait. Finally 
               <br />
               some Canadian who knew the northwest coast 
               <br />
               came down and packed those lobsters. The best 
               <br />
               price paid was 50 cents for 100 lobsters, regard- 
               <br />
               less of what size they were. Today they are paid 
               <br />
               practically 50 cents each. In 1920 the government
