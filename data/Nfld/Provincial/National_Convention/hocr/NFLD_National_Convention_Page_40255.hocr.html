               Mr. Higgins We can hardly blame Mr. Starkes, 
               <br />
               although I think he was one of the people who 
               <br />
               subscribed to that highroads policy; but certainly 
               <br />
               there are members in this House today who agree 
               <br />
               that that road was to be built not for the St. John’s 
               <br />
               people, but for the whole peninsula. I do agree it 
               <br />
               is a pity that we can’t have a series of roads 
               <br />
               through all the places, but that’s going to be in 
               <br />
               the future. You have got to depend on your local 
               <br />
               roads committees for that. I am strong in my 
               <br />
               advocacy of a transinsular highroad. I don’ t know 
               <br />
               if you can do that for $6 million, but if so it will 
               <br />
               be money well spent. In that event you can have

               come in to St. John’s by bus, if he lives long

               Mr. Fudge Mr. Chairman, much discussion has 
               <br />
               taken place since this report has been presented 
               <br />
               regarding the Railway, the amount of money that 
               <br />
               it is costing the country, and especially the loss 
               <br />
               which reaches the tidy sum of $1.5 million. Of 
               <br />
               course, the greatest concern to the Convention is 
               <br />
               to try and devise ways and means to reduce this, 
               <br />
               so that we may be able to recommend our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnd</span> 
               <br />
               ings to the present or future form of government. 
               <br />
               I understand that in 1938 there were certain con- 
               <br />
               cessions granted to Bowater’s Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd. by the present form of 
               <br />
               government, and this also, I take it, applies to the 
               <br />
               Anglo-Newfoundland Co. and Buchans Mining 
               <br />
               company. We are all aware of the tremendous 
               <br />
               rise in operating costs since 1938.... Due to rising 
               <br />
               costs, labour has agitated for and received in- 
               <br />
               creases in wages to offset conditions as much as 
               <br />
               possible. I think we will agree that where a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com»</span> 
               <br />
               pany contributes an enormous amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">busi~</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               ness to the Railway, it is human nature to expect 
               <br />
               some special consideration or concessions. In 
               <br />
               other words, it is a matter as I see it of wholesale 
               <br />
               and retail prices... Now, Mr. Chairman, can you 
               <br />
               imagine that our government of today is applying 
               <br />
               concessions to those companies which might 
               <br />
               have been suitable in 1938, but are out of all 
               <br />
               proportion today. It does seem businesslike that 
               <br />
               in view of the high cost of operating the Railway, 
               <br />
               the government should have negotiated with the 
               <br />
               various companies for an adjustment upwards in 
               <br />
               the rates... But I warn the powers that be that the 
               <br />
               general public will not accept further taxation 
               <br />
               while wealthy corporations are getting off with a 
               <br />
               mere triﬂe. The Railway cannot pay under such 
               <br />
               circumstances. The increases should rest on the 
               <br />
               shoulders of those who can afford to bear them. 
               <br />
               With regard to roads, I am well aware that 
               <br />
               roads are a necessity, but they should be built in 
               <br />
               sections where they serve the greatest number of 
               <br />
               people, and not through a wilderness. The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               necessity today is local roads, and roads linking 
               <br />
               up with the railway. It is all very well to talk of a 
               <br />
               highroad through the country, but we must cut 
               <br />
               our garment according to our cloth. I am sure that 
               <br />
               outport doctors will agree with me. Let me tell 
               <br />
               you of one instance that came to my notice last 
               <br />
               year. There is a settlement in Bay of Islands 
               <br />
               called Cox’s Cove, which has no road connection 
               <br />
               with Corner Brook... There was a shortage of

               <br />
