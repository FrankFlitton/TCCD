               Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman, we are dealing now 
               <br />
               with aged people, up around 70 years of age, and 
               <br />
               I think that the one thing above all others we 
               <br />
               should not do is, we should not try to kid the 
               <br />
               children. Let’s try to give them a fair, true angle 
               <br />
               as it stands. Now I believe the facts are, and I am 
               <br />
               sure Mr. Smallwood will correct me if I go 
               <br />
               wrong, that we have around 12,000 persons in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland around 70 years of age. I take it 
               <br />
               that not more than 5% of these would be living in 
               <br />
               rented homes. The ﬁrst qualiﬁcation on the ap- 
               <br />
               plication, or the means test, that is given to these 
               <br />
               men, would be that they could not at any time 
               <br />
               during the period when they would be receiving 
               <br />
               old age pensions assign or transfer their property 
               <br />
               to their heirs or successors, in order to evade 
               <br />
               having the state come in eventually and take their 
               <br />
               property for the amount of pension they have 
               <br />
               received. Now in my time I have filled out, 
               <br />
               without exaggeration, anwhere from 40 to 50 old 
               <br />
               age pension forms for people, and while Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood was explaining this clause my 
               <br />
               thoughts were going back to thees people. I can 
               <br />
               think of them at this moment almost by name, in 
               <br />
               the past 30 years or around there, and I have been 
               <br />
               at various time in various communities, and I can 
               <br />
               say without fear of contradiction that I have never 
               <br />
               signed an old age pension form without having it 
               <br />
               go through. Now if any of these men had to 
               <br />
               submit to the means test, as I understand it 
               <br />
               think of one individual who would today be 
               <br />
               receiving his old age pension. For the simple fact 
               <br />
               is that if they knew, or his sons, married or single 
               <br />
               knew, that when poor old dad reaches 72 or 75

               <br />

               <br />
               pension he received, to begin with they would not 
               <br />
               allow him to accept his old age pension. If these 
               <br />
               old age pensioners knew that that was going to

               <br />
               Mr. Vardy Of course it depends also on the 
               <br />
               value that would be put on the property in the 
               <br />
               outports. For instance a humble little home of two 
               <br />
               stories 20 x30 and so on, in the city of St. John’s 
               <br />
               would be valued at around <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$34,000</span> probably, 
               <br />
               whereas the same home in the outports would be

               <br />
               in Newfoundland, on a forced sale, has to be quite 
               <br />
               a good property. And I take it also that the 
               <br />
               auditors would give the applicant for the old age 
               <br />
               pension the benefit of the doubt. No one would 
               <br />
               be incline to over-estimate the value of any 
               <br />
               property, but...

               Mr. Vardy I honestly feel that there would be

               a very limited number under these conditions in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland qualiﬁed for, or even applying for 
               <br />
               the old age pension. The feeling exists in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, rightly or wrongly, among the old, 
               <br />
               aged ﬁshermen, that when they reach the age of 
               <br />
               75 years, even though they have a few dollars in 
               <br />

               <br />
               the ﬁshing gear and go about their way to make

               their living, that they should get the old age
