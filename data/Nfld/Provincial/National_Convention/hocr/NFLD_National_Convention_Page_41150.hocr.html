               <br />
               today, active agents whose business and object is 
               <br />
               to usher Newfoundland into confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada, and to induce our people to walk into the 
               <br />
               trap which has been baited. The outward 
               <br />
               evidence of the activities of these pro-con- 
               <br />
               federate agents is shown in the foisting of this 
               <br />
               Convention upon us, so that the agreement made 
               <br />
               with the Newfoundland government in 1933 
               <br />
               could be evaded. It is shown in the act of export— 
               <br />
               ing from this country a great portion of the 
               <br />
               people’s treasury; in the reckless and deliberate 
               <br />
               squandering of our revenues to the tune of $40 
               <br />
               million a year; in the giving away of reckless 
               <br />
               concessions, and under disgraceful conditions, of 
               <br />
               our Labrador territory. It is evidenced by the false 
               <br />
               pictures of the ﬁctitious prosperity which would 
               <br />
               be ours if we have confederation. It is shown by 
               <br />
               the actions of members of the Ottawa delegation, 
               <br />
               who in collaboration with the Canadian govem- 
               <br />
               ment, cooked up and brought back to us false 
               <br />
               estimates and misleading statements; by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex«</span> 
               <br />
               istence of secret documents given to that delega- 
               <br />
               tion and the failure to produce them before this 
               <br />
               Convention; by the circumstances under which 
               <br />
               the Canadian delegation was elected. All these 
               <br />
               things indicate to me at least beyond all doubt, 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland today is being conspired 
               <br />
               against from all sides. And if there was any doubt 
               <br />
               on this score, it must be dismissed when we see 
               <br />
               that the business of negotiating us into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion has been entrusted to a body such as this, 
               <br />
               which has no power to negotiate, no power to 
               <br />
               speak for the people, which in the last analysis 
               <br />
               has neither the knowledge, the experience, nor 
               <br />
               the qualiﬁcations to pass on this matter, a matter 
               <br />
               which any sensible person knows is one for a 
               <br />
               properly constituted and elected government. 
               <br />
               This whole business is not alone illegal, it is 
               <br />
               worse, it is immoral.

               I would ask you to believe me when I say that

               Ihave not said these things merely to make a case 
               <br />
               for responsible government, or because I am 
               <br />
               against confederation with Canada. I have made 
               <br />

               beguiling phrases nothing less than an invitation

               Now I realise that some people may not agree 
               <br />
               with me. They may see, or think they see, bright

               prospects for us under confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada. I cannot ﬁnd it in my mind to judge them 
               <br />
               too harshly. For out of the political muddle which 
               <br />
               has been purposely created in this country, how 
               <br />
               can we expect the average man or woman to 
               <br />
               know what it is all about, when we, who have 
               <br />
               been close to the picture for over 16 months, are 
               <br />
               still looking for information? It is because I am 
               <br />
               aware of this bewilderment on the part of our 
               <br />
               people, that I feel it my duty to take upon myself 
               <br />
               the obligation of advising them to the best of my 
               <br />
               ability as to the road I think we should pursue.

               To those who, like myself, recognise the fact 
               <br />
               that the only proper and decent course open to us 
               <br />
               is to become masters in our own house, no further 
               <br />
               words of mine are necessary. But to those who 
               <br />
               may be beguiled to any degree by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederav</span>

               new steps. Do not consider any negotiations until,

               as a ﬁrst step, you have a duly audiorised govern- 
               <br />
               ment of your own to consider the whole matter. 
               <br />
               Any other course is sheer political madness. That 
               <br />
               is my solemn advice to you. Whether you take it 
               <br />
               or not rests with yourselves. And if we delegates 
               <br />
               have failed to carry that one message to the 
               <br />
               people who sent us here, then I say we have failed 
               <br />
               dismally in our duty.

               In closing I would ask your permission to 
               <br />
               express a purely personal opinion. I am con- 
               <br />
               vinced that although our country and our people 
               <br />
               are at present enshrouded in a pall of political 
               <br />
               darkness, they will eventually ﬁnd their way into 
               <br />
               the light. This whole matter of bribes and 
               <br />
               promises will in the end be shown up for what it 
               <br />
               really is. And I say this not because our people 
               <br />
               would shrink from the new burden of taxation 
               <br />
               which confederation with Canada will place on 
               <br />
               their shoulders, not because of the vision of the 
               <br />
               thousands of homesteads which may have to be 
               <br />
               sold to satisfy the Canadian tax gatherers. No. It 
               <br />
               will not be for these things alone, that our people 
               <br />
               will spum this offer for them to sell out the land 
               <br />
               of their birth. I say our people will win through 
               <br />
               because of other, greater things. They will tri—

               still in this country such things as pride, courage
