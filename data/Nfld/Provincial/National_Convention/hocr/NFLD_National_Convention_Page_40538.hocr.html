               Mr. Chairman This communication is now 
               <br />
               before you, gentlemen. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I presume the intention of this let- 
               <br />
               ter is that the Corporation wishes to know the 
               <br />
               feelings of the Convention with respect to broad- 
               <br />

               <br />
               broadcasting of the debates be continued or not. 
               <br />
               Speaking for myself, I am sorry that it happened 
               <br />
               at the beginning, butnow that it is here and people 
               <br />
               have been listening in as fully as we feel they 
               <br />
               have been, it might be rather regrettable if it were 
               <br />
               discontinued at this stage. 
               <br />
               Mr. Roddy I concur with Mr. Higgins. 
               <br />
               Mr. Starkes I agree with Mr. Higgins. The 
               <br />
               people in the outports have no chance whatever 
               <br />
               to hear the proceedings of the Convention as far 
               <br />
               as newspapers are concerned. The people in 
               <br />
               St. John’s have the daily papers, but the people 
               <br />
               in the outports, if they can’t listen in, have no 
               <br />
               means of hearing it.

               Mr. Miller Our duty here is to survey

               <br />
               must sometimes be ruthless. We must go without 
               <br />
               regard to the law. We are not always going to be 
               <br />

               <br />
               give the public this information, or are we going

               to forfeit half the issue as far as Newfoundland is

               limited and restricted, or will it be better that we 
               <br />
               disregard that? We will be at a loss, too, if we

               <br />
               job if we disregard that and go into the situation 
               <br />
               deeply and having fully explored it all, then give

               Mr. Hollett I notice some remarks have been 
               <br />
               made about one of the remarks of a certain mem- 
               <br />
               ber of this Convention yesterday. I don’t exactly 
               <br />
               know what these references were, but I do know 
               <br />
               this: that this Convention was deﬁnitely referred 
               <br />
               to yesterday as a debating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">society.</span> If we are 
               <br />
               purely and simply a debating society, I think there 
               <br />
               is very little room for these microphones here. 
               <br />
               That came up, as I remember, in a discussion on 
               <br />
               the matter of privilege. We were compared to a 
               <br />
               debating society, and had no more privilege than 
               <br />
               that. I feel that the presence of the microphones 
               <br />
               very certainly informs the general public as to the 
               <br />
               proceedings that have taken place. I do feel, 
               <br />
               however, that there are occasions when it would 
               <br />
               be wise that the prior discussion of certain mat- 
               <br />
               ters, at any rate, should not go out over the air, 
               <br />
               but merely the decision arrived at by the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion by a discussion which, in some cases, might 
               <br />
               possibly be heated. I don’t think that is conducive
