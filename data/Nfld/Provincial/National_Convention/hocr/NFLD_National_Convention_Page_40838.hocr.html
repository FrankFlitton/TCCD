               I think it is timely to refer to the much—dis- 
               <br />
               cussed base deal. I regard this deal as the most 
               <br />
               far-reaching, and as far as we are concerned the 
               <br />
               most deplorable of all the acts perpetrated in our 
               <br />
               name by the Commission of Government. 1 refer 
               <br />
               to the negotiations which they conducted with the 
               <br />
               British and American governments, whereby the 
               <br />
               sovereignty of Newfoundland territories was 
               <br />
               given over to a foreign power under terms which 
               <br />
               amount to an absolute assignment and forfeiture 
               <br />
               of all our rights of ownership and administration 
               <br />
               into and over these particular parts of our country. 
               <br />
               We were never told then and we do not know 
               <br />
               today, the circumstances and conditions under 
               <br />
               which Newfoundland territory was placed under 
               <br />
               a foreign ﬂag. But those who come after us will 
               <br />
               look upon this deal as the most shameful and 
               <br />
               traitorous act which has ever stained the pages of 
               <br />
               our history. For by that act there was taken, I 
               <br />
               might almost say stolen from us, something so 
               <br />
               priceless that other men and other nations have 
               <br />
               not hesitated to defend it with the last drop of their 
               <br />
               blood. It is a truly pathetic spectacle to read the 
               <br />
               story of that time, when Mr. Emerson and Mr. J.

               I hold, Mr. Chairman, that if proper steps had 
               <br />
               been taken at that time, the national debt of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would have been cancelled by 
               <br />
               Great Britain, and Newfoundland would have 
               <br />
               arranged and even demanded favourable trade 
               <br />
               concessions for her ﬁshery products from the 
               <br />
               USA. But what happened? The United States was 
               <br />
               given the strategic bases it required, and Great 
               <br />
               Britain received material help in return for these 
               <br />
               bases from the United States. Newfoundland 
               <br />
               received nothing, unless we are to regard as a 
               <br />
               favour the monies which Uncle Sam was com- 
               <br />
               pelled to spend here for the erection of these 
               <br />
               bases. But even in this case the beneﬁts we reaped 
               <br />
               were restricted ones, inasmuch as they were 
               <br />
               restricted upon the direct or indirect instructions 
               <br />
               of the Commission government, which advised 
               <br />
               the American contractors not to pay New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders the same rates of pay as those paid 
               <br />
               to either Canadians or Americans. The result of 
               <br />
               this infamous measure was that it was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uncom“</span>

               <br />
               similar work, just as efﬁciently as the Canadian

               instances not more than half the wages of these
