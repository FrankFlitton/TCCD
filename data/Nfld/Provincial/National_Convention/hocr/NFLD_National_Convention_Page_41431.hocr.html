               <br />
               complete picture of the real position. Indeed, for 
               <br />
               myself, I find them more remarkable for what

               <br />

               <br />
               Chairman, I regard them as an insult to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intel‘</span> 
               <br />
               ligence of this Convention, and a reﬂection on the 
               <br />
               sound common sense of all the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland.

               I have said, sir, that these terms are more 
               <br />
               remarkable for what they do not tell us than for 
               <br />
               what they do, and the glaring instance of this is 
               <br />
               given in the manner in which they deal with 
               <br />
               taxation. Some weeks ago I told this Convention 
               <br />
               that in the event of confederation with Canada the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland had better get out of 
               <br />
               their heads any idea that we were going to get 
               <br />
               lower taxation. I went further, and I said that 
               <br />
               instead of any decrease in taxation we would 
               <br />
               suffer from even a higher and much more oppres- 
               <br />
               sive burden under confederation. We have all 
               <br />
               witnessed Mr. Smallwood’s failure to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfae</span> 
               <br />
               torily balance the budget which he brought in 
               <br />
               here some weeks ago —— his own personal budget, 
               <br />
               made to order, which contains his own chosen 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. Now I ask you, when this budget could 
               <br />
               not be balanced even in theory, how can we 
               <br />
               expect to measure up when the real thing comes 
               <br />
               along? And remember too, that in addition to this 
               <br />
               provincial budget we will have to pay, I say have 
               <br />
               to pay, our deﬁnite share of taxation to the federal 
               <br />
               government. In commenting on this matter I es— 
               <br />
               timated that the people of Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               be called upon to ﬁnd a total annual sum for 
               <br />
               taxation of nearly $80 million annually. I said 
               <br />
               that some weeks ago, and I am still waiting for 
               <br />
               someone to prove to me that my estimate was not 
               <br />
               correct. I have heard, as you have heard, pro—con- 
               <br />
               federates make somewhat feeble attempts to in— 
               <br />
               dicate how our provincial budget might be 
               <br />
               balanced, but not one of them gave us a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfac»</span>

               tory answer. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood indeed seems to

               <br />
               capital and labour depend upon each other for 
               <br />
               existence. I know and you know, that without the 
               <br />
               so-called capitalists the great United States 
               <br />
               would not be where she is today. Canada, the 
               <br />
               much vaunted Canada, had her resources 
               <br />
               developed and her railways constructed, and their 
               <br />
               country opened up only through and with the 
               <br />
               driving power of capitalism, and the same thing 
               <br />
               applies to the British Empire, and if we look at 
               <br />
               our history we ﬁnd that the same thing applies to 
               <br />
               this country. I know and you know, that today the 
               <br />
               country which is the envy of all the world, whose 
               <br />
               people enjoy the highest standard of living, is also 
               <br />
               the country which has the greatest number of rich 
               <br />
               individuals per square mile than any country on 
               <br />
               earth. Must we put two and two together? Do we 
               <br />
               not also know what happened to those countries 
               <br />
               in which agitators arose to turn the people of the 
               <br />
               country against those possessing money? Yes, 
               <br />
               these people destroyed the capitalists, but at the 
               <br />
               same time they destroyed their own country — a 
               <br />
               Hitler, a Mussolini, and a Stalin replaced the 
               <br />
               banker and industrialist and the merchant. Would 
               <br />
               anyone want that sort of thing to happen here?

               <br />

               organisations of this country, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               who built the factories, the men who started new 
               <br />
               industries, the men who employ thousands of our 
               <br />

               reasonable attacks on these people on Friday, I 
               <br />
