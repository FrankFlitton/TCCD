               <br />
               Some 14 months ago we were sent here by the 
               <br />
               people of this country as their representatives. 
               <br />
               For what? To try and ﬁnd out the true condition 
               <br />
               of our island home. We started, and after a day or 
               <br />
               two a monkey wrench was thrown in. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedera~</span> 
               <br />
               tion came on the scene. What happened? Con- 
               <br />
               fusion has reigned ever since. That is the sum and 
               <br />
               substance of this Convention today.

               Mr. Northcott We were sent here to see if our 
               <br />
               island home is self-supporting or not. We have 
               <br />
               not got anywhere. After we came here we realised 
               <br />
               our task was immense. Committees were set up 
               <br />
               to try to ascertain the true facts of our economy, 
               <br />
               and whether our country was self-supporting or 
               <br />
               not. Mr. Chairman, for months we worked in 
               <br />
               committees, and after many months we brought 
               <br />
               here the various reports. They were approved, 
               <br />
               debated, and 45 or 44 members okayed each 
               <br />
               report in its turn. And so, by piecing together 
               <br />
               these various reports, did we not piece together 
               <br />
               at the same time the Economic Report? If we did 
               <br />
               not, it does not make sense... They became law, 
               <br />
               as it were.

               I am absolutely satisfied that if ever this country 
               <br />
               was self-supporting it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selﬁsupporting</span> today.

               When one can pay his bills he or she is solvent. 
               <br />
               The same can be said of this country. If we can 
               <br />
               balance our budget and have a surplus left we are 
               <br />
               financially sound, and Newfoundland today is 
               <br />
               just that. I wish to refer you to page 5 of the 
               <br />
               Economic Report. Unfortunately Major Cashin is 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman I would say that if you have any

               questions, it has been decided by the Steering

               Mr. Northcott You mean all the questions, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman? Thank you. That will cut my time 
               <br />
               pretty short... The ﬁrst I was going to ask was 
               <br />
               this: page 5: “In 1930 an approach was made to 
               <br />
               the Canadian government with respect to the 
               <br />
               payment of a subsidy in connection with the 
               <br />
               operation of our ship on the Gulf service." I was 
               <br />
               wondering if Major Cashin took that matter up 
               <br />
               with the Commission of Government, as to why 
               <br />
               there was no subsidy given since 1933. The 
               <br />
               second one was in connection with Gander.... I 
               <br />
               was wondering if the Committee could ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               how many millions of gallons of aviation gas was 
               <br />
               hauled from Lewisporte to Gander during the 
               <br />
               year 1946? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hickman The answer is no, Mr. Northcott. 
               <br />
               Mr. Northcott Some ten million gallons. If they 
               <br />
               got one cent a gallon it would increase the 
               <br />
               revenue of the country. I may say though, that 
               <br />
               there is no duty on aviation gasoline, and I can’t 
               <br />
               see why it should not be. It is very sensible and 
               <br />
               important to this country, especially when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fisher»</span> 
               <br />
               men have to pay high taxes on their gasoline... 
               <br />
               Mr. Spencer 1 have no desire to spend much 
               <br />
               time in debating this Economic Report, but I am 
               <br />
               convinced that this committee of the whole is the 
               <br />
               place to speak of it. There can be no doubt that 
               <br />
               we are at the moment in a sound ﬁnancial condi- 
               <br />
               tion, due in large part to the boom of prosperity
