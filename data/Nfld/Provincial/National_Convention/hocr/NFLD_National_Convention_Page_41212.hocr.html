               <br />
               thing I do know. If Major Cashin can convince 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland that the British 
               <br />
               government and the Commission government 
               <br />
               believe in confederation, if he can convince our

               people that the British government and the Com-

               <br />

               <br />
               now that I hope with all my heart that Major 
               <br />

               At several points Major Cashin compared our 
               <br />
               railway with Canada’s superb and world-famous 
               <br />
               transportation system. Mr. Chairman, didn’t he 
               <br />
               realise that there’s something comical about 
               <br />
               comparing our 600 miles with Canada‘s tens of 
               <br />
               thousands of miles of railways which happen to 
               <br />
               be amongst the very ﬁnest railways in the whole 
               <br />
               world? He spent practically an hour here telling 
               <br />
               us of the hundreds of millions and the thousands 
               <br />
               of millions of dollars that Canada’s government 
               <br />

               <br />
               then we won’t want to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out“.</span> If we find it a

               bad thing, we cannot be kept in. We cannot be 
               <br />
               kept in against our will. There are nine provinces 
               <br />
               in the Canadian union, four of them came in in 
               <br />
               1867, one in 1869, one in 1871, another in 1873, 
               <br />
               and two of them in 1905. Not one, not one of these 
               <br />
               provinces has ever tried to get out. No province 
               <br />
               can be forced into confederation and no province 
               <br />
               can be forced to stay in against its will. All right, 
               <br />
               let’s look at that for a moment. It’s quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impora</span> 
               <br />
               tant. Let us say that in the referendum our people 
               <br />
               vote for confederation and that we become a 
               <br />
               province of Canada. Let us say that after ten or 
               <br />
               15 years or 20 or 30 years we don’t like it.... What 
               <br />
               can we do about it? Can Canada force us to stay 
               <br />
               in against our will? Can’t we get out if we want 
               <br />
               to get out? Of course we can get out. We’ve got 
               <br />
               to want to get out. It’s not enough for half a dozen 
               <br />
               people to want to get out. You have in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia today one man, at least one man, who 
               <br />
               thinks Nova Scotia should get out. And on July 1 
               <br />
               every year, which is Dominion Day, the ﬁrst day 
               <br />

               <br />
               out. It’s not enough for ten men. It’s not enough 
               <br />
               for 50% of the people. But if the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span>

               <br />
               if we want to get out. Just in the same way that 
               <br />
