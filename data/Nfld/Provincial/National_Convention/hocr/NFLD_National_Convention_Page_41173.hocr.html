               In the debate on old age pensions the ﬁrst big 
               <br />
               ﬂaw in the Black Books came to light. The ﬁgure 
               <br />
               set down by the Ottawa delegation for old age 
               <br />
               pensions to be paid in the province was $510,000. 
               <br />
               In the debate, Mr. Smallwood said the ﬁgure 
               <br />
               would be increased to $750,000, and actually it 
               <br />
               was ﬁnally concluded it would be $900,000. This 
               <br />
               the province would have to find —— almost a 
               <br />
               million dollars, almost twice the amount the 
               <br />
               delegation ﬁrst supposed. The $64 question is, 
               <br />
               will the province be able to pay it? Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as a province could pay her old age pensioners 
               <br />
               what she liked; $100 a month if she could afford 
               <br />
               it, if she could raise the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money,</span> There are a lot of 
               <br />
               ifs in this business, Mr. Chairman — too many 
               <br />
               ifs, ands, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buts.</span> It is too theoretical, too vague. 
               <br />
               We have to take too much on spec for my liking, 
               <br />
               and with all due respect for Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               integrity, too much on his word.

               <br />
               $72 million, so the Railway ofﬁcials say. And 
               <br />
               even if it is only worth $50 million, it is still a lot 
               <br />
               of valuable property. It has been roughly com- 
               <br />
               puted that the public utilities value that Canada 
               <br />

               <br />
               up; and it is a mighty big item of generosity to 
               <br />
               hand this over lock, stock and barrel to the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada for nothing. If the seven

               <br />
               demanded some lump sum payment for the hand-

               <br />
               that; that would be negotiating. And here is 
               <br />
               another $64 question -— who did the negotiating? 
               <br />

               Now, about the Railway under confederation. 
               <br />
               Under the Canadian National Railway, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood read something from the Black Book 
               <br />
               that says nothing about the Railway employees. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins came in the next day with the 
               <br />
               minutes of a meeting, which word for word was 
               <br />
               the same as that found in the Black Book, volume 
               <br />
               2, with a signiﬁcant exception. When this oc- 
               <br />
               curred —— members were apparently letting it pass 
               <br />
               —— I raised a question which was to the effect that 
               <br />
               it seemed the delegation was in possession of 
               <br />
               information that the Convention was denied. I 
               <br />
               had no inkling it would start a 70 minute debate, 
               <br />
               butI soon saw I had touched on a sore point. From 
               <br />
               the trend the debate has taken all through it seems 
               <br />
               there are many sore points. Taxation is certainly 
               <br />
               one. Notwithstanding Mr. Smallwood’s declared 
               <br />
               eagerness to come to grips with this fascinating 
               <br />
               subject before Christmas, the truth of it is that it 
               <br />
               was scarcely touched on until last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">week,</span> It has 
               <br />
               been continuously shelved since the debate 
               <br />
               began on November 20 or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">earlier.</span> Sometimes the 
               <br />
               Black Books are ofﬁcial, sometimes unofﬁcial. 
               <br />
               On the matter of the employees of the Railway 
               <br />
               under Canadian National, Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               claim is that this inferred reduction of staff is not 
               <br />
               in the Black Books, ergo it is unimportant. I 
               <br />
               cannot accept this view. These statements are 
               <br />
               there in black and white in the ﬁles at Ottawa, and 
               <br />
               if it is produced and acted on when the tenth 
               <br />
               province is sworn in, then what kind of an argu- 
               <br />
               ment is it to say, “It is not in the Black Books”? 
               <br />
               The ofﬁcials will say it is not in the terms either, 
               <br />
               that these people should be kept on. And what can 
               <br />
               we say? And that goes for more than the Railway. 
               <br />
               Then Newfoundlanders are supposed to continue 
               <br />
               to run the Railway. Why? Because the Canadian 
               <br />
               Civil Service Act says, “Employees must be 
               <br />
               citizens of the province”. But it is stated in the 
               <br />
               Black Book that administration goes to regional 
               <br />
               headquarters at Moncton. Who employs who, 
               <br />
               then? Do Newfoundlanders go up to Moncton to 
               <br />
               run the Railway, or do the New Brunswick 
               <br />
               people run it? Or does Ottawa send down men to 
               <br />
               keep New Brunswick and Newfoundland from 
               <br />
               each other’s throats? Note well in this regard, 
               <br />
               what of the Housing Association with its regional 
               <br />
               ofﬁce somewhere in the Maritimes — does the 
               <br />
               same hold? I ask you in all seriousness, what are 
               <br />
               we expected to suppose?
