               <br />
               happened to Newfoundland in the years past. We

               ves. We elected men and sent them to the House

               of Assembly and promptly forgot them for four 
               <br />
               years. And another crowd came along and said, 
               <br />
               “What about electing me?" And they elected 
               <br />
               them, to forget them again. You have to get

               Representative assemblies are often Charged

               with being places of mere talking. With regard to

               <br />
               interest of the country, and every sentence of it 
               <br />
