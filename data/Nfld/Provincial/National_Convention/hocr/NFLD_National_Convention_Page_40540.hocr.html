               I have been accused of talking too much. Like 
               <br />
               my friend Major Cashin and Mr. Hollett and 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey and Mr. Fudge and other gentlemen 
               <br />
               here, perhaps I talk too much. As a matter of fact 
               <br />
               I doubt it. I think that’s what we were sent here 
               <br />
               for -— to talk, and think, and study, and carry on 
               <br />
               research, and then talk, so that the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear,</span> Not just talk nonsense, 
               <br />
               but talk about our reports. Ten gentlemen here 
               <br />
               were appointed as a Finance Committee They 
               <br />
               have spent months digging up the facts about this 
               <br />
               country’s ﬁnances for many year past. Major 
               <br />
               Cashin turned in a splendid job here the other day, 
               <br />
               reading that report. What is the good of doing all 
               <br />
               that work, if it is not debated and broadcast for 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland? Take this mag-

               nificent report of the Mining Committee. The like 
               <br />

               <br />
               history of this country, and I have readjust about 
               <br />
               everything published on mining in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. What is the good of it, if the people 
               <br />
               can’t hear the debate?

               While I am at it, Mr. Chairman, I don’t think

               the people of this country owe any gratitude to 
               <br />

               <br />
               do anything. We can only study out our reports 
               <br />
               and come in here and debate them. We debate the 
               <br />
               reports so that the people of Newfoundland will 
               <br />
               know what is going on. There is one other thing. 
               <br />
               An old friend of mine in Elliston, Simeon Tucker, 
               <br />
               a ﬁsherman since he was born almost, was in 
               <br />
               town the other day, and he said, ”Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               what we can’t understand in Elliston is this: the 
               <br />
               way you fellows there in the Convention cross- 
               <br />
               hacklel each other." That’s an outport expres- 
               <br />
               sion, but they forget two things, ﬁrst that the 
               <br />
               Governor, the day he opened this Convention, 
               <br />
               prophesied for us as an old-timer himself in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons, he said this, “Now, 
               <br />
               gentlemen, you will do your work and make your 
               <br />
               studies, and your feelings will run high some- 
               <br />
               times, and when men's feelings run deep their 
               <br />
               language will sometimes become a bit heated, 
               <br />
               and they will be a bit excited”. Save me from the 
               <br />
               cold-blooded brute whose feelings can’t get 
               <br />
               worked up, and a man who can’t express himself, 
               <br />
               or does not express himself with heat and en- 
               <br />
               thusiasm. I would not trust him. Give me a man 
               <br />
               like Major Cashin or Mr. Higgins, or Mr. Bailey 
               <br />
               or myself, a man that feels a thing in his heart and 
               <br />
               gets up and says it. But now the people of the 
               <br />
               country are not used to that. What do they think 
               <br />
               the House of Assembly was — a Sunday school, 
               <br />
               where everybody got up and bowed and scraped 
               <br />
               and never lost theirtempers? Oh no! Is the House 
               <br />
               of Commons a Sunday school? Oh no! A man 
               <br />
               whose name commands respect in this world, the 
               <br />
               Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, I myself saw 
               <br />
               Mr. Churchill in the House of Commons take up 
               <br />
               a book in a row that was going on, take up a book 
               <br />
               and ﬂing it across the floor at another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man,</span> He 
               <br />
               was good and excited...
