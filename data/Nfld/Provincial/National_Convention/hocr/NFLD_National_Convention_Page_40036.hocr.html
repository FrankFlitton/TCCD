               We delegates have been appointed by the men

               and women of Newfoundland to meet here to 
               <br />
               review our past, study our present and, as far as 
               <br />
               humanly possible, to plan for our future. It is a 
               <br />
               great task, a great responsibility, but at the same 
               <br />
               time, let us ever remember, it is also a great 
               <br />
               privilege. To us has been given the sacred and 
               <br />
               solemn duty of performing a truly patriotic ser- 
               <br />
               vice — helping to shape the destinies of our 
               <br />
               country for possibly 100 years. It should then be 
               <br />
               unnecessary for me to stress the importance of 
               <br />
               our approaching the task in a proper spirit —-

               <br />
               able, and to get these facts, no matter how deep 
               <br />
               we may have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dig.</span> We must not hesitate to stand 
               <br />
               solidly behind what is just and right, and be 
               <br />
               equally ready to condemn whatever is wrong, 
               <br />
               regardless of the source from which that wrong 
               <br />
               emanates, and no matter whom the wrongdoers 
               <br />
               may be. Newfoundlanders have always been 
               <br />
               noted for their courage and love of justice. Let us 
               <br />
               then show to the country and to the outside world 
               <br />
               that we, in this time of crisis, are not lacking these 
               <br />
               same qualities.

               As regards this Convention itself, i should like 
               <br />
               to repeat what I have so often said in the past, that 
               <br />
               I am not and have never been a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supporter</span> of this 
               <br />
               whole set-up which is absolutely contrary to the 
               <br />
               pledge made to this country by the British 
               <br />
               government in December, 1933. Everyone 
               <br />
               present knows that under the terms of that agree- 
               <br />
               ment we were specifically and categorically 
               <br />
               promised the return of responsible government 
               <br />
               upon our becoming self-supporting, which state 
               <br />
               we reached, according to the Dominions 
               <br />
               Secretary himself, in the year 1941. No one has 
               <br />
               yet come forward to give us the reason why this 
               <br />
               pledge was ignored, and why we were offered 
               <br />
               this Convention as a substitute. We know that in 
               <br />
               that international pact, there is no mention of 
               <br />
               conventions or plebiscites and the introduction of 
               <br />
               these foreign issues is wholly contrary to the 
               <br />
               spirit and letter of that agreement. How can I, how 
               <br />
               can any thinking Newfoundlander, honestly and 
               <br />
               conscientiously give his moral support and en— 
               <br />
               dorsement to a thing which is not alone illegal, 
               <br />
               but even ethically improper? Therefore, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, if we are to view this Convention 
               <br />
               in its right perspective, we must accept the fact 
               <br />
               of its fundamental illegality. And in reference to 
               <br />
               this point, permit me to give you some extracts

               “It is important that a series of reconstruction

               <br />
               will be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. The

               Now, Mr. Chairman, is not this a most extraor- 
               <br />
               dinary statement for Mr. Attlee to make. On the 
               <br />
               one hand, he talks about letting Newfoundland 
               <br />
               hold 3 Convention to decide what form of 
               <br />
               government the people want, and in the next 
               <br />
               breath coolly telling the world that regardless of 
               <br />
               what the people of Newfoundland may want, 
               <br />
               regardless of any political aspirations they may

               be, he intends to enforce Commission rule on

               Newfoundland for another three years and during 
               <br />
               that time to carry out his own special plans with 
               <br />
               regard to our country. If this is so, what is the 
               <br />
               sense of our being here at all, going through these 
               <br />
               legislative gestures? Why not save ourselves and 
               <br />
               the country all this trouble and expense and wait 
               <br />
               until Mr. Attlee has completed whatever 
               <br />
               schemes he has in mind for our country, in the 
               <br />
               working out of which, apparently, no New- 
               <br />
               foundlander shall have part? Does it not simply 
               <br />
               bear out what I have said time and time again, that 
               <br />
               this whole convention and plebiscite scheme 
               <br />
               dressed up in the trappings of democracy is noth- 
               <br />
               ing more or less than a glorified stall. I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that in drawing up his three-year 
               <br />
               programme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrr</span> Attlee has been influenced and 
               <br />
               enthusiastically abetted by the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commis~</span> 
               <br />
               sioners, who must have stressed the necessity of 
               <br />
               retaining their indispensible services. I should 
               <br />
               like to make it clear I am not speaking with any 
               <br />
               idea of making political capital, or placing un-
