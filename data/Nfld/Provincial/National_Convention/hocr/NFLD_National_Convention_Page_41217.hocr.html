               On that point I would direct your attention to 
               <br />
               Sir Erskine May, pages <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">45051,</span> in which he 
               <br />
               points out that the Chair should intervene in a 
               <br />
               closure motion where it is felt that it is an abuse 
               <br />
               of the rules of the house or infringes on the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority, and in the discharge of this duty 
               <br />
               the discretion of the Chair is absolute, and is not 
               <br />
               open to dispute. There is no appeal to the House 
               <br />
               on that point. As you are fully aware, it is purely 
               <br />
               a guillotine or kniﬁng-off procedure, which is 
               <br />
               calculated to knife off and shut off debate when 
               <br />
               put and carried. Now, I should direct your atten— 
               <br />
               tion to the fact that I got notice of this motion on 
               <br />
               Friday afternoon. Of course, Saturday and Sun— 
               <br />
               day we were not sitting, and it therefore meant 
               <br />
               that I received notion of it two clear days ago. In 
               <br />
               further View of the fact that my attention has been 
               <br />
               drawn to the desire of some members to speak, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins, on this business, who have been 
               <br />
               prevented by illness and transportation and other 
               <br />
               defects from attending, and who therefore have 
               <br />
               not had an opportunity of addressing themselves 
               <br />
               on the business in question, I feel that a closure 
               <br />
               motion ought not to be put at this time... There 
               <br />
               must come a time when the responsibility for 
               <br />
               accepting this motion will rest with the House 
               <br />
               my tentative opinion is that I will in all prob- 
               <br />
               ability put the motion at the beginning of Friday 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins I don’t mind, sir. It is not my inten- 
               <br />
               tion to close off the debate today, but it would be 
               <br />
               fair to ask you if the members speaking after Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood would conclude before Friday, and 
               <br />
               then you would be prepared to put it at that time. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Oh, quite deﬁnitely. You will 
               <br />
               recall that I assured Mr. Smallwood that he would 
               <br />
               be given the opportunity of replying once before 
               <br />
               the debate on the business terminated. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is now availing himself of that right. 
               <br />
               In addition to that there are other members who 
               <br />
               have not spoken, and I feel that a reasonable time 
               <br />
               should be given after the motion reaches me. As 
               <br />
               far as I know it is the desire of this Convention to 
               <br />
               complete its work by the 3 1 st of this month and 
               <br />
               if we are to deal with the rest of the business on 
               <br />
               the order paper it follows that a decent interval 
               <br />
               between the debate now before the Chair and the 
               <br />
               3lst of the month must necessarily be preserved; 
               <br />
               therefore the proposal of a closure motion at this 
               <br />
               time is not improper, in fact it is quite proper. The 
               <br />
               only thing we have to make sure of is that it is not 
               <br />
               jumped on any members that may be absent. The 
               <br />
               motion is quite fair, and I think the house will 
               <br />
               agree that in deferring it until Friday members are 
               <br />
               quite well informed in this respect and it cannot 
               <br />
               be argued that they had no opportunity.
