               Mr. Bradley This discussion is a debate upon 
               <br />
               the economic position of Newfoundland, and in 
               <br />
               view of its irregular and somewhat wandering 
               <br />
               development, it may be well to remind ourselves 
               <br />
               of what it is not, as well as of its true and only 
               <br />
               useful purpose.

               It would seem clear it is in no way concerned 
               <br />
               with forms of government, or with the merits or 
               <br />
               demerits of any such form, for these things lie in 
               <br />
               the future. At the referendum our people will 
               <br />
               have to select some form of government to apply 
               <br />
               to our economy. They will need all the informa— 
               <br />
               tion obtainable about that economy to reach a 
               <br />
               sound decision. Surely then, our ﬁrst and only 
               <br />
               duty in this discussion is to ascertain what that 
               <br />
               economy is, how it has developed, whether it is 
               <br />
               satisfactory or not, and what degree of stability it 
               <br />
               possesses. Equally certain it is that efforts to 
               <br />
               advance the cause of any form of future govem- 
               <br />
               ment to which we may be partial, or to abuse a 
               <br />
               form which we dislike, are not only highly im- 
               <br />
               proper, but tend to confuse the real issue, and 
               <br />
               render the whole issue completely worthless. 
               <br />
               Anger, and a display of party spirit, exclude calm 
               <br />
               analysis and destroy sound judgement. Smart 
               <br />
               jibes and sly innuendoes shot into the debate in 
               <br />
               an effort to secure a hit against some form of 
               <br />
               government which we dislike, and made in the 
               <br />
               face of the Chairman’s ruling, cause the whole 
               <br />
               discussion to degenerate into a partisan conten- 
               <br />
               tion. When such a situation arises, and we cannot 
               <br />
               deny it has done so on more than one occasion, 
               <br />
               the Convention departs entirely from the only 
               <br />
               purpose for which it exists, and for which the 
               <br />
               people sent us here. The thing becomes a gather- 
               <br />
               ing of warring political partisans, each bent upon 
               <br />
               advancing the cause dearest to his own heart, and 
               <br />
               completely incapable of forming any sound 
               <br />
               judgement on questions which may arise In a 
               <br />
               battle between the mind and the heart, sir, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly when opposition intensiﬁes enthusiasm, 
               <br />
               often to the point of antagonism, the mind never 
               <br />
               wins. To that impasse I fear this Convention has, 
               <br />
               on more than one occasion, deteriorated We 
               <br />
               have lost sight of our duty to discover and inform 
               <br />
               the people of cold facts, and have developed into 
               <br />
               standard-bearers of one or other particular form 
               <br />
               of future government.

               have ceased to be one body in search of truth, and

               be abundantly clear to every one of us by this

               much justiﬁed criticism from John Citizen who 
               <br />
               is in search of truth, and conﬁdence in us has 
               <br />
               failed. As a body there remain to us but a few 
               <br />
               short weeks ofcxistence. Only in one way can we

               hope to recover that conﬁdence, to be of any real

               it is remarkable for the rosy hues in which it

               timism with which it envisions a New Jerusalem 
               <br />
               for our future. it is full of fair ﬁgures and happy

               hopes.
