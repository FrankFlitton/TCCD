               would seem that we have entered upon a new

               on ﬁrst-hand knowledge of this phase of the

               ﬁshery is so shot to pieces that the individual

               fisherman at this moment is just one shortjump 
               <br />
               ahead of the dole, and if there is to be any 
               <br />
               Labrador ﬁshery next season, if the Labrador 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman sails up the coast in a schooner, he will 
               <br />
               go only with a guarantee of his security, or, to put 
               <br />

               <br />
               minimum salary at the end of the voyage. I have 
               <br />
               an interest in three schooners which this year 
               <br />
               prosecuted the ﬁshery, and the 30 men on board 
               <br />

               arrived home, “Not again brother, my last trip", 
               <br />
               and do you wonder? The season coming as the

               smashing climax to a cycle of three bad years, the

               the convertibility of sterling. I’ll ask the chap in

               Newtown with whom I talked ten days ago, who 
               <br />
               told me his summer’s catch of ﬁsh was in his 
               <br />
               store, and he wanted ﬂour and couldn’t get it. 
               <br />
               Yes, Mr. Chairman, I’ll ask them the question, 
               <br />
               and am well content to await their replies, and 
               <br />

               I am not suggesting that government or vested 
               <br />
               interest can make ﬁsh swim at specific periods in 
               <br />
               speciﬁc harbours, so that our schooners may 
               <br />
               secure substantial loads; but I do want to point 
               <br />
               out that the Labrador phase of the industry 
               <br />
               employs a lot of our people, and 1 am not satisfied 
               <br />
               in my own mind that the fishery generally is 
               <br />
               anything but discouraging. The Labrador ﬁshery 
               <br />
               at the moment is ﬂat on its back; some fishing 
               <br />
               skippers have lost everything, and sharemen- 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen have given up all plans of going back 
               <br />
               to the coast. This is not exaggerated. Look up 
               <br />
               your papers and read the schooners advertised for 
               <br />
               sale. I am conversant with every angle of this 
               <br />
               industry, and if this house, or the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government wants some corroboration, they 
               <br />
               have only to have a look~see around the northeast 
               <br />
               coast ofBonavista Bay, and it will be put to them 
               <br />
               in very strong terms. Modernise your methods, 
               <br />
               centralise your ﬁsheries, establish dollar credits, 
               <br />
               invoke the Marshall Plan, transform and 
               <br />
