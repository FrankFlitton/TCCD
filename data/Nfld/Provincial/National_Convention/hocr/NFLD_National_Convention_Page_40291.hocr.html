               what the future holds. But they don’t show the 
               <br />
               white feathers, they know that uncertainty is the 
               <br />
               unavoidable law of life. And their pride, their 
               <br />
               courage, and their patriotism bids them fight on. 
               <br />

               But why, I ask, should any one in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland talk of giving up, or talk of selling out? 
               <br />
               For what is the actual position? We are faced with 
               <br />
               no ﬁnancial or economic emergency. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, we are richer than we ever were before, 
               <br />
               than we ever expected to be. And as for our future 
               <br />
               prospects, I tell you they were never brighter. I 
               <br />
               know something of the economic and ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               structures of other countries, and I also know 
               <br />
               something about the position of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               and I place myself on record as saying that I know 
               <br />
               of no other people in the world who can today 
               <br />
               face their future with more confidence and as- 
               <br />
               surance, than Newfoundland. I see no shadow on 
               <br />
               the road ahead. Rather do I see continued bright- 
               <br />
               ness and prosperity. And when the final reports 
               <br />
               are presented to this Convention, I will prove 
               <br />
               what I say by the evidence of hard facts and 
               <br />
               figures. I know that there are with us today the 
               <br />
               prophets of doom and disaster, and they in their 
               <br />
               way are bad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough,</span> But worse still are those 
               <br />
               whom I honestly believe are disappointed at 
               <br />
               every new sign and proof of our country’s 
               <br />
               prosperity, which the investigations of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con.</span> 
               <br />
               vention are steadily producing. I cannot find 
               <br />
               words to express my utter contempt for this latter 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">class,</span> All I can say is that they disgrace the very

               I know something of what people called graft

               <br />
               evidence of this, I refer you to that section of the 
               <br />
               Auditor General’s report which deals with the 
               <br />
               Department of Public Health and Welfare, and 
               <br />
               also the Railway Department, and you will get an 
               <br />
               indication of what I mean. I assure you that if the

               whole story of the things which are taking place 
               <br />
               today under the present regime were exposed, the 
               <br />
               people of this country would be shocked as they 
               <br />
               have never been before. Why, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, 
               <br />
               there is at present on the table of this house the 
               <br />
               report of the Transportation Committee, and in 
               <br />
               this instance alone we ﬁnd that a sum of no less 
               <br />
               than $1 million per year is being sacrificed, or 
               <br />
               should I say sabotaged, with no more considera- 
               <br />
               tion or foresight than if it were so many cents. In 
               <br />
               a recent interview with the Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Public Utilities we were coolly informed that this 
               <br />
               obligation had been fastened on the necks of the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people solely by the decision of 
               <br />
               the local Commissioners without any reference 
               <br />
               to the British government. What an example of 
               <br />
               spendthrift dictatorship, what an abuse of a 
               <br />
               people’s interests, what a breach of the sacred 
               <br />
               obligations of trusteeship. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Is it not high time that we did something about 
               <br />
               all this, that we took some steps to prevent this 
               <br />

               it not time that this Convention did something 
               <br />

               there was never a time in our national life when 
               <br />
               the motto “Delays are dangerous" was more ap-

               <br />
