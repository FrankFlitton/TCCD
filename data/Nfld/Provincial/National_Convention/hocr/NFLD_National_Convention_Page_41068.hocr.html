               <br />
               August 1. 1937. After three years this Rowell-

               Sirois Commission made its report and recom- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was endorsed by the Dominion government, and 
               <br />
               this was the plan which subsequently was

               <br />
               remember, proved a dismal failure.

               <br />
               that great ﬁnancial concerns and wealthy in- 
               <br />
               dividuals who were holders of provincial bonds 
               <br />
               had engineered the report. He also objected to the 
               <br />
               surrender to a central authority of rights and 
               <br />
               privileges granted under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. Most of the premiers spoke against 
               <br />
               the Sirois recommendations, and refused to sit in 
               <br />
               further conferences. Said Hepburn, “1 will not

               sell my province down the river for all time to 
               <br />

               victim of the dictatorial methods of a

               However, although three provincial premiers 
               <br />
               had refused to even sit down to discuss the 
               <br />
               Rowell-Sirois Report, they all agreed to sur—

               <br />
               one year thereafter, as did also the municipalities. 
               <br />
               As a result the municipalities were compensated 
               <br />
               yearly to the amount of $86 million, Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               receiving less than $3 million. What would we 
               <br />
               have got, I wonder? The Dominion finance min-

               <br />
               point, collecting nearly $1,000 million in 1943 
               <br />
               from these sources alone as against $123 million
