               <br />
               amount required is proportionately a very modest 
               <br />
               sum to pay for the great advantages that would

               sensible to assume that we can rely upon those in

               It is true that we assist a certain number of 
               <br />
               students to go to Canada, but only to a small

               The Memorial University College was

               founded in 1924. By great good luck the ﬁrst

               academic thoroughness and high personal aims.

               longer adequately foster the development of his
