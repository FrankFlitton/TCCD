               Mr. Smallwood I intended to discuss the very 
               <br />
               matter Major Cashin has raised, but not to do it 
               <br />
               until the report was finished reading. I guess how 
               <br />
               is the time to go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I have a great deal of 
               <br />
               admiration for the work that the Committee has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> Any of us can see they put in a lot of work. 
               <br />
               I know the terrible difficulty they must have had 
               <br />
               because I have been doing that kind of thing 
               <br />
               myself, trying to get the same ﬁgures. It is one of 
               <br />
               the complaints that I have against this govern- 
               <br />
               ment that they have not got, after 13 years, any 
               <br />
               department to gather together just the ordinary 
               <br />
               facts and ﬁgures and statistics to show what the 
               <br />
               country is worth, the value of the goods 
               <br />
               produced, and of the manufactures. We and the 
               <br />
               government and Mr. Hickman’s committee do 
               <br />
               not know, because there is no one to tell them. 
               <br />
               This matter of protective tariff, I can’t agree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin, or with the Committee, in drawing 
               <br />
               too sharp a line between those local industries 
               <br />
               whose capital is owned outside the country, and 
               <br />
               those whose capital is owned inside the country. 
               <br />
               So far as the consumers of Newfoundland are 
               <br />
               concerned it does not make much difference who 
               <br />
               owns the capital, if the effect of a high protective 
               <br />
               tariff or a high customs tariff is to drive up the 
               <br />
               cost of living... Why draw the line? The enquiry 
               <br />
               that has to be made is on the effect of the tariff on 
               <br />
               all local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">industries,</span> That’s the enquiry that ought 
               <br />
               to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made.</span> It is true the Committee goes on to 
               <br />
               say that it would require investigation by ac- 
               <br />
               countants and economists in order to determine 
               <br />
               the degree of protection these local companies 
               <br />
               get. If it is so it is a pity that the Local Industries 
               <br />
               Committee did not make an effort to get an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac.</span> 
               <br />
               countant and economist to do that job. We are 
               <br />
               down now to one of the most fundamental things 
               <br />
               that we have to face. I heard Major Cashin in this 
               <br />
               very chamber stand up 20 years ago, and I heard 
               <br />
               him say that if he had his way he would take every 
               <br />

               local industry in this country and burn it to the 
               <br />
               ground. Now he did not mean that I know, but 
               <br />
               what he was getting at then, and also this after- 
               <br />
               noon, and what I am trying to get at, is this: taking 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as a whole, we know that in a 
               <br />
               local industry the employees get their living and 
               <br />
               the owners get their dividends, so a local industry 
               <br />
               is certainly good for those who are employed in 
               <br />
               it and for those who own it, but is that local 
               <br />
               industry good for Newfoundland? Industries are 
               <br />
               good, but I would-point out this fact, and it is the 
               <br />
               thing that we have to keep in our minds, and if 
               <br />
               we run into the danger of forgetting it we are 
               <br />
               going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong.</span> Every man, woman and child in this 
               <br />
               building and in this country today, is eating food 
               <br />
               and wearing clothes, footwear, etc, bought from 
               <br />
               the money that comes back into Newfoundland 
               <br />
               for the fish, the paper and the minerals we ship 
               <br />
               out. That‘s the only money we have, what we get 
               <br />
               back for these three things. That’s all we have to 
               <br />
               live on — how we divide it up is another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter...</span> 
               <br />
               There is no other money, except during the war 
               <br />
               when we had a lot of Canadian and American 
               <br />
               money for base construction. There is a little 
               <br />
               dribble still coming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> The only money that we 
               <br />
               live on is what comes into Newfoundland from 
               <br />
               Spain, Portugal, Italy, the West Indies, etc. for 
               <br />
               fish, and from Canada and England for iron ore 
               <br />
               and paper, not what is produced in these local 
               <br />
               industries. They don’t produce a single cent of 
               <br />
               new money, they only have their share of the fish, 
               <br />
               paper and mineral money. What follows from 
               <br />
               this? That it is absolutely necessary for this 
               <br />
               country to make the cost of fishing, of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufao</span> 
               <br />
               turing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paper,</span> ofmining, as cheap as we can make 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Are we doing that? Yes, I am afraid we are. 
               <br />
               How? Down through the years whenever we 
               <br />
               wanted to cut down the cost of producing fish we 
               <br />
               cut down the price we gave the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fishermen.</span> How 
               <br />
               did we cut down the cost of producing iron ore? 
               <br />
               By cutting the wages of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miners.</span> And how did 
               <br />
               we cut down the price of paper? By cutting the 
               <br />
               wages of the men in the mills. But that is not the 
               <br />
               way to do it. One way is to cut down the cost of 
               <br />
               living, and these local factories are not cutting it 
               <br />
               down, they are making it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">higher.</span> That’s what is 
               <br />
               meant in this paragraph here. What does it say?
