               mere reading of that list of federal services, but 
               <br />
               because of the exaggeration, the overtone, the 
               <br />
               emphasis which was laid upon the reading of that 
               <br />
               list. So much so, I felt sure that there were people, 
               <br />
               thousands of people in this country who had no 
               <br />
               experience in these matters at all, who would feel 
               <br />
               that if all these services were applied to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, nothing short of the millennium 
               <br />
               would have come. At that time, I injected a note 
               <br />
               of doubt and later I made an attempt to find out 
               <br />
               just how we would beneﬁt, apart from the purely 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial services which were allotted to these 
               <br />
               lists of services before us. I came to this con- 
               <br />
               clusion: we could not possibly beneﬁt very much 
               <br />
               materially by the direct application of these 
               <br />
               federal services. for the following reasons. Most 
               <br />
               of these services are research and consulting ser- 
               <br />
               vices. Secondly, the result of the ﬁndings of these 
               <br />
               services are open to Newfoundland today and are 
               <br />
               being availed of by Newfoundlanders. Take for 
               <br />
               example, geology, labour, agriculture. Let us 
               <br />
               look at page 19 of the Black Book (volume 2), 
               <br />
               the long list of services. The delegation put a 
               <br />
               question directly to the Ottawa group: 
               <br />
               Question: Would the agricultural services 
               <br />
               described in the Canadian memorandum 
               <br />
               automatically extend to Newfoundland in the 
               <br />
               event of union? 
               <br />
               Answer: One of the services which the 
               <br />
               Department of Agriculture would expect to 
               <br />
               make available to Newfoundland in such 
               <br />
               event, would be the experimental farms ser- 
               <br />
               vice. While the Department is not familiar 
               <br />
               with the present development in this ﬁeld in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, they understand that it does 
               <br />
               include a central experimental station. They 
               <br />
               would hope to use such a station in much the 
               <br />
               same way as they use their presently <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estab'</span> 
               <br />
               lished experimental stations in the various 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada and through this they 
               <br />
               would plan to develop supplementary ser- 
               <br />
               vices, which in Canada take the form of il~ 
               <br />
               lustration stations and, where required, 
               <br />
               sub-stations for dealing with special inves~ 
               <br />
               tigations.

               Consistent with the general policy of the 
               <br />
               Department and the resources available, the 
               <br />
               Department of Agriculture would also con-

               Out of a list of ﬁve or six, that was the answer 
               <br />
               to that particular question. A little further on, a 
               <br />
               question was put on the Canadian Farm Board 
               <br />
               loans. The answer was that the loans would be 
               <br />
               made available to Newfoundland. On the 
               <br />
               mortgage loans, I would not like to see that intro— 
               <br />
               duced into Newfoundland because I am aware of 
               <br />
               the fact, through my reading, that those loans and 
               <br />
               mortgages on farms in both the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada have led, in my opinion, to a great deal 
               <br />
               of hardship. I believe we should develop <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agriculu</span> 
               <br />
               tural services in Newfoundland, and I believe that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland should ﬁnd the money to develop 
               <br />
               these resources without taking mortgages on 
               <br />
               people’s property. The real point I want to make 
               <br />
               is this: in agriculture, all you have is their promise 
               <br />
               that one service would apply to Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               and that one service we already have, presumably 
               <br />
               up to the standard which Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               require at the present time. Then on page 21: 
               <br />
               Question: Would the services outlined in 
               <br />

               of mineral deposits, metallurgy, economic 
               <br />
               problems, etc.) apply to Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               how rapidly would it be likely they would be 
               <br />
               introduced? 
               <br />
               Answer: The services described have been 
               <br />
               carried on for many years and would undoub- 
               <br />
               tedly be extended to Newfoundland under 
               <br />
               present federal policy, although not all of 
               <br />
               them are, strictly speaking, federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respon»</span> 
               <br />
               sibilities. For example, the federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               merit is obligated by statute to carry out 
               <br />
               geological surveys in Prince Edward Island, 
               <br />
               Manitoba and British Columbia. No such 
               <br />
               obligation exists in respect of other provin— 
               <br />
               ces, although in practice Mines and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resourv</span> 
               <br />
               ces has carried on such surveys in the other 
               <br />
               provinces as well. It is hoped that in due 
               <br />
               course further Dominion-provincial discus- 
               <br />
               sions will result in clariﬁcation of these mat- 
               <br />
               ters when public investment policy generally 
               <br />
               is under discussion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Would Mr. Butt permit me to 
               <br />
               refer to the Grey Book, section 22? Does not that 
               <br />
               supersede the thing you just read? “As soon as 
               <br />
               may be practicable after union, the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada will make a special effort to collect and 
               <br />
               make available statistical and scientific data
