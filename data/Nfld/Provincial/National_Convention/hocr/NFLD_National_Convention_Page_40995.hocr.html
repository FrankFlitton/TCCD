               Mr. Ashbourne As 1 view it, the 10% we are

               talking about here happens to be 10% of $20 
               <br />
               million which the federal government expects to 
               <br />
               get. Now, if the amount of the ratio of total 
               <br />
               imports happens to be 10%, then they would 
               <br />
               expect it to be that, if the average was $20 mil-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> 1 think it would be a logical basis to ﬁgure 
               <br />
               on. If the average customs duty collected was 
               <br />
               10% and they estimated the amount of $2 million 
               <br />
               which they think they are going to get in customs 
               <br />
               duty, would it not be a fair assumption to assume 
               <br />
               the amount would be $20 million? There are two 
               <br />
               different things. The 4.28% is the percentage of 
               <br />
               the total revenue as compared with import duties; 
               <br />
               not the total amountof goods imported atdutiable

               raw materials coming in duty-free than the rest of

               10% duty, we might, on all imports, pay l2% or 
               <br />
               14% and that accounts for this $2 million in the
