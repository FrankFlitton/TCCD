               of them. Loans that they will never get returned, 
               <br />

               lowed for relief in Europe ~— charity if you like, 
               <br />
               and they have put them down as an asset, and they 
               <br />
               won’t get half of them. No. The per capita debt 
               <br />
               is $1,492.89, and their provincial debt is $149.06, 
               <br />
               and the municipal debt is $77.29 per head. Add 
               <br />
               these three together and you have nearly $1,800 
               <br />
               per head in Canada. Now let’s have a look at 
               <br />
               ourselves, and I am going to use the Canadian 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. I am not using mine, because I have been 
               <br />
               accused of faking mine. Now we have to go and 
               <br />
               get some of these experts up there to make up 
               <br />
               ours. No, according to their ﬁgures, not Cashin's, 
               <br />
               our per capita debt is $212.94 per head, and our 
               <br />
               St. John’s city debt is $44.94, say $45.00, that 
               <br />
               means a total debt for Newfoundland, including 
               <br />
               the City of St. John‘s, of approximately $260 per

               Mr. Cashin lam coming to that too, Mister. You 
               <br />
               just keep quiet now, I know my stuff on this 
               <br />
               contingency debt. We had our security for this 
               <br />
               contingency, and I know what Mr. Smallwood is 
               <br />
               driving at — Bowaters; Harbour Grace water- 
               <br />
               works a few thousand dollars; Placentia, and a 
               <br />
               few more, but Bowaters is the outstanding one, 
               <br />
               and I see now it is less than $7 million. Now our 
               <br />
               own debt is $260 a head, taking in our 
               <br />
               municipality of St. John’s. Theirs, with their 
               <br />
               provincial and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> no, we will ﬁgure that they 
               <br />
               haven’t any provincial debt, or any municipal 
               <br />
               debt; they have $1,492 net debt, we will call it, 
               <br />
               and take $260 from that and it leaves us what? A 
               <br />
               $1,230 difference between the two. Now some- 
               <br />
               one take it down if you like, and multiply 320,000 
               <br />
               people by $1,200, and you will ﬁnd a $380 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">milv</span> 
               <br />
               lion-odd difference. Now what is happening? 
               <br />
               Here is the basis of a proposal that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would enter union with Canada, figuring that we 
               <br />
               owe $260 a head, or whatever it is. We say, “All 
               <br />
               right, we are a wealthy people now, we are 
               <br />
               prepared to take upon ourselves a further

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liability,</span> We will wipe out ours and take on a 
               <br />
               liability of $1,492." But that‘s not the whole 
               <br />
               story. A few weeks ago the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               went to the United States to borrow money. We 
               <br />
               went one time too, to Canada, and were turned 
               <br />
               down. They went to the USA to borrow some 
               <br />
               money not long ago, and they got $300 million, 
               <br />
               and they were looking for $700 million. If, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, Newfoundland got its just des- 
               <br />
               serts and entered union with Canada on an equal 
               <br />
               basis, that $300 million that they borrowed from 
               <br />
               the United States belongs to the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               people, because it is the difference, between their 
               <br />
               percapita debt andourpercapita debt. You might 
               <br />
               also say it was on our credit that they were able 
               <br />
               to raise that $300 million, because they were not 
               <br />
               able to raise all they wanted on their own. Now 
               <br />
               with respect to this contingent liability, 1 think we 
               <br />
               have them here — anyhow, l remember them. 
               <br />
               Our contingent liabilities are something over $7 
               <br />
               million. What are the contingent liabilities of 
               <br />
               Canada? I can’t count them.
