               <br />
               he told it twice —— that 110 local ﬁrms made a

               <br />
               to now, and for centuries past, the Union Jack has 
               <br />

               of Canada they have torn down the Union Jack 
               <br />
               and for the past 12 months they have been argu—

               not a bunch of fools following a jack-o-lantern, 
               <br />
               and let us do exactly as Canada herself did a

               month ago when she was in ﬁnancial difﬁculties 
               <br />
               and had to borrow $300 million. Let us go to the 
               <br />
               USA with our economic problems, let us sell the 
               <br />

               <br />
               produce. And right there is the solution, and only 
               <br />
               solution to our economic problems. And anyone 
               <br />
               who says otherwise is only fooling himself and 
               <br />
