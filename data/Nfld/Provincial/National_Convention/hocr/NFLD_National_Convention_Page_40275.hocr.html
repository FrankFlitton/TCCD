               Mr. Northcott In yesterday’s debate there 
               <br />
               seemed to be a lot of misunderstanding in con- 
               <br />
               nection with the smaller post offices in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">island.</span> 
               <br />
               On page 5 of the report you will see, “203 
               <br />
               postmasters — salaries paid $80 per year.” In 
               <br />
               these small places there are perhaps ten families. 
               <br />
               They have a boat once a week. When the boat 
               <br />
               arrives, these ten families go to the post office and 
               <br />
               get their mail. 0n the return trip, the ten families 
               <br />
               will go and post their mail. That is all the work 
               <br />
               there is to that post ofﬁce. Perhaps that person 
               <br />
               spends one hour in a week in the post ofﬁce; 
               <br />
               therefore he or she is fairly well paid. In nine out 
               <br />
               of ten cases the post ofﬁce is in the person’s 
               <br />
               home. He or she gets a small rent. That will make 
               <br />
               a clearer picture. Then 97 postmasters are in 
               <br />
               places where there are 15 or 20 families; they are 
               <br />
               getting better salaries, $126—$240 a year. They 
               <br />
               have no telegraph system; they have about 20 
               <br />
               families and weekly mail. And the same thing 
               <br />
               applies. In the next group, at $240—$500 a year, 
               <br />
               nine out of ten of these have a money order ofﬁce 
               <br />
               and perhaps a telephone. They send only three or 
               <br />
               four messages a day. It is not necessary for that 
               <br />
               person to spend all of his or her time in the office. 
               <br />
               Again this ofﬁce may be in the home, for which 
               <br />
               rent is received. Then we find 21 getting $500- 
               <br />
               $600 a year. There is more work there. The 
               <br />
               person who is underpaid is the postmaster or 
               <br />
               postmistress in places like Botwood, Fogo. St. 
               <br />
               Anthony and Lewisporte. You have in the last 
               <br />
               place a post office and telegraph office all in one 
               <br />
               — one person doing three persons’ work. The 
               <br />
               Canadian army is there, the Shell Oil Co. and 
               <br />
               other businesses. It is a centre. They are in the 
               <br />
               ofﬁce from nine in the morning until 12 at night. 
               <br />
               This group is very much underpaid. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> 
               <br />
               people were getting $200 a month they would be 
               <br />
               getting a fair rate of wages... Again we have 159 
               <br />
               mail couriers, these people have long, hard and 
               <br />
               weary trips, and to them the country owes a great 
               <br />
               debt of gratitude. Sometimes they travel on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">her</span>

               Mr. Vardy Iam not so sure that that is, critically 
               <br />
               speaking, a true picture. I am thinking of a place 
               <br />
               where there are 600 people and the postal 
               <br />
               operator is employed there 20 years. He is a 
               <br />
               family man, his salary is $22 a month, and he gets 
               <br />
               $2 a month rent for the post office. He collects an 
               <br />
               average of $100 a month customs duties. I have 
               <br />
               a message today from a man who is employed 
               <br />
               around 30 years; his monthly salary is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$11.62</span> 
               <br />
               including war bonus, and he has four in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fami»</span> 
               <br />
               1y. I think that this Convention must have some 
               <br />
               sympathy for these people. I know this 
               <br />
               postmaster to be a capable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man.</span> There are at least 
               <br />
               three communities adjoining that settlement 
               <br />
               where post ofﬁces were taken away, telegraph 
               <br />
               and telephone poles chopped down, and this of— 
               <br />
               fice serves 1,200 to 1,500 people. That man is 
               <br />
               employed full time all the year round and he 
               <br />
               receives $11.62 a month. I have every sympathy 
               <br />
               for him...

               Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman, I have but few obser- 
               <br />
               vations to make and shall refrain from any 
               <br />
               detailed criticism. It appears we have today a 
               <br />
               worn—out railway and a worn-out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teIEgraph</span> sys- 
               <br />
               tem, and we are coldly advised of this fact by both 
               <br />
               of these departments. This has happened despite 
               <br />
               the fact that both the railway and the telegraph 
               <br />
               system had been building up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre‘war</span> in a highly 
               <br />
               satisfactory manner and indicated an ability to 
               <br />
               handle our normal needs for a long time. What, 
               <br />
               then, was the reason for this overburdening and 
               <br />
               unproﬁtable business? Plainly, sir, it is because 
               <br />
               we have just fought a war, we have rendered 
               <br />
               services beyond our means; whether willingly or 
               <br />
               unwillingly I don’t know, but certainly to a dis- 
               <br />
               tressing effect in assisting a world interest. Are 
               <br />
               we then satisfied to receive from that world a 
               <br />
               graceful thank~you, and leave the matter there? 
               <br />
               England, the US and Canada, stand together <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               still stand together in peace, but we stood with 
               <br />
               them in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war.</span> Why then are we so quickly forgot- 
               <br />
               ten in peace? If I were to answer that question I 
               <br />
               would say because we work out our deals on 
               <br />
               “friendly terms” —— two words to be careful of in 
               <br />
               the future of Newfoundland. In a friendly manner 
               <br />
               we have gone on in the past and accepted things 
               <br />
               as we found them. We have accepted the word 
               <br />
               and treatment of old England as final and live
