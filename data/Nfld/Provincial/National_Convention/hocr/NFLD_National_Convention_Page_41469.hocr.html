               just like our own folk doing the same. As a

               <br />
               potatoes. Time forbids me quoting other prices. 
               <br />
               Go to Cape Breton and it is the same, hundreds 
               <br />
               of farmers gone back to the country their fathers

               God made Cape Breton he smiled on it, he gave 
               <br />
               it coal, lumber, good farming land and ﬁshing 
               <br />
               and with Newfoundland ore, it could be a 
               <br />
               paradise. The raw material is brought to a certain 
               <br />
               point, then it is taken away to be ﬁnished in

               Ontario or Quebec and as the proﬁts are exported 
               <br />
               also, what is left is not enough to give the people 
               <br />
               a good living, and certain parts are slums or a

               <br />
               the Gaspé coast to the River St. Croix I have a 
               <br />
               very intimate knowledge of the men who with 
               <br />
               their hands produce the wealth wrested from 
               <br />
               land, woods, mines and sea. 1 have yet to meet 
               <br />
               one that did not curse confederation, 1 mean from 
               <br />
               the rural districts, and my mind goes back to 
               <br />
               1912, and we were anchored in the Magellan 
               <br />
               Strait, awaiting daylight. The second mate and 
               <br />
               myself were on the bridge, and there the talk 
               <br />
               turned to confederation. He had been master of 
               <br />
               one of Nova Scotia’s last iron windjammers. He 
               <br />
               said, “Charlie, if our fathers had any savvy and 
               <br />
               formed a confederation of New Brunswick, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, PEI and Newfoundland, the world would 
               <br />
               be a worthwhile place for us today.” He told me 
               <br />
               that at the time of confederation we had a large 
               <br />
               ﬂeet of ships, and if we had joined hands then, 
               <br />
               nobody could have touched us. All four provin- 
               <br />
               ces owned their own homes and lands, we could 
               <br />
               have sailed ships cheaper than any of the rest of 
               <br />
               the world. We could have been a maritime nation 
               <br />
               as we had the men, and that’s a country‘s best 
               <br />
               asset. “But”, he said, “we were forced into con- 
               <br />
               federation, you stayed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out,</span> Britain did not want 
               <br />
               any rivals in the maritime field and here are you 
               <br />
               and I working under what is to us a foreign ﬂag.” 
               <br />
               The ship was registered in Britain, owned in the 
               <br />
               United States. I could see it then, as he pointed it 
               <br />
               out to me, I believe that would be confederation 
               <br />
               worthwhile... Nova Scotia cannot get a break 
               <br />
               now as all the money is in Ontario and God did 
               <br />
               not intend them to be sailors.

               I have given this deep thought and I am ﬁrmly

               convinced even if the people vote against it, we 
               <br />
               will go into confederation unless we watch our 
               <br />
               balance. For it is a $64 question how Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               got in at that time. The Nova Scotia elections 
               <br />
               went terrible against the confederation, 54 out of 
               <br />
               57 seats being against it. The House of Commons 
               <br />
               was advised by a very able member, Mr. John 
               <br />
               Bright, not to include Nova Scotia, but to allow 
               <br />
               the general election to take place to ascertain the 
               <br />
               opinion of the colony; but the government and 
               <br />
               the House was deaf to this counsel.... They went
