               Mr. MacDonald Shortly after this Convention

               met I put through a question before committees

               were appointed, on this very subject of tourist 
               <br />
               development. The question was divided into ﬁve 
               <br />
               parts. I have never received a direct answer to 
               <br />
               those questions, but in this report those questions 
               <br />
               are all answered... I have met a lot of tourists in 
               <br />
               my time, and found out that they enjoyed it very 
               <br />
               much here...

               Mr. Ballam I did not think that we were all 
               <br />
               going over the question before the House, that is 
               <br />
               individually making speeches on it.... The tourist 
               <br />
               trafﬁc is probably of more interest over on the 
               <br />
               west coast than in this part of the country, simply 
               <br />
               because we have bigger ﬁshing rivers, we have 
               <br />
               steamship routes in Corner Brook, and there 
               <br />
               seems to be a desire amongst the people who 
               <br />
               come to visit primarily that part of the coast, so 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing this movement of the Tourist Board is, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, very bad. I know that next summer it is 
               <br />
               anticipated by a certain fraternal organisation 
               <br />
               that they will have a conference in Corner Brook, 
               <br />
               and that might mean a thousand people coming 
               <br />
               in there for a start, and much potential income. If 
               <br />
               the country had any encouragement from the 
               <br />
               government along these lines similar excursions 
               <br />
               would be made, and we would materially beneﬁt 
               <br />
               from it.

               channels of the air. Who gave VOUS the chan-

               Mr. Smallwood That does sound like a very 
               <br />
               valid argument. If VOUS are over the 250 watts 
               <br />

               ment of Posts and Telegraphs that makes a very 
               <br />
               strong case for allowing VOCM to increase their 
               <br />
               power to the same extent. If the House wants the 
               <br />

               <br />
