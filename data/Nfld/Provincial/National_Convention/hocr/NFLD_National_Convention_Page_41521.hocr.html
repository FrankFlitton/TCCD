               Britain proposed a method along democratic

               that formerly performed by a chosen few. 
               <br />
               Now we all know that an elected assembly 
               <br />
               differs in many important respects from a 
               <br />
               small compact commission. The members 
               <br />
               are not chosen because of any particular 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcations; they come from different 
               <br />
               parts of the country and from different walks 
               <br />
               of life; they have different interests and have 
               <br />
               different conceptions of their duties and 
               <br />
               responsibilities. They work in public and in- 
               <br />
               stead of holding their discussion in the quiet 
               <br />
               detachment of a small conference chamber, 
               <br />
               they debate in full session and before a public

               <br />
               have been prolonged, that your debates have 
               <br />
               from time to time resulted in some members

               wandering from the direct path of the terms

               <br />
               think, to be expected. A great deal of the

               criticism which has been levelled at the Con- 
               <br />
