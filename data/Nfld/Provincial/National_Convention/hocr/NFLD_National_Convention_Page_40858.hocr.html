               would recommend very strongly that Mr. Hollett

               regards any form of government, are anxious to

               get a clear understanding of the meaning of these

               Mr. Chairman Thank you very much, Mr. Job. 
               <br />
               Without in any way wishing to place any respon- 
               <br />
               sibilities upon Mr. Hollett, I might say that other-

               wise I think your suggestion is very welcome and 
               <br />
               very sound. The progress made last evening was 
               <br />
               terrible to say the least, and I feel that Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               should address himself to me as to how he feels, 
               <br />
               about assuming the responsibilities contained in 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett I think I should speak right away 
               <br />
               before I become involved in the thing. Let me say 
               <br />
               that I would refuse to undertake such an arduous 
               <br />
               task as to reply in one address to the multi- 
               <br />
               tudinous things that our friend from Bonavista 
               <br />
               Centre is going to raise on this issue. Not only do 
               <br />
               I fail to see how the debate last night was so 
               <br />
               terrible, but I cannot agree with anybody who 
               <br />
               would state that.

               us from Canada, and unless we examine them 
               <br />
               step by step we are not going to get this thing

               speeches before, and unfortunately I have made 
               <br />
               one or two myself and I know they are not the 
               <br />
               right approach to any matter. Human beings can 
               <br />
               only grasp one or two, or three or four points at a

               time to absorb them properly. Therefore to at— 
               <br />
               tempt to analyse these two Black Books and these 
               <br />
               terms from Mackenzie King in one, or two, or 
               <br />
               three long-winded speeches, I am afraid I don’t 
               <br />
               agree with the idea. If the progress has not been 
               <br />
               satisfactory we should devise a better case, but I 
               <br />
               would refuse to take on the burden of proof, if 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman I quite understand that it is a 
               <br />
               very difficult and arduous responsibility, but in 
               <br />
               fairness to Mr. Job I think I should correct a 
               <br />
               misapprehension. As I understand Mr. Job’s 
               <br />
               proposal he is not suggesting that you should 
               <br />
               reply to Mr. Smallwood in one speech. What he 
               <br />
               is saying is that the section would be read, that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood would give his interpretation of 
               <br />
               it as brieﬂy as possible, only referring to the 
               <br />
               Black Books as it becomes necessary, and then at 
               <br />
               the end you, if you so care, could reply. That 
               <br />
               means you would have the right to reply to every 
               <br />
               interpretation that Mr. Smallwood may place on 
               <br />
               every section of the report.

               <br />
               say it should be section by section. That’s a
