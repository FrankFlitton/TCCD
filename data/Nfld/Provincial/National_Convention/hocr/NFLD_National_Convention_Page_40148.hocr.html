               Mr. Hollett It is not my intention to delay the 
               <br />
               debate. I am neither very much enamoured of the 
               <br />
               amendment, and certainly not of the motion, but 
               <br />
               I believe I shall vote for the amendment. I regret 
               <br />
               there seems to be from day to day a change in the 
               <br />
               manner of procedure. One day we seem to be 
               <br />
               using parliamentary procedure, and some other 
               <br />
               day we seem to be using some omer form of 
               <br />
               procedure, so it makes it rather awkward when 
               <br />
               one gets to his feet to make some remarks.

               <br />
               originally laid down whatsoever. Where the rules

               ago there was strong objection taken by the Chair 
               <br />
