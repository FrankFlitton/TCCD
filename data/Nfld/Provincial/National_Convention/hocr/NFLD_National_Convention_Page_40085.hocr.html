               Committee, the main object of which is the cold

               committee on the excellence of their report, and 
               <br />
               the thoroughness with which they have reviewed

               Mr. lob has given us an excellent resumé of 
               <br />
               conditions under which our ﬁsheries will have to 
               <br />
               function, and stressed the necessity of markets, 
               <br />
               with favourable tariffs and trade relations, 
               <br />
               primarily with the United States. We feel that the 
               <br />
               concessions granted to the United States in the 
               <br />
               way of leases of Newfoundland territory for 99

               years, together with free importations for use at 
               <br />
               their bases, use of roads, etc., should justify some 
               <br />
               adequate returns, and I concur with the report as 
               <br />
               presented in its entirety, but will add that more 
               <br />
               stress should be placed on other phases of the
