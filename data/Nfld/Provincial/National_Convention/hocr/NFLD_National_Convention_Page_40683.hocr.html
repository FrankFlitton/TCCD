               situation. At that time, when the Americans ﬁrst 
               <br />
               came in here, we were ourselves trying to get a 
               <br />
               little extra money in the pockets of our workers. 
               <br />
               I haven’t any doubt whatever now that if it wasn’t 
               <br />
               for the advent 'of the Americans in here, we 
               <br />
               wouldn’t have been as successful as we were. Sir,

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               we did get an award from an arbitration board 
               <br />
               which was chaired by a good Newfoundlander, 
               <br />
               in my opinion anyway, Judge Dunﬁeld, who gave 
               <br />
               us an award, 18 cents above the wages paid at 
               <br />
               Argentia and other American bases, and also an 
               <br />
               award above the amount paid by the Highroads 
               <br />
               Commission. Now last year right here I asked a 
               <br />
               question regarding the rates paid by the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government to their employees. When I 
               <br />
               asked the question I knew at the time what they 
               <br />
               were paying. They were paying insofar as or- 
               <br />
               ganised labour was concerned, 18 cents below 
               <br />
               the rates; and they stepped it up 10 cents more 
               <br />
               after my question was posed here in the House. I 
               <br />
               have since been informed, I haven‘t checked on 
               <br />
               it, but I have since been informed they have 
               <br />
               dropped back to the old rate of 40 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents.</span> Now it’s 
               <br />
               not my point here this afternoon to attack Com— 
               <br />
               mission of Government or any form of govem- 
               <br />
               ment. I realise the time will come for that later 
               <br />
               when we get to forms of government. But since 
               <br />
               the labour question was brought up, I can verify 
               <br />
               this much and produce evidence if necessary, that 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government was not wholly 
               <br />
               responsible, yet in my opinion they were because 
               <br />
               a govemment is supposed to look after the needs 
               <br />
               of the people first. But the Commission of 
               <br />
               Govemmentin regard to pegging wages for New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders on the bases was directed by out- 
               <br />
               side inﬂuences, that is the big corporations in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. That is the situation. If the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government, I say again this in their 
               <br />
               favour, were not pressed to keep these wages 
               <br />
               down, I have no doubt whatever that the very rate 
               <br />
               which the Americans wanted to pay would have 
               <br />
               been paid. But it was by the vested interests in 
               <br />
               this country that the wages of labour were kept 
               <br />
               down and not the Commission of Government. 
               <br />
               They were only the agent.

               Mr. Fudge I think Mr. Smallwood said that he

               <br />
               there’s a few things that Mr. Smallwood has not 
               <br />
               been acquainted with just yet. However, I shall

               past. But I would like to say that when the 
               <br />
               Americans and Canadians came here, the rate of 
               <br />
               wages was set at 30 cents. Along with the Federa- 
               <br />
               tion of Labour, the President of the FPU and the 
               <br />
