               <br />
               may I say again it is relatively unimportant 
               <br />
               whether Major Cashin, as the former ﬁnance 
               <br />
               minister, made an error in his budget, and under- 
               <br />
               estimated or overestimated his expenditure, or 
               <br />
               whether his predecessors or his successors did the 
               <br />
               same thing. I suggest, with all due respect to the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee, what is important is what 
               <br />
               was our position in 1934, and what is it today? 
               <br />
               Because, as you know, the terms of reference ask 
               <br />
               us to go back to 1934, and study the changes that 
               <br />
               have taken place in the economy and bearing in 
               <br />
               mind the extent to which the revenues of recent 
               <br />
               years have been due to wartime conditions, to 
               <br />
               examine the position of the country from that 
               <br />
               time on. That is what I propose to do very briefly. 
               <br />
               I presume that nearly every member is going to 
               <br />
               have something to say. We have had two very 
               <br />
               long, very well-delivered speeches — one ex- 
               <br />
               tremely pessimistic, and one extremely realistic, 
               <br />
               in my opinion. But these points come to me in the 
               <br />
               survey of the 1934 — 1947 period. In 1934 I 
               <br />
               believe we owed $100 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million...</span> And today we 
               <br />
               owe, deducting our liquid assets, $35 million. In 
               <br />
               1934 the people had $25 million in the Savings 
               <br />
               Bank, today they have $80 million. In 1934 our 
               <br />
               people had insurance worth $52 million, today 
               <br />
               they have insurance worth $100 million. The 
               <br />
               cash surrender value of this insurance in 1934 
               <br />
               was worth $9 million, today it is worth about $22 
               <br />
               million. Today we have ﬁxed government assets 
               <br />
               of something in the vicinity of $140 million. Now 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee gives our ﬁxed assets in 
               <br />
               the vicinity of $110 million. I believe they have 
               <br />
               not added in the value of Gander airport, and the 
               <br />
               cost of it should be the value of it. We may not 
               <br />
               be able to put it on the block and sell it for that, 
               <br />
               but I am putting in the cost of it as the value of 
               <br />
               it.... Included in that, of course, is the $72 million 
               <br />
               value that has been put on the Railway. That 
               <br />
               value has been put on by the management of the 
               <br />
               Railway. I don’t know where you could get any 
               <br />
               better value for the Railway than by going to the 
               <br />
               Manager and asking him, and I must say that I 
               <br />
               think it very unethical of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood to sug~

               wood. To revert to our ﬁgures from 1934 on, our 
               <br />
               revenue from 1934-35 was $9,624,000. Our 
               <br />
               revenue in 1946-47 was $37,250,000. Our expen- 
               <br />
               diture in 1934-35 was $10 million, and our ex— 
               <br />
               penditure in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194647</span> was $25 million. We have 
               <br />
               had a surplus of revenue over expenditure now 
               <br />
               since 1941, and you all know that expenditure has 
               <br />
               not been curtailed. Therefore there can be no 
               <br />
               doubt whatsoever that at the present time at least 
               <br />
               this country is self-supporting, and we have been 
               <br />
               self-supporting since 1941. I say also that I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that our present high expenditure, our 
               <br />
               present high revenue, is due in a large measure to 
               <br />
               war <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditures.</span> I think we must all agree to 
               <br />
               that, but I am prepared to agree with the Finance 
               <br />
               Committee’s contention that our continuing high 
               <br />
               revenues are, in a large measure, due to the 
               <br />
               growth of our main industries and general world 
               <br />
               conditions. I am satisfied that if, as it must, the 
               <br />
               exchange problem can be handled, that these 
               <br />
