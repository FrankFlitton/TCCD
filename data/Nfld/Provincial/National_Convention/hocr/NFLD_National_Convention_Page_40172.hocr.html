               The present system does not give teachers a 
               <br />
               chance to accomplish what they would wish. A 
               <br />
               teacher with four or five grades to teach cannot 
               <br />
               hope to attain the same result as with one grade, 
               <br />
               and the children cannot hope to attain that degree 
               <br />
               of knowledge which is their right. The teachers 
               <br />
               in these seven schools number 18. The largest of 
               <br />
               these school has six rooms, three others have 
               <br />
               three rooms each, the other three schools one 
               <br />
               room each, making a total 18 rooms — 18. Can 
               <br />
               you imagine anything more wasteful or un- 
               <br />
               economical when a central school of say ten or 
               <br />
               twelve rooms, and two schools for primary 
               <br />
               grades, would suffice? I might say that three of 
               <br />
               these school are situated within a radius of about 
               <br />
               200 yards.

               In conclusion, it is my opinion that the present 
               <br />
               system is not only wasteful and uneconomical, 
               <br />
               but seriously retards the education of our young

               people who do not get the chance to which they 
               <br />
               are entitled, and to whom we look forward, at 
               <br />
               some time, to carry on the public affairs of this 
               <br />
               country. It also restricts the efforts of that under- 
               <br />
               paid, self-sacn‘ficing body, the teachers of this

               are doing a good job but would be eager and 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins Usually I am in accord with my 
               <br />
               friend Mr. MacDonald on those matters, but 
               <br />
               frankly I can’t agree with the statement, or his 
               <br />
               suggestions of a new school system such as he 
               <br />
               has outlined. As far as this country is concerned 
               <br />
               the system of education that we have meets with 
               <br />
               the approval of the people, and unless you have 
               <br />
               the approval of the people as a whole no system 
               <br />
               of education is going to be successful, because 
               <br />
               apparently it has worked out very well. Whilst it 
               <br />
               does not make any difference what comments we 
               <br />
               make here, nevertheless we should express our 
               <br />
               thoughts, and I would like to say that in my 
               <br />
               opinion our system of education is entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satis»</span>

               factory, and should not be changed.

               <br />

               <br />
               and is part of the denominational system. It is 
               <br />
               true, as Mr. Higgins said, it is the choice of the 
               <br />
               people and it should remain as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such,</span> I agree with 
               <br />
               him there, but I agree also with Mr. MacDonald 
               <br />
               that it is a wasteful system, not giving us the best 
               <br />
               possible advantage of the money Spent, and I 
               <br />
               wonder if we could not as a country perhaps do a 
               <br />
               little better under our denominational system. 
               <br />
               There seems to be a tendency at the present time 
               <br />
               to greater divisions. Our school system in a little 
               <br />
               community seemed to be working very well, and 
               <br />
               then certain denominational interests stepped in 
               <br />
               and opened another school, which results in a 
               <br />
               very wasteful system. I would like to be able to 
               <br />
               arrange it so as to avoid that happening, to 
               <br />
               preserve that arrangement rather than to split it 
               <br />
               up again. That seems to be a thing to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider,</span> I 
               <br />
               regret that sometimes you will find in some small 
               <br />
               communities a fairly good system operating 
               <br />
               under our denominational system, and then, for 
               <br />
               reasons that you all know, the split is made and 
               <br />
               the system is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inefficient,</span> That does not apply 
               <br />
               to our work in Labrador, where I am chieﬂy 
               <br />
               interested, because our work there is going very 
               <br />
               very smoothly under the denominational system, 
               <br />
               but I am afraid perhaps in the future it may suffer 
               <br />
               because of it. I will have no more to say about this 
               <br />
               at the present time, but I would like to say that in 
               <br />
               Labrador and the northern part of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               the work of education is efﬁciently enhanced by 
               <br />
               the interest the Grenfell Mission people have had 
               <br />
               in the schools and the education of the people in

               <br />
               thony is a great success and is making a great 
               <br />
               contribution to that community. Perhaps you do 
               <br />
               not know just what is being done in Labrador by 
               <br />
               these people, and has been done for some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> 
               <br />
               There were three boarding schools in Labrador, 
               <br />
               one at Mary’s River, one at Cartwright and one 
               <br />
               at North West River. Two of these are still exist- 
               <br />
               ing, one at Cartwright under Dr. and Mrs. For- 
               <br />
               syth and one at North West River under 
               <br />
               Mrs. Paddon and her son. The one at North West 
               <br />
               River is now being converted into a non- 
               <br />
               denominational school. We have three teachers 
               <br />
               there, and we have plans made for the community 
               <br />
               to set up a $15,000 building with a four room 
               <br />
               school. It will be under the board of education, 
               <br />
               but I am glad to say that the Grenfell Mission
