               In dealing with the period from 1920 to 1934, 
               <br />
               much ado about nothing was also made in the 
               <br />
               remarks of the member from Bonavista Centre. 
               <br />
               A long array of ﬁnance ministers was presented 
               <br />
               to us, and it was intimated that scarcely one of 
               <br />
               them ever made a correct budget. That, of course, 
               <br />
               we can all understand. I fail to see how any 
               <br />
               ﬁnance minister in any government, business, or 
               <br />
               household, can make a sure estimate of what the 
               <br />
               expenditures or deﬁcits or surpluses will be from 
               <br />
               year to year. But the pointl want to raise is this: 
               <br />
               much capital was meant to be dispersed to the 
               <br />
               other needs of this country, and many ﬁnance 
               <br />
               ministers not only failed to make an accurate 
               <br />
               estimate of the surplus or the deﬁcit, but they 
               <br />
               made such errors and such estimates which in the 
               <br />
               end proved to be very wrong. In touching upon 
               <br />
               that point I would like for you to remember that 
               <br />
               period from 1920 to 1934, remember that the 
               <br />
               Great War had been fought and won. You will 
               <br />
               remember that for two or three years after peace 
               <br />
               was signed this little country enjoyed unwonted 
               <br />
               prosperity. Fish was selling in the markets of the 
               <br />
               world at higher prices than ever before, and con~ 
               <br />
               sequently the people up to 1921 or 1922 were 
               <br />
               enjoying such prosperity as had been undreamed 
               <br />
               of before these days. Also you will remember that 
               <br />
               shortly after that time conditions were not so 
               <br />
               good. There were ups and downs and ins and outs, 
               <br />
               if you like. And that’s the way it was, I suppose, 
               <br />
               with the ﬁnance ministers. But they were not 
               <br />
               getting the price for the ﬁsh, and unfortunately,‘ 
               <br />
               at this time, they were not even getting the ﬁsh; 
               <br />
               but they certainly were not getting the price they 
               <br />
               had got some years before. Our merchants had 
               <br />
               been stocked up to the hilt. Our banking owners 
               <br />
               (I come from the southwest coast where they go 
               <br />
               to ﬁsh in deep waters) had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up«to-date</span> vessels; 
               <br />
               firms had from five to six bankers costing 
               <br />
               anywhere from $10-25,000 and more, new ves- 
               <br />
               sels too. They had been perhaps unwise in this era 
               <br />
               of prosperity to think that it was going to con- 
               <br />
               tinue, and they had gotten rid of the old vessels 
               <br />
               and gotten themselves new up-to—date vessels, 
               <br />
               built in Lunenburg, Shelburne and other places, 
               <br />
               at very high cost. That was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">situationuand</span> 
               <br />
               suddenly the price dropped and the bottom 
               <br />

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 770 186 1308 1843">

               dropped out of the market, and the merchants

               ves with good expensive gear and they could not 
               <br />
               sell their ﬁsh. Under these circumstances I ask 
               <br />
               you who could you put in as ﬁnance minister to 
               <br />
               budget the surpluses or deﬁcits from 1922 or 23 
               <br />
               onwards? 
               <br />
               I come down to 1931, but ﬁrst I must remind 
               <br />
               you of that great depression which struck the 
               <br />
               world, not only Newfoundland, in 1929. 
               <br />
               Everybody was broke, and by 1931 it was coming 
               <br />
               in with a surge on this country, an absolute tidal 
               <br />
               wave, and my friend Major Cashin at that time 
               <br />
               was ﬁnance minister. Yesterday it was intimated 
               <br />
               that because he made the colossal mistake of 
               <br />
               budgeting for a small deﬁcit and succeeded in 
               <br />
               getting a deﬁcit of $4 million, then this, what we 
               <br />
               have here, was only tomfoolery. That was the 
               <br />
               idea which it was the endeavour of the member 
               <br />
               from Bonavista Centre to convey to you, and to 
               <br />
               the country at large. I am quite sure you see now 
               <br />
               how ridiculous that idea <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was.</span> If my friend from 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre had explained to you that at that 
               <br />
               time no ﬁnance minister in this world could 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely make a correct budget, then I would 
               <br />
               have no complaint whatsoever with the member 
               <br />
               from Bonavista Centre. 
               <br />
               New 1931 was a bad year. In order to prove 
               <br />
               how uncertain things then were and in order to 
               <br />
               prove how difﬁcult it might have been for my 
               <br />
               friend from Bonavista Centre, if he had been 
               <br />
               ﬁnance minister, to make the correct estimate, 1 
               <br />
               would like to quote from a sort of history, an 
               <br />
               economic history if you like, of this country, 
               <br />
               written by my friend from Bonavista Centre in 
               <br />
               the year 1930.1 1931 was well in sight. If any of 
               <br />
               you have that book 1 would ask you to turn to page 
               <br />
               9. This is how my friend from Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               saw things in Newfoundland in the future: 
               <br />
               The Newfoundland note then is distinctly one 
               <br />
               of hope. The country has put its worst behind 
               <br />
               it. The future is most promising. This march 
               <br />
               to industrialism is no ﬂash in the pan. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New‘</span>

               foundland is around the corner. Much 
               <br />
               remains to be done to make conditions ideal 
               <br />
               it is true, but the encouraging fact is that
