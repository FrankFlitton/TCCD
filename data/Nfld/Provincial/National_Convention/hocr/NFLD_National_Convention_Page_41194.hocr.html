               <br />
               see any earthly reason for putting it in there at all. 
               <br />
               It’s a purely provincial matter, and as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under‘</span> 
               <br />
               stand it we can do exactly as we wish and carry 
               <br />
               on as at the present time. I would like to point out 
               <br />
               though, and here I refer to something that Mr. 
               <br />
               Bailey has been trying to get across, that a lot of 
               <br />
               the school money which has been paid by the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government has been found 
               <br />
               through municipal taxation. The point that Mr. 
               <br />
               Bailey, I take it, was trying to make is this: that 
               <br />
               if you want to progress in education and social 
               <br />
               welfare, and want to run your government on the 
               <br />
               same basis as in Canada, we in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will have to follow the same pattern. If you don’t 
               <br />
               want to do these things, then as Mr. Bailey says, 
               <br />
               you can remain as you are. But don’t say on the 
               <br />
               one hand that you’re going to have the standard 
               <br />
               that they have in Canada if you do not apply the 
               <br />
               same formula. The taxes have to be found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> 
               <br />
               where. The whole scheme of municipal govern— 
               <br />
               ment in Canada is an integral part of the scheme 
               <br />
               of government in that country. I’m not against 
               <br />
               local councils, I’m all for them. I would like to 
               <br />
               see them built up. I would point out this though, 
               <br />
               that under the provincial budget that has been 
               <br />
               arranged, nothing has been left except the amount 
               <br />
               which we have at the present time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">".1</span> and I will 
               <br />
               say, from personal experience with these matters, 
               <br />
               that if you are going to develop local councils in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, you’ve got to give them not only 
               <br />
               the ordinary maintenance services, but some- 
               <br />
               thing to build up so that they can carry on. That 
               <br />
               accounts for what the present government is 
               <br />
               doing, in giving large grants so that local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com.</span> 
               <br />
               munities can build their roads and keep <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themsel‘</span> 
               <br />
               ves in a position where their normal revenue will 
               <br />
               maintain them. I contend that you must add a very 
               <br />
               considerable amount to this provincial budget 
               <br />
               which has been produced for us, whether it’s the

               Now, sir, I’ve been talking a long time, butI 
               <br />
               want to say one or two things more. I want to 
               <br />
               come to oleomargarine. It says that we can 
               <br />
               produce it but we mustn’t ship it outside of the 
               <br />
               country. When you read that you made a speech 
               <br />
               and you ended up by having oleomargarine 
               <br />
               produced in a magniﬁcent factory on Lemarchant 
               <br />
               Road, and sold across Canada. I think it’s only 
               <br />
               fair to say though, that a little small company, it 
               <br />
               can’t be bigger then a small empire, like Lever 
               <br />
               Brothers is very likely to establish branches in 
               <br />
               Canada, if the time ever comes that they can 
               <br />
               produce oleomargarine there. And as far as our 
               <br />
               plant here is concerned, we could not count on a 
               <br />
               great increase in production which would bring 
               <br />
               extra wages. Modern oleomargarine is made 
               <br />
               from vegetable oil, as against the old-time ﬁsh 
               <br />
               oil, and it doesn’t seem reasonable that Levers 
               <br />
               would come to Newfoundland, ship in its 
               <br />
               vegetable oil make its margarine and ship it to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> I mention this fact, because an exag— 
               <br />
               gerated statement of that kind is likely to create 
               <br />
               the impression that we are going to get much 
               <br />
               more then we can find from the evidence in the

               What is proposed is that we should go into 
               <br />
               Canada ﬁrst, and then ﬁnd out what is in this

               country, rather then staying out, ﬁnding out what 
               <br />
               is in this country, and seeing if we can make 
               <br />
               better terms as a result of it. We know what we 
               <br />
               can get without an economic survey. We don’t 
               <br />
               know what we can get with an economic survey. 
               <br />
               I can understand now why there was such a 
               <br />
               deadset on the proposal suggested by the chair- 
               <br />
               man of the Industrial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Association...</span> We are told 
               <br />
               that we’ll get the services of technical personnel 
               <br />
               and agencies to assist in the work. Surely people 
               <br />
               must know that Montreal brought in experts, not 
               <br />
               from Ottawa, but from the United States of 
               <br />
               America. Surely they must know that two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provin«</span> 
               <br />
               ces brought in experts from America. And yet we 
               <br />
               were given the bait, that if we get into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion they will send the experts to carry on this 
               <br />
               survey. Mr. Chairman, I suggest to you that the 
               <br />
               only common sense thing to do is to ﬁnd out what 
               <br />
               we have in Newfoundland ﬁrst, and then ﬁnd out
