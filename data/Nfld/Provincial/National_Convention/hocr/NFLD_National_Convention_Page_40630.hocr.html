               some day this fall, perhaps, in the national 
               <br />
               referendum, to link this country with another 
               <br />
               country, in such a case it will be more important 
               <br />
               than ever to see to it that our Newfoundland 
               <br />
               culture is preserved and encouraged and fostered 
               <br />
               and developed, and in no way can that be done 
               <br />
               better than through the creation of a New- 
               <br />
               foundland university. I wanted to make that 
               <br />
               point. It is not a new point, I have been making it 
               <br />
               for many, many years, and I want to associate 
               <br />
               myself very heartily indeed with the motion... 
               <br />
               Mr. Jones Mr. Chairman, I have been con- 
               <br />
               nected with education all my life, having taught 
               <br />
               in some of the principal high schools of this 
               <br />
               country, and I rise to support the resolution.

               I consider that Memorial College should be a 
               <br />
               degree-conferring institution. There have been 
               <br />
               many boys and girls thwarted in their education 
               <br />
               by the lack of such an institution in this country. 
               <br />
               During the last ten or 15 years I know of many 
               <br />
               young men and women who, having completed 
               <br />
               their second year at the Memorial College, were 
               <br />
               handicapped by the lack of funds from continuing 
               <br />
               their studies abroad. Had we such an institution 
               <br />
               in this country, some of these boys and girls 
               <br />
               would have been able to continue their studies

               <br />
               course applies to any other course of studies 
               <br />
               taken at the Memorial College. As time goes on, 
               <br />
               the need of such an institution will be more urgent 
               <br />
               because many of our young people are beginning 
               <br />
               to realise the necessity of such an education. Why 
               <br />
               should we not do our utmost to make it possible 
               <br />
               for these young people to reach their goal? I hope 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government will give the

               matter their serious consideration; if so, it will be

               one of the best things they have done for our

               young people during their reign...

               I do not propose to speak at any great length 
               <br />
               on this matter, which is beyond controversy. The

               mover has summed up most of the arguments in 
               <br />

               the most outstanding antagonisms with regard to

               <br />
               on the theme and it has been covered rather 
               <br />
               thoroughly. Yet I cannot let this opportunity pass 
               <br />
               without adding a few comments of my own on a

               What is a university? Too many people have 
               <br />
               the wrong idea. They think it means snobbishness 
               <br />
               — they think it is a place where a young man or 
               <br />
               young woman attends for so many years to 
               <br />

               <br />
               which do not mean very much. How mistaken an 
               <br />
               ideal In this country, the tendency to think of a 
               <br />
               university as a breeding—ground of snobbishness 
               <br />
               arises from the fact that only those who can afford 
               <br />

               preciation of the real case. The reason that so

               many of our young people do not, cannot attend 
               <br />
               a university, is simply that there is no university 
               <br />
               in the country. The cost of attending a university 
               <br />
               is relatively small — that is the actual tuition fees, 
               <br />
               and so on. In the case of Newfoundlanders, it is 
               <br />
               the expense of travelling, board and lodging and 
               <br />
               the rest, that makes attending a foreign university
