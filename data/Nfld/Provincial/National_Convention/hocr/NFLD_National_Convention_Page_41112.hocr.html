               Government of Canada would get from New- 
               <br />
               foundland? He says he applied, I believe, 15% on 
               <br />
               the actual value of tickets sold by the Railway last 
               <br />
               year; is that what I understand? And he found out 
               <br />
               the value of tickets sold on steamers and trains 
               <br />
               last year, and having got the value of that he 
               <br />
               merely applied 15% to that value sold by the 
               <br />

               apply 15% tax to sleeping berths or parlour car

               Mr. Smallwood I think we have it fairly clear

               <br />
               I believe on trains it is 5 - 7 cents a mile. In 
               <br />
               Canada, when you buy a ticket on a train or plane 
               <br />
               or any kind of transport, besides the amount of 
               <br />
               the ticket, the railway or airline collects 15% tax 
               <br />
               from you, which they pass back to the Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />
               being charged, we would pay 15% travel tax 
               <br />
               when we buy the ticket and that tax and the fare 
               <br />
               would come to 3.5 cents a mile, where now we 
               <br />
               have to pay 5-7 cents a mile. If Mr. Fogwill would 
               <br />
               take the total value of tickets sold last year by the 
               <br />
               Railway, deduct from that what would have been 
               <br />

               <br />
               of $400,000, it would be half. He can cut that in

               half. On top of that, our people would be

               hundreds of thousands of dollars in pocket by
