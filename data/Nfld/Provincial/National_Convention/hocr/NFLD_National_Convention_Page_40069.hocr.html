               sterling and how much in dollars? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild It is all sterling. All the guaranteed

               money is sterling. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood There are dollar bonds? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild No. Oh well, mere are about $12,000 
               <br />
               worth that people did not convert. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Then the total of dollar bonds 
               <br />
               indebtedness is roughly what? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild About $5 million. We have got that 
               <br />
               railway loan which is about $1.5 million. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood We owe no dollars out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland except the regular loan, and all the 
               <br />
               sterling is guaranteed by the UK? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild All except what I have mentioned. 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington There is one sentence here: 
               <br />
               “There is considerable increase in direct taxation 
               <br />
               since the war, and it now amounts to more than 
               <br />
               half the yield from customs duties, on which we 
               <br />
               used mainly to depend." Could you foresee the 
               <br />
               time when all our revenue would be raised by 
               <br />
               direct taxation? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild If you mean by income tax I would 
               <br />
               not like to say anything for the future, but may I 
               <br />
               put it this way. I assume you mean that in regard 
               <br />
               to balancing our budget, can we get the whole 
               <br />
               thing without some other taxation? 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington Well, the greater portion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild I think the answer physically could be 
               <br />
               “yes", but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it’s</span> going to be the devil of a job to do. 
               <br />
               It means that you have got to drop your exemp— 
               <br />
               tion. You have to start collecting taxes from your 
               <br />
               fishermen. The small farmer or ﬁsherman does 
               <br />
               not pay taxes in Canada. The trouble is your small 
               <br />
               farmer and fisherman is, in a small way, a 
               <br />
               capitalist. He is in business on his own, but if we 
               <br />
               ask him to pay taxes we have to ask him to render 
               <br />
               a balance sheet, etc., and how many ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               are going to do that? If the country wanted to tax 
               <br />
               workers in industry then we would be getting 
               <br />
               somewhere, but we are a long way from that. The 
               <br />
               larger proportion will always have to be gotten 
               <br />
               by some other taxes than income tax. There are 
               <br />
               many things to be said for it. Income tax may not 
               <br />
               be quite fair. Why should anybody pay a tax on 
               <br />
               his smokes and drinks? If you dropped customs 
               <br />

               duties I think we should have to have sales taxes, 
               <br />
               and sales taxes are rather difﬁcult in application. 
               <br />
               In Canada they have a very successful tax 
               <br />
               through the wholesalers, but the other retail taxes 
               <br />
               mean an awful lot of trouble, you have to have a 
               <br />
               system of stamps or an army of accountants. One 
               <br />
               might check on the merchants in St. John’s and 
               <br />
               the big towns, but it would be very difﬁcult in 
               <br />
               other districts. Sales taxes are possible, but they 
               <br />
               mean a lot of work. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Would they be very much 
               <br />
               more difﬁcult to enforce in this country than 
               <br />
               income tax is now? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild Income tax is not difﬁcult in this 
               <br />
               country now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Judging by all the talk it is. 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild It is a gradual process and is going to 
               <br />
               take some years, but I think as time goes on we 
               <br />
               can do better. We have got 10,000 income tax 
               <br />
               payers now as against 2,000 previously. It is 
               <br />
               surprising how many people are getting used to 
               <br />
               paying income tax. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood You are getting about $2 mil- 
               <br />
               lion in direct taxation from liquor, licenses, etc. 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild Well, I call liquor an indirect tax. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood You said the other day that the 
               <br />
               least amount necessary to maintain ordinary ex- 
               <br />
               penditure at its present level would be $23 mil— 
               <br />
               lion a year, and then as to the capacity of the 
               <br />
               country to pay that $23 million you looked ahead 
               <br />
               a bit and saw newsprint fairly good for a few 
               <br />
               years to come, some minerals, etc., and the pos- 
               <br />
               sibility that for the next three or four years the 
               <br />
               country would be fairly well off to pay the $23 
               <br />
               million, and maybe more. But you mentioned the 
               <br />
               possibility that it is anyone’s guess as to when the 
               <br />
               slump might come. If we have to devise a system 
               <br />
               of government, it is not for five or ten years, but 
               <br />
               for 50 or a 100. Have you formed any personal 
               <br />
               opinion as to the capacity of this country’s 
               <br />
               economy, beginning five or ten years from now, 
               <br />
               to produce that amount of money yearly? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild I said that I expected that it would not 
               <br />
               be below that, butl said that that included nothing 
               <br />
               for unemployment relief. That $24 or $25 million 
               <br />
               contains little or nothing for public relief. If you 
               <br />
               have a slump in trade it may not be enough to 
               <br />
               cover your $25 million, it would not be enough 
               <br />
               to meet the $28 million to cover your public 
               <br />
               relief. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well, if the slump comes we 
               <br />
