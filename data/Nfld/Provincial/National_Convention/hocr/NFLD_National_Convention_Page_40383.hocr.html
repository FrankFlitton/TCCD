               Major Cashin’s petition to the contrary not- 
               <br />
               withstanding,1 the people of Newfoundland had 
               <br />
               never directly requested the restoration of the 
               <br />
               constitution. That does not prove they did not 
               <br />
               want it; it chieﬂy means they did not have the 
               <br />
               leaders. So by means of the National Convention 
               <br />
               the British government sees to it that they get at 
               <br />
               least representatives, and possibly leaders as 
               <br />
               well. Then the British government tells the

               people of Newfoundland that financially they can 
               <br />

               <br />
               cannot help out any further. A report <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Chadwick</span> 
               <br />
               Jones) is prepared and submitted to the Conven~ 
               <br />
               tion, which amongst other things informs us the 
               <br />
               country is self-supporting. Commissioner Wild 
               <br />
               before leaving the country tells the Convention 
               <br />
               the country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self~supporting.</span> The various 
               <br />
               reports of the Convention when added up will 
               <br />
               show the same situation. What then? What else 
               <br />
               can the Convention do but recommend respon— 
               <br />
               sible government? As representatives of the 
               <br />
               people, they are the people. Again the 1933 
               <br />
               agreement is fulﬁlled. Why then a referendum? 
               <br />
               Why indeed? Why many things? Why, above all, 
               <br />
               the introduction of confederation under the rather 
               <br />
               loose term of federal union? Why the steady flow 
               <br />
               of propaganda reiterating, insisting that the 
               <br />
               referendum involve three issues, none of which 
               <br />
               is representative government? Why should there 
               <br />
               be two forms of one form of government on a 
               <br />
               referendum, the second of which, confederation, 
               <br />
               is in reality an act of union with a larger state, 
               <br />
               which by its very appearance on a ballot paper 
               <br />
               presupposes that the people have already sig- 
               <br />
               nified their desire for self-government? For we

               <br />
               which they would like me to do, is that any real
