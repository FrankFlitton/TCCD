               don’t seem to agree with him As regards the

               <br />
               question there is one thing I would like to bring 
               <br />
               before the Convention. See Black Book, Volume 
               <br />

               <br />

               Federal Taxation. The federal govem-

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of confederation the former field of taxation 
               <br />
               was quite unimportant, but the introduction 
               <br />
               of the income tax in 1917 greatly increased 
               <br />
               its importance as a source of revenue, until 
               <br />
               today the federal government collects about 
               <br />
               30% more revenue through direct taxation 
               <br />
               than through indirect.

               I don’t know what you think about that, but it 
               <br />
               appears to me that that is the ofﬁcial lie of ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               liars, or something like that. You will ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               from 1946 and 1947 the direct taxes of Canada 
               <br />
               were $1,155,000,000, and the indirect were 
               <br />
               $1,045,000,000. Where does the 30% come in? 
               <br />
               There’s another answer to this question. I made 
               <br />
               a statement standing here over a year ago that we 
               <br />
               were signed, sealed and delivered, and that a 5 
               <br />
               cent stamp or a taxi fare could bring the terms 
               <br />
               into this house. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               If we will go back to 1946-47 we will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the direct taxes of Canada were $1,436,000,000, 
               <br />
               and the indirect were $1,122,000,000. l have the 
               <br />
               lot, the 1945—46 taxes were $1,453,373,000, and 
               <br />
               indirect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$821,485,000.</span> I will skip the others, and 
               <br />
               we will go back to 1942-43, and we ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               direct taxes of Canada were $1,378,000,000, 
               <br />
               while the indirect taxes were $758,677,000. Now 
               <br />
               I don’t know much about percentages, when the 
               <br />
               time was for me to learn percentages, I was given 
               <br />
               a haul hook to try to get a few logs out of the 
               <br />
               woods so that I could eat, but there is the position. 
               <br />
               This summer, when the Ottawa delegation came 
               <br />
               back, mention was made of the lot of work they 
               <br />
               had done, and the amount of stuff they brought 
               <br />
               back; but if the Black Book is right on the 30% 
               <br />
               business, it goes a lot further back because the 
               <br />
               difference of $1 10 million today between the two 
               <br />
               don’t work out together. I am not going to say any 
               <br />

               more, but I am going to leave it to you gentlemen 
               <br />
               here. I think you have got savvy enough to 
               <br />
               remember this: that this was got ready for us, and 
               <br />
               the whole thing was worked out so that we would 
               <br />
               fall right into the trap. Now I am going to quote 
               <br />
               Prime Minister Winston Churchill: “I wonder 
               <br />
               what manner of men they think we are”. Is it 
               <br />
               possible that they can push that stuff in print and 
               <br />
               shove it down our throats and expect us to believe 
               <br />
               it? I said it here to my own men who believe in 
               <br />
               responsible government, that it was prepost- 
               <br />
               erous, and it could not be, but it was and is so. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now referring back to our ﬁrst subject ~— 
               <br />
               taxes that our sister provinces are paying today 
               <br />
               (if we become a sister province) — that is some- 
               <br />
               thing that I have been trying to get a hold of, so 
               <br />
               that I could tell the people of this country the kind 
               <br />
               of taxes we are going to get up against when we 
               <br />
               change over from what we are today. Now don’t 
               <br />
               think I am against the kind of taxes they have in 
               <br />
               Canada. One thing we found out since we came 
               <br />
               here is that the economy of our country is around 
               <br />
               $80 million. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">don't</span> think it is any more, and I 
               <br />
               ﬁrmly believe that if our economy were doubled 
               <br />
               to $160 million, I would consider this confedera- 
               <br />
               tion very quick, because I think their form of 
               <br />
               taxation could be worked on the people, and the 
               <br />
               service that it calls for could be given to the 
               <br />
               people today.

               We were brought in here and, as it were, the

               confederation issue was thrown into our lap -—- 
               <br />
               everything that would make us understand, a 
               <br />
               generation of men without a big lot of schooling, 
               <br />
               everything should be put before us so that we

               could understand the system of confederation 
               <br />
               and what it means. Instead of that we have got up 
               <br />
               and painted a rosy picture of “marching up to 
               <br />
               Zion” — everything all right. The poor people

               Mr. Chairman, I shall have to refer to localities

               in Newfoundland in comparison with localities 
               <br />
               in Canada, to bring my point out, and I hope in

               this way to establish a foundation for what I am 
               <br />
               trying to bring before the house. It has been said 
               <br />
               that we can run this province on so much per 
               <br />
               head, $43 per capita. This leaves me in a fault... 
               <br />
               Let us review the situation like we should. This
