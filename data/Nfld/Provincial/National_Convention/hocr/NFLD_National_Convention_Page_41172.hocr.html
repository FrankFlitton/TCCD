               Old age pensions. Everyone agrees with old

               <br />

               We cannot wait until we have a surplus to in- 
               <br />
               crease old age pensions, and there should be no

               <br />
               last, a few days before our delegation arrived in

               tion, Mr. Bracken, said: “This government 
               <br />
               promised two years ago, in this public document 
               <br />
               I have read, a pension plan which would provide 
               <br />
               for the elimination of the test... This government 
               <br />
               then proposed to eliminate the means test. Now 
               <br />
               they are bringing forward a measure which 
               <br />
               retains the means test. They promised old age 
               <br />
               pensions at 70, all to be paid by the Dominion. 
               <br />
               They now bring forward a measure in which they 
               <br />
               leave 25% of the cost to be paid by the provinces. 
               <br />
               And the proposed old age pensions for people 
               <br />
               between the ages of 65 and 69, half to be paid by 
               <br />
               the Dominion and half by the provinces. Yet there 
               <br />
               is nothing of that in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">billl..."</span> And further on in 
               <br />
               the debate, M. J. Coldwell, leader of the Co- 
               <br />
               operative Commonwealth Federation, spoke in 
               <br />
               the same strain: “1 want to make a plea again this 
               <br />
               afternoon, for the complete abolition of the 
               <br />
               means test. I see no reason whatever for continu- 
               <br />
               ing this humiliating test, which is entirely un- 
               <br />
               necessary. In another act the government has 
               <br />
               recognised the validity of not applying the means 
               <br />
               test. They have recognised this in connection 
               <br />
               with childrens’ allowances.”
