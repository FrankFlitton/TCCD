               Government. This administration has, in my

               opinion, done a good job generally speaking; it is 
               <br />
               not an ideal form of government to have per-

               <br />
               tem that has caused untold troubles in the world, 
               <br />
               a system that lost the American colonies to 
               <br />
               Britain, and was probably the cause of the war in 
               <br />
               South Africa. In Newfoundland it has probably 
               <br />
               outlived its usefulness, and I think the time has 
               <br />
               arrived to take more of our responsibilities on our 
               <br />
               own shoulders. But let us give credit where credit 
               <br />
               is due, the Commission of Government has done 
               <br />
               some good work during its tenure of office; it has 
               <br />
               been an honest administration, it has undoubtedly 
               <br />
               put the civil service on a more businesslike basis 
               <br />
               than any of our own governments ever did; it has 
               <br />
               given our young people a better opportunity to 
               <br />
               advance in that service, and to feel that their 
               <br />
               positions do not rely on changes of government. 
               <br />
               It has increased our social services in the matter 
               <br />
               of health services and education, although much 
               <br />
               still remains to be done. It has endeavoured to 
               <br />
               give us good roads, though undoubtedly they 
               <br />
               overdeveloped the ﬁsheries. It must be conceded 
               <br />
               that they had large revenues to accomplish all 
               <br />
               this, but it also shows they had the will to do it. 
               <br />
               They may have made mistakes, but who doesn’t? 
               <br />
               We should at least be thankful to the British

               government and the Commission of Government
