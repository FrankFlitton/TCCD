               measure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self~support;</span> as a country is developed 
               <br />
               its standard of living is measured accordingly. As 
               <br />
               an example, compare the standard of living in the 
               <br />
               United States and Canada, 100 years ago with 
               <br />
               that of today. Do likewise for Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               judge for yourselves. I maintain that we in New-

               foundland have progressed in parallel with our 
               <br />
               western neighbours. Iam not trying to convey the 
               <br />
               idea that our standard of living is equal with those 
               <br />
               countries, but rather, our program has been com- 
               <br />
               paratively even. I want you to consider our 
               <br />
               retarded development of the ﬁrst two centuries 
               <br />
               after discovery, which, historians claim, was 
               <br />
               planned as a deliberate act, We were a very late 
               <br />
               starter in the race of progress.

               As far as the revenue and expenditures are 
               <br />
               concerned, for the period which the Committee 
               <br />
               had under review, if we go back further than that, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that for very near a century, since 1856 
               <br />
               to 1947, this country has accumulated a national 
               <br />
               debt of only $72 million. If we consider the late 
               <br />
               start of our national life, and if we consider the 
               <br />
               cost to Newfoundland for her participation in two 
               <br />
               world wars, then I maintain that our national debt 
               <br />
               is a paltry sum indeed. Perhaps if our national 
               <br />
               debt was ten times as great, we would have more 
               <br />
               friends. The Committee has shown quite clearly 
               <br />
               that as far as revenue and expenditure was con- 
               <br />
               cerned, the record is good, most deﬁnitely good.

               There is another section of the report on which

               I want to say something, and that is in regard to 
               <br />
               agriculture. The Committee has not been too 
               <br />
               optimistic in their forecast. Our agricultural <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in«</span>

               <br />
               twice its present value. I want to point out some 
               <br />
               very pertinent facts. During the 20 years imme- 
               <br />
               diately proceeding World War II, this country 
               <br />
               imported approximately $60 million worth of 
               <br />
               farm produce. This volume of imports was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comv</span> 
               <br />
               posed of only those articles of food which can be 
               <br />
               produced here in this country by our local 
               <br />
               farmers. I am going to quote three items of food 
               <br />
               imported during the 20 year period mentioned: 
               <br />
               imports of eggs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">——</span> 3,361,300 dozen; milk — 
               <br />
               50,140,920 liquid lbs.; meats - over 
               <br />
               380,899,700 lbs. Or, if we take it another way, 
               <br />
               and include imports of vegetables we ﬁnd a total 
               <br />
               of over 300,000 tons of food imported during 
               <br />
               those 20 years. Here we have one of the causes 
               <br />
               of our troubles, an undeveloped and unorganised 
               <br />
               agricultural industry. This condition can and 
               <br />
               should be corrected. I believe that with the proper 
               <br />
               farm marketing organisation, and with more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en«</span>

               couragement and determination on the part of our 
               <br />
               citizens to obtain their requirements from our 
               <br />
               local farmers, such a large volume of imports can 
               <br />
               be considerably reduced.

               I am declaring myself in support of the 
               <br />
               opinion that this country is self-supporting now, 
               <br />
               and we can continue to be self-supporting in the 
               <br />
               future. I for one am proud of our historic record,

               Lord Amulree to the contrary notwithstanding, 
               <br />
               and I feel that we would have made progress

               along regular and ordinary lines without the in-

               called boom of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">non»productive</span> prosperity. We

               are no different from other people of the world in 
               <br />
               matters of native ability, industry and vision. 
               <br />
               What the future hold for us is anybody’s guess. 
               <br />
               That holds good for every country, and our future 
               <br />
               depends entirely upon our own efforts to make 
               <br />
               that future as bright as possible.
