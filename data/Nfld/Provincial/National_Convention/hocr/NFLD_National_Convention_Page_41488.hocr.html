               Christ had in mind when he enjoined us to feed

               True it is that without vision the people perish;

               but without three square meals a day, they perish 
               <br />
               just as surely. And anyone who doesn’t think so

               Now to turn to the motion before the Chair. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, after making it quite clear 
               <br />
               beyond a shadow of doubt that he has resolved 
               <br />
               the problem of perpetual motion, has seen ﬁt to 
               <br />
               terminate his endeavours in this Convention by 
               <br />
               asking us to recommend to His Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government in the United Kingdom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat</span> among 
               <br />
               the forms of government to be submitted to the 
               <br />
               people in the forthcoming national referendum 
               <br />
               should be confederation with Canada upon the 
               <br />
               basis submitted to the National Convention on 
               <br />
               November 6, 1947, by the Prime Minister of 
               <br />
               Canada. Beyond a doubt, Mr. Smallwood in 
               <br />
               moving this motion is seeking a result which a 
               <br />
               great many people in this island desire. It may be 
               <br />
               a matter of great surprise to some that any con~ 
               <br />
               siderable body of people should desire any such 
               <br />
               thing. To many members of this Convention who 
               <br />
               have undertaken to decide in their omniscience 
               <br />
               to restrict the people’s choice, and even to prefer 
               <br />
               what they should vote for, it may well appear an 
               <br />
               outrage that there should be any considerable 
               <br />
               body of opinion to the contrary of their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">View,</span> But 
               <br />
               there is a considerable body of opinion to the

               What I have been at pains to try to decide for 
               <br />
               myself in the whole matter of this motion has 
               <br />
               been simply this: is there anything in the 
               <br />
               proposed arrangements themselves that puts 
               <br />
               them beyond and outside the pale of rightful 
               <br />
               submission to the people of Newfoundland - in 
               <br />
               other words is there something in them intrinsi- 
               <br />
               cally evil? Personally, I have come to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that it does not devolve upon me to seek 
               <br />
               to determine here if the proposed arrangements 
               <br />
               for union are fair and equitable, or even if they 
               <br />
               are adequate. That is a decision for the people. 
               <br />
               And time and time again throughout history the 
               <br />
               collective common sense of the whole people has 
               <br />
               proved more adequate than has the collective 
               <br />
               common sense of the people’s popular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as«</span> 
               <br />
               semblies. And in this instance I am quite prepared 
               <br />
               to leave this matter in the people’s hands. And 
               <br />
               what I am concerned with here, is to decide 
               <br />
               whether there is any rightful impediment in the 
               <br />
               way of endorsing these proposed arrangements 
               <br />
               as a referendum alternate.

               I have been listening for many weeks to the 
               <br />
               Don Quixotes of the National Convention tilting 
               <br />
               at the windmills of the proposed arrangements for 
               <br />
               union. I must give them credit for supplying the 
               <br />
               wind that drove the very windmills they were 
               <br />
               tilting at. But as far as I am concerned, no 
               <br />
               evidence has been adduced to indicate that the 
               <br />
               proposed arrangements are not fair and equitable, 
               <br />
               all the ranting and roaring like true New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders notwithstanding. Indeed, it is quite 
               <br />
               apparent that the proposed arrangements do offer 
               <br />
               some advantages in consequence of which the 
               <br />
               lives of our people would be changed for the

               To put the matter in a nutshell, I have come to

               conclude that there is nothing within the 
               <br />
               proposed arrangements themselves that obliges 
               <br />
               me in conscience not to recommend them to the 
               <br />
               people for decision. And so I will recommend 
               <br />
               them. And that will be all that is expected of me
