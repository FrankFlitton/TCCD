               called Weaver Minerals Ltd. got this concession. 
               <br />
               They had to spend $50,000, were given the right

               Canadian and American backing they have spent

               Mr. Monroe and his colleagues visited

               nection with the Labrador boundary dispute, and 
               <br />
               offered to settle the matter with former Premier 
               <br />
               Taschereau for a payment to Newfoundland of 
               <br />
               somewhere in the vicinity of $15 million, and 
               <br />

               foundland was merely to retain the ﬁshing rights.

               Taschereau and his government turned down this 
               <br />
               proposition, with the result that the case was 
               <br />
               heard before the Privy Council in 1926 and 
               <br />
               judgement was given in favour of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in the early part of 1927. Now that case started 
               <br />
               around the early part of this country, when 
               <br />

               <br />
               power claim on the Muskrat Falls started an 
               <br />
               operation, and the Canadian government stepped 
               <br />
               in and claimed it; Dickie went broke, and it was 
               <br />
               not until 1909 that efforts were made to settle this 
               <br />
               case... We won 100,000 square miles, and now

               was granted. He did all the preliminary exploring

               of that area. He is still employed by the Hollinger 
               <br />

               Labrador Mining Company, the future of 
               <br />

               <br />
               Canada and the United States going. No doubt 
               <br />
               some of you have read it. He went so far as to say, 
               <br />
               andI don’t agree with him, that efforts were being 
               <br />
               made to bring that place into production in ten 
               <br />
               months. I think that should have been ten years. 
               <br />
               but I do know they are going to have it in produc- 
               <br />
               tion in five or six years, and I further do know 
               <br />
               that the only interest Canada has in New— 
               <br />

               places in Ontario, nearly 12 million cords of 
               <br />

               <br />
               of wood down there. That should keep two mills 
               <br />
