               Mr. Ashboume I want ﬁrst of all to congratu- 
               <br />
               late most heartily Mr. Newell and Mr. Keough, 
               <br />
               two young men unknown to me until just recent- 
               <br />

               <br />
               debate on this motion, I ask the earnest considera- 
               <br />
               tion of the members present for a few observa- 
               <br />
               tions which I shall make. I wish it to be 
               <br />
               understood that I am regarding this report as a 
               <br />
               valuable one. We cannot be too fully informed on 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial and economic conditions of our 
               <br />
               land. I came to this Convention with an open 
               <br />
               mind, and with a firm desire to ascertain as well 
               <br />
               as I could, for myself and for the people who sent 
               <br />
               me here, a true picture of Newfoundland. Before 
               <br />
               my election I was asked what form of govern— 
               <br />
               ment I favoured. My reply was that I refused to 
               <br />
               have my hands tied. Irealise, sir, that if I had my 
               <br />
               mind made up before I came I might as well come 
               <br />
               and cast my vote and then go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">home...</span> I would 
               <br />
               like to approach this important Convention with 
               <br />
               an unprejudiced mind. This is a View which I 
               <br />
               made clear to my district, and I feel that I lost 
               <br />
               some votes because of my association in former 
               <br />
               days as a member of responsible government; 
               <br />
               some of my constituents may have thought that I 
               <br />
               still favoured responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> I realise 
               <br />
               that in the north there is a very strong sentiment 
               <br />
               in favour of Commission government. The mat- 
               <br />
               ter of selection of Commissioners has often been 
               <br />
               debated, some people preferring a form by which 
               <br />
               the people themselves would elect the Commis— 
               <br />
               sioners. I believe the ﬁshermen and other 
               <br />
               producers in the country, have realised that there 
               <br />
               has been a certain stability and security evident 
               <br />
               for some years, particularly in the ordinary 
               <br />
               marketing of our staple products of the ﬁsheries. 
               <br />
               It is perhaps true that in other sections of New— 
               <br />
               foundland there may be decided preferences for 
               <br />
               some other form of government, or for respon- 
               <br />
               sible government. I have no doubt, sir, that the 
               <br />
               seeming indifference and apathy which was 
               <br />
               reﬂected, particularly in some outports, in the

               small number of votes cast in the election in June, 
               <br />
               was perhaps because the people were not sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               ciently informed about the matter. I had no public

               My ﬁrst experience, sir, with this chamber, 
               <br />
               was as a boy when I stood in the gallery yonder 
               <br />
               and looked down upon this house. The one person 
               <br />
               that I remember was Sir Robert Bond, that great 
               <br />
               statesman that we remember with pride and af- 
               <br />
               fection, who represented the honourable and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> 
               <br />
               toric district of Twillingate, having as its chief 
               <br />
               town the metropolis of the north. This great 
               <br />
               leader in the political arena was one of the 
               <br />
               greatest statesmen Newfoundland ever produced, 
               <br />
               whose wise and stable leadership is a matter of 
               <br />
               history. I remember well Sir Robert, and, al- 
               <br />
               though I cannot at the moment recall his exact 
               <br />
               words, he talked about a bubble which would be 
               <br />
               made to expand and occupy such a large space, 
               <br />
               but which would utterly disappear when touched 
               <br />
               by such a small thing as a pin-point. When the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland decide that it is time to 
               <br />
               take up the duties of responsible government 
               <br />
               there should not be the shadow of a doubt about 
               <br />
               the ability of the people to carry on successfully 
               <br />
               the various tasks of government. It is no easy task 
               <br />
               to govern a country wisely and well. It is an easy 
               <br />
               matter, often times, to borrow money, and much 
               <br />
               easier to spend it, but we all know where that 
               <br />
               generally leads. We have suffered in the past in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and I believe it is largely because 
               <br />
               of a lack of education. Ibelieve that we need here 
               <br />
               in the city of St. John’s a university, and we need 
               <br />
               in our city, and also in our outports, the very best 
               <br />
               teachers that we can procure. The monies now 
               <br />
               being spent on education will, I hope, bring rich 
               <br />
               rewards in the future. I have no doubt in my mind 
               <br />
               whatever, Mr. Chairman, about the honouring of 
               <br />
