               <br />
               every so often. Yet it could be clearly seen that 
               <br />
               they were alive to their jobs and gave us some 
               <br />
               good stuff to think over. May they be followed

               When Mr. Brown told us in his address that he 
               <br />
               came to this Convention with an open mind his 
               <br />
               declaration touched me closely, for I can say also 
               <br />
               that it is my privilege to be sailing in the same 
               <br />
               boat in that reSpect. While I am not in love with 
               <br />
               the dictatorial make-up of Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, I am more concerned over the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">num»</span>

               foundland will be able to afford in the years 
               <br />
               ahead, than I am in particular forms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govemv</span> 
               <br />
               ment at this time, so to that end, and for that 
               <br />
               purpose I am very willing to serve with a feeling 
               <br />
               that there are many rivers to cross in between. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, I had not intended 
               <br />
               to address this assembly at the present time, and 
               <br />
               I don’t intend to do so today for more than five 
               <br />
               or six minutes. I feel it is much more ﬁtting to 
               <br />
               have members outside St John’s do the talking 
               <br />
               at the present time, because we in St. John’s who 
               <br />
               are so much closer to the seat of government have 
               <br />
               a lot to learn from the opinions of outside mem- 
               <br />
               bers. My real reason for rising in this debate was 
               <br />
               because I did not feel justiﬁed in keeping silence 
               <br />
               any longer, having listened to the remarks of the 
               <br />
               proposer of this motion on Wednesday last. I do 
               <br />
               not feel justiﬁed for two reasons, one that silence 
               <br />
               may be considered to give consent to the views 
               <br />
               of Major Cashin, and secondly because I feel that 
               <br />
               his remarks, whilst they may be good politics, do 
               <br />
               not lead to contentment in the minds of the 
               <br />
               delegates. The remarks I object to are these. In 
               <br />
               referring to the undertaking by the British 
               <br />
               government to Newfoundland — “When the 
               <br />
               country is self-supportin g we would have respon- 
               <br />
               sible government given back upon the express 
               <br />
               wish of the people” —— he said, speaking of this 
               <br />
               people, “How can any thinking Newfoundlander

               alone illegal but even ethically improper?” 
               <br />
               Again, in referring to a statement made by Prime 
               <br />
               Minister Attlee that the Commission have in hand 
               <br />
               or are planning to meet our present needs during 
               <br />
               the next two or three years, Mr. Cashin read into 
               <br />
               this statementthe fact that the British government 
               <br />
               intended to enforce Commission rule for two or 
               <br />
               three years. He said again, “Our status, despite 
               <br />
               what may be said to the contrary, is simply that 
               <br />
               of a mock parliament, a discussiOn group, a study 
               <br />
               club." How anybody holding opinions such as 
               <br />
               these can sit as a member of this Convention is 
               <br />
               beyond my understanding, and certainly Major 
               <br />
               Cashin’s doing so is, using his own words, very 
               <br />
               improper. The most scathing part, however, is the 
               <br />
               excuse he gave when he said he was not “a sub- 
               <br />
               servient delegate to a Commission-inspired as- 
               <br />
               sembly, but rather a free and independent 
               <br />
               representative of the people whose interests I 
               <br />
               represent.” The suggestion contained in these 
               <br />
               remarks means that either some or all of us are 
               <br />
               subservient delegates to what Major Cashin 
               <br />
               describes as “a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commission—inspired</span> assembly”. 
               <br />
               I resent that suggestion, and I am sure I resent it 
               <br />
               equally with all of you here today. There is no 
               <br />
               man here who is not a free and independent 
               <br />
               representative of the people, and I defy Major 
               <br />
               Cashin or any other person to say otherwise. I am 
               <br />
               not interested in the background of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion; as far as I am concerned we have been 
               <br />
               elected by the people of this country to ascertain 
               <br />
               if we have or can arrange economic security and 
               <br />
               financial stability. Without these no government 
               <br />
               can be successful. Having ascertained these items 
               <br />
               we must look to the form of government best 
               <br />
               suited to the country. Our fellow countrymen are 
               <br />
               looking to us with great expectations, in fact the 
               <br />
               outside world is also extremely interested in this 
               <br />
               Convention, as we note by the newspaper 
               <br />
               coverage we are receiving. I ask you, can the 
               <br />
               remarks of Major Cashin impress our country or 
               <br />
               outsiders with our ability to solve our problems? 
               <br />
               Let us in all future sessions refrain from all such 
               <br />
               remarks as we heard here on Wednesday last. We 
               <br />
               must remember that the cost of this Convention 
               <br />
               is by no means inconsiderable. The sum of 
               <br />
               $150,000 was set aside to cover this assembly. 
               <br />
               The costs amount to upwards of $800 for each 
               <br />
               day. Unless we are giving service in line with our 
               <br />
