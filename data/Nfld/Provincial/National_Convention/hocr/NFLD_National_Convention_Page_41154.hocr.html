               measure, does not compare with what they have 
               <br />
               at present? Why acquire additional territory that 
               <br />
               Canada appears to consider is merely going to be 
               <br />
               an additional drain on the pockets of her people? 
               <br />
               Various explanations have been advanced, from 
               <br />
               personal pride of the Prime Minister to complete 
               <br />
               a job his predecessors could not do, all the way 
               <br />
               down to the fact that Canada likes us and wants 
               <br />
               to help us. Tucked into the middle of all these 
               <br />
               reasons are the mineral resources of the island, 
               <br />
               but in my opinion the only real reason is our 
               <br />
               strategic geographical position. It is in this con- 
               <br />
               nection that I propose to address you at length 
               <br />
               today.... The United States, as well, recognises 
               <br />
               this fact. North American pressure and economic 
               <br />
               interest tend to take Newfoundland towards the 
               <br />
               United States, and it is the fear of New- 
               <br />
               foundland‘ s becoming a possession of the United 
               <br />
               States more than any other single factor that is 
               <br />
               motivating the evident interest that Canada has in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland.

               Newfoundland, because of its position, pos- 
               <br />
               sesses a meaning that its economic weight alone 
               <br />
               could not give it. It is on the edge of two worlds 
               <br />
               — the North American continent and the North 
               <br />
               Atlantic basin. To the continent it is an outpost 
               <br />
               but in the North Atlantic it forces itself on the 
               <br />
               attention; it is in the forefront of the sailor’s 
               <br />
               thoughts. When soundings are picked up on the 
               <br />
               Banks, America is coming near, and when the 
               <br />
               first landfall is made it is Newfoundland. The 
               <br />
               island is of the continent but not in it. As long as 
               <br />
               faces on the continent were turned westward, 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was forgotten; but for some years 
               <br />
               past, events forced them to turn eastward again 
               <br />
               and so their glance had to rest on it. The island is 
               <br />
               a focus of the lines of force crossing the North 
               <br />

               Human history has alternated between ter-

               the chief centres of movement, the chief routes, 
               <br />
               were within the continents. As a result of the 
               <br />
               discoveries beginning in the 15th century, 
               <br />
               mankind became maritime and the centres moved

               out to what had formerly been distant frontier

               The English thrust into the Americas three
