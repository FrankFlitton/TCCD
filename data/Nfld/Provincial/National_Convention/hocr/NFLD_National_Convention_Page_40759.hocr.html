               It is true that our salt codlish for 1934-35 was 
               <br />
               only worth $5 million and in 1945 it was some 
               <br />
               $17 millions — quite a gap. It is also true we can 
               <br />
               expect reduced prices in our salt eodﬁsh over the 
               <br />
               course of the next few years, but I do not expect 
               <br />
               to see our salt codﬁsh drop in price as low as it 
               <br />
               did in 1934-35. If you say, “Why?”, my answer 
               <br />
               is this: during recent years there has been a 
               <br />
               greater spirit of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperation</span> all over this country 
               <br />
               and our marketing system for salt codﬁsh has 
               <br />
               improved tremendously. There will be no throat- 
               <br />
               cutting, no loss because of shipping on consign- 
               <br />
               merit; more co-operation in every direction, 
               <br />
               which means a steadier, ﬁrmer market and better 
               <br />
               returns. Like every other industry, the salt cod- 
               <br />
               fishery has certain branches and phases that are 
               <br />
               uneconomic, and one of these branches is the 
               <br />
               Labrador ﬁshery. This ﬁshery costs a lot to fit out 
               <br />
               and continues only for three to four months; 
               <br />
               further, during these three or four months, only 
               <br />
               six weeks of fishing may be done. We had men 
               <br />
               come home from Labrador last year and this year 
               <br />
               with no voyages, men who have to go through 
               <br />
               hardship because they have caught no ﬁsh. For 
               <br />
               these men I have deepest sympathy and greatest 
               <br />
               admiration; it is not their fault, the country’s 
               <br />
               fault, but nature’s. I feel it is our duty, knowing 
               <br />
               that these ﬁsheries are uneconornical, to wake up, 
               <br />
               get together, try and ﬁnd the cure for these un- 
               <br />
               economical ﬁsheries. I would suggest centralisa- 
               <br />
               tion, intense fishing of certain areas, more 
               <br />
               versatile boats, better equipment. You may say, 
               <br />
               “Where is this money coming from?” I say, if 
               <br />
               necessary the state should put it up. They have

               ﬁshery. I have been in touch with this fishery

               from an angle entirely different from the pattern 
               <br />

               badly needed all over the world, and will be

               in its infancy. It is only in the last 15 or 20 years, 
               <br />
               that the value of these ﬁsh meals have been 
               <br />
               realised for the purpose of feeding cattle, poultry 
               <br />
               and many other purposes. It is true, as some of 
               <br />
               you have said, since 1940 I have been in this 
               <br />
               business, had hardship and it is true I have made 
               <br />
               no money. But I would like to assure you my faith 
               <br />
               in this industry is greater than ever, and I am sure 
               <br />
               some day I will be rewarded or at least repaid for 
               <br />
               the trouble I have taken. We have today, which 
               <br />
               we never had before, the ﬁlletting of herring, the 
               <br />
               canning of herring by a large Canadian company, 
               <br />
               that has invested close to half a million dollars in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland for the handling of herring, a firm 
               <br />
               that has been for years in the herring ﬁshery of 
               <br />
               Canada, who know their markets and have faith 
               <br />
               in herring as a product. There are many people in

               this country who would doubt that these in- 
               <br />
               dustries can be developed. To them I say, have 
               <br />
               faith, encourage the people who are trying to run
