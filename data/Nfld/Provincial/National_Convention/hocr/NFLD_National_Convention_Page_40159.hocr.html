               <br />
               I have listened attentively to all the speeches. 
               <br />
               Some of the discussion did not appeal to me. I do

               not intend to make a speech, I think time enough

               has been wasted. I will be as concise as I possibly 
               <br />
               can. The motion is that a delegation will be 
               <br />

               deferred, and the reasons offered I consider

               sound. The amendment to the amendment is a 
               <br />
               simple matter of trying to befog the issue. The

               sending of a delegation from this Convention I

               the matter of confederation, or federation must be
