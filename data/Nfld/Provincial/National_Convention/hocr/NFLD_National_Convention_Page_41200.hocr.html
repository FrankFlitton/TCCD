               Newfoundland government credit — while

               Commissioner James stated that our surplus is

               around $38 million, it has been said that it is only 
               <br />
               $30 million. I’m satisﬁed to take the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. I was not a party to the last parliament of 
               <br />
               this country, nevertheless there is one fact which 
               <br />
               cannot be overlooked; only by default on the 
               <br />
               interest on our bonds could we have been able to 
               <br />
               carry on. It may be recalled that the late EC. 
               <br />
               Alderdice, during the campaign of 1932, said that 
               <br />
               if elected he would get all the money he wanted 
               <br />
               within 48 hours. He was elected and what did we 
               <br />
               find? We found he couldn’t get a cent. I am 
               <br />
               stating this to show that we had very little in— 
               <br />
               ﬂuence as a dominion in raising a loan. We could 
               <br />
               not put our own currency on the market as it 
               <br />
               would not be accepted as legal tender in Canadian 
               <br />
               banks. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge 
               <br />
               the last 14 years, but we did not then and we do 
               <br />
               not today exert very much influence in the world. 
               <br />
               If prices soar in Canada, from which country we 
               <br />
               import the bulk of our goods, they will affect our 
               <br />
               prices throughout Newfoundland, and the same 
               <br />
               applies to other countries from which we import. 
               <br />
               It is too bad that some people have great doubts 
               <br />
               about Canada being solvent. I suppose they’re 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁscal year is around $13 billion. And you deduct 
               <br />
               her national debt, an amount of $31/2 billion 
               <br />
               arising out of the war, and a billion dollars spent 
               <br />
               on the rehabilitation of the personnel of the fight— 
               <br />
               ing forces the wealth for one year is almost equal 
               <br />
               to her accumulated debt of 80 years of confedera— 
               <br />
               tion. I don’t feel the crushing burden as being so

               great after this review.

               <br />
               government took the returns of the past fiscal 
               <br />
               year, and I’m satisﬁed the ﬁgures are correct. 
               <br />
               What the amount will be under confederation, 
               <br />
               nobody can accurately foretell. Using the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               of the last ﬁscal year on the basis of Canadian 
               <br />
               scale, gives you the actual account if we had been 
               <br />
               under confederation that year. Future returns can 
               <br />
               only be estimated... Naturally we would not pay 
               <br />
               any duty on goods produced within the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada. Of the $25 million we purchased in 
               <br />
               the United States last ﬁscal year, 80% of this 
               <br />
               would be bought in Canada under union. There 
               <br />
               is an average duty paid of 25%, being $6.25 
               <br />
               million; that would be saved, plus a cheaper 
               <br />
               freight rate from Quebec to St. John’s, 20% less 
               <br />
               than at the present. Are we going to import animal 
               <br />
               and poultry feed from the United States when we 
               <br />
               can import it freight free from Winnipeg under 
               <br />
               confederation? I cannot understand any person 
               <br />
               saying that the Canadian government’s estimate 
               <br />
               of customs revenues is guesswork. The Canadian 
               <br />
               government has complete returns of the $43 mil— 
               <br />
               lion they exported to Newfoundland in the last 
               <br />
               ﬁscal year, and it would be easy to get returns of 
               <br />
               what came into our country from the United 
               <br />
               States, Great Britain and the rest of the world. The 
               <br />
               Dominion government figures would surely be 
               <br />
               more accurate than an individual expressing a 
               <br />
               viewpoint that is mere assumption. The same 
               <br />
               applies to the Canadian government’s liquor es— 
               <br />
               timates... Surely a government which compiles 
               <br />
               statistics of millions of dollars each year, would 
               <br />
               be more likely to be accurate then any one in- 
               <br />
               dividual in Newfoundland. Of course, I am not a
