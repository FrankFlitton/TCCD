               Mr. Smallwood One of the things that would 
               <br />
               happen if Newfoundland ever became a 
               <br />
               province, is that in a number of departments of 
               <br />
               the Government of Newfoundland there would 
               <br />
               not be as many employees needed as they have 
               <br />
               today. Take for example the Auditor General’s 
               <br />
               department which audits everything the govem~ 
               <br />
               ment runs. The government would not be running 
               <br />
               as many things; not as much auditing to be done; 
               <br />
               therefore the department would not need to be as 
               <br />
               big. The same thing applies to a number of 
               <br />
               present government departments. But in View of 
               <br />
               the fact that the Government of Canada would be 
               <br />
               introducing quite a number of new federal ser- 
               <br />
               vices that we have not got today and that they 
               <br />
               would be manning new departments, and must 
               <br />
               employ Newfoundlanders, obviously there will 
               <br />
               be many opportunities for men to be engaged in 
               <br />
               these new departments and for these civil ser— 
               <br />
               vants in Newfoundland departments that would 
               <br />
               not no longer be needed... We discussed that
