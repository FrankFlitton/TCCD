               Mr. Butt Obviously, I would have certain infor- 
               <br />
               mation as suggested by my friend across the way, 
               <br />
               but just as obviously I could not reveal that for 
               <br />
               two reasons. One, I would be in danger of getting 
               <br />
               myself in jail under the Ofﬁcial Secrets Act. But 
               <br />
               more important than that, I held at that time a 
               <br />
               position of trust, and that I would not break. 
               <br />
               However, I’ve been thinking what I could useful- 
               <br />
               ly say which may be helpful, and I would suggest 
               <br />
               it’s just possible that faced with a very difﬁcult

               problem of policy that the Commission of

               Government may have taken certain steps to do 
               <br />
               what would be considered fair, reasonable and 
               <br />
               right in the circumstances. It may be that the 
               <br />
               Americans, the Canadians, both on the military

               Commission of Government and certain other 
               <br />
               bodies, may have sat down together and said, 
               <br />
               “Now what should we do in the circumstances?” 
               <br />
               It just may be that that happened. And, one party 
               <br />
               may have argued that they were not going to pay 
               <br />
               higher than certain wages current at the time in 
               <br />
               the country. The other party may have argued that 
               <br />
               higher wages should be paid and it should be wide 
               <br />
               open. Now any further than that I can’t go, but I 
               <br />
               would say, in all fairness to people with whoml 
               <br />
               dealt at the time, that it caused more than one 
               <br />
               headache, and I think I ought to say out of fairness 
               <br />
               to Sir Wilfred Woods that whether he did rightly 
               <br />
               or wrongly at the time, he sweated plenty as to 
               <br />
               what should be done in the circumstances. I think 
               <br />
               I really ought to say that, regardless of what one 
               <br />
               may think of Commission of Government. 
               <br />
               Whilst I’m on my feet, I would like to refer to 
               <br />
               a question raised yesterday by one of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers, and by another member this afternoon, the 
               <br />
               question of how far a government should go in 
               <br />
               raising or increasing its expenditure from time to 
               <br />
               time. That too is a very difficult question which 
               <br />
               involves a long history of government and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxa«</span> 
               <br />
               tion throughout, shall I say, the western world. 
               <br />
               But ﬁrst, when government had to deal with 
               <br />
               nothing but the defence and maintenance of jus- 
               <br />
               tice and a few other matters such as education, 
               <br />
               the expenditure would naturally be very small. As 
               <br />
               the world progressed, in this country, as in every 
               <br />
               other country, it was felt that more expenditure 
               <br />
               should be spent on social services.1 ....[The only 
               <br />
               way] in which you can get money to spend is to 
               <br />
               take it from the people. But when you take money 
               <br />
               in taxation from the people, you pass it back to 
               <br />
               them in the form of services. So that it does not 
               <br />
               matter a row of pins where you ﬁx the point at 
               <br />
               what you’re going to spend from time to time, as 
               <br />
               long as the people of any country are satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               they want certain things. I entirely agree with Mr. 
               <br />
               Newell on the point that he made about increas- 
               <br />
               ing social <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">welfare.</span> I also want to say that there 
               <br />
               has been left, in dealing with ﬁnancial matters, 
               <br />
               the impression that if one form of a government, 
               <br />
               I’m not mentioning any names, should be ac~ 
               <br />
               cepted it is necessary for us to go back to certain 
               <br />
               conditions. As one person with deﬁnite opinions 
               <br />
               on the form of the government we should have at 
               <br />
               the moment and in the future, I would like to 
               <br />
               disassociate myself with that theory and say that,
