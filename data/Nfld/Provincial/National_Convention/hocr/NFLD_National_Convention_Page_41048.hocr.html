               insulted because Mr. Higgins has asked you

               Mr. Smallwood I was not referring to that. Ido 
               <br />
               not regard that question as an insult. I regard this 
               <br />
               as an insult: I spent from 2:30 to 5:30 pm explain- 
               <br />
               ing these points, then to be asked by a gentleman

               who sat here three or four feet from me right

               throughout that period all these same questions

               was here, and if he is merely asking you to

               no knowledge of Mr. Higgins being here at the

               he please tell me what roads are being built in

               has to ask me. He was a member of the Ottawa

               I take it that Mr. Smallwood means that when 
               <br />
               roads are built they are going [0 be built out of

               Mr. Smallwood That is under union.

               we go into union, if we ever do. and i don‘t think 
               <br />
               we will, there is supposed to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$30</span> million

               earned from monies owed by the Housing Cor-

               poration and individuals, therefore you take $10 
               <br />
               million of that money and you deposit it with the 
               <br />
               Canadian government, which is to be spent on 
               <br />
               current account only. That leaves $20 million 
               <br />
               balance, which is supposed to be capital account, 
               <br />
               from which you would spend, 1 take it, to build 
               <br />
               these roads. Now there is over $9 million of that
