               are in death." Not many days ago, Mr. Justice 
               <br />
               Fox, our Chairman, was amongst us; today, his 
               <br />
               Chair is vacant; his soul has winged its way to the 
               <br />
               God who gave it and we have laid his earthly 
               <br />

               <br />

               unfailing courtesy and kindliness, for his

               <br />
               him many years. My own acquaintance with him

               tury, when we were youths together in the study 
               <br />
               of the law. Even then he impressed me with his 
               <br />
               kindliness and consideration for others, with his 
               <br />
               broad charity and his aversion to speaking ill of 
               <br />
               anyone, with his earnest conception of the 
               <br />
               seriousness of life and with his complete freedom 
               <br />
               from all unworthy motives. That impression, sir, 
               <br />
               has outlived the years and it abides with me still. 
               <br />

               <br />
