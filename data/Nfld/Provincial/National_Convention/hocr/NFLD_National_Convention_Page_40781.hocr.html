               <br />
               there were not any. If there were we will probably

               A lot of our troubles here might have been 
               <br />
               saved if we had agreed at the beginning of the 
               <br />
               debate to deﬁne our terms. I do not hold entirely 
               <br />
               with the view that debating a repon is a waste of 
               <br />
               time. I can sympathise with that view, and par— 
               <br />
               ticularly after hearing some of the debates we had 
               <br />
               on some of the reports. I feel the big question is 
               <br />
               not the report; it is the economic condition of the 
               <br />
               country. If the report serves no other purpose than 
               <br />
               as a starting point from which to assess the 
               <br />
               economic condition, it is our business to evaluate 
               <br />
               the economic condition as we see it, and get on 
               <br />
               with what we are going to do about it afterwards. 
               <br />
               Perhaps if we had deﬁned our terms we would 
               <br />
               have saved ourselves a great deal of needless 
               <br />
               discussion. There is the term “country". There is 
               <br />
               the term “self-supporting”. It has been said here 
               <br />
               that no country is self—supporting; in that case 
               <br />
               there is no use discussing it Suppose we use the 
               <br />
               word “solvent”.... What do we mean by “the 
               <br />
               country?” Do we mean the government of the 
               <br />
               country? I would excuse, readily, any man who 
               <br />
               had spent considerable time in the government, 
               <br />
               if such a one were to consider the country as the 
               <br />
               government. I ﬁnd it less excusable for a repre- 
               <br />
               sentative of the labour movement referring to the 
               <br />
               government as the businessmen of the country. 
               <br />
               Democracy must be in the interest of the 
               <br />
               majority. We must consider whether or not the 
               <br />
               country is economically sound on the basis of 
               <br />
               whether or not the economy is sound in the inter- 
               <br />
               ests of the majority. We must consider whether 
               <br />
               we are completely and 100% self-supporting; we 
               <br />
               are not, if you think of all the people who are 
               <br />
               more self—supporting than in 1934. And yet I 
               <br />
               wonder if that is a fair comparison to make. In 
               <br />
               1934 we were going through unusual times. It has 
               <br />
               been said that the world was upside down. It was 
               <br />
               inside out also. Has the position of the majority 
               <br />
               of the people changed in relation to the economic 
               <br />
               entity that is the state? As one interested in these 
               <br />
               matters in point of view of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperatives,</span> that is 
               <br />
               something which causes me very great concern.

               Also I do not agree with the philosophy which 
               <br />
               expresses itself in these terms, “the poor you have 
               <br />
               always with you”. That was the attitude adopted 
               <br />
               by tired and effete governments a little over a 
               <br />

               the chaos that we have in those countries today. 
               <br />
               The modern statesman does not accept that View. 
               <br />
               It smacks of defeatism. It is certainly not a

               cause they would work harder? No, they 
               <br />
               couldn’t. Because they have a different sense of

               social justice from ourselves; because they have 
               <br />
               a co—operative economy based on that sense of 
               <br />
               social justice. One thing has not changed since 
               <br />
               1934 —— there is just too much of every man for 
               <br />
               himself; we want to make our own little pile

               I ﬁnd very little in the report relating to the

               one discrimination of terms between standards of

               Our scale of living has immeasurably improved
