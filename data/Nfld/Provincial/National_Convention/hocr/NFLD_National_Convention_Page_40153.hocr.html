               we all came into this House with one purpose 
               <br />
               only, to do a job and to show to the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and the world that we can still 
               <br />
               produce legislators in this country; and because 
               <br />
               of that I say we have not done the country or 
               <br />
               ourselves credit by some of the remarks made in 
               <br />
               this debate. In future, please let us try and get our 
               <br />
               minds a little above the old days that this House 
               <br />
               had to put up with in the days of responsible 
               <br />
               government. If we are going to be a board of 
               <br />
               judges, we have to try and be impartial, without 
               <br />
               heat, abuse, or personal scurrility. I am convinced 
               <br />
               that we can do it and there is no necessity of our 
               <br />
               going down to the gutter where we have been in 
               <br />
               the past few days. We should do the job which 
               <br />
               we were sent here to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> For that reason I do not 
               <br />
               see why the decision should be delayed any 
               <br />
               longer than tonight. Once the decision is made, 
               <br />
               let us be ﬁnished with it entirely until the matter 
               <br />
               has to come before us for final decision. I agree 
               <br />
               with Mr. Fudge to the extent that it has meant 
               <br />
               taking sides; it has meant bad committee work 
               <br />
               and in a lot of cases, no committee work at all. 
               <br />
               We should try in future to keep the discussions 
               <br />
               on the level they should be and not let per- 
               <br />
               sonalities come into it. Unfortunately, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has turned this House into a personal 
               <br />
               debate against him. When we have such notices 
               <br />
               in the paper as “They dug the grave but Joe was 
               <br />
               not in it”, it is getting beyond a joke. In view of 
               <br />
               the indeﬁniteness of Mr. Penney’s amendment 
               <br />
               and the general wish of all the delegates to have 
               <br />
               it examined, I am prepared to vote for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amend“</span>

               I have listened to the addresses this afternoon 
               <br />
               of able speakers, and to the mover of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amend!</span> 
               <br />
               ment to the amendment — an old politician, an 
               <br />
               able speaker, and a fine man. His amendment to 
               <br />
               the amendment was put in a very subtle way; but 
               <br />
               I say to members of this House, beware and think 
               <br />
               before you act. Since introducing this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amend&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               ment, 1 have been particularly interested in the 
               <br />
               debate which followed, more particularly the part 
               <br />
               concerning the amendment itself. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amend~</span> 
               <br />
               ment contained few words and that was in strik- 
               <br />
               ing contrast to the motion. Before deciding to 
               <br />
               move an amendment, it seemed to me that there 
               <br />
               was something ﬁshy about the whole resolution 
               <br />
               and I decided to Oppose it. Since then and after 
               <br />
               listening to members‘ expressions of opinion, 
               <br />
               and noting newspaper comments, I am more than 
               <br />
               ever convinced that my sense of suspicion is 
               <br />
               more than justified. Further I believe that there 
               <br />
               was a political attempt to disrupt the feeling of 
               <br />
               this Convention at a ume when it needed peace. 
               <br />
               True, the wording of this attempt was 
               <br />
               camouﬂaged in a fact-finding mission to Ottawa 
               <br />
               at the expense of this country, but I may say that 
               <br />
               my sponsors and friends in the district of Car- 
               <br />
               bonear did not give a priority mandate to study 
               <br />
               the affairs of Canada ﬁrst, they did give me a 
               <br />
               mandate to study and examine the affairs of New- 
               <br />
               foundland first and foremost. That is how I un- 
               <br />
               derstand it. If I am wrong, then I would say that 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">level~headed</span> men made a great mistake in 
               <br />
