               Mr. Higgins You will remember sometime last 
               <br />
               year there was a big announcement stating that 
               <br />
               Bell Island ore had been sold for some ten years 
               <br />
               ahead, some 750,000 tons a year. We questioned 
               <br />
               Mr. Anson and Mr. Archibald and they told us 
               <br />
               that this is not so; but they did feel that if they 
               <br />
               could compete with the prices of ore from Spain 
               <br />
               and the other places, Sweden, etc, that the market 
               <br />
               could be maintained. It is all a question of com- 
               <br />
               petitive prices. They feel if they can continue to 
               <br />
               sell at the market price, that they would get their 
               <br />
               fair share, or their quote. That’s as far as the
