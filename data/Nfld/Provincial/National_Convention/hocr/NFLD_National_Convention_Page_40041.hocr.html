               It is an open question how far any government 
               <br />
               can be held accountable for economic prosperity. 
               <br />
               Personally, I think the matter goes deeper than a 
               <br />
               question of constitutions. It goes to the very roots 
               <br />
               of such organised society as we have. But you 
               <br />
               cannot have political democracy, as far as I am

               <br />
               among ourselves what changes have taken place 
               <br />
               in the ﬁnancial and economic situation since 
               <br />
               1934. Let us drop the oratory and get on with it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Mr. Chairman, we are gathered 
               <br />
               here at a most solemn moment for Newfound- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land.</span> It is a moment every bit as solemn as the 
               <br />
               first moment of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discovery.</span> It is a moment every 
               <br />
               bit as solemn as that when Newfoundlanders first 
               <br />
               congregated in responsible government. For this 
               <br />
               is the time of decision as to whether this land we 
               <br />
               live in can support a community of civilised men 
               <br />
               in such fashion as civilised men expect to be 
               <br />
               supported in this mid-20th century. We must 
               <br />
               make as accurate an estimate as may be possible 
               <br />
               of our capacity to be sufﬁcient unto ourselves, 
               <br />
               and having done so, say whether or not we think 
               <br />
               we can fuse the economics that we must live by, 
               <br />
               and such genius for the political as may be ours, 
               <br />
               into a satisfactory social and political order. It is 
               <br />
               of utmost importance that we should not err in 
               <br />
               our estimate of what the national economy will

               <br />
               our whole purpose. It was that thought which has 
               <br />
               led me to wonder if the holding of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion at this time is not a bit premature. I am not at 
               <br />
               all so certain that this is such a happy moment to 
               <br />
               have to decide what we must now decide. In some 
               <br />
               future year the world would have had time to stop 
               <br />
               vibrating and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postwar</span> pattern of life would 
               <br />
               have become distinct. We could then better judge 
               <br />
               to what extent we could be sufﬁcient unto oursel- 
               <br />
               ves. Five years from now would be a much better 
               <br />
               time to determine whether we will still be able to 
               <br />
               balance our national budget, and what is still 
               <br />
               more important, whether that last forgotten 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman out on the bill of Cape St. George, or 
               <br />
               down on the bill of Cape Norman will still be able 
               <br />
               to balance his budget ﬁve years from now. That 
               <br />
               for me is the ultimate test. T he Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Finance or the Minister for Finance, whichever it 
               <br />
               mightbe, might well go on balancing the national 
               <br />
               budget from now till doomsday but the same 
               <br />
               would be no real indication of a satisfactory 
               <br />
               national economy if there were still those who did 
               <br />
               not eat. For me what matters is not so much 
               <br />
               budget surpluses, as that none should have to 
               <br />
               tighten his belt.

               However, that which we must decide must be 
               <br />
               decided not later than in the days of the forthcom- 
               <br />
               ing national referendum. It is going to be most 
               <br />
               unfortunate for Newfoundland if too many 
               <br />
               people get delusions of grandeur about what we 
               <br />
               are ready for in governments, and insist upon our 
               <br />
               biting off more than we can chew. A year or so 
               <br />
               ago I would have said that there was great danger 
               <br />
               of that very thing happening, for quite a number 
               <br />
               of people seemed to think that we were ready for 
               <br />
               almost anything in government. In the meantime 
               <br />
               many have retreated from that position and are 
               <br />
               now quite content, indeed are now quite insistent, 
               <br />
               that this Convention should give precedence of 
               <br />
               consideration to the economic over the consti- 
               <br />
               tutional. This is, of course, as it should be. Once 
               <br />
               this Convention can come to see somewhat clear~ 
               <br />
               ly the probable shape of economic things to

               been permanent change in the economic and 
               <br />
               financial stmcture of this island, then will our 
               <br />
               task be greatly simpliﬁed. However, how to see
