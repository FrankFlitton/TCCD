               Mr. Hickman ....Mr. Job mentioned it, but I

               Mr. Smallwood Who owns the Clarenville 
               <br />
               boats? To be quite frank with you I felt a bit 
               <br />
               ashamed, for myself only, not for the other mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the delegation, that I had not got that 
               <br />
               matter made absolutely crystal clear when we 
               <br />
               were there. These boats do not belong to the 
               <br />
               Railway — they belong to the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. The Railway, for a fee from the 
               <br />
               government, has been managing them, but they 
               <br />
               do not own them, and when they take over the 
               <br />
               Railway system they don’t have to take over 
               <br />
               boats which the Railway does not own, so it 
               <br />
               seems to me that they would continue to belong 
               <br />
               to the Newfoundland government. The reply he 
               <br />
               has just read out from the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               shows clearly that they think that they belong to 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland government, and under con- 
               <br />
               federation why should they not continue to 
               <br />
               remain the property of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government? The provincial government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland could make an arrangement for 
               <br />
               the Railway to go on managing these boats, or for 
               <br />
               the federal government to manage them, but in 
               <br />
               either case they would be managed in the inter- 
               <br />
               ests of Newfoundland, because Newfoundland 
               <br />
               owns these boats.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hickman The Canadian government got 
               <br />
               some ofﬁcials to value these boats in the event of 
               <br />
               taking them over, and the value was considerably 
               <br />
               lower than we have put on them today. I realise 
               <br />
               our value is higher because of the fact that we had 
               <br />
               to ﬁrst build a shipyard. The most important part 
               <br />
               of the question was: In the event of their taking 
               <br />
               them over would they maintain them in the

               present service? That was not asked, and we have 
               <br />
               not got an answer to it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Frankly I don’t think we need 
               <br />
               doubt that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman I am afraid I am full of a lot of 
               <br />
               doubts. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Because in the Grey Book it says 
               <br />
               they are going to take over the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Railway, including steamship and other marine 
               <br />
               services of the government. And also I would like 
               <br />
               to point out in this respect that another section 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely states that our government would not 
               <br />
               be permitted to subsidise any industry which 
               <br />
               would be in competition with a similar industry 
               <br />
               in any other province of Canada. If we had our 
               <br />
               own steamers we would, in a sense, be subsidis- 
               <br />
               ing the industry. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood There are literally thousands, 
               <br />
               as Major Cashin knows a lot better than Ido, of 
               <br />
               boats, ships in Canada privately owned and 
               <br />
               operated, that are subsidised by the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada. Every little twopenny—half-penny 
               <br />
               boat in the Maritimes is subsidised every year by 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Even at the present time they are 
               <br />
               subsidising them, and not in competition with the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Railway. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I rise to point of order. I understood 
               <br />
               we were supposed to be discussing Commission 
               <br />
               government and responsible government, and 
               <br />
               now we are discussing confederation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I think the point is well taken, 
               <br />
               we are getting far aﬁeld. Before I advert to the 
               <br />
               orders of the day, for the particular beneﬁt of my
