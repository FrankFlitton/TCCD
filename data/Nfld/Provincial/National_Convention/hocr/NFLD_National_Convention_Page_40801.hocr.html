               paradoxes of history -— the paradox which 
               <br />
               drenched this world in blood and at the same time 
               <br />
               was the means of givin g our people enough to eat, 
               <br />
               and placing a few dollars in their empty pockets. 
               <br />
               Yet we are asked by this report to believe that our 
               <br />
               swollen revenues are due to anything but war. 
               <br />
               During those terrible years of conflict and their 
               <br />
               aftermath, Mr. Average Fisherman has enjoyed a 
               <br />
               turn of comparative prosperity and again I use 
               <br />
               that word “comparative” advisedly. Let no one 
               <br />
               imagine that he has been living the full life during 
               <br />
               that period. He had a long leeway to make up to 
               <br />
               regain what the latest period of privation had 
               <br />
               taken from him. His home was dilapidated and in 
               <br />
               serious disrepair. Household utensils and essen- 
               <br />
               tials of all kinds, the very clothing on his bed had 
               <br />
               worn thin or disappeared altogether. Even his 
               <br />
               boat, his traps, his net, his engine, those things 
               <br />
               which claim priority of attention, for by them 
               <br />
               alone he could hope to live at all, suffered sadly. 
               <br />
               Yes he had a long leeway to make up. And it is a 
               <br />
               source of satisfaction to know that to a large 
               <br />
               extent at any rate he has been successful in that 
               <br />
               endeavour. And for that, wartime scarcity of 
               <br />
               food, high wages on transient defence works and 
               <br />
               high prices for his staple products have been 
               <br />
               fundamentally responsible. That, sir, is the story 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundland ﬁsherman as I have known 
               <br />
               him intimately for over 40 years. And yet, we are 
               <br />
               asked to believe that our present levels of com- 
               <br />
               parative prosperity and our revenues are due to 
               <br />
               anything, anything but the war.1
