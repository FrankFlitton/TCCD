               The value of our total productive economy is 
               <br />
               entirely dependent on the economy of countries 
               <br />
               thousands of miles away. The welfare of my last 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman friend down on stormy Cape Freels is 
               <br />
               entirely dependent on the economic standing of

               the Italian, the Greek, the Spaniard, living in 
               <br />
               continental Europe. We have no internal markets 
               <br />

               <br />
               300,000 people eat anyhow? Thus I submit that 
               <br />
               our economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">setup</span> has no similarity in the

               <br />
               this big problem of our ﬁsheries. Probably my

               able friend Mr. Crosbie has something to offer, 
               <br />
               but this I do know, that solving the problem will 
               <br />
               require capital expenditure on a large scale, be 
               <br />
               the source the vested interests or the state. Other- 
               <br />
               wise, the poor forgotten fishermen, every last 
               <br />

               <br />
               quietly wait, till chance or somebody else comes 
               <br />
               along to redeem their fortunes. I’m finished with
