               Mr. Higgins Mr. Secretary, we will stop at that 
               <br />
               point. I would like you to refer to the sections 
               <br />
               which we have read. You will be able to follow 
               <br />
               our comments easier. Get the 1938 act, and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1944</span> act, and I will give you the cements, and 
               <br />
               you can check them yourselves... You will note 
               <br />
               from paragraph 1 of the Quebec act the Hollinger 
               <br />
               North Shore Co. has 3,900 square miles <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">211-</span> 
               <br />
               together. The Hollinger North Shore is a com- 
               <br />
               pany similar in personnel to the Labrador 
               <br />
               Exploration Co. Our concession area is 28,000 
               <br />
               square miles. Paragraph 2 provides that they have 
               <br />
               rights, in that 3,900 miles, from the date of issue 
               <br />
               until 1952, with arenewal period of two consecu- 
               <br />
               tive periods of ﬁve years each, making something 
               <br />
               roughly like 16 years of a free concession area. it 
               <br />
               is not free, because, as you will note from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">para</span> 
               <br />
               graph 3 of that act, during all that time they must 
               <br />
               pay, beginning with $10,000 at the date of issue 
               <br />
               of the concessions, and $6,000 each year during 
               <br />
               the period of the concession. Now this area began 
               <br />
               in 1936 for 20,000 square miles, and continues 
               <br />
               up to 1953, and there is no payment of any kind 
               <br />
               during that time. The only obligation of the com- 
               <br />
               pany is to do work up to $50,000 per year during 
               <br />
               that time. Now both acts provide that the com- 
               <br />
               pany must pay the cost of survey, boundaries, 
               <br />
               etc., in other words thoroughly prospecting and 
               <br />
               surveying the area, and in both acts they have to 
               <br />
               supply the governments, both ours and the 
               <br />
               Quebec government, with all information.

               In Newfoundland the company and its

               <br />
               from 1936 until 1953. They are paying $50,000 
               <br />
               per year, at least they are spending $50,000 per

               they are obligated to spend. Now 1 say, on the 
               <br />
               basis of the land they got from Quebec and on the 
               <br />
               basis of the land they got from Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               we should have been paid, at the date of the issue 
               <br />
               of the concession, the sum of $50,000, because, 
               <br />
               as you will note, the area is roughly ﬁve times as 
               <br />
               great as the area of the Quebec concession. Ours 
               <br />
               is 20,000 miles, theirs is 3,900 miles. For each 
               <br />
               year they had this concession they should have 
               <br />
               paid us $50,000. Now they get, after a period, a 
               <br />
               regular mining license. It is true, and i must point 
               <br />
               out to you in all fairness, that after 1952 the 
               <br />
               company will get the area that they require up to 
               <br />
               2,000 square miles, and at that time they are 
               <br />
               obligated to pay 5 cents per acre for 2,000 square 
               <br />
               miles... My memory of the act is that they have 
               <br />
               the privilege of acquiring 2,000 square miles for 
               <br />
               a ten year licence. At any time within that ten 
               <br />
               years they have the privilege of picking 1,000 
               <br />
               square miles from the 2,000 square miles, and for 
               <br />
               the 1,000 square miles they pick they are entitled 
               <br />
               to get a 40 year further additional period of time 
               <br />
               for 5 cents per acre. In other words ifthey so wish 
               <br />
               they could tie up for 50 years 1,000 square miles 
               <br />
               of Labrador, which 1 presume would be the best 
               <br />
               Labrador ore section, for 5 cents per acre, for 50 
               <br />
               years. Now they would have to pay for that 
               <br />
               $64,000 per year if they took the whole 1,000 
               <br />
               square miles. At the end of that time, or at any 
               <br />
               time during it, they have the right to apply for a 
               <br />
               mine lease. If they take out a mine lease they have 
               <br />
               the right for 90 years to export and exploit the 
               <br />
               mine in Labrador on the concession area. For that 
               <br />
               1,000 square miles they pay a royalty, or a rental 
               <br />
               rather, of 50 cents per acre, so that if they took up 
               <br />
               the full area of the concession, they would have 
               <br />
               payed $320,000 per year in the way of rental. 
               <br />

               If they operate it and, under the act, have to

               <br />
               deduct the amount of royalty that they would 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
