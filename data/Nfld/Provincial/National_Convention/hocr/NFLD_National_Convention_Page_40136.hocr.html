               Mr. Ashbourne I would be remiss in my duty if 
               <br />
               I did not take voice my feelings as regards this 
               <br />
               motion. I feel as a representative of the district of 
               <br />
               Twillingate, that we had the honour to have Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown as our representative for several years. 
               <br />
               When I ﬁrst entered the House of Assembly I 
               <br />
               entered with Mr. Brown, and the late Mr. George 
               <br />
               Grimes, who has entered into his eternal rest. I 
               <br />
               feel I am voicing the sentiments of the district of 
               <br />
               Twillingate, as well as the whole of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, when I say that the people today regret 
               <br />
               this unfortunate accident and sickness from 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Brown is suffering. I know that 
               <br />
               throughout Newfoundland today, as Mr. Brown 
               <br />
               is a national leader for labour, and has fought and 
               <br />
               championed their cause, the whole country is 
               <br />
               waiting for word which we hope will soon be 
               <br />
               given of his recovery. As I said, Mr. Brown was 
               <br />
               a member for Twillingate district, and although 
               <br />
               at one time I opposed him as an independent 
               <br />
               there, yet I will say that in all our dealings 
               <br />
               together we have been very friendly indeed, and 
               <br />
               I trust and pray that it will not be long before we 
               <br />
               regain his service and his influence. He is a very 
               <br />
               responsible man, looking on both sides of an 
               <br />
               argument, fair minded, viewing the pros and the 
               <br />
               cons, and I hope it will not be long before he will 
               <br />
               be again restored to health. In the meantime I 
               <br />
               would like to add my sympathy to his wife and 
               <br />
               relatives at King’s Cove and elsewhere in New- 
               <br />
               foundland.

               Mr. Spencer I was going to say I never knew

               <br />
               that would hardly be true. It is true that I never 
               <br />
               met him until at this Convention, but I have heard 
               <br />
