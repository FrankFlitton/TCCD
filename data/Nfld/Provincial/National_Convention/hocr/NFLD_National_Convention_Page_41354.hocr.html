               completed the ﬁrst part of the task to which we 
               <br />

               <br />

               In the matter of this great final debate based upon 
               <br />
               systems of government I had been hoping for a 
               <br />
               better bargain. I had been hoping that the form 
               <br />
               that would be taken would be different from that 
               <br />
               which has been taken. I had been hoping that it 
               <br />
               would be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three«in«one</span> affair, and that the three

               forms of government that this Convention has 
               <br />
               elected to concern itself with could have been

               As matters stand the motion now before the

               <br />

               <br />
               that yardstick and get it all over with. Indeed, I 
               <br />
               think I may just as well do so, and whatl have to
