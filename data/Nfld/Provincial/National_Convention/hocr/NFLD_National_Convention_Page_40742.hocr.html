               tomorrow afternoon my motion will be to defer 
               <br />
               the other, because I don’t propose to introduce 
               <br />
               the question of that communication from Ottawa 
               <br />
               until the Economic Report has been dealt with. I 
               <br />
               don’ t know why there should be so much difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ty in getting this thing straightened out. Is there 
               <br />
               any object, any adequate object, in dealing with 
               <br />
               tiny meticulous technicalities on a question of 
               <br />
               this kind? I can’t see it. One would think we were 
               <br />
               discussing an intricate point of law upon which 
               <br />
               millions of dollars depended. All we want is to 
               <br />
               get this matter before the Convention at the 
               <br />
               proper time. Deﬁnitely we ought to receive it at 
               <br />
               the earliest possible moment, and if the two mo- 
               <br />
               tions are taken together, as the order stands, it 
               <br />
               simply means that tomorrow afternoon, when the 
               <br />
               order is read, I shall move that it be deferred, and 
               <br />
               the same thing on the next day, if the Economic 
               <br />
               Report has not been ﬁnalised, and on the next 
               <br />
               day, and until we have ﬁnished the Economic 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Report.</span> It does not make any difference as far as 
               <br />
               I can see — any method of doing it so long as we

               <br />
               ference of opinion about it. With Mr. Bradley’s 
               <br />
