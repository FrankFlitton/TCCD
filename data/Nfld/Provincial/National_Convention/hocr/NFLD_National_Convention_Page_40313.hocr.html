               me for diverting a moment or two to the last

               phrase, maybe St. Mary’s pays for it all. I believe 
               <br />
               that the last speaker has a communication on his 
               <br />

               <br />
               fora bridgewhich he thinks it is necessary to have 
               <br />

               district wish to have anything for the district 
               <br />

               <br />
               I feel he should give it to the people. Perhaps he 
               <br />

               Mr. McCormack I think I made it very clear

               <br />
               what the Convention was appointed to do here, 
               <br />

               not here to talk of the needs of our different

               <br />
               that from the beginning we would probably have 
               <br />
               finished up our work by this time. As I told Mr.

               Higgins, if this gentleman wants to have anything 
               <br />

               <br />
