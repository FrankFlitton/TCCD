               within the scope of the Convention for the simple

               reason we are here to ﬁnd out the economic 
               <br />
               position of the country. Great Britain tells us they 
               <br />
               cannot do anything with the US. The Dorninions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce tells us they are not going to try Why not 
               <br />
               let us try?.... The ﬁsh business is the livelihood 
               <br />
               of 50% of the people. Consequently, as a Con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               even if we have to drive it down the throat of the 
               <br />

               There is another matter, the sale of iron ore to 
               <br />
               the United States. We all know some of their 
               <br />
               mines are worked out. It will be ﬁve to ten years 
               <br />
               before Labrador produces. If Lake Superior is 
               <br />
               worked out, there are millions of tons here on Bell 
               <br />
               Island. That would be another trade agreement. 
               <br />
               No effort has been made by the Commission or 
               <br />
               the Dorninions Office to get trade agreements for 
               <br />
               us. When they gave the bases away, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis»</span> 
               <br />
               sion and the Dominions Ofﬁce forgot all about 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland”.</span> They tell us we got some 
               <br />
               labour; we did, at restricted wages. They tell us 
               <br />
               it was to protect us. Do they expect us to swallow 
               <br />
               that? 300,000 people, and they are worried about 
               <br />
               us! The island of Newfoundland is a fortress for 
               <br />
               North America, and both the Canadian and 
               <br />
               American governments are interested in New- 
               <br />
               foundland for that reason. The Commission 
               <br />
               betrayed their trusteeship. I think it was brought 
               <br />
               up at a meeting with the Dominions Ofﬁce, that 
               <br />
               they were trustees, and we were told that the 
               <br />
               bases were gone and that there was nothing they 
               <br />
               could do about it. I am going to support this 
               <br />
               motion whether it receives the consent of the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government or not.
