               <br />
               also to countries. It applies to Newfoundland. She 
               <br />
               must look to herself for her fortune and her 
               <br />
               prosperity. Today she is in a happy position. She 
               <br />
               is one of the most solvent countries in the world. 
               <br />
               She has money, she has brains, she has the assets, 
               <br />
               and she has the men who can govern her and 
               <br />
               protect her sovereign rights. What then is holding 
               <br />
               us back? Why do we hesitate? What are we afraid 
               <br />
               of? Whatis all this talk about tying ourselves onto 
               <br />
               someone else’s apron strings? We are not 
               <br />
               children, we are men! We are the sons of liberty- 
               <br />
               loving people. The job awaits us, and we are able 
               <br />
               to do the job. Then let us get on with it! For 
               <br />
               myself, I have faith in my country and her people. 
               <br />
               Every time the challenge came to our fathers, 
               <br />
               they stood up to that challenge. They fought and 
               <br />
               they won. As I see it, such a call has come to us 
               <br />
               today. And in the historic words of Nelson, 
               <br />
               “Newfoundland expects every man to do his 
               <br />
               duty.” With us, our first duty is to take over the 
               <br />
               control of our country -— to get back what we lost. 
               <br />
               When this is done, then time enough to talk about 
               <br />
               making deals with other countries. After all, what 
               <br />
               do we want from other countries? All we want is 
               <br />
               a chance to do business with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> We only want 
               <br />
               their trade, not their traditions, not their politics, 
               <br />
               not their ideas. All these things we have ourselves 
               <br />
               in full measure, and we don’t want to change 
               <br />
               them for a foreigner’s. As I see it, it is a waste of 
               <br />
               time, a mistake, for us to think of sending delega- 
               <br />
               tions to Canada or anywhere else. If there are a 
               <br />
               certain number of people who are curious to 
               <br />
               know what terms would be offered us by these 
               <br />
               countries, then they could have their desires satis- 
               <br />
               fied by simply having the government of this 
               <br />
               country send a letter asking for such terms. 
               <br />

               I agree with Major Cashin that we should not 
               <br />
               waste time with any lengthy discussion of the 
               <br />
               report before the Chair. We all know now what it 
               <br />
               means without going further into the matter. We 
               <br />
               should now get on with thejob. That job is to give 
               <br />
               the people of the country a chance to express 
               <br />
               themselves by the ballot. If we do not soon do 
               <br />
               this, then there will be no country to hand back 
               <br />
               to the people, and the treasury itself will be 
               <br />
               emptied. In closing, then, I ask that every man, 
               <br />
               woman and child in the country unite their voices, 
               <br />
