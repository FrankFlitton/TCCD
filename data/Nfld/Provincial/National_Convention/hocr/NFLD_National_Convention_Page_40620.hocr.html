               be hypocritical about it, or try to bluff about it?

               <br />
               it? We may take a very dim view of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion government or the Dominions Ofﬁce, but 
               <br />
               whether it is dim or bright, the fact is that they 
               <br />
               both told us that negotiation of trade and tariff 
               <br />
               agreements is a matter between governments. I 
               <br />
               don’t know whether they are right or wrong, but 
               <br />
               they ought to know what they are talking about,

               we deﬁnitely are not a government. Moreover, I

               feel that we are somewhat confusing the people

               <br />
               are getting things confused. Some of the speakers 
               <br />
               have confused matters pertaining to the sending 
               <br />
               of a trade delegation, with a group that we may 
               <br />
               or may not send to seek union with the United

               <br />
               I will be glad to see any delegation going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> I 
               <br />
               have no hard feelings against anyone in the 
               <br />
               United States. I am reminded of the fact that 
               <br />
               George Washington’s father was a great English- 
               <br />
               man, and I think we have reached the time in life 
               <br />
               when, in the very near future, not only those in 
               <br />
               Canada and America must come together more 
               <br />
               closely, but Newfoundland must eventually 
               <br />
               come into some kind of a union with these great 
               <br />
               powers on this side of the Atlantic.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Some speakers have criticised the idea of 
               <br />
               sending a delegation to Ottawa, but seem to 
               <br />
               favour sending a delegation to Washington. I am 
               <br />
               not in that group. I try to be fair towards every 
               <br />
               subject brought before this Convention, and to be 
               <br />
               fair to the people of this country we must give 
               <br />
               sober thought to any resolution that’s brought in. 
               <br />
               We have been severely criticised for turning the 
               <br />
               former resolution down, but I am of the opinion 
               <br />
               that the time is premature for sending this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delega~</span> 
               <br />
               tion to Washington. This is a very delicate matter, 
               <br />
               and we could get ourselves embroiled into some 
               <br />
               pretty hard feelings, because when it comes to 
               <br />
               changing matters of this kind, it strikes very deep. 
               <br />
               I know we need three meals a day, but I believe 
               <br />
               these things could be settled around the table, and 
               <br />
               a closer union than now exists could be brought 
               <br />
               about between Canada, USA and New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and that it would improve the future
