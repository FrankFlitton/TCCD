               two of my questions have not yet been replied to,

               Mr. Cashin We can get it in a minute or two. 
               <br />
               Another point I would like to bring up is this: as 
               <br />
               you know we had a private meeting on Friday, in 
               <br />
               which it was agreed that this Convention would 
               <br />
               be shut out, so to speak, by His Excellency the 
               <br />
               Governor on Friday, January 30. I bring up this 
               <br />
               matter because when the delegation went to 
               <br />
               England, Lord Addison, when a question was put 
               <br />
               to him regarding say two or three forms of 
               <br />
               government there, about making up his mind on 
               <br />
               it, said he might have to seek further advice 
               <br />
               from the Convention. Well, if the Convention is 
               <br />
               out of business, then there won’t be any Con- 
               <br />
               vention to appeal to, and I bring the matter up 
               <br />
               because I feel that the Convention should not be 
               <br />
               dissolved. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Irealise, Mr. Chairman, there’s possibly legal 
               <br />
               technicalities which say that once we have made 
               <br />
               our recommendations, the Convention closes off. 
               <br />
               But I feel that the matter should be brought to the 
               <br />
               attention of the Governor, so that we would know 
               <br />
               the result of these recommendations in one way 
               <br />
               or another. Surely if we make these recommen- 
               <br />
               dations we should know what is happening, and 
               <br />
               we should remain technically a body, not under 
               <br />
               pay, so that it can be called together at a 
               <br />
               moment's notice if necessary. I know some 
               <br />
               gentlemen will be gone, but as Lord Addison 
               <br />
               pointed out and I am not breaking any secrets, 
               <br />
               he would probably have to ask the Convention 
               <br />
               for further advice. If the Convention is disbanded 
               <br />

               he won’t be able to ask it. I bring this to your 
               <br />
               attention so that you can bring it to the proper 
               <br />
               authorities, and see what is going to happen. Say 
               <br />
               we make these recommendations, we are told that 
               <br />
               within 30 days we should know what is going to 
               <br />
               happen from the Dominions Ofﬁce, etc. How 
               <br />
               long it will take them to do this and thatI do not 
               <br />
               know, and I feel that before the Convention is 
               <br />
               ofﬁcially wiped out these things should be set- 
               <br />
               tled. I suggest you take it up with the Attorney 
               <br />
               General, or His Excellency the Governor.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I am rather glad Major Cashin 
               <br />
               raised that matter. As Iunderstand it, the National 
               <br />
               Convention Act, which created this Convention, 
               <br />
               contains no provision for the dissolution of the 
               <br />
               Convention, and certainly the Convention cannot 
               <br />
               dissolve itself. It has no authority to do that. To 
               <br />
               be dissolved I suppose one of two methods would 
               <br />
               have to be adopted; either the government would 
               <br />
               enact a statute to dissolve the Convention, or else 
               <br />
               His Excellency, when he comes here on the clos- 
               <br />
               ing day next week, will issue his proclamation 
               <br />
               dissolving the Convention, and in either way the 
               <br />
               Convention would be dissolved. But the question 
               <br />
               arises — should the Convention be dissolved 
               <br />
               before the referendum is held? His Excellency, 
               <br />
               when he comes here next week, could prorogue 
               <br />
               the Convention instead of dissolving it, and as 
               <br />
               Major Cashin says, we would go on back to our 
               <br />
               own business or work, and would not be meeting. 
               <br />
               But we would still be a Convention for as long 
               <br />
               only as there would be any point or sense in our 
               <br />
               being so, and certainly we would not be under 
               <br />
               pay. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am glad he mentioned that matter of not 
               <br />
               being under pay, because I have been waiting for 
               <br />
               the right moment to point out that there seems to 
               <br />
               be a lot of misunderstanding in the country 
               <br />
               amongst the people on this question. A lot of 
               <br />
               people seem to think we get paid every day, even 
               <br />
               when we have holidays, even when we recess for 
               <br />
               Christmas, even when the Convention is not 
               <br />
               meeting, a lot of people seem to think that our pay 
               <br />
               goes right on as if we were sitting here all the 
               <br />
               time. The truth is that is not so, and when Major 
               <br />
               Cashin says that if the Convention were held 
               <br />
               together until a later day we would not get paid, 
               <br />
               I am glad he made that point, so that nobody 
               <br />
               would think that the only reason we would have 
               <br />
               this thought in our minds now is trying to hook 
               <br />
               more money out of it. We would get no money at 
               <br />
