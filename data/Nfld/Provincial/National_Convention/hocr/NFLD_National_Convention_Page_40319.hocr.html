               <br />
               have to pay more, like all of us. I am not a 
               <br />

               <br />
               big enough to know what human nature is like — 
               <br />
               no doubt I would like a high protective tariff, no 
               <br />
               duty at all on the raw material, but say 50% or 
               <br />
               60% on the ﬁnished article, so that I would have 
               <br />
               a protective tariff of 40% or 50%. That’s ifl were 
               <br />
               a shareholder. I am a consumer, and so are all of 
               <br />
               us, and I am interested only in the cost of living. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Whilst I don’t disagree with you, 
               <br />
               how is the government going to make up the 
               <br />
               difference in their duties under your scheme? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well, Mr. Cashin told us a few 
               <br />
               minutes ago what he said 20 years ago, and I will 
               <br />
               remind you of what I said 20 years ago in the 
               <br />
               MCI..I1 in a debate they had up there. I said the 
               <br />
               day would come in Newfoundland when there 
               <br />
               would be a political party and on their banner 
               <br />
               they would inscribe two words “Direct Taxa- 
               <br />
               tion", not indirect taxation as you have today in 
               <br />
               our customs tariff. The Chadwick-Jones report 
               <br />
               tells us that in the last year they report the per- 
               <br />
               centage of the total revenue was risen to 30% — 
               <br />
               30 cents out of every dollar they took in direct 
               <br />
               taxation, but that still left you 70 cents to the 
               <br />
               dollar that was taken in by indirect taxation. I 
               <br />
               would say it ought to be the other way about - 
               <br />
               70% by direct taxation and not more than 30% by 
               <br />
               indirect taxation. That is what is crucifying the 
               <br />
               people of this country and always did....

               There was a time in Newfoundland when the 
               <br />
               tariff amounted to 8% or 10%. Go back 20 or 30 
               <br />
               years ago, when you got a duty of 20% it was 
               <br />
               something unusual. It was the same as it is in 
               <br />
               Canada today, about 10%. You take all our im-

               is some profiteering, but the real trouble is the 
               <br />

               Mr. Hickman A few of the remarks <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> 
               <br />
               Smallwood has made we have pointed out in the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> He has not taken them into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">account.</span> I refer 
               <br />
               to one remark on page 8, this $4,800,000 which 
               <br />
               he implied, and rightly so, came out of the pock- 
               <br />
               ets of the people who made the money. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im»</span> 
               <br />
               plied that if those local industries were not there 
               <br />
               the people would not have had to pay that money. 
               <br />
               They still would have had to pay it, and perhaps 
               <br />
               more. There are certain local industries that do 
               <br />
               make things cheaper than the imported articles. 
               <br />
               Another thing he said was that local industries are 
               <br />
               driving up the cost of goods. We have found that 
               <br />
               in many cases the tariff has been reduced since 
               <br />
               these companies have been in business. There is 
               <br />
               one, clothing, which ran to 65% duty, and is down 
               <br />
               today to 35% in spite of local industries being 
               <br />
               here.
