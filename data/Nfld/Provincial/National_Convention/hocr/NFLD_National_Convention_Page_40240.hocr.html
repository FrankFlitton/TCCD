               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Russell informs us that the 
               <br />

               from the main line could be used on the branch

               <br />
               the Railway, but by others, that this was on the 
               <br />
               optimistic side, and that it might cost more than 
               <br />
               that. 
               <br />

               To convert to oil will cost $1 million. They 
               <br />
               hope to have it done before 1947 is over.... I may 
               <br />
               say the government has not yet made any appro- 
               <br />
               priation for this outlay, but it is a deﬁnite policy 
               <br />
               adopted by the Railway and approved by the 
               <br />
               government... Similarly with the steamers. They 
               <br />
               have ordered the steamers — that’s a deﬁnite 
               <br />
               commitment, but nothing has been paid on them 
               <br />
               as yet, and the total cost is to be $2.5 million. 
               <br />
               Then they have to buy seven new locomotive 
               <br />
               engines, and that will run to $445,000; freight 
               <br />
               equipment, another $250,000; $4.2 million and 
               <br />
               $3.6 million for rail relaying is roughly $8 mil~ 
               <br />
               lion. That’s capital outlay to be made on the 
               <br />
               railway in the course of the next two to six years. 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins You say also that operating losses

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, because costs of materials 
               <br />
               are still rising. Take, for instance, shipping. I 
               <br />
               understand all controls on shipping in Canada 
               <br />
               and the United States are abolished. During the 
               <br />
               war the shipping boards controlled all shipping, 
               <br />
               and now it has become more difficult than ever.... 
               <br />
               The costs are still going up, and other costs are 
               <br />
               climbing steadily. So long as they do, the losses 
               <br />
               in the operation of the Railway must go on in- 
               <br />
               creasing.

               Mr. Hollett That point raised by Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               interests me very much too. The Committee say, 
               <br />
               “Apart from capital expenditures we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im»</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               likely to increase rather than decline”. I under- 
               <br />
               stood the idea of these improvements was to cut 
               <br />
               down on the operating expense. In view of that, 
               <br />
               why are they impressed that we are liable to get 
               <br />
               greater operating expense in the future? I want

               report is excellent, but there are certain things I 
               <br />
               cannot understand, and this is one of them. Why 
               <br />
               should the Committee say that we are headed for 
               <br />
               increased operating expenses?

               Mr. Smallwood I appreciate what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hollett 
               <br />
               says, and believe he does not rise in any critical 
               <br />
               spirit, and I am grateful to him for his words about 
               <br />
               our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report</span> I am acting merely as spokesman for 
               <br />
               a Committee of ten gentlemen, one of whom is 
               <br />
               no longer a member of the Committee, namely 
               <br />
               our Chairman, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Bradley. We did work hard, 
               <br />
               there is no question of that, and there is a tremen- 
               <br />
               dous amount of knowledge here which we our~ 
               <br />
               selves may not have digested properly.... The 
               <br />
               particular question is in paragraph 4, “Apart from 
               <br />
               Capital Expenditure, etc.” I tell you one thing, for 
               <br />
               example. We have 4,000 men working on that 
               <br />
               railway. I am convinced that the standard of life 
               <br />
               of these 4,000 railroad men must go up, not down, 
               <br />
               and that will give you greater operating costs. I 
               <br />
               am not a railroad man, but 4,000 of our people 
               <br />
               are operating that railway for the benefit of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and I contend that it should not be 
               <br />
               operated at the expense of these men or their 
               <br />
               families. Their ﬁrst charge should be a living 
               <br />
               wage, and a decent standard of life for everyone 
               <br />
               who is working on it, and if we agree to that, 
               <br />
               wages must go up or the cost of living must go 
               <br />
               down. The main point is that these men, as the 
               <br />
               men in the mills in Grand Falls and Corner Brook 
               <br />
               and the mines at Buchans and Bell Island, work- 
               <br />
               ing the public utilities for the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, are just as much entitled to a decent 
               <br />
               standard of life as anyone else.
