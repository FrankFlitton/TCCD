               to the Newfoundland people, especially the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen. It would be a pity to skimp it. We are 
               <br />
               torn between two desires, to get through our work 
               <br />
               on the one hand, and to let the people know what 
               <br />
               is in the report on the other hand. I have not yet 
               <br />
               got a clear picture of what the prospects are for 
               <br />
               the fresh ﬁsh industry in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span> For 
               <br />
               example, we hear in the United States they are 
               <br />
               going into this fresh fish industry on a gigantic 
               <br />
               scale, building new plants, building draggers and 
               <br />
               trawlers in many dozens. In Canada they are 
               <br />
               doing the same thing; Iceland has already done it 
               <br />
               and are doing it even more; in England they are 
               <br />
               starting now on the construction of fresh ﬁsh 
               <br />
               refrigeration plants, and the same in Norway. 
               <br />
               What I am trying to do is to fit Newfoundland into 
               <br />
               that picture for the next four or ﬁve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> What 
               <br />
               is to be the outcome of this industry in New- 
               <br />
               foundland? We have the best fish in the world, 
               <br />
               lovely quality. What are the actual chances of 
               <br />
               marketing? What are the chances in competition 
               <br />
               with Canada, Iceland, Norway, England and 
               <br />
               France? France is building in St. Pierre, they tell 
               <br />
               us, a $4-5 million plant. How are we going to 
               <br />
               market this 30 million pounds of fresh ﬁsh in the 
               <br />
               next few years if the only markets are the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom and the United States, and all the 
               <br />
               countries in the world are trying to get fish into 
               <br />
               these two countries? Now, Mr. Job, I know if I 
               <br />
               could make him mad I could make him talk, but 
               <br />

               Mr. Job I am afraid we can’t give you any more 
               <br />

               <br />
               am not going to go ahead and say what the market 
               <br />
               will become; he can draw his own conclusions as 
               <br />
               well as we can. I believe the markets will come 
               <br />
               back, but when he talks of expansion in the USA, 
               <br />
               it is fresh ﬁsh expansion, not frozen ﬁsh expan-

               Mr. Hollett On page 2 of the Appendix: 
               <br />
               “Another heavy investment is in draggers, say 
               <br />
               around $350,000." I wonder if the Committee 
               <br />
               inquired as to the number ofsmall and young fish 
               <br />
               that were killed and had to be thrown away? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job It is so new that really we have not had 
               <br />
               time. These draggers have been going only about 
               <br />
               six months. Perhaps Mr. Crosbie could shed 
               <br />
               some light on that. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Crosbie My experience with draggers is 
               <br />
               that very little ﬁsh is thrown overboard. There’s 
               <br />
               a good deal of small ﬁsh caught, but most of them 
               <br />
               go down the hold with the other fish. We know 
               <br />
               what is brought in, but not what is thrown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">away,</span> 
               <br />
               With regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood’s question, I am 
               <br />
               not so pessimistic as some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> In this country 
               <br />
               we only know one fish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—~</span> cod. Actually it is only 
               <br />
               one of the many varieties of fish that are required 
               <br />
               in the ﬁsh business. I think it has a tremendous 
               <br />
               future in this country over the next four or five 
               <br />
               years. There are markets that we have not heard 
               <br />
               about, and have never gone to look for. We don’t 
               <br />
               actually know what conditions are. There is 
               <br />
               Brazil, these peeple consume a lot of fresh fish. 
               <br />
               With regard to competition from the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, I don’t think we are going to have any. 
               <br />
               Their catch will be all consumed in England and 
               <br />
               very little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exported,</span> iceland‘ 5 production is being 
               <br />
               bought by Russia, and probably will be for the 
               <br />
               next few years. I don't think we will have much 
               <br />
               competition there.
