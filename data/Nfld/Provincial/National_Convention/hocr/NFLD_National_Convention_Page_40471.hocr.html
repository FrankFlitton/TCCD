               Mr. Ashbourne This matter of old age pensions 
               <br />
               is listed under the section on welfare which we 
               <br />
               have not yet come to. There are certain regula- 
               <br />
               tions under which old age pensions are granted. 
               <br />
               It is not everyone who attains the age of 75 years 
               <br />
               mat can send in to the government and get his 
               <br />
               cheque. He is supposed to be pretty much in need 
               <br />
               of the old age pension. Still, he does not have to 
               <br />
               be in destitute circumstances. Up to quite recent- 
               <br />
               ly, I think, the man was allowed to have $250 in 
               <br />
               the bank if he belonged to the outports. He could 
               <br />
               have a somewhat larger figure, $400, in St. 
               <br />
               John’s. Although he had that amount in the bank, 
               <br />
               if the relieving ofﬁcer, after investigation of his 
               <br />
               circumstances, approved of his application, the 
               <br />
               old age pension could be granted. I believe it is 
               <br />
               now $400 in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outports.</span> Naturally an aged 
               <br />
               person who had worked hard in the fishing boat 
               <br />
               and on the land and had attained the ripe old age 
               <br />
               of 75, should not have to be penniless before he 
               <br />
               could get the pension. I do not think a man with 
               <br />
               $100 would have any difﬁculty in getting an old 
               <br />
               age pension.

               Mr. Newell I think when we drew up this table 
               <br />
               we felt that it was something the members would 
               <br />
               study at their leisure. Therefore we did not draw 
               <br />
               the conclusions. Two of the largest amounts 
               <br />
               spent have been on salaries and maintenance of 
               <br />
               institutions. Salaries are just about eight times 
               <br />
               what they were in 1934-35 - the total spent, not 
               <br />
               the individual salaries. The same is true of hospi— 
               <br />
               tals and other institutions. Approximately eight 
               <br />
               times. What 1 was going to suggest is, that our 
               <br />
               report is in two sections — public health as read 
               <br />
               and public welfare which we are about to read. 
               <br />
               The ﬁgures in between are applicable to both. 
               <br />
               These ﬁgures will have more meaning if they 
               <br />
               were taken up after having read the welfare <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sec»</span>
