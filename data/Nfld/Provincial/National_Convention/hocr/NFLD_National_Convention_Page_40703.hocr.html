               What has happened to make our main forest

               <br />
               ﬁgures are swollen because prices have gone up, 
               <br />

               over for two years, therefore they cannot be the 
               <br />

               man, who will tell me sincerely and honestly that

               the present price of newsprint is not the result of 
               <br />

               <br />

               will not believe him, because I know that these

               prices are the result of the war, and the wartime 
               <br />
               boom. How can we adopt that part of the report, 
               <br />
               saying as it does that these inﬂated revenues of 
               <br />
               the government, and of the AND Co., the 
               <br />
               Buchans Company, Bowaters, Bell Island and all 
               <br />
               the other companies, that these inﬂated values are 
               <br />
               just the ordinary result of the growth of these 
               <br />
               industries, and are not the result of wartime 
               <br />
               boom? I don’t believe it, and I don’t believe the 
               <br />
               people of this country are going to believe it 
               <br />
               either, and I for one will not vote for that report 
               <br />
               so long as that section is in it. Not only that 
               <br />
               section, but there are several others I would want 
               <br />
               taken out before I can support it, because I do not 
               <br />
               believe that the report is an accurate, true, fair 
               <br />
               account of our country’s economy now or in the 
               <br />
               years to come. It is neither correct nor fair.... If it 
               <br />
               was an honest report, realistic, trying to face the

               <br />
               kind of government. The railroaders want to

               kind of government when the referendum comes 
               <br />
               around next spring. That, Mr. Chairman, this 
               <br />
               report is not. It is neither fair nor accurate. It is 
               <br />
               optimistic and it should not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">optimistic,</span> It 
               <br />

               report does not do it, and as such this Convention 
               <br />
               should not adopt it, and as such the people of

               Newfoundland should spurn the report and throw
