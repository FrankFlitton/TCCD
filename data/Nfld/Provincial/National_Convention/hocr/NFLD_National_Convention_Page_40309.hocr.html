               In this district there are quite a number of

               sawmills which support quite a number of

               <br />

               is not done — if we need say one hundred

               feet of lumber, we will have to import it from 
               <br />
               Canada, which to my idea should not be 
               <br />
               necessary.

               They must cut wood to erect stages, and they

               <br />
               ested in what remains. The people in our section 
               <br />
               were greatly disappointed when we realized that 
               <br />
               there would not be a mill on the Gander River, 
               <br />

               was also hoped that mill would be able to utilise

               a considerable quantity of the timber on the

               natural resources will be so utilised that they will

               the people who make this survey will be com-

               be run on a co-operative basis, but unfortunately 
               <br />
               we are a small country. While we have many
