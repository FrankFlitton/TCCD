               Smallwood, while you are speaking in this House 
               <br />
               you are addressing the Chair. I am not concerned 
               <br />
               at all with how people listen to the speeches all 
               <br />
               over Newfoundland. There has been too much of 
               <br />
               that altogether. You are talking to the Chair in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place, and I am not going to be concerned by 
               <br />

               <br />

               In fairness to you, Mr. Smallwood, I want to 
               <br />
               say this: that if you persist in repeating, then it 
               <br />
               may very well be that you are running the risk 
               <br />
               that I will have to hold that you are indulging in 
               <br />
               tedious repetition and are therefore out of order. 
               <br />
               As to the alternative of destroying you or any 
               <br />
               other individual here, I don’t think I need make 
               <br />
               any comment on that. But if you persist as you 
               <br />
               have been going, I will have to ask you to avoid 
               <br />
               as nearly as possible, if you will, repeatedly stat- 
               <br />
               ing the same thing, even though you do say it in 
               <br />
               a different form.

               Mr. Smallwood May I ask, in connection with 
               <br />
               the words “tedious repetition”, does that refer to 
               <br />
               repeating a certain fact over and over and then 
               <br />
               making the statement again in different ways? 
               <br />
               Does it mean repeating the same topic over and 
               <br />
               over, or does it refer to describing that topic over 
               <br />
               and over?

               Mr. Chairman If the statements made by you 
               <br />

               <br />
               employed, or phraseology employed may be 
               <br />
               slightly different in each case or not, if you are

               <br />
               ing tedious to the Chair, then, if any member 
               <br />
               raises that point of order, I will have to rule that 
               <br />
               this tedious repetition is out of order.
