               Smallwood, because I am not anxious at all to 
               <br />
               paint a gloomy or pessimistic picture, but the 
               <br />
               position is really this: that in order to qualify the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst thing you have to do is literally rent your own 
               <br />
               home from yourself. You place a value on it of 
               <br />
               say $20 a month, say $240 a year. That is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con«</span> 
               <br />
               sidered as part of your yearly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">income,</span> You stated 
               <br />
               that yourself. Let’ s accept that as a fact. Now then 
               <br />
               the pension is valued next — $30 a month, $360 
               <br />
               a year—so that gives us the $600. In other words 
               <br />
               a pensioner can’t really have any income outside 
               <br />
               the home he is living in, and the pension he hopes 
               <br />
               to receive. That is really the position isn’t it? If 
               <br />
               he has any other income he can’t qualify for a 
               <br />
               pension on that income or be assisted in some 
               <br />
               way or another. Is there such a thing as a part 
               <br />
               pension, say $100 a year, or $200 a year? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, of course. If an old age 
               <br />
               pensioner has a house in Joe Batt‘s Arm, and it is 
               <br />
               valued at $240 a year, that is $240 a year income 
               <br />
               he has — if it is valued at $20 a month, which is 
               <br />
               pretty high; $20 a month in most outports would 
               <br />
               be very, very high. It is nearer $5, or $6 or $8 or 
               <br />
               $10 a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">month,</span> But if it is valued at $240 a year, 
               <br />
               $20 a month straight, then he can still make $100 
               <br />
               ayear, but that cuts his pension by $100 a year, 
               <br />
               and instead of getting $360 a year then he gets 
               <br />
               $260. 
               <br />

               Mr. Vardy In other words you may be getting 
               <br />
               $240 a year from the government towards your 
               <br />
               pension, and I may be getting $360. Is that it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, that’s right.

               Mr. Vardy I never heard it explained that way. 
               <br />
               I did not know that such a scheme existed. I 
               <br />
               thought you had to qualify or disqualify for your 
               <br />
               pension. Let us assume that is the position. There 
               <br />
               is one undeniable fact, isn’t there Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood, in fairness to these people that we owe the 
               <br />
               whole truth to, it is a fact that they must hold their 
               <br />
               property while they are drawing the old age pen- 
               <br />
               sion from the state, and in the end ﬁnally the state 
               <br />
               would take the position that if the sons or 
               <br />
               daughters refused to assist in any way towards 
               <br />
               their support, that it would be the state’s right, if 
               <br />
               they accepted the old age pension under these 
               <br />
               conditions, to step in and take over sufﬁcient of 
               <br />
               the property to repay the state for the amount they 
               <br />
               had paid out in old age pension? I take it that’s 
               <br />
               the true position isn't it? Give the people the 
               <br />
               facts, that’s my idea.

               Mr. Smallwood That‘s right. I thought I had

               said that. Now bearing on that, as I said before 
               <br />
               the old age pension is only given to people who 
               <br />
               need it. It is not meant for people who don‘t need 
               <br />

               <br />
               pension by age, in other words he is 70 years of 
               <br />
               age, then they come to ﬁgure the income of that 
               <br />
               person, mother’s allowances will not be included 
               <br />
               as income. You can get mother’s allowance of 
               <br />
               course, but you would be pretty old at 70 to get 
               <br />
               mother’s allowance, but there may be cases of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span>

               <br />
               children under 16, but that is not counted as 
               <br />
               income, cost of living allowances are not counted 
               <br />
               as income... If a man gets a military allotment

               from a son or daughter in active service in time 
               <br />
               of war that is not counted as income. Direct relief 
               <br />
               is not counted as income. Casual gifts of small

               Auditor says this house in Joe Batt’s Armis worth 
               <br />
               $9 a month (the same house in St. John’s might 
               <br />
               be worth a lot more), but it’s taken $3 a month to

               Whatever the average cost of maintaining the

               value. I don’t know if there is any other point

               <br />
               make this observation. Here Mr. Starkes could be 
               <br />
               of a great deal of help if he would be so kind. The 
               <br />
               question is: “What is the value of the average 
               <br />
               home in the outports?” Now I know there are 
               <br />
               places in Newfoundland besides the outports, St. 
               <br />
               John’s is not an outport, but thinking for a minute 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outportsl</span> What is the average home worth? 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy puts it at $5-800, or $1,200—1,500. He 
               <br />
               did not get up as far as $2,000. In Admiral’s Cove 
               <br />
               in Mr. Starkes’s district there are four persons of 
               <br />
               70 and over. No, I have got the wrong district, I 
               <br />
               mean Mr. Goodridge’s district. In Aquaforte, 
               <br />
               there are four persons. In Bay Bulls 46, in Bear 
               <br />
