               in the least afraid of discussing these so-called

               conﬁdent that when the people have been shown 
               <br />

               that I see in them only a camouﬂage, a deceit and 
               <br />
               a bait that is being used by those who plot against

               several years ago. And when the story is told, it

               despatch in the Daily News not a single word is
