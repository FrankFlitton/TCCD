               ful if ever a dollar will come back to us. The 
               <br />
               government of the United Kingdom must think 
               <br />
               we are a mighty generous country. This business 
               <br />
               began in 1941-42, when the sum of $3.8 million 
               <br />
               was passed over, free of interest, to Great Britain. 
               <br />
               At the same time they had to raise a loan of $2.1 
               <br />
               million from the United States to put our railway 
               <br />
               in good shape for war purposes, on which we had 
               <br />
               to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2V2%</span> annual interest. There’s frenzied 
               <br />
               ﬁnance for you, if ever there was. There’s honest 
               <br />
               handling of the people’s money by trustees. We 
               <br />
               shipped out of this country $4 million as an 
               <br />
               interest—free loan, and then turn right around and 
               <br />
               hang on our people’s neck a debt which, up to 
               <br />
               now, has cost them in annual interest nearly 
               <br />
               $200,000. 
               <br />

               Again in 1942-43 the trick was repeated. 
               <br />
               Another burst of generosity at our expense, and 
               <br />
               another $4 million leaves our shores. Again it is 
               <br />
               interest free, and we are told without the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom asking for the loan, and again our Com- 
               <br />
               missioners go out and borrow this sum from our 
               <br />
               own people, $1.5 million at 3 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1/29/22</span> annual interest, 
               <br />
               whilst our people invested some $400,000 in war 
               <br />
               savings certiﬁcates. What can we say of this sort 
               <br />
               of thing, this taking in two years almost $8 mil- 
               <br />
               lion and sending it right out of the country? In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place we lost the interest we should be 
               <br />
               making on it. We are losing this money just as if 
               <br />
               it had been stolen from us. It is just as if our 
               <br />
               treasury had been looted by thieves. What else 
               <br />
               can I call it but large scale plunder? And if Mr.

               <br />

               tribute thievery and plunder to the government? 
               <br />
               Can anyone do that with impunity? Is that in

               Mr. Cashin Oh no, foolish people don’t do

               things like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that!....</span> All we in Newfoundland know 
               <br />
               is that we have been deprived of what should be 
               <br />
               ours. Let us trace this claim. In 1943-44 still 
               <br />
               another $25 million shipment went from our 
               <br />
               treasury, and again it went without any interest. 
               <br />
               What a wonderfully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self«supporting</span> country they 
               <br />
               must have thought us! And again in that year, the 
               <br />
               old trick of borrowing another $2 million at an 
               <br />
               annual interest rate of 3%, to add another yoke to 
               <br />
               the neck of our taxpayers. This year we did some- 
               <br />
               thing extra, by way of a tilly, as it were. Those 
               <br />
               gentlemen who do business in the outports will 
               <br />
               appreciate it better than I do — a man who buys 
               <br />
               ten gallons of molasses ﬁgures he should get 
               <br />
               another gallon for “tilly”. We sent other monies 
               <br />
               to redeem a loan which was not due for another 
               <br />
               year, and thereby lost another $50,000 in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest.</span> 
               <br />
               The ﬁnal spasm was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194445</span> when the Com- 
               <br />
               mission sent out another $2 million to Great 
               <br />
               Britain under the usual interest-free conditions. 
               <br />
               The total of this whole business shows that the 
               <br />
               local agents of the government took $12 million 
               <br />
               of our money and loaned it free of interest, whilst 
               <br />
               at the same time they borrowed between <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">39-10</span> 
               <br />
               million. In short, whilst they went looking for 
               <br />
               loans of $9 million on which they knew we had 
               <br />
               to pay interest, they gave away $12 million free 
               <br />
               of interest. Now if the member for Bonavista can 
               <br />
               show you or me that such conduct was giving a 
               <br />
