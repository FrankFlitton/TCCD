               the various armed forces of Canada —— it being a 
               <br />
               well—known fact that the people of French 
               <br />
               Canada were not enthusiastic to take part in any 
               <br />
               wars that did not involve their homeland directly. 
               <br />
               Mind you, there were several outstanding French 
               <br />
               Canadian regiments, but it is generally speaking 
               <br />
               I am talking about. The same thing applied to the 
               <br />
               First World War. This corrupt legislation has cost 
               <br />
               the Canadian nation and the Canadian taxpayers 
               <br />
               over $200 million annually. The same immoral 
               <br />
               legislation is now being held out as a bait to the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to induce them to join 
               <br />
               the federal union; but I would like to point out 
               <br />
               that there is no deﬁnite indication that this par- 
               <br />
               ticular legislation will be continued. As a matter 
               <br />
               of fact, there are thousands of Canadian citizens 
               <br />
               throughout the entire Dominion of Canada who 
               <br />
               are advocating its repeal. And in view of the fact 
               <br />
               that Canada is today in a difﬁcult ﬁnancial posi- 
               <br />
               tion, having to impose further taxation on its 
               <br />
               already over~taxed people, it is not unlikely that 
               <br />
               this legislation will be stricken from the statutes 
               <br />
               within a very short period.

               forget that the taxpayers of the country will be
