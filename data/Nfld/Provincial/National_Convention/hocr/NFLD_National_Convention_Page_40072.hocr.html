               Mr. Vardy I am not referring to increases in

               Mr. Wild The general government policy is to

               defer all capital expenditure to a time of lack of

               The answer is that all this is extremely needful. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt My question is quite simple. I would 
               <br />
               like to know if the government has ever at- 
               <br />
               tempted to draw an international balance of pay- 
               <br />
               ments, which would include not only our visible 
               <br />
               assets but our invisible ones. How do you base it 
               <br />
               when you come to look for a trade preference for 
               <br />
               example?

               Mr. Wild We have actual figures of exports and

               at some time or other we will have to come to that.

               Mr. Wild One of the troubles lies with our our-
