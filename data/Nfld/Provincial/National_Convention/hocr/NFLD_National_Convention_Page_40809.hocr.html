               people who have had such a dreary existence, this 
               <br />
               was a great light, and they rejoiced in the fact that 
               <br />
               an industry was started. It had a very checkered 
               <br />
               beginning, but it did do good. And now this 
               <br />
               morning I was shattered in my hopes for these 
               <br />
               people to hear that this company has gone into 
               <br />
               liquidation. It is something more than another 
               <br />
               company gone broke. The coast is left stranded 
               <br />
               at a late pan of the season, when the ﬁshery was 
               <br />
               very, very poor, so poor that there was nothing 
               <br />
               left on the coast as a result of the ﬁshery, or 
               <br />
               practically nothing. All supplies for the winter 
               <br />
               depended upon the industries, upon Goose Bay 
               <br />
               and the Labrador Development Company, and 
               <br />
               upon the government. There is very little upon 
               <br />
               the coast by way of groceries and supplies to 
               <br />
               carry them through the winter. . .. The people were 
               <br />
               depending, on this part of the coast, upon the 
               <br />
               work that would be given them by the Labrador 
               <br />
               Development Company. In that area the popula- 
               <br />
               tion is 400 people, 165 children. In the immediate 
               <br />
               vicinity there are 500 people, another 160 
               <br />
               children —— north and south there is a large 
               <br />
               population coming to the Labrador Development 
               <br />
               Company to look for work rather than depend 
               <br />
               upon the government to supply them with dole. 
               <br />
               Even before the ﬁshery stopped as many as 200 
               <br />
               men poured into Port Hope Simpson in the hope 
               <br />
               of getting work. The usual quota of the company 
               <br />
               is 150 people; that is quite a strain upon the 
               <br />
               supplies — 250 men calling upon them. Conse- 
               <br />
               quently the food had been all used up even before 
               <br />
               the boats left the coast for the year. They are in 
               <br />
               pretty desperate need.

               I am not in a position to make any pronounce—

               wisdom or justice of the company’s going into 
               <br />
               liquidation. This is how it strikes me. Here is a 
               <br />
               company cutting wood in Labrador; there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plenr</span> 
               <br />
               ty of wood, plenty of labour, the market is open, 
               <br />
               prices are generous, and this company is not 
               <br />
               absolutely broke. They have some credits on the 
               <br />
               other side of the Atlantic in sterling. They have 
               <br />
               applied to the government for some help. As I 
               <br />
               understand it the government has not seen ﬁt to 
               <br />
               grant their request -— a mere $200,000 — to 
               <br />
               enable them to carry on, to send supplies in and

               <br />

               <br />
               is one thing certain: the government will have to 
               <br />
               do something. They will have to send a supply 
               <br />
               boat to feed these people. There are about 900 of 
               <br />

               wonder if it would not be better for the govern-

               reliable. I understand this company is composed 
               <br />
               of genuine, reliable, honest men of this country 
               <br />
               — no question about that ~— this company is in

               inconvertibility of sterling. I do not see why the 
               <br />
               government is not able to tide them over, let the 
               <br />
               company send in supplies and let the men earn an

               <br />
               on the dole as they will have to. Some may say 
               <br />
               that is not a matter for the Convention. That is not 
               <br />
               the way I see it. It is the job of the Convention to 
               <br />
               consider that there is another one of our industries 
               <br />

               I do not want to be unkind, but it seems rather 
               <br />
               strange that the Economic Committee could 
               <br />
               write such an optimistic report when, while they 
               <br />
               were writing it, our most northerly industry was 
               <br />
               going into liquidation and our most southerly 
               <br />
               industry ~— the mining operation at St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               — has been closed during the summer for want 
               <br />
               of hydro-electric power. That is a thing which 
               <br />
               shows there is a very vital weakness in the 
               <br />

               northerly industry is going into liquidation, there 
               <br />
               is our labour leader telling us that the camps are 
               <br />
               just about ﬁnished cutting, and we have been 
               <br />
               reminded that so many of our men rely upon that 
               <br />
               cut to tide them over; in view of these facts,‘l 
               <br />
               cannot but help thinking that the Committee
