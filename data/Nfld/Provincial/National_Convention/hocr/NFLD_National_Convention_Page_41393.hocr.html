               other motion covering any other form of govern~ 
               <br />
               merit. In that connection, before I come to deal 
               <br />
               with the form of the motion itself, rule 39 says, 
               <br />
               “In discharging its duties to make recommenda- 
               <br />
               tions to His Majesty’s Government in the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom as to the possible forms of future govem— 
               <br />
               ment to be put before the people at a National 
               <br />
               Referendum, the Convention shall include in its 
               <br />
               report to the Secretary of State for Dominions 
               <br />
               Affairs the opinion of each several member of the 
               <br />
               Convention as to the form of government which 
               <br />
               in his opinion should be put before the people, 
               <br />
               together with any preference which he may 
               <br />
               choose to express as between one form of govem- 
               <br />
               ment and another.“ The rule therefore requires 
               <br />
               the Convention to express or record the opinion 
               <br />
               of each and every member of the Convention as 
               <br />
               to the form or forms of government which in his 
               <br />
               opinion should be put before the people; and 
               <br />
               secondly, shall also record any preference which 
               <br />
               he may choose to express (he does not have to) 
               <br />
               as between one form of government and another. 
               <br />
               In other words, this rule requires the Convention 
               <br />
               to record the opinion of each and every member 
               <br />
               of the Convention on the form or forms of 
               <br />
               government which he thinks should be included 
               <br />
               in the referendum. Now the question is whether 
               <br />
               or not the motion in its present form prevents the 
               <br />
               very thing that rule 39 requires to be done. That 
               <br />
               is to say, could any member or members express 
               <br />
               their opinions upon any forms of government 
               <br />
               other than the two referred to in the motion? I do 
               <br />
               not know how you feel about this, Mr. Higgins, 
               <br />
               but I feel the motion quite deﬁnitely confines the 
               <br />
               Convention to recommending the two forms of 
               <br />
               government covered by your motion, and these 
               <br />
               two forms only.
