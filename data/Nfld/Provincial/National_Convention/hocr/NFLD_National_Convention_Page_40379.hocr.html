               Some may say that I am inconsistent in that I 
               <br />
               voted for sending a delegation to the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               cal afﬁliations with England demand that this

               <br />

               <br />
               Commission made no stipulation as to the subject

               Mr. Harrington Mr. Chairman, on the night of 
               <br />
               Wednesday, October 20, I943, at a Jubilee dinner 
               <br />
               in the Newfoundland Hotel, I proposed a toast to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. In my toast, besides many other 
               <br />
               things, I said: “In spite of even the latest sample 
               <br />
               of mismanagement, every bit as deliberate as the 
               <br />
               former anti—settlement laws in its eventual pur- 
               <br />
               pose to hinder rather than to help, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               today, through a combination of world events is 
               <br />
               standing on the threshold of our inevitable des- 
               <br />
               tiny, the geographical centre of the empire of the 
               <br />
               air.” The “latest sample of mismanagement” 
               <br />
               referred to, was as everyone knew, the regime 
               <br />
               known as Commission of Government. It was 
               <br />
               with a sense of vindication that I heard members 
               <br />
               of this Convention during the debate last Decem- 
               <br />
               ber on the Report of the Committee on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Transpor»</span> 
               <br />
               tation and Communications, say the same thing 
               <br />
               in different words. Principally it was said in 
               <br />
               connection with the sections of the report dealing 
               <br />
               with Gander and tourism, and I made particular 
               <br />
               note of Mr. Higgins’ expressing himself in words 
               <br />
               to this effect: “It seems as if the Commission of 
               <br />

               Two months after the speech referred to, I 
               <br />
               succeeded Mr. Smallwood as “The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">litarrelman“l</span> 
               <br />
               and as editor ofThe Newfoundlander.2 I inherited 
               <br />
               his historical mantle and as I believed, his politi- 
               <br />
               cal philosophy, which was identical with my 
               <br />
               own. At least it was then. For the past three years 
               <br />
               I have made no secret of my political philosophy. 
               <br />
               On the radio and in The Newfoundlander I 
               <br />
               stressed the doctrine of self-help; that New— 
               <br />
               foundlanders would only progress by their own 
               <br />
               efforts; that a dictatorship, however benevolent, 
               <br />
               was a monument of shame to people who had 
               <br />
               governed themselves, wisely or unwisely, well or 
               <br />
               unwell, under representative institutions since 
               <br />
               1832 and under responsible government since 
               <br />
               1855. I believed that in 1943. l believed it long 
               <br />
               before that. I believe it now.

               <br />
               to The Daily News in 1945, in which I stated flatly 
               <br />
               that in my opinion there was only one course 
               <br />
               open to us, namely, that we should seek to return 
               <br />
               immediately to full responsible government. 
               <br />
               “Otherwise”, I said, “we are a lost people." Had 
               <br />
               I been divinely inspired I don't think I could have 
               <br />
               been more prophetic.

               Early in the spring of 19461 was asked to take

               <br />
               choice I took the negative side. The debate, which 
               <br />
               took place in a well-known literary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">association4</span>
