               <br />
               wildly absurd, so obviously a thing of sending the

               On behalf of the people whom I represent and 
               <br />
               myself, I wish to record my strong resentment at 
               <br />
               the derogatory and insulting manner in which we 
               <br />
               have been treated by the Dominions Ofﬁce, and 
               <br />
               in the interests of all Newfoundland I say that, 
               <br />
               being aware of this position, it is high time that 
               <br />
               we did something about it. To use the words of 
               <br />
               Winston Churchill, “What kind of people do they 
               <br />
               think we are anyhow?” Do they think we have no 
               <br />
               intelligence? Do they think we have no national 
               <br />
               pride? Do they think we do not resent such un~ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calledvfor</span> treatment?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Some months ago in a radio address, I ex- 
               <br />
               pressed myself to the effect that if New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders did not soon take over their country, 
               <br />
               there would be nothing left to take over. I have 
               <br />
               that same feeling today. It is an old story now, 
               <br />
               about the bartering away of our national assets. 
               <br />
               But the thing still goes on, and the tragedy of it is 
               <br />
               we are doing nothing to stop <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Sometime ago this

               Mr. Chairman, not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slightest.</span> Indeed, I doubt

               if this Convention has been given the courtesy of 
               <br />
               a reply to their request. It was only a few days ago 
               <br />
               that a further act was passed giving further con~ 
               <br />
               cessions on the Labrador to outside parties, and 
               <br />
               we have no doubt that as time goes on further 
               <br />
               contractual obligations will be made involving us 
               <br />
               to the tune of many millions of dollars of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ture in adeeper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bondage,</span> You will remember that 
               <br />
               at the beginning of this Convention we were 
               <br />
               furnished with a ten~year programme for the ex- 
               <br />
               penditure of some $60 million. This programme 
               <br />
               is actually being carried out today by the Com- 
               <br />
               mission government itself, without any notice 
               <br />
               being taken of this Convention. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am aware there are those amongst us who 
               <br />
               seem obsessed with the peculiar idea that the 
               <br />
               problem of Newfoundland can be dealt with as 
               <br />
               one would a problem in mathematics; that it is 
               <br />
               something which can be worked out by the rule 
               <br />
               of three. They seem to want somebody to come 
               <br />
               and show as a mathematical certainty that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland will never know another bad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day,</span> 
               <br />
               They want a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gilt~edged</span> guarantee that there will 
               <br />
               be no more depressions in the world, that there 
               <br />
               will be no more wars, no more bombs, no more 
               <br />
               ups or downs in either politics or commerce. 
               <br />
               They want to be assured of the exact number of 
               <br />
               fish we are going to catch ten years from now, the 
               <br />
               number of trees we are going to cut, the number 
               <br />
               of tons of ore we are going to extract from our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mines.</span> And if we can’t perform this miracle of 
               <br />
               exactly prophesying all these things. they will say 
               <br />
               that we are not self-supporting ~ that we had 
               <br />
               better not take a chance, there may be a depres- 
               <br />
               sion in 1950 or even 1960, and we had better go 
               <br />
               in with some other country that has no depres- 
               <br />
               sions, no wars, and no business cycles. Why the 
               <br />
               thing is so absurd, so hopelessly impractical, that 
               <br />
               I would not mention it at all but for the reason that 
               <br />
               there are people who actually think this way. I 
               <br />
               ask, what country, what individual, what 
               <br />
               businessman expects to be able to have a
