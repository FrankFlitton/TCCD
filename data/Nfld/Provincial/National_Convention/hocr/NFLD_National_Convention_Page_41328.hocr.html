               Mr. Chairman, it is a recognized fact that the

               government’s Department of Supply picked their 
               <br />

               <br />
               groups, call them what you like. Perhaps these are 
               <br />
               the parasites that Governor Walwyn referred to 
               <br />
               in his farewell address, in which he said: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The cost of living here is terribly high, but 
               <br />
               I hope it will tend to fall before long. I am 
               <br />
               assured on the highest authority that this high 
               <br />
               cost of living is not due to the high duties on 
               <br />
               necessities, but is due to the high proﬁts and 
               <br />
               the excessive proﬁts being made locally. 
               <br />
               There are too many middlemen and commis— 
               <br />
               sion agents, who are really parasites on the 
               <br />
               community. 
               <br />
               This expression, coming from no less a person 
               <br />
               than a past chairman of the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, does not speak well for that body, 
               <br />
               but rather veriﬁes my statement of what can be 
               <br />
               and is being done with the help of governments 
               <br />
               to feed parasites rather than destroy them. It has 
               <br />
               been said that it was rather late for the past 
               <br />
               chairman to make this expression in his farewell 
               <br />
               address. Maybe it was a little late, but it was much 
               <br />
               earlier than the rest of the Commissioners.

               I know that none of the Commissioners will 
               <br />
               attempt to say that they fail to see where any evil 
               <br />
               was committed. If they do, we could all rejoice 
               <br />
               that such men did not have charge of the govern— 
               <br />
               ment of England at the time when Hitler began 
               <br />
               his threat to dominate the world. If they could not 
               <br />
               see from the very day that the Supply Department 
               <br />
               was instituted and its committees formed, that it 
               <br />
               meant the domination of the trade of this country 
               <br />
               by a few, then they were too small or indifferent 
               <br />
               to realise what was going to take place; I hope we 
               <br />
               won’t, as a body of Newfoundlanders entrusted 
               <br />
               by our fellow men to help to put things right. In 
               <br />
               order to put things right, we must regard this 
               <br />
               Convention as a declaration of war against 
               <br />
               domination, manipulation and intrigue, and I 
               <br />
               hope we will meet with the success that the Allied 
               <br />
               armies met with against Hitler’s domination.

               Mr. Chairman, again I do not want to be 
               <br />
               misunderstood. I know and agree that price con-

               <br />

               <br />
               essential; but the handling of the textile business 
               <br />
               by the Department of Supply was abused right 
               <br />

               <br />
               criminated against. If there is any person who 
               <br />
               would like to dispute what I have said, let us ask 
               <br />
               ourselves the question, “Did we know of any 
               <br />
               ceiling price on a suit of clothes, or anything in 
               <br />
               the drygoods line during the war?” No, sir, we did 
               <br />
               not, and I say without fear of contradiction that 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government did help big 
               <br />
               business, and in doing so took a delight in upset- 
               <br />
               ting the business of the outport importer; and 
               <br />
               again I repeat, the fishermen and workers of this 
               <br />
               country lost at least 30% on their purchases. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman, perhaps you do not grasp the 
               <br />
               means whereby monopolies were created by the 
               <br />
               establishment of the Supply Department. I will 
               <br />
               make an attempt to point it out to you. When an 
               <br />
               outport importer needed goods from any foreign 
               <br />
               country, the ﬁrst thing he had to do was apply to 
               <br />
               the Supply Division of the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government for a certificate of essentiality. That 
               <br />
               application had to go before a committee of men 
               <br />
               who were that man’s competitors. In other words, 
               <br />
               they were the wholesalers of St. John’s. They 
               <br />
               were given the privilege of being able to dive into 
               <br />
               that man’s private business, and even preventhim 
               <br />
               from getting any goods. Perhaps you may ask in 
               <br />
               what way they could do that. Well, here is an 
               <br />
               example. I know of a man who in 1942 applied 
               <br />
               for a certiﬁcate of essentiality for a quantity of 
               <br />
               goods from New York. When his goods were 
               <br />
               packed and addressed ready for shipment, an 
               <br />
               agent from Newfoundland appeared at the ware- 
               <br />
               house in New York and seeing the address on two 
               <br />
               cases of goods he inquired from that ﬁrm if they 
               <br />
               shipped to that man. When being told they had 
               <br />
               been shipping to that man for a considerable time 
               <br />
               he simply put the gun to the shipper by saying, 
               <br />
               “If you ship that man these two cases you will 
               <br />
               have to cancel our ten”, with the result that that 
               <br />
               man got no goods from the ﬁnnsince. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               Now these are the acts of the Commission of
