               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves.</span> It has been made abundantly clear by 
               <br />
               you, sir, and by many other speakers, that this 
               <br />
               Convention was elected to make recommenda- 
               <br />
               tions on form or forms of government, and in my

               opinion any member of this assembly relegating 
               <br />
               to himself the right to think for another is assum- 
               <br />
               ing a prerogative that never was his. Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               said the terms were fair; that is the opinion of a 
               <br />
               legal mind. Mr. Bradley approves and recom- 
               <br />
               mends them; again the opinion of a keen, legal 
               <br />
               brain. Great sections of the island have given 
               <br />
               their moral support to this issue, and yet we have 
               <br />
               members who will get up and say, “No, con- 
               <br />
               federation has no right to be on the ballot." Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman and gentlemen, I can assure you in all 
               <br />
               sincerity, to make such a statement in my district 
               <br />
               would not only be sheer folly, but it would be 
               <br />
               positively dangerous, and as the elected repre- 
               <br />
               sentative for Bonavista North I demand that con— 
               <br />
               federation be placed on the ballot. I have also 
               <br />
               supported the other forms being put there as well. 
               <br />
               Critics have been trying hard to build up a case 
               <br />
               against tlte people having a choice. They have, 
               <br />
               with great forcefulness, invoked the almost 
               <br />
               sacred covenant of letters patent, the act suspend- 
               <br />
               ing responsible government. They might as well 
               <br />
               have read themselves a chapter out of Charles 
               <br />
               Dickens’ Oliver Twist, it would have been more 
               <br />
               entertaining and much more humourous. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or»</span>

               he will swing the big stick next May), cares as

               <br />
               row of beans. What concerns him at the moment 
               <br />
               —— and it is very important —— is his freedom of 
               <br />
               choice, the right to make his own decisions.
