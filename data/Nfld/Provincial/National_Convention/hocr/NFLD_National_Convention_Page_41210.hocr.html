               before us on the question of confederation I

               believe that I am correct in saying that the

               dollar under the Canadian set-up as compared

               ticular and the nature of those taxes payable as 
               <br />

               possible to have a fair knowledge of the whole

               Mr. Chairman, speaking of faith, faith in our-

               selves, faith in our neighbours, we can only show 
               <br />
               our faith in the common sense, sound reasoning 
               <br />
               power and good judgement of our fellow men by 
               <br />
               being honest and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abovevboard,</span> by furnishing 
               <br />
               truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
               <br />
               The peOple of this country do not expect to get 
               <br />
               something for nothing. They have not been 
               <br />
               brought up that way. And because they have not 
               <br />
               been brought up that way, all who are respon- 
               <br />
               sible, they want to know how much they have to 
               <br />
               contribute towards providing these things. 
               <br />
               Speaking of family allowances, old age pensions 
               <br />
               —— these are good things, without a doubt. I have 
               <br />
               for years been greatly interested in the question 
               <br />
               of providing a decent pension for our old age 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen. I introduced a scheme at the opening 
               <br />
               of this Convention but the Convention having no 
               <br />
               legislative powers, nothing could be done about 
               <br />
               it.... I ﬁnd myself not quite in agreement with the 
               <br />
               Canadian pension scheme as outlined in the act 
               <br />
               before us. First, the age is quite unsuitable... It is 
               <br />
               too late in life and then again there is the claim of 
               <br />
               the pension authorities upon the estate of the 
               <br />
               pensioner. I do not like the scheme and am con-

               between now and the day of the referendum, that 
               <br />
               our people will have gleaned a general

               <br />
               shall have to make a choice. Whatever our future

               there must be a full realisation of the necessity of

               when we shall be called upon to make a grave

               called upon in our day to make, a most serious
