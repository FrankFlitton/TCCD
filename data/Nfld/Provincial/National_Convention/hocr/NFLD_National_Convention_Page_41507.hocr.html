               <br />
               foundland, and they will set up no divorce court 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, unless ~— and here I ask you 
               <br />
               to pay special attention —— unless we ask them to 
               <br />
               do it. And that, sir, we are not very likely to do, I 
               <br />
               am sure you will agree. The Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada has power to set up a divorce court in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland if we go into confederation Yes, 
               <br />
               that is a fact, they have the right and the power. 
               <br />
               But they will not use that rightunless we ask them 
               <br />
               to do so. Never in all Canada’s history has the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Canada used its power to set up a 
               <br />
               divorce court in a province unless and until that 
               <br />
               province asked for it. Ontario asked for it, and 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island asked for it, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliav</span> 
               <br />
               ment of Canada did as they asked. If New- 
               <br />
               foundland should ever ask to have a divorce court 
               <br />
               setup, then the Parliament of Canada would do 
               <br />
               it, but not otherwise. Mr. Higgins, sir, is absolute- 
               <br />
               ly well aware of that fact, no one is better aware. 
               <br />
               It was Mr. Higgins himself, amongst others, who 
               <br />
               personally had some very special interviews on 
               <br />
               that very question in Ottawa. He was not the only 
               <br />
               one who had interviews, for Mr. Bradley also 
               <br />
               interviewed the very high personage whom Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins interviewed —— and I am not now refer— 
               <br />
               ring to anybody connected with the Government 
               <br />
               or Parliament of Canada, but someone much 
               <br />
               higher in a matter like this. There were various 
               <br />
               interviews, sir, and what did they all boil down 
               <br />
               to? They boiled down to this: that the Govem— 
               <br />
               ment of Canada would be willing to put it in the 
               <br />
               very terms of union that never, for all time, would 
               <br />
               the Parliament, or could the Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada, pass any law for divorce in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfound.</span> 
               <br />
               land or set up any divorce court in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, unless and until we ask for it 
               <br />
               ourselves, unless we ask them to do it. Let me 
               <br />
               make this very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clean...</span> To make the matter ab-

               <br />
               ment of Canada would be willing to put into the

               terms a special clause stripping from the Parlia- 
               <br />

               <br />
               to do such a thing, unless and until we, as a 
               <br />
               country, should ask them to do it — and that is 
               <br />
               the thing that is extremely unlikely, that we 
               <br />
               would ask them. I say that the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada would include such a clause in the terms 
               <br />
               and that clause would become part of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, if they were asked to place 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins says that our Catholic fellow- 
               <br />
               citizens would not favour confederation unless 
               <br />
               some such clause was put. in the terms, and in the 
               <br />
               RNA Act itself, making sure that divorce and 
               <br />
               divorce courts will not come to Newfoundland. I 
               <br />
               partly agree with him, and I add this further piece 
               <br />
               of information; that our Catholic citizens are not 
               <br />
               alone in that feeling. Others feel the same way 
               <br />
               about it, and have been informed fully of the 
               <br />
               situation. But I want it to be understood perfectly, 
               <br />
               that it only needs for the right people to say the 
               <br />
               word and that very clause will go into the terms. 
               <br />
               Why sir, the Prime Minister of Canada himself 
               <br />
               gave us a very broad hint in his letter to His 
               <br />
               Excellency. He said that in matters such as educa- 
               <br />
               tion —— such as education -they would want to 
               <br />
               satisfy us. Sir, a clause was actually drafted and 
               <br />
               a copy of it was here in St. John’s — is here in 
               <br />
               St. John’s at this moment. It is wrong to drag this 
               <br />
               matter into this debate. Our people need not 
               <br />
               worry about this question of divorce. It is in good 
               <br />
               hands, far better, far abler, far more conscientious 
               <br />
               hands than either those of Mr. Higgins or me. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Another point on Mr. Higgins, he wanted to 
               <br />
               know why so many Canadians were leaving 
               <br />
               Canada for the USA. The answer is simple. They 
               <br />
               are returning now at the rate of 11,000 a year; 
               <br />
               they cannot stand the high taxes in the United 
               <br />
               States. In addition to that 12,000 Americans set- 
               <br />
               tled in Canada in 1947.

               There is only one point in Mr. Butt’s speech 
               <br />
               to which I would refer. He said, “Let somebody 
               <br />
               better than we are decide this question." Exactly. 
               <br />
               The people of Newfoundland are better than we
