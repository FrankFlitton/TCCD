               Mr. Butt I believe that education is making real 
               <br />
               progress in Newfoundland and that our educators 
               <br />
               are doing an excellent job, but I feel that the 
               <br />
               Convention should be made conversant with the 
               <br />
               main lines, such as the grading of teachers, etc. 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell Since the report has been tabled the 
               <br />
               Convention has been busy with other matters and 
               <br />
               I wonder how any delegates have studied the 
               <br />
               report.

               Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, without doubt there is a 
               <br />
               marked difference between the estimate of 
               <br />
               salaries and your estimate of the total education 
               <br />
               grant of $3,538,500. There is a difference of 
               <br />
               about $1 million, and I think this should be 
               <br />
               cleared up.

               Mr. Smallwood For the present year ending 
               <br />
               March 31, 1947, we got our information from the 
               <br />
               department within the past three weeks, and if 
               <br />
               there is any difference in the figures, as referred 
               <br />
               to by Mr. Job, why should anybody worry? That 
               <br />
               is a matter for Chadwick-Jones to worry about. 
               <br />
               After all, the Education Committee is comprised 
               <br />
               of average Newfoundlanders, and not of men 
               <br />
               thoroughly versed in the issue. With regard to 
               <br />
               state control of schools I feel that the pupils 
               <br />
               would be subjected to propaganda. I do, however, 
               <br />
               agree that children should be helped to think for 
               <br />
               themselves and to develop character, but I would 
               <br />
               not advocate state interference with the system. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett This subject of education is a real 
               <br />
               problem. During its sessions the Education Com- 
               <br />
               mittee was addressed by the secretary of the 
               <br />
               department and he gave sufﬁcient information to 
               <br />
               the Committee to make us believe that the 
               <br />
               government was deﬁnitely interested in the train- 
               <br />
               ing of teachers and that it had taken steps in this 
               <br />
               respect. I feel sure that the standing of the average 
               <br />
               teacher of the future will show a decided im~ 
               <br />
               provement over the past and present. While on 
               <br />
               this point I would like to remind delegates that 
               <br />
               the government could not be expected to spend 
               <br />
               thousands of dollars towards the training of 
               <br />
               teachers for very small settlements.

               Mr. Newell The Education Committee did not

               feel it was obligated to examine all aspects and

               Mr. Crosbie I agree with Mr. Newell that the 
               <br />
               primary job of the Convention is to collect ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial and economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts.</span> I also believe we got the 
               <br />
               estimate of the expenditure on education far too 
               <br />
               low. The majority of professional teachers 
               <br />
               received less than $3,000 in 1944, and I notice in 
               <br />
               the report also that two teachers received less 
               <br />
               than $300 salary. If they had to pay board they 
               <br />
               were in debt. Further on I notice that 31 get from 
               <br />
               $300 to $400; 196 from $500 to $600; 285 from 
               <br />
               $600 to $699; 232 from $700 to $799; 202 from 
               <br />
               $800 to $900; 446 from $1,000 to $2,000 and 20 
               <br />
               over $2,000 upwards. I think this offers little 
               <br />
               encouragement to people to become professional 
               <br />
               teachers, and I think the Committee should 
               <br />
               recommend an increase in the salaries. We are not 
               <br />
               concerned with what has been paid in the past. 
               <br />
               We must look to the future, and it is ridiculous 
               <br />
               for anyone to think that a teacher could be ex- 
               <br />
               pected to exist properly on $500 a year.

               agree with what Mr. Crosbie has said with regard 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">016</span> small salaries paid school teachers. The 
               <br />
               same laxity applies to the training of our teachers. 
               <br />
               Twenty percent of our teachers are ungraded and 
               <br />
               yet Mr. Hollett wondered if the government was 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in spending money for the training of 
               <br />
               teachers in smaller <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span> I come from a district 
               <br />
               where we have quite a number of small schools 
               <br />
               and need teachers, and I say that the government 
               <br />
               would be amply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justiﬁed.</span> There is no reason in 
               <br />
               the world why small communities should be 
               <br />
               deprived of the services of trained teachers, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be~</span>

               <br />
               Good trained teachers is the important thing, I 
               <br />
               think. What Mr. Smallwood has said I back it up, 
               <br />
               we have to have a larger percentage spent on the 
               <br />

               <br />
