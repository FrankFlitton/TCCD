               If we turn to page 102 of the Finance Report 
               <br />
               we find that our gross national debt amounts to 
               <br />
               $83,993,047. The ﬁrst amount of $3.5 million

               $1,700,000 against our sterling indebtedness of 
               <br />
               approximately $72 million. There is a sinking 
               <br />
               fund of $8,342,000, which leaves this amount of 
               <br />
               sterling debt at approximately $64.25 million. 
               <br />
               Now our local debt in bond issues and war 
               <br />
               savings certiﬁcates is approximately $7 million. 
               <br />
               Against this latter amount there is a sinking fund 
               <br />
               of $800,000, thus reducing our local debt to $6.25 
               <br />
               million. If we add this we have a debt of $70.75 
               <br />
               million. Against this we have cash and other 
               <br />

               less than $39 million. If we deduct this amount 
               <br />
               then from our total national debt we find that our 
               <br />
               net national debt on October 1, 1947, amounted 
               <br />
               to approximately $32 million.

               This, Mr. Chairman, was practically the exact

               rect. In our Economic Report we stated that we 
               <br />
               had $35 million approximately in liquid assets to 
               <br />
               the credit of the country. The above statement 
               <br />
               shows the assets accumulated since 1940-41, to 
               <br />
               the amount of $39 million or possibly $40 mil-

               Mr. Cashin I am not referring to that at all. I

               have a very strong suspicion that the galleries 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Cashin This was brought to my mind 
               <br />
               recently when I listened to the member from 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre go into his song and dance. He 
               <br />
               is our prize jumper in the dark, and when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some»</span> 
               <br />
               one throws the light of information on him he is 
               <br />
               usually up to his neck in a bog of misunderstand- 
               <br />
               ing. This is the subject of our ﬁnances, and he 
               <br />
               bites off more than he can chew on our sinking 
               <br />
               fund. After listening to his hysterical oration I 
               <br />
               wonder whether he had read our reports at all. If 
               <br />
               he read the report he did not understand it, and 
               <br />
               that would account for his not knowing what he 
               <br />
               is talking about. I have to try and dispel some of 
               <br />
               the fogs in which this delegate is wandering and 
               <br />
               send him back on the road. I do this in the hope 
               <br />
               that it will save me the trouble of doing it later
