               on Tuesday night we had been discussing Annex 
               <br />
               IV of the Grey Book, which set forth the 
               <br />
               Canadian government’s estimate of what we 
               <br />
               would collect from the people in taxes in New- 
               <br />
               foundland if we became a province, and also what 
               <br />
               they estimate they would spend in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               if we became a province. in the course of the 
               <br />
               debate, Major Cashin particularly, and Mr. .lob 
               <br />
               also, expressed the feeling that the estimates 
               <br />
               provided by the Canadian government on those 
               <br />
               two matters were not sufficiently accurate and 
               <br />
               comprehensive, or in sufficient detail in some 
               <br />
               respects. So the feeling seemed to develop 
               <br />
               amongst some delegates that the matter should be 
               <br />
               looked into, and for that reason no public or 
               <br />
               private session of the Convention was held 
               <br />
               yesterday. Instead a meeting of the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee was held, and I think I may say that 
               <br />
               the result of yesterday’s Steering Committee 
               <br />
               meetings was shown this afternoon, when Major 
               <br />
               Cashin gave notice of these questions bearing on 
               <br />

               amount of $9.4 million which the Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />
               was a feeling in the Steering Committee meeting

               <br />
               that information is forthcoming, and that we 
               <br />
               would in the meantime postpone our debate on 
               <br />
               these financial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aspects.</span>
