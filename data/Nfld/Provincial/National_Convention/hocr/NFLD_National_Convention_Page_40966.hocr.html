               <br />

               Now, Mr. Smallwood wanted to know

               Now this is one case in which the Dominion

               <br />
               opinion. Having said that I believe firmly in an 
               <br />
               economic survey, I question if that survey of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               utmost importance. You know the very recent

               <br />
               and of Canada. Canadian citizens. One of the 
               <br />
               reasons is that up to now we have all been British 
               <br />
               subjects. Of course we have been and we will 
               <br />
