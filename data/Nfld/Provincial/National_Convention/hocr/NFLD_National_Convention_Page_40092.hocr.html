               <br />
               production of ﬁsh in the United States, and I 
               <br />
               found that besides importing 425 million pounds 
               <br />
               a year, she is producing herself something over 4 
               <br />
               billion pounds a year —— 12 times as much ﬁsh as 
               <br />
               she imports. The American consumption of ﬁsh 
               <br />
               is 32 pounds per year per capita. Of the 32 pounds 
               <br />
               consumed she imports three and produces 29 
               <br />
               pounds. I wonder seriously, as I have done for 
               <br />
               more than a year, what is the future of the fresh

               <br />
               tariff action and trade agreements and trade 
               <br />
               treaties, and if it is a fact that they are trying to 
               <br />
               make up an international trade organisation, and 
               <br />
               if it is their policy not to deal in bilateral trade 
               <br />

               imposed on us in this Convention a very solemn 
               <br />
               and very important duty. We must face facts. It 
               <br />
               is because we did not that we lost self-govern-
