               <br />
               in these last weeks of discussion, and particularly 
               <br />
               in the debate just recently ﬁnished covering the 
               <br />
               ﬁnance end of it and the estimated provincial 
               <br />
               budget. This very signiﬁcant fact, sir, which 
               <br />
               stands out as a weak link in the chain of the 
               <br />
               confederation-backers, is that they have not men~ 
               <br />
               tioned anything about the provincial budget, or 
               <br />
               how we are going to fare operating New-

               going to pay for the beneﬁts they might receive 
               <br />
               from confederation. I have heard eight or nine of 
               <br />
               these members speaking in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confedera»</span>

               tion on generalities alone. They have not stated 
               <br />
               any solid basic facts to back up their recommen- 
               <br />
               dation to the people. They have glibly skipped 
               <br />
               over the most important part that the people 
               <br />
               should consider, and that is, sir, how can we 
               <br />
               operate a province and who is going to pay for it?

               I was most surprised indeed by the impression 
               <br />
               I received of what Mr. Burry said on January 13. 
               <br />
               He spoke very feelingly of the people on the 
               <br />
               Labrador, and quite rightly so, and pointed out 
               <br />
               the beneﬁts to them; but my impression was that 
               <br />
               he spoke through the eyes of 5,000 people on 
               <br />
               Labrador as a basis for recommending to the 
               <br />
               other 300,000 people of Newfoundland that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con‘</span>

               federation would be good for them. I realise that 
               <br />
               Mr. Burry has the people of Labrador at heart, 
               <br />
               and I have every respect for this gentleman, but 
               <br />
               to me his sole argument was based on and around 
               <br />
               only that small percentage of the whole country 
               <br />
               and I cannot accept his argument as referring to 
               <br />
               the rest of Newfoundland. ’

               terms we have been offered, I cannot sincerely

               Mr. Ashboume said on January 16 that he 
               <br />
               could not see why we always want to remain 
               <br />
               independent. I can hardly believe Mr. Ashboume 
               <br />
               seriously considered this remark, as surely it is 
               <br />
               the wish of everybody in this country to remain 
               <br />
               independent if they can do so without sacriﬁcing 
               <br />
               too much. Mr. Ashboume also mentions the fact 
               <br />
               that under confederation a man could leave here 
               <br />
               after the ﬁshing season for winter work in 
               <br />
               Canada, but surely he realises that people in 
               <br />
               Canada are in similar industries as ourselves, and 
               <br />
               that they are in the identical position as us, and 
               <br />
               the volume of work to be obtained in Canada 
               <br />
               during the winter months would affect such a 
               <br />
               small part of our population, and would beneﬁt 
               <br />
               us so little, that this is hardly a reason for his 
               <br />
               strong recommendation of confederation. If con- 
               <br />
               ditions become poor in this country and work is 
               <br />
               hard to get, it will also apply to Canada, and the 
               <br />
               jobs that are available in Canada are being ﬁlled 
               <br />
               by immigrants consisting of displaced persons 
               <br />
               from Europe who are coming to Canada on very 
               <br />
               low salary to start with, such a salary as 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders could not exist on, and which 
               <br />
               would not give them sufﬁcient returns to pay 
               <br />
               their fare up and back again. He states that we are 
               <br />

               Mr. Ashboume I maintain that I referred to

               Great Britain as well as Canada.
