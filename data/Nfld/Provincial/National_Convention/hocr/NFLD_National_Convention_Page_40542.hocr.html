               people who have not complied with the necessary

               <br />
               table on water-power, the position is this. Some 
               <br />
               years ago there were timber leases on which the 
               <br />
               people who had rights had to erect mills. They 
               <br />
               did not erect mills, and the government took 
               <br />
               action for cancellation of licenses. But the 
               <br />
               government had accepted rentals. Upon action 
               <br />
               being taken it was ultimately decided by the Privy 
               <br />
               Council on appeal in the case of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Government vs. Jardine that the 
               <br />
               condition had been broken, but if after the breach 
               <br />
               the government had accepted the rent, then the 
               <br />
               government had waived its right to cancel the 
               <br />
               leases, and the licenses must continue on that 
               <br />

               The judgement is very long, gentlemen, but 
               <br />
               you understand the situation At that time it was 
               <br />
               being argued by counsel for the plaintiffs that the 
               <br />

               British Parliament through one of the Secretaries 
               <br />
               of State, as the property being expropriated was 
               <br />
               not the property of British subjects residing in the

               Mr. Higgins I believe there were.

               Mr. Smallwood Sitting beside you is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chain</span> 
               <br />
               man of the National Convention, who was once 
               <br />
               Solicitor General of Newfoundland, and as such 
               <br />
               once instrumental in serving quite a number of 
               <br />
               writs on the owners of timber lands, who had 
               <br />
               been granted those timber lands on condition that 
               <br />
               they would develop them. They had not 
               <br />
               developed them, I believe, and they had not met 
               <br />
               the conditions, and he issued writs running up to 
               <br />
               a value of millions of dollars, one of the biggest 
               <br />
               actions ever taken in the history of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. I was wondering if we could provoke 
               <br />
               him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> it was a case where a lot of natural 
               <br />
               resources had been granted to certain individuals 
               <br />
               on certain conditions. They did not develop them, 
               <br />
               and he decided to get them back for the Crown. 
               <br />
               The government backed him and their licenses 
               <br />
               were cancelled.3 It may not be quite the same 
               <br />
               kind of case, but if it were, there is a case where 
               <br />
               the government could get them back, and here’s 
               <br />
               another case where we could not get them back. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I can only speak from memory 
               <br />
               and my recollection is that the owner of the 
               <br />
               property was a limited company which was 
               <br />
               domiciled in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> I believe it was the 
               <br />
               Reid Newfoundland Company, so that any Let- 
               <br />
               ters Patent or Instructions to the Governor would 
               <br />
               have no application. I have also to add that while 
               <br />
               those writs were in fact issued the leases were not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cancelled.</span> That was prior to the case which went 
               <br />
               to the Privy Council. Beyond that I cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go,</span> 
               <br />
               because I would be talking politics, and I cannot

               talk politics in this Chair.
