               Mr. Smallwood Well, I would too, but if we

               can’t do it how can we say whether we will be

               Mr. Crosbie I don’t know, there is an awful lot

               of hot air around here. I don’t agree with Mr. Job. 
               <br />
               It was not a blind guess. I don’t know if he knows 
               <br />
               how this $2.5 million was made up on oil. It was 
               <br />
               not until sometime in November or December 
               <br />
               that the large increase in oil came, so actually it 
               <br />
               would be nearer $5 million instead of $2.5 mil- 
               <br />
               lion ~ pretty near double, so actually that figure 
               <br />
               of $2.5 million is somewhere near double since 
               <br />
               November, and in some cases triple.

               Mr. Crosbie I am not criticising. I am trying to 
               <br />
               explain to Mr. Smallwood what the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> I 
               <br />
               am not one of the critics, and I don’t intend to be. 
               <br />
               Now with regards to the drop, where we estimate 
               <br />
               a drop in salt codﬁsh around $8 million. As I said 
               <br />
               before, this country has one fish only, the codﬁsh, 
               <br />
               and as soon as we forget that attitude the sooner 
               <br />
               the country will get on its feet. For one thing 
               <br />
               alone, these ﬁgures for 1947 will be closer to $4.5 
               <br />
               million rather than $2.5 million, that’s for the 
               <br />
               same quantity, and you are going to get increased 
               <br />
               production over the next two or three years, and 
               <br />
               additional quantities of ﬁshrneal that have not 
               <br />
               been exported before will take up a lot of the 
               <br />
               slack. You have those canning plants, last year it 
               <br />
               was somewhere in the vicinity of $8 million, and 
               <br />
               there is no reason why we can’t export $2-3 
               <br />
               million worth of canned goods. I don’t think this 
               <br />
               estimate is too far wrong. lfI were to make a little 
               <br />
               bet I might say that in the next few years it might 
               <br />
               be $40 million.

               Mr. Smallwood I am glad to hear Mr. Crosbie 
               <br />
               express such optimism, but we have got to keep 
               <br />
               our feet on the ground, you have to admit that. 
               <br />
               Just come back to that table: haddock was 
               <br />
               $300,000 last year, lobsters $1 million, and sal- 
               <br />
               mon close to $1 million. Sealskins $500,000 last 
               <br />
               year, squid $136,000, and then you have a large

               <br />
               shortage prices. Now, say you are right, oil that 
               <br />
               was worth $2.5 million in 1946 in 1947 comes to 
               <br />
               be worth $4.5 or $5 million, and even in 1948 
               <br />

               let’s say it is worth $5 million, surely by the end

               <br />
               There will be no shortage of oil two years from 
               <br />
               now. It is true you can be producing more by that 
               <br />
               time than you are now, but is it possible, unless 
               <br />

               <br />
               if it is worth $5 million now, will it be worth that 
               <br />
               two or three years from now? There must be a 
               <br />
               limit to the amount of salmon and lobster you can 
               <br />

               Iceland, which we look upon as a codfish 
               <br />
               country, at the end of 1944 had 62 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quickireezing</span>

               plants in operation costing $10 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> In l945 
               <br />
               they produced 200,000 tons of ﬁsh — how much 
               <br />
               of that was codfish? 3,000 tons out of the 214,000 
               <br />
               tons of all kinds of ﬁsh. We have not begun to 
               <br />
               think of herring. I agree with Mr. Crosbie. We
