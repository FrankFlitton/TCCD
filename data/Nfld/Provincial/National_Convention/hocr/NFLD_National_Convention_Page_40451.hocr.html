               behind with over half the economy of the whole

               faith in canning. The Committee tells us that

               Senator MacLean appeared before them — he is 
               <br />
               one of the biggest fish men in Canada ~— and one

               <br />
               bothering the United States?" “I never even think 
               <br />
               of them, we are shipping to 100 different 
               <br />
               countries,” he said. That is canned ﬁsh. His plant 
               <br />
               is costing $250,000. We have enough to put up

               ﬁsheries have to have new capital by thousands

               <br />

               of the most modern? If we have not got the capital
