               taxation as and when it likes all through this

               $250 million annually spent on baby bonuses or

               family allowances, represents a 60% increase

               over the normal expenditure of the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada in 1939. I don’t think that’s a question 
               <br />
               of taxation, but it might be relevant to point that 
               <br />

               Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman, on Friday Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood stated that the population of Canada is 
               <br />
               around 12,500,000. They get $250 million in 
               <br />
               baby bonuses, we’ll call them for the time being, 
               <br />
               that works out around $20 per head. So on the 
               <br />
               same basis I presume that Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               have about the same proportion of children under 
               <br />
               16 years of age as they would have in Canada. 
               <br />
               It’s not a matter of being critical at all, it'sjust to 
               <br />
               keep the record straight because our people were 
               <br />
               listening in, and I’ve been asked already on the 
               <br />
               street how we arrived at these ﬁgures. We say our 
               <br />
               population is around 320,000, approximately. 
               <br />
               Therefore we would get around $6,400,000. Now 
               <br />
               the chairman of the Ottawa committee reported 
               <br />
               it to be in the vicinity of $8,200,000 and in 
               <br />
               another statement he said around $750,000 a 
               <br />
               month, which would work out around $9 million, 
               <br />
               which is one-third over the approximate amount 
               <br />
               I take it we would get, admitting that we have 
               <br />
               117,000 children... Ofcourse, I don’t know what 
               <br />
               the Chairman feels about that, I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               see how we can evade talking forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment when we’re debating a form of government 
               <br />
               in itself. I’m wondering what position our Chair- 
               <br />
               man is going to be in when we touch a rather 
               <br />
               delicate point.

               Mr. Chairman I’d like to put you straight on 
               <br />
               that question now. The procedure under which 
               <br />
               this report was to be debated was not a matter for 
               <br />
               the Chairman at all. It was a question of proce- 
               <br />
               dure which was decided by the Convention itself 
               <br />
               when the motion to resolve the Convention into 
               <br />
               a committee of the whole was adopted. As far as 
               <br />
               I’m concerned the manner in which any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">docuw</span> 
               <br />
               ment coming before the Chair is to be discussed, 
               <br />
               or the procedure to be employed in the discussion 
               <br />
               of any document, is one for the Convention. I 
               <br />
               would like to point out, Mr. Vardy, I quite realise
