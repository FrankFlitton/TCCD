               <br />
               into the sinking fund. The tmstees take that 
               <br />
               £178,000 and they go out on the market and go 
               <br />
               to John Jones and Thomas Smith or John Brown 
               <br />
               in England. John Smith is a man who has a 
               <br />
               Newfoundland bond. He owns that bond, he has 
               <br />
               paid for it, but he now wants to turn that bond into 
               <br />
               cash — he wants to sell it, so the trustees buy the 
               <br />
               bond from him, and they buy all the bonds they 
               <br />
               can get every year, up to the value of over 
               <br />
               $750,000, up to £178,000 sterling. In other 
               <br />
               words, when the Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               pays the trustees that 1% every year into the 
               <br />
               sinking fund, the trustees use the money to buy 
               <br />
               those very bonds. Now when they buy them, they 
               <br />
               own them, and the position today is that the 
               <br />
               trustees have bought year after year more and 
               <br />
               more of our Newfoundland bonds. But these 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, sir. They were never can- 
               <br />
               celled. They are not going to be cancelled until 
               <br />
               1963, when they will all be cancelled. They will 
               <br />
               all be cancelled then, but until then the trustees

               foundland bonds in England from anyone who 
               <br />

               <br />
               bondholders? No. 1, all the public of England 
               <br />
               who happen to buy those bonds. No. 2, the trus- 
               <br />
               tees of the sinking fund. There are two classes of 
               <br />
               bondholders now — the public and the trustees 
               <br />
               of the sinking fund. The trustees receive their 
               <br />
               interest every year. What do they do with that 
               <br />
               interest? They don’t put it in their own pockets. 
               <br />
               They use that interest to buy still more bonds. All 
               <br />
               that income from the sinking fund, whether it be 
               <br />
               the 1% they get from the government, or the 3% 
               <br />
               interest on those bonds that they buy, all that 
               <br />
               income goes to buy still more Newfoundland 
               <br />
               bonds, so what is happening? What is happening 
               <br />
               is this: the sinking fund is growing every year. It 
               <br />
               is growing on the one hand, and on the other hand 
               <br />
               the number of public bondholders is falling year 
               <br />
               by year. Carry it on long enough, and ﬁnally our

               whole public debt would be owned by the trus-

               That is the crux of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter.,..</span> I claim it is a good 
               <br />
               thing to build up a sinking fund as much as you 
               <br />
               can, and have so much saved up to meet the whole 
               <br />
               principal when it comes due in 1963. Let us say 
               <br />
               they could have adopted half a dozen other ways 
               <br />
               of handling that sinking fund. The question is not 
               <br />
               whether that the right way, the best way, the 
               <br />
               question is who is doing the plundering, and how 
               <br />
               is the plundering being done?.... I for one am 
               <br />
               heartily sick of hearing statements made that 
               <br />
               the government — whom I do not like —- is 
               <br />
               plundering and looting when it is not true and 
               <br />
               cannot be proved. I challenge any man to prove 
               <br />
               to us ordinary, simple-minded Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               that the sinking fund of $1.75 million was 
               <br />
               plundered out of this country. I say now, on the 
               <br />
               authority of this document which is the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               answer of the government, that every year since 
               <br />
               1938 the trustees of that fund have used that 
               <br />
               money to buy in Newfoundland bonds. The New- 
               <br />
               foundland government is paying interest on the 
               <br />
               bonds the same as they pay any other bondholder, 
               <br />
               and that interest is used by the trustees to buy still 
               <br />
               more bonds and pile up the sinking fund and 
               <br />
               make it grow as fast as possible, so when it comes 
               <br />
               due in 1963 they will have a good sizeable 
               <br />
               amount accumulated in the sinking fund to pay 
               <br />
               over, I say not one cent has been robbed. Not one 
               <br />
               cent has been plundered. The statement has been 
               <br />
               made that Newfoundland has been plundered of 
               <br />
               $1,730,000. It is a shocking statement... If that 
               <br />
               kind of statement is allowed, and it has been 
               <br />
               going on for two years, you cannot blame the 
               <br />
               people for believing it, if it is not contradicted. 
               <br />
               There is as much truth in that accusation as 
               <br />
               there was in all the wild crazy statements that 
               <br />
               have been made in politics in the last 25 years 
               <br />
               about plundering, looting and graft. it is not made 
               <br />
               surely, without any sense of responsibility; surely 
               <br />
               not made in calm, reasoned tones or feelings, 
               <br />
               surely not. If Major Cashin can prove to us — he 
               <br />
               does not have to prove it, all he has to do is to 
               <br />
               give us a good case.
