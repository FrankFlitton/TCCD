               <br />

               <br />
               at no time allowed his personal leanings towards

               this National Convention as a jumping-off place 
               <br />
               for future political partisanship. If we cannot help

               forming a deﬁnite bias towards one or more 
               <br />
               forms of government, we can restrain ourselves 
               <br />
               from preventing a hearing for those other forms

               Our duties as regards the gathering of facts 
               <br />
               have almost reached their objective, and if we 
               <br />
               now decide to concentrate our attention on per- 
               <br />
               haps three phases of our deliberations which 
               <br />
               seem to me necessary before we wind up our 
               <br />
               work, we shall be acting wisely. The first of these 
               <br />
               seems to be to declare whether the country is at 
               <br />
               the present time self—supporting, a decision 
               <br />
               which should not be difﬁcult to reach. The 
               <br />
               second is to decide whether we have a reasonable 
               <br />
               expectation of being able to maintain a self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting position in the foreseeable future, and I 
               <br />
               submit that we cannot be expected to prophesy 
               <br />
               for any lengthy period, and indeed under present 
               <br />
               world conditions it may be dangerous to 
               <br />
               prophesy at all. The third phase, it seems to me, 
               <br />
               is to debate and deﬁnitely decide upon the forms 
               <br />
               of government which we consider should be 
               <br />
               placed on the referendum paper, taking each form 
               <br />
               separately. Perhaps I should add a fourth item, 
               <br />
               namely, the drafting of a report covering our 
               <br />
               findings and recommendations.
