               Referring to the supplementary report, I notice

               that Mr. Neill denies that he ever said that. Is he

               hedging, or is the Committee in error in the 
               <br />

               there was a stenographer present at the meeting

               what they liked with their own equipment. The 
               <br />
               great bulk of it they moved to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> John’s. They 
               <br />
               formed a pool of equipment they intended to sell,

               and to it they brought the equipment they owned 
               <br />
               in Gander. The buildings were not owned by 
               <br />

               Mr. Fudge Mr. Chairman, I am wondering

               <br />
               what equipment was there when it was taken 
               <br />

               <br />
               they could move a lot of things that we did not 
               <br />
               know were there, and that is why I say surely the

               Mr. Smallwood They have an inventory, and 
               <br />
               when I was at Gander at Christmas I saw it. It is 
               <br />
               a huge thing —— I suppose a thousand sheets... 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I don’t want to stop Mr. Fudge on 
               <br />
               this matter, but I would like to direct Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood’s attention to this $300 matter once 
               <br />
               more. The importance of it is that from your 
               <br />
               report we understand that we are losing half a 
               <br />

               <br />
               Squadron Leader Pattison to your Committee he 
               <br />
               states that by mid-I947 we might expect 1,000 
               <br />
               planes a month. The normal fee is less than $100. 
               <br />
               That would mean that we would have $200 more 
               <br />
               per plane, which would give us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2.4</span> million a
