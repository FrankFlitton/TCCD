               this Convention to know the amount that these 35 
               <br />

               the value of the local industries to the country as 
               <br />

               is no way of averaging or considering what it 
               <br />

               In looking over this list I see there are three

               <br />

               Mr. Hickman That might be possible in certain 
               <br />
               cases, but I would not be able to give a general 
               <br />
               answer. There are some items that could be ex- 
               <br />
               ported. For example in this report here, one ex— 
               <br />
               port is margarine. I imagine that is what went to 
               <br />
               St. Pierre. There must be items that can be ex- 
               <br />
               ported. There has been such a demand locally in 
               <br />
               the last few years and such a shortage of imported 
               <br />
               goods that I don't think we could touch the export

               country, they are like ourselves, they must export 
               <br />
               or perish. That country lives purely on industry, 
               <br />
               and most of them are conducted by importing raw 
               <br />
               materials. They have very little of their own, but 
               <br />
               everything is imported, manufactured and then 
               <br />
               exported to other countries and compete with

               matters referred to in the report or inferred during 
               <br />
               the debate. In leading off, I would refer to a 
               <br />
               statement which I made in a radio broadcast 
               <br />
               during the short election campaign that preceded 
               <br />
               the election in June last. In speaking of the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of the Convention, I said: “You are not 
               <br />

               John’s West, I said I did not intend to apologise

               for the debates that had taken place in the Con-
