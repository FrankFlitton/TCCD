               made to block this resolution. Our people have

               <br />
               quite clear on this point. There are members who 
               <br />
               have spoken very sincerely against the motion, 
               <br />
               because they feared that it was trying to rush 
               <br />
               them. Not to them do I refer, but to a certain 
               <br />
               willful minority whose only policy is responsible 
               <br />

               <br />
               higher patriots, have had the same charge hurled 
               <br />
               against them. That greatest patriot of all, the 
               <br />
               Right Honourable Sir Robert Bond, who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ocv</span>

               cupied a seat only two or three feet from where I

               stand today, had the same charge made against 
               <br />
               him. Here’s a printed pamphlet published in 
               <br />
               1909, when he was prime minister. On the cover 
               <br />
               of this pamphlet, in heavy black type, are the 
               <br />
               words: “Bond’s Awful Plot to Sell the Country.” 
               <br />
               And what is this pamphlet about? It tells how our 
               <br />
               great Newfoundland patriot was a confederate 
               <br />
               who wanted to get Canada’s terms of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion in 1909. For wanting to get the terms of 
               <br />
               confederation Sir Robert Bond was accused of 
               <br />
               trying to sell his country, so why should I com- 
               <br />
               plain for having the same charge hurled at me 
               <br />
               when I propose to get the terms? Sir Edward 
               <br />
               Morris not only tried to get the terms in 1914 but 
               <br />
               got them —~ was he trying to sell the country? 
               <br />
               Were Sir William Coaker and Sir Michael Cashin 
               <br />
               traitors to Newfoundland because they were

               <br />
               tlon? Were Sir William Whiteway and

               Archbishop Howley traitors for believing in con~

               mons, the prime minister of Canada made this 
               <br />
               precise statement: “If the people of New—

               foundland should ever decide that they wish to 
               <br />
               enter the Canadian federation and should make 
               <br />
               that decision clear beyond all possibility of 
               <br />
