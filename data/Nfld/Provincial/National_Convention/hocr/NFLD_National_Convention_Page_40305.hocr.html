               Mr. Higgins I wonder if Major Cashin would

               Mr. Cashin If you will remember that time we 
               <br />
               brought the original Forestry Report before this 
               <br />
               House, we estimated that the total earning power 
               <br />
               from the pulp and paper industry would be in the 
               <br />
               vicinity of $16 million. Since that time, we have 
               <br />
               had Mr. Lewin, General Manager of the Bowater 
               <br />
               Pulp and Paper Company before the Committee, 
               <br />
               and I think he stated in his address that the in- 
               <br />
               dustry would be earning around $20 million in a 
               <br />
               very short period. He said that the development 
               <br />
               of timber for export or pulp and paper on the 
               <br />
               Labrador could be very reasonably expected to 
               <br />
               produce another $5 million a year. Consequently 
               <br />
               with the price of newsprint as it is today and the 
               <br />
               future prospects for it in the next two or three 
               <br />
               years at $83 a ton, and ﬁguring $35 or $40 a ton 
               <br />
               labour, and some 500,000 tons of newsprint an- 
               <br />
               nually, you will find that it will go over $20 
               <br />
               million annually. It is well known that newsprint 
               <br />
               gives an earning power of half the price obtained 
               <br />
               for it. That is general.

               <br />
               News Mr. Lewin wrote an article, and in that he 
               <br />
               said: “When it is also realised that the total 
               <br />
               payroll of the Corner Brook company will have 
               <br />
               increased nearly fourfold in the last ten years and 
               <br />
               will reach close to $12 million in 1948, it will 
               <br />
               readily be seen what this means to the west coast 
               <br />
               in particular and the country as a whole.” I as- 
               <br />
               sume his position was that Comer Brook would 
               <br />
               contribute $12 million, and I presume he meant 
               <br />
