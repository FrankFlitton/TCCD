               Mr. Smallwood We went into the question of 
               <br />
               public debt—thatquestion was raised, discussed 
               <br />
               across the table, as we might in your office, 
               <br />
               informal and friendly. The answer was, “No". 
               <br />
               The reason was that the terms given one 
               <br />
               province must be guided by the terms given to 
               <br />
               other provinces. The Government of Canada for 
               <br />
               many years will have to pay into Newfoundland 
               <br />
               between $10—15 million more than they can take 
               <br />
               out of Newfoundland. I hope it will not be too 
               <br />
               many years; {hope the day will come when things 
               <br />
               will be so developed, industries so productive, 
               <br />
               our people so prosperous that we will be paying 
               <br />
               a lot more taxes to the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               than we will be paying for some years to come. 
               <br />
               Put it at $10 million — the difference between 
               <br />
               what the Government of Canada will pay into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and what they take out — that is 
               <br />
               $100,000 every ten years. These subsidies are 
               <br />
               paid; some in return for the grant of certain taxes, 
               <br />
               direct taxes, income taxes, corporation taxes and 
               <br />
               death duties. The government will take so much 
               <br />
               money in taxes. That government will pay so 
               <br />
               much into Newfoundland every year. If we take 
               <br />
               it at the lowest ﬁgure —— $10 million —— that is 
               <br />
               $100,000 a year that the Province of New- 
               <br />
               foundland would cost the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada. That is something.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               One other point far more important - the per 
               <br />
               capita debt of any country, the public debt is 
               <br />
               important to the people of that country for one 
               <br />
               outstanding reason, and in this I hope Major 
               <br />
               Cashin will agree you have to service that debt, 
               <br />
               pay interest on it, put a sinking fund forward; and 
               <br />
               you have to pay it back when it falls due. You pay 
               <br />
               so much a year for this debt, you pay in your 
               <br />
               taxes. So what matters in a country, what counts, 
               <br />
               is not so much the size of the public debt, but the 
               <br />
               size of your taxation... That includes public debt, 
               <br />
               it includes family allowances, it includes public 
               <br />
               services, it includes the Railway, your taxes that 
               <br />
               you pay, the total amount you pay.... There is not 
               <br />
               a special tax collected from people to pay the 
               <br />
               interest on the debt, it is paid out of the regular 
               <br />
               revenue that the government collects, and the 
               <br />
               only real importance of a public debt is how much 
               <br />
               it adds to your taxation... 
               <br />

               Incidentally, in Newfoundland too there are 
               <br />
               very bitter experiences with public debt. We have 
               <br />
               in this country a great horror of public debts. I 
               <br />
               find that in larger countries they don’t have that 
               <br />

               same dread. In Canada, certainly Mr. Higgins and 
               <br />
               all our delegation will agree, all the ofﬁcials and 
               <br />
               cabinet ministers used to smile at our great con- 
               <br />
               cern and our dread of public debt. Maybe they 
               <br />
               can afford to smile, because nearly all their debt 
               <br />
               is internal. It is owned in Canada. When they pay 
               <br />
               interest on it they are paying it to Canadians. it 
               <br />
               still stays in Canada. I think every year it is 
               <br />
               around $400 million that the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada pays on the public debt, and nearly all of 
               <br />
               it goes to Canada and is used for the general 
               <br />
               purposes of providing capital. Maybe that is why 
               <br />
               they don’t fear public debt.

               If a country is growing, has good industries 
               <br />
               and their prospects seem to be very good, then 
               <br />
               they look upon debts as something natural, not 
               <br />
               something to be scared of; because if they were 
               <br />
               to be scared the United States today would be a 
               <br />
               nation frantic with fear and debt; and the same 
               <br />
               applies to Great Britain... However, the question 
               <br />
               of public debt is so much connected with the 
               <br />
               question of taxation, because taxation includes 
               <br />
               public debt, that l hesitate to go into the matter 
               <br />
               now. I would suggest to Major Cashin that we 
               <br />
               have got to get down to brass tacks in this debate 
               <br />
               before it is over, get down to this question of 
               <br />
               taxation, then we can have it out about our public 
               <br />
               debt as well.

               Mr. Cashin I think I am inclined to agree with 
               <br />
               my friend Mr. Smallwood for once. To go into 
               <br />
               the matter of revenues and expenditure and 
               <br />
               public debt is a very important matter in connec-

               tion with this debate. It is the Only matter really 
               <br />
               that is worth talking about, and I think that this 
               <br />
               matter should be put off until some of the ques— 
               <br />
               tions that appear on the order paper are correctly

               answered, because I don’t want to be guessing 
               <br />
               any more. Whilst I want to get this thing over, I 
               <br />
               want to be in a position to discuss the public debt 
               <br />
               from an economic standpoint as far as the country 
               <br />
               is concerned. So far i have got the answer that 
               <br />
               they put it up to the Canadian government who 
               <br />
               said they were not prepared to give us anything
