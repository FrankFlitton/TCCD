               Mr. Job I did not know that I was to make this 
               <br />
               motion, and unfortunately I have not prepared

               received and suggest that it be read to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie I second that motion.

               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, when this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion decided to send a committee to confer with 
               <br />
               the Governor in Commission with the object of 
               <br />
               obtaining information relating to the sending of 
               <br />
               delegates to discuss the affairs of our country 
               <br />
               with the governments of Great Britain, Canada 
               <br />
               and the United States, I was one of those who 
               <br />
               voted against such a measure on the grounds that 
               <br />
               such a committee could not obtain any tangible 
               <br />
               results. Today, that Committee has presented its 
               <br />
               report and its nature is such as I anticipated. 
               <br />
               Over and over, I have given expression of my 
               <br />
               opinion that it is futile to entertain any notion that 
               <br />
               we can expect sincere <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperation</span> from either 
               <br />
               the Dominions Ofﬁce or its local agents, the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government. I have given 
               <br />
               deﬁnite instances of the obvious intention of our 
               <br />
               rulers to thwart and circumscribe the activities of 
               <br />
               this Convention -—— of their intention to divert and 
               <br />
               keep our thoughts and actions in the harmless and 
               <br />
               ineffectual channel of petty discussion. I have 
               <br />
               pointed out that as a country and a people we are 
               <br />
               being triﬂed with, that our rulers do not intend to 
               <br />
               allow us to interfere with the plans they have laid 
               <br />
               down. Time goes by, the treasury of our country 
               <br />
               is being squandered, and future generations are 
               <br />
               being harnessed with huge ﬁnancial commit- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ments...</span> I say that under the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">set»up,</span> this 
               <br />
               Convention can do nothing to help our people or 
               <br />
               our country. If the doors of this Convention were 
               <br />
               closed tomorrow it would make no appreciable 
               <br />
               difference or have any effect on the already 
               <br />
               prepared plans of the Dominions Office. The 
               <br />
               future of this country has been planned out long 
               <br />

               today, to obtain ample conﬁrmation of what I say. 
               <br />
               We have the position where the members of this 
               <br />
               Convention, representing over 300,000 people, 
               <br />
               decide to ascertain the possibility of establishing 
               <br />
               economic relations with other countries, and in 
               <br />
               particular the United States. To quote the resolu- 
               <br />
               tion: “bearing in mind the present occupation of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland territory by the United States of 
               <br />
               America and the fact that free entry is accorded 
               <br />
               the USA for its imports into Newfoundland.” 
               <br />
               Arising out of this resolution, a committee of the 
               <br />
               Convention asked the government if they can 
               <br />
               approach the USA with a view to making some 
               <br />
               proﬁtable-arrangements in the interests of the 
               <br />
               country, and the answer to their request is a clear 
               <br />
               and definite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refusal.</span> We, the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, are told that the Dominions Office 
               <br />
               will not allow us to make any attempt to better 
               <br />
               our national conditions by opening negotiations 
               <br />
               with the United States. When the people of this 
               <br />
               country, through their appointed representatives 
               <br />
               are prevented from exercising the ordinary 
               <br />
               freedom of bargaining with another country, 
               <br />
               what name are we to put on this sort of thing? 
               <br />
               Could there ever be presented to us a stronger 
               <br />
               justification for having control of our own 
               <br />
               country? Imagine the position, if the British 
               <br />
               government tried to prevent Canada or Australia 
               <br />
               or any other colony or dominion from doing 
               <br />
               business with the United States. Would not the 
               <br />
               thing be regarded as so outrageous and improper 
               <br />
