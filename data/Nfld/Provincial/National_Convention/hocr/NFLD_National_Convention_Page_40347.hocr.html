               When we ﬁnally take stock I would be in 
               <br />
               favour of a delegation to England, because I am 
               <br />
               convinced there are many things over there 
               <br />
               which should be in our stock sheet. I am not 
               <br />
               concerned any more about fish than about land 
               <br />

               <br />
               ours and our people need it all. This Convention, 
               <br />
               is an elected body from the people, let’s forget 
               <br />
               this “asking” and “if you please” business. Let us 
               <br />
               stand on our feet and demand. My attitude may 
               <br />
               be termed radical, but I belong to the same stock 
               <br />
               from across the ocean and I have the same 
               <br />
               bulldog spirit and determination to have and to 
               <br />

               Mr. Reddy I was particularly interested in sec-

               establishing improved economic or fiscal

               relationships between the USA and this country, 
               <br />
               which was one of my real reasons for voting for 
               <br />
               the resolution as a whole. I was keenly disap- 
               <br />
               pointed on discovering how lightly this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all-im“</span>

               portant question, was brushed aside by our 
               <br />
               Committee. If there is the least shred of hope of 
               <br />
               improving our relationship with the USA, which 
               <br />
               is the greatest country on earth, where thousands 
               <br />
               of our own blood relations reside, no stone must 
               <br />

               <br />
               tive. Any movement in this direction, will receive 
               <br />
               the support of 80% of our population.

               <br />

               <br />
               pound on our fresh fish entering the USA this 
               <br />

               <br />
               defence are concerned. This, like forms of 
               <br />

               <br />
               by the people of Newfoundland, and our 
               <br />
               authority is limited to recommendation only. I 
               <br />

               <br />
               ence. It is correct that Professor Wheare stated 
               <br />
               we have got the power to send a delegation to the 
               <br />
               USA to discuss terms of union, and we must 
               <br />
               admit that the treatment accorded Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in 1933 has not been conducive to the promoting 
               <br />
               of the cordial relationship so much desired be- 
               <br />
               tween the mother country and her oldest colony. 
               <br />
               It was the old Conservative Churchill govern- 
               <br />
               ment which set up the machinery for the National 
               <br />
               Convention and the newly elected Labour 
               <br />
               government merely took it over as a going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               cern, and being favourable toward New~ 
               <br />
               foundland getting some form of responsible 
               <br />
               government, they naturally set the machinery in 
               <br />
               motion as soon as it was expedient to do so. 
               <br />
               Despite what the first paragraph on page 21 in- 
               <br />
               fers, I am of the opinion that should a delegation 
               <br />
               go to London on any business pertaining to the 
               <br />
               welfare of Newfoundland, they will get a hearing 
               <br />
               on any matter affecting this country, even though 
               <br />
               it may not be strictly speaking within the terms 
               <br />
               of reference. It is also worth noting that the 
               <br />
               Governor was a member of the Opposition when 
               <br />
               Newfoundland lost her franchise and His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency himself voted against the suspension of 
               <br />
               democratic government. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Speaking of delegations next year 
               <br />
               we have the Olympic Games on, and I think we 
               <br />
               could send a very fine delegation from this House 
               <br />
               to the Olympic Games! I feel certain that if we 
               <br />
               could get them to put on a contest for long dis- 
               <br />
               tance talking we could make a good showing. 
               <br />
               We are hired, or retained by the people to do 
               <br />
               a job as a committee of enquiry, and any man who 
               <br />
               consented to be hired must put his own thoughts 
               <br />
               and ideas beside the point as a member of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committee.</span> I may feel equally as strongly about

               responsible government as Major Cashin and Mr.
