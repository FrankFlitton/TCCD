               and seconded by Mr. Harrington in amendment 
               <br />
               that the consideration of this matter be deferred 
               <br />
               to a later date. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jaekman Is it in order for me to speak? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It is in order for you to speak on 
               <br />
               the amendment once. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman My point in moving this resolu- 
               <br />
               tion was that I felt that when our delegation goes 
               <br />
               to England, it should be fully armed with all the 
               <br />
               facts regarding forms of government in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. That is the only reason why I moved 
               <br />
               it. I am not in favour of federation with anyone. 
               <br />
               I am a Newfoundlander, and I believe in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and Newfoundlanders, but my whole 
               <br />
               object in moving this motion was this: that when 
               <br />
               the delegation would go to England, they would 
               <br />
               be able to tell the British people that there is 
               <br />
               sentiment here in Newfoundland favouring amal- 
               <br />
               gamation or federation with the United States. 
               <br />
               That is the only reason I put it, and I think it is 
               <br />
               only fair that this Convention should vote on it 
               <br />
               now, and give this delegation the full facts. What 
               <br />
               are we holding back for? I was told yesterday 
               <br />
               when I decided to bring this resolution in, “Don’t 
               <br />
               do that, it is political suicide.” I am not a 
               <br />
               politician, and I am not looking for anything in 
               <br />
               that respect. The only way you can classify me as 
               <br />
               a politician is that I will ﬁght and die for the right 
               <br />
               to bring my family up as decent human beings, 
               <br />
               and my next door neighbours’ children as well. 
               <br />
               If the delegation goes to England and is asked, 
               <br />
               “What is the sentiment in Newfoundland?”, they 
               <br />
               can say, “Well, some want Commission govem~ 
               <br />
               ment, some responsible government, and some 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada.” Then they might 
               <br />
               say, “What about the United States, how do they 
               <br />
               think about that?” Now here’s what I look at, by 
               <br />
               giving this resolution passage, when the 
               <br />
               Dominions Secretary asks them that question 
               <br />
               they can pass it on. There is a lot of sentiment 
               <br />
               regarding the United States. Personally I do not 
               <br />
               want to see my country put out on hook to 
               <br />
               anybody, but seeing it is going to go that way, and 
               <br />
               there are so many wishing to let it go that way, 
               <br />
               my argument is let it go to the highest bidder. I 
               <br />
               want to put myself on record, and I think there is 
               <br />
               as much British blood in me as any man in this 
               <br />
               Convention, that I admire the British people and 
               <br />
               what they fought and died for.

               What did Churchill tell the people in 1940? Here 
               <br />
               is what he told them, and here’s what I tell the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, regardless of what 
               <br />
               form of government they take up. He said, “I have 
               <br />
               only one thing to offer you -—- blood, sweat and 
               <br />
               tears.” He did not say, “Give me your mind and 
               <br />
               let me do your thinking for you, and we will give 
               <br />
               you baby bonuses.” Well, I have six children and 
               <br />
               I can ﬁgure out quickly $48 a month —— very ﬁne. 
               <br />
               He told them blood, sweat and tears, and I tell 
               <br />
               them the same. I am used to hard times all my life, 
               <br />
               and I know what hunger is, and what it is to stand 
               <br />
               in the breadline, and what it is to wake up in the 
               <br />
               morning and wonder how in God’s name are you 
               <br />
               going to raise your children <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up,</span> I know all these 
               <br />
               things, and I am not looking for it from con- 
               <br />
               federation with Canada or the United States or 
               <br />
               anyone else, but I am looking for it in one way 
               <br />
               only — through ourselves, and we can do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I am sorry ifl am out of order, but 
               <br />
               lcan‘t help <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now as I see it as far as our country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con.</span> 
               <br />
               cemed, we are Split wide open. But the people 
               <br />
               have the ﬁnal choice and believe it or not the 
               <br />
               ordinary man, even if he does not know his 
               <br />
               ABCs, is pretty commonsense after all. Now we 
               <br />
               are here, sent here by our people to explore, 
               <br />
               investigate and ﬁnd out what is best for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. We have different personal ideas. My 
               <br />
               idea from the beginning is only one thing, respon- 
               <br />
               sible government, but it is not for me or you or 
               <br />
               anyone else to say what form of government we 
               <br />
               should have. All we can do is give our opinion, 
               <br />
               and it is up to the people to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decide.</span> But I do say 
               <br />
               this, give them the chance anyway. IfI could get 
               <br />
               up with the ability of Mr. Smallwood, with his 
               <br />
               oraton'cal power, I would talk here for the next 
               <br />
               ten weeks if I were allowed on responsible 
               <br />
               government, but, as I was saying, it is not me or 
               <br />
               you, but what the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think,</span> However, I think 
               <br />
               that if we are going to send delegations to Ottawa 
               <br />
               and to England why not, as many of our people 
               <br />
               want to know, why not send a delegation to the 
               <br />
               United States as well?
