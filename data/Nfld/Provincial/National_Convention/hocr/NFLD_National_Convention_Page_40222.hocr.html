               <br />
               gested that the Tourist Board’s work was one of 
               <br />
               the bright spots in the country’s affairs. It has 
               <br />
               been demonstrated quite clearly that the Tourist 
               <br />
               Board has more than given good returns for the 
               <br />
               money they expended. It is incomprehensible 
               <br />
               that the work of the Board has been treated in 
               <br />
               such a careless fashion by the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government. The mind of a government that will 
               <br />
               look at the work of the Tourist Board, that has 
               <br />
               worked voluntarily over a period of 20 years, and 
               <br />
               dismiss their labours in such a summary fashion, 
               <br />
               is beyond my comprehension. I can only assume 
               <br />
               that the gentlemen handling our affairs are not 
               <br />
               only utterly callous to the future of our country, 
               <br />
               but actually do not want to see this country 
               <br />
               prosper. It is apparent that tourist traffic can be a 
               <br />
               major industry but for reasons best known to 
               <br />
               themselves the Commission of Government are 
               <br />
               not going to see this industry properly developed. 
               <br />
               If we had the power I would like to move a vote 
               <br />
               of censure on the Commission of Government for 
               <br />
               their attitude towards the most important industry 
               <br />
               of the country.

               us. We have seen what the tourist industry in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia has meant — why, in the last year 
               <br />
               alone the sum of $22 million was realised. Even 
               <br />
               with the very conservative ﬁgure of $50 per 
               <br />
               tourist in Newfoundland in the last year before 
               <br />
               the war, the sum of $346,500 was realised I am 
               <br />
               certain that $50 is too conservative and at least 
               <br />
               the sum of$ 10 per day is spent by tourists coming 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland. This would mean that 
               <br />
               $750,000 came to the revenue in 1939. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is the least explored country in 
               <br />
               the world as far as tourist traffic is concerned. It 
               <br />
               has a real attraction for tourists, and if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper»</span> 
               <br />
               ly develop the traffic Newfoundland is assured of 
               <br />
               a definite income that will increase as the years 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come.</span> When we realise that for salmon ﬁshing 
               <br />
               alone we have over 200 ﬁshing streams, we can 
               <br />
               be sure that our country’s possibilities are of 
               <br />
               immense value. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I heartily endorse everything Mr. 
               <br />
               Fowler has said. I agree with his condemnation 
               <br />
               of the powers that be over our tourist trade. I 
               <br />
               congratulate the Committee on a very fine and 
               <br />
               full report, because I see tremendous possibilities 
               <br />
               in the future for our tourist traffic. I, like a good 
               <br />
               number of you here, have gone over a great part 
               <br />
               of the country. I have observed it particularly 
               <br />
               from the tourist standpoint, because most of my 
               <br />
               wanderings have been for sport-ﬁshing or shoot- 
               <br />
               ing. I am convinced it is a factor in the economy 
               <br />
               of our country. All we have to do is look nextdoor 
               <br />
               to our immediate neighbour, Canada and Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia alone, where the attractions are not a patch 
               <br />
               on our own, in spite of any ideas some people 
               <br />
               may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> We look at our own and we see that in 
               <br />
               1939, 6,900 tourists came here and spent an es- 
               <br />
               timated $346,500, and that for an expenditure by 
               <br />
               this government of $34,932. I am sure the figure 
               <br />
               of $50 spent by each tourist is very conservative 
               <br />
               and this $346,000 coming into the country can 
               <br />
               easily be doubled, or possibly trebled. In the past 
               <br />
               three years the Tourist Board’s grant from the 
               <br />
               government has been $26,000, and we have seen
