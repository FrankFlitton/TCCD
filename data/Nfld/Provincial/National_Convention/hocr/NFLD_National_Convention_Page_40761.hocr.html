               This report has come in for considerable 
               <br />
               debate. Some members have gone all out in sup- 
               <br />
               port, others have taken a contrary view. In some 
               <br />
               cases the debate has been a bit on the stormy side. 
               <br />
               I wonder what our listeners all over the country 
               <br />
               think. Are they in agreement that the task as— 
               <br />
               signed us is being handled properly? Are they 
               <br />
               acquiring such knowledge as will enable them to 
               <br />
               decide more easily the great question which must 
               <br />
               in due time be given serious thought? An artist 
               <br />
               may paint a beautiful picture, but it may not 
               <br />
               appeal to every one in the same way. The same 
               <br />
               applies to the picture this Economic Report gives. 
               <br />
               There is no just reason why one man should 
               <br />
               become aggrieved simply because the other fel— 
               <br />
               low cannot see in that picture the same thing.

               Economics is the science that treats of produc- 
               <br />
               tion, and use of wealth, so its meaning has two 
               <br />
               sides. Faith in the possibilities of production is 
               <br />
               one thing, getting down to business and pro- 
               <br />
               ducing is another thing. Nature may provide 
               <br />
               wealth in the land, but she does not dig it out. The 
               <br />
               four factors are land, labour, capital and organisa- 
               <br />
               tion, and capital is very important. The report 
               <br />
               does give an encouraging picture. I hope it works 
               <br />
               out along these lines in the years which lie
