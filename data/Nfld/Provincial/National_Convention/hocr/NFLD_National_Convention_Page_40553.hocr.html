               <br />
               on Newfoundland soil? Two mines will be 
               <br />
               worked together, it is all one mine. If you can 
               <br />
               work those two mines as one mine, then certainly 
               <br />
               you can have the town on the Quebec side as 
               <br />
               easily as on the Newfoundland side. Apart from 
               <br />
               the 15 cents per horsepower royalty, if we can get

               Somebody said here that I was trying for the

               <br />
               will say this, that on account of a number of 
               <br />
               things —— the fact that this man Timmins is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span>

               made and unmade presidents in the United States

               <br />
               dollars to develop, I am convinced that this mine 
               <br />
               in Labrador is one of the biggest things that ever 
               <br />
               struck this country — utterly monumental. There 
               <br />
               is another thing about it. It is a local company, a

               They are going to tie up in Newfoundland $125 
               <br />

               <br />
               liked, nationalisc Bowaters tomorrow, buy them 
               <br />
               out and make them a government proposition in

               Mr. Higgins With this exception. 1 would say. 
               <br />
               It is true what parliament makes it can unmake, 
               <br />
               but we must regard this as a binding agreement. 
               <br />
               If we did what you suggest, it would be extraor-

               dinary if people would do business with us again. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I am talking of the ability of 
               <br />
               parliament to do it. Naturally they would have to 
               <br />
               consider the consequences that would follow 
               <br />
               from its action. If it is true of Bowaters, AND, 
               <br />
               Buchans, St. Lawrence and Bell island, is it not 
               <br />
               also true of Labrador? Would not that company
