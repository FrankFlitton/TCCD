               <br />
               taken from all of us in taxes, and don’t forget the 
               <br />
               coming budget of the Canadian government, 
               <br />

               Canadian tax rates still more next month or the

               <br />
               and see First, what will the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment spend each year in Newfoundland? Under 
               <br />
               the tax rental agreement, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$6.82</span> million. Old age 
               <br />
               pensions and pensions to the blind, $2.6 million; 
               <br />
               family allowances, $8.35 million; other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">departmental</span> expenditures, $9.4 million; transi- 
               <br />
               tional grant, taking the yearly average, 
               <br />
               $2,843,000; interest on our sterling debt, that they 
               <br />
               will take over, $2,156,000 a year; Railway 
               <br />
               operating losses, at least $2 million a year. It is 
               <br />
               costing us $1—2 million a year, but it will cost the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada much more than that, 
               <br />
               because they will have less revenue. They have 
               <br />
               to reduce the Railway force, taxpayers’ rates and 
               <br />
               freight rates, to bring them down to Canadian 
               <br />
               rates, and in some cases they have to increase the 
               <br />
               wages to the Railway men, and then on top of 
               <br />
               that, railway and other capital expenditures by 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada, $2 million a year. 
               <br />
               Remember, they have to spend $17 million for 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst ten years, or they estimate that is what 
               <br />
               they will have to spend on the railway alone, so 
               <br />
               that is $2 million a year for capital account. That 
               <br />
               is a total of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$36.5</span> million a year which the federal

               <br />
               $36.5 million a year. Some of it will come to the

               On a purely cash basis confederation would mean

               a magnificent gain for the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Confederation, during the ﬁrst eight

               years of union, will cost the public chest of 
               <br />
               Canada over $16 million net each year: $16 mil- 
               <br />
               lion a year is what the entry of Newfoundland into 
               <br />
               the Canadian union will cost the Canadian public

               more than they will get from Newfoundland. It 
               <br />
               sounds like a lot of money in our ears, I admit

               that, for the Government of Canada to be out $16

               other point, I think, in connection with Major

               <br />
               have only one point left in Major Cashin’ s speech 
               <br />
               with which to deal. And that is the question of 
               <br />
               Canada’s public debt. Major Cashin has made a 
               <br />
               great deal out of the fact that Canada has what 
               <br />
               sounds like a very large public debt. I say sounds 
               <br />
               like a large debt, though actually it is not large at 
               <br />
               all. There used to be nothing easier than to con— 
               <br />
               fuse people about this public debt question. An 
               <br />
               awful lot of nonsense is still talked about it, and
