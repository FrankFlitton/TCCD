               I am not a pessimist. There are a certain amount

               of encouraging things and given a fair amount of

               <br />
               go much further; a certain percentage of our

               I have great faith in the future. I really believe 
               <br />
               we have seen the worst, given a fair amount of 
               <br />
               world stability. But it is no use for us to paint a 
               <br />
               bright, glowing picture and think we are doing 
               <br />
               justice to the people. Those of us who would like 
               <br />
               to see a few shady lines in this picture are not 
               <br />
               unpatriotic. We are not backing down on the 
               <br />
               people just because we are trying to see the thing

               figures which I could give you to tell you what 
               <br />
               happened even last year in my own district, of the 
               <br />
               amount of privation and need that existed: 641 
               <br />
               individuals receiving dole last winter, and that 
               <br />
               did not include the Indians, 300 of them, most of 
               <br />
               them were on dole rations last year. Somewhere 
               <br />
               around 900 people receiving dole outofa popula-

               <br />
               the Labrador Development,1 so we can imagine 
               <br />
               the very much more concentrated privation and 
               <br />
               hunger there were in other places, and from what

               Mr. Burry Mr. Chairman, when the session 
               <br />
               closed this afternoon I was about to observe that 
               <br />
               this Convention is very anxious to have its work 
               <br />
               completed and I am in sympathy with that. I 
               <br />
               would like to have it over as quickly as possible. 
               <br />
               But I am wondering if fate has not had some hand 
               <br />
               in delaying this Economic Report. Perhaps if we 
               <br />
               had had it last fall or spring we would not see the 
               <br />
               true position of the country as we see it at the 
               <br />
               present time... 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I was about to say also, that in treating this 
               <br />
               subject in a bright and cheerful way, we are not 
               <br />
               treating the people of this country fairly. We have 
               <br />
               to recognise the struggle that they have had in the 
               <br />
               past and the struggles that they are bound to have 
               <br />
               in the immediate future. I do not want to be too 
               <br />
               pessimistic. I do not want to dwell upon this too 
               <br />
               much; but the other side of it has been given such 
               <br />
               importance that I feel someone should show that 
               <br />
               not every side of our life and economy is as bright 
               <br />
               as some would have us think. It was pointed out 
               <br />
               here the other day, in all seriousness, that 90% of 
               <br />
               our people own their own homes. That fact was 
               <br />
               taken from the census and is an interesting fact. 
               <br />
               But that does not tell the whole story. We know 
               <br />
