               remarks on the report now in question. This Na- 
               <br />
               tional Convention has become a reality after 
               <br />
               much tribulation. Ihope its faculties will continue 
               <br />
               to keep healthy and strong, because it will need 
               <br />
               the shoulder of an Hercules to carry the burden 
               <br />
               of statistics about to be placed upon its shoulders. 
               <br />
               The members of this Convention have been ap- 
               <br />
               pointed by our respective districts to try and find 
               <br />
               out the best form of government suitable for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland The task is going to be extremely 
               <br />
               difﬁcult, and will call for the best contribution 
               <br />
               each and every one of us can put into it. We shall 
               <br />
               have to give sane and unbiased considerations to 
               <br />
               the many problems which will from time to time 
               <br />
               confront us, and there is much hard work in store 
               <br />
               for us before we can attempt to try and come to a 
               <br />
               decision.

               Mr. Chairman, since we relinquished our 
               <br />
               status as a self-goveming people, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has been in the limelight, and still is. We have had 
               <br />
               many reverses in our economic life since then, 
               <br />
               yet we have survived somehow. When war was 
               <br />
               declared Newfoundland was at its lowest ebb, 
               <br />
               economically and ﬁnancially, yet in spite of the 
               <br />
               fact that many of our young men were on the dole, 
               <br />
               being only half-fed and half—clothed (on six cents 
               <br />
               a day) they rallied round the colours, and very 
               <br />
               soon some 7,000 of our young men were enlisted 
               <br />
               in the different forces of the empire, not forget- 
               <br />
               ting thousands of our young women who offered 
               <br />
               their services. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrl</span> Chairman, let us hope New-

               foundland will never again experience the dif-

               ﬁcult times previous to the outbreak of hostilities. 
               <br />
               That is where this Convention comes in, to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that form of government which will remove the 
               <br />
               spectre of want from our people. Should this

               What I have to say will not be lengthy nor will it

               propriate, for us to discuss the merits or demerits 
               <br />
               of any particular form of government. As regards 
               <br />
               what form of government is best for this country 
               <br />
               at the present, I have no idea, but as to what kind 
               <br />
               of a government I want for this country, I have a 
               <br />
               very ﬁxed idea. What I, and the majority of the 
               <br />
               people of this country want is a government that 
               <br />
               will give us the greatest measure of economic and 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial stability. A government that will see to 
               <br />
               it that the rising generations of this country are 
               <br />
               given a sound education, a chance to develop a 
               <br />
               healthy mind, and what is perhaps most important
