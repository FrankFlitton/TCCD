               I got a great surprise in the discussion of the 
               <br />
               US base deal. I always thought that it was not part 
               <br />
               of the destroyer deal. That was ofﬁcially stated 
               <br />
               at the time. To my astonishment, Lord Addison 
               <br />
               said the Americans would not have given the 
               <br />
               destroyers without the bases in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               We were deceived even there. I know the 
               <br />
               Americans drove a hard bargain. I still don’t think 
               <br />
               that the agreements should have been made 
               <br />
               beyond the duration without some reciprocal ar~ 
               <br />
               rangement. The Americans got from us, through 
               <br />
               their hard bargain with a desperate Britain, 
               <br />
               privileges which they would have given millions 
               <br />
               to get by purchase, They got all these things out 
               <br />
               of Britain’s need in order to serve their own 
               <br />
               defence interest. I don’t know what would have 
               <br />
               happened if we had a Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               that said Britain could give America everything 
               <br />
               we had for the duration, and we would reserve 
               <br />
               the right to enter into reciprocal negotiations 
               <br />
               afterwards. I don‘t mind venturing the guess that 
               <br />
               Britain would still have got the destroyers.

               people who have been trustees for this country, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               bit more cordial in their discussions. It looks to 
               <br />
               me, sir, that Newfoundland is still the Cinderella

               We suggested they reduce our debt by apply-

               <br />
               and it would have saved $400,000 a year in 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charges.</span> We suggested lending them dollars to 
               <br />
               buy ﬁsh they wanted and were going to take at 
               <br />
               higher prices from other countries, and they said 
               <br />
               no, and told us we had no right even to talk about 
               <br />
               it. They would make no deﬁnite promises about 
               <br />
               a few million dollars worth of ore from Bell 
               <br />

               <br />
               from Spain or Sweden if not from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, and pay for it in something the 
               <br />
               Swedes or Spaniards can use. The only pledge of 
               <br />
               any kind was that, if we got into ﬁnancial difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties after all our surplus was gone, they would try 
               <br />
               within the limits of their financial position to help 
               <br />
               keep us solvent. Well, I know what that means.
