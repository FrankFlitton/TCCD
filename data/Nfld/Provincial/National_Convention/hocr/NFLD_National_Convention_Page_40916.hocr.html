               Mr. Bailey As far as loan see we made a mistake

               in sending this delegation to Ottawa. We should 
               <br />
               all have gone, and then we would all have the 
               <br />
               information. I said from the ﬁrst, whatever infor- 
               <br />
               mation was given, privately or publicly, was 
               <br />
               given to the Ottawa delegation as servants of this 
               <br />
               Convention. We are the delegates of the people, 
               <br />
               and they were sent there by us, and whatever 
               <br />
               information is private or secret, there is not any 
               <br />
               more honour in a man from Bay St. George than 
               <br />
               there is in a man from Trinity South. We are all 
               <br />
               the same men, doing the same job, and whatever 
               <br />
               information there is should not be kept from 
               <br />
               anybody. Ican‘t see why a thing should be secret 
               <br />
               when 25 or 30 men elected to send these men to 
               <br />
               get it for them. Now I don’t say to put it all over
