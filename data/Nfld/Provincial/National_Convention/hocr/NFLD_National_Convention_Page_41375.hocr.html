               jurisdiction to deal with them as partisans. It was 
               <br />
               not our business to advocate or oppose any form 
               <br />
               of government. Our duty, the whole purpose of 
               <br />
               our existence was simple and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plain.</span> It was to

               <br />
               government to be submitted to the people at a 
               <br />
               referendum. Nothing more and nothing less. Ob- 
               <br />
               viously that task was to select and recommend 
               <br />
               such forms of government as might be suitable to 
               <br />
               the people of the country. It was the British 
               <br />
               government’s inability to carry out this task that 
               <br />
               brought this Convention into existence. We were 
               <br />
               to do what they, 2,000 miles away, could not do.

               Because of our closer associations with, and 
               <br />
               presumably greater knowledge of our own 
               <br />
               people -— and remember care was taken to see 
               <br />
               that all sections of the country were represented 
               <br />
               — because of these associations, we should be 
               <br />
               able to judge more clearly not what the people 
               <br />
               actually wanted — that was for them to say —- 
               <br />
               but what they might want, what might be suitable 
               <br />
               to them. Our own personal predilections and 
               <br />
               prejudices, our own party loyalties and an~ 
               <br />
               tagonisms, our own political beliefs and faiths 
               <br />
               were all entirely outside the scope of that purpose 
               <br />
               and should never have been pemtitted to enter in. 
               <br />
               Indeed, if we had adhered strictly to our plain 
               <br />
               duty, we would have completed our task, made 
               <br />
               our recommendations, and up to the dissolution 
               <br />
               of the Convention not one Newfoundlander need 
               <br />
               have known what particular form of government 
               <br />
               was favoured by any individual member of the 
               <br />
               Convention. We are not here to express our 
               <br />
               political views or to advocate any form of 
               <br />
               government, but simply to study calmly, not as 
               <br />
               party hacks, what in our opinion might be 
               <br />
               suitable to the people of Newfoundland, and to 
               <br />
               recommend to the Government of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom that the people of Newfoundland be 
               <br />
               given an opportunity to say which form might be 
               <br />
               suitable to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> They, the people, would choose.

               Unfortunately it became plain from the outset 
               <br />
               that the Convention was to be the scene of a 
               <br />
               struggle of ideologies instead of one concerned 
               <br />

               tion. Indeed, at one stage of the proceedings there 
               <br />
               were plain indications that would shut out all but 
               <br />
               one form of government, do away with the

               <br />
               enough to retain the last word in their own hands.

               Now I come to this resolution. The cloven 
               <br />
               hoof of partisanship is apparent in its very word- 
               <br />
               ing. It does not recommend that Commission 
               <br />
               government and responsible government or 
               <br />
               either of them be submitted to the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,—</span> I 
               <br />
               repeat, it does not recommend that either Com- 
               <br />
               mission or responsible government be submitted 
               <br />
               to the people. What it does do is to set these two 
               <br />
               forms in a class by themselves, and it asks the 
               <br />
               people to declare their preference as between the 
               <br />
               two. If it passes, and I am quite sure it will, 
               <br />
               because it has the support of the responsible 
               <br />
               government group which constitutes two-thirds 
               <br />
               of this Convention, if it passes it is plain that any 
               <br />
               other form of government is excluded. I want to 
               <br />
               repeat that, sir. If this resolution passes in its 
               <br />
               present form it is plain that any other form of 
               <br />
               government is excluded. If I vote for this resolu- 
               <br />
               tion I cannot consistently vote for a resolution to 
               <br />
               place any other form of government upon the 
               <br />
               ballot paper, for I have already chosen to demand 
               <br />
               that the people shall make a choice between these 
               <br />
               two, and I can’t now consistently add a third. I 
               <br />
               have asked that there be a showdown between 
               <br />
               these two forms of government, and a third and 
               <br />
               a fourth form of government has no place in that 
               <br />
               showdown. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Assuming that the resolution itself has passed, 
               <br />
               and that Mr. Smallwood’s resolution to place the 
               <br />
               question of confederation upon the ballot paper 
               <br />
               also passes, and that some other member of this 
               <br />
               Convention proposes a resolution that repre— 
               <br />
               sentative government be also placed upon the 
               <br />
               ballot paper and that passes, now what position 
               <br />
               are we in? Isn’t it an absurdity? The ﬁrst thing 
               <br />
               that we recommend is that we have a showdown 
               <br />
               between responsible government and Commis— 
               <br />
               sion government, and the winner of that duel is 
               <br />
               then to take up the cudgels with the other two. 
               <br />
               Obviously the position is an absurd one, and no 
               <br />
               man who votes for this resolution can, in consis- 
               <br />
               tency, vote to place any other form of govem— 
               <br />
               merit on the ballot paper.

               Again, I would point out that our duty is to

               recommend forms of government to be submitted 
               <br />
