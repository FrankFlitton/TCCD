               <br />
               something wrong with the Finance Department, 
               <br />
               because they have made a ruling that they will 
               <br />
               not answer any questions from this Convention 
               <br />
               unless it comes through the proper channels. I 
               <br />
               wonder therefore why Mr. Smallwood has the 
               <br />
               privilege of going to the Finance Department and 
               <br />
               getting the information. He can go to his little 
               <br />
               friend who helped him make up the budget,1 and 
               <br />
               he probably did. Anyway I discover that he and 
               <br />
               his budgetmakers were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$123,000</span> short in 1947- 
               <br />
               48, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194960,</span> and $40,000-odd short for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l951-52,</span> 
               <br />
               That was the ﬁrst thing that should have gone into 
               <br />
               that budget. That was left out, and as I go through 
               <br />
               it I find there were many other things left out, 
               <br />
               many other things not accurate there; but having 
               <br />
               found that first error I studied it very carefully, 
               <br />
               because i was indeed surprised.
