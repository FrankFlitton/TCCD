               ment at all.... Reconstruction undertaken by any 
               <br />

               <br />
               don’t know if I agree, but I am in doubt as to just 
               <br />
               how far a person can go in debate on this par-

               Mr. Chairman I am not going to speculate. If

               you don‘t mind I will deal with any remarks, if 
               <br />
               there are any made in the chamber. If a remark is

               that I will deal with it then. I can’t be asked to

               Mr. Hollett Point of order. I was about to make 
               <br />
               an observation. Am I not to be allowed to make 
               <br />
               a simple observation? I was going to draw your 
               <br />
               attention sir, to one of the concluding paragraphs 
               <br />
               in the address given by the late Chairman, Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley, when they arrived in Ottawa, wherein 
               <br />
               he stated that the basic economy of this country 
               <br />
               was sound, provided we could get the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem«</span>

               chamber, but in Ottawa. What’s this got to do 
               <br />
               with this debate? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I must sustain that. I am not

               concerned with any observations made by any 
               <br />

               Mr. Bradley said in Ottawa, or any other place,

               time. 
               <br />
               Mr. Watton Again I ask if I may proceed?

               Mr. Chairman Please do, Mr. Watton.

               Mr. Watton What I am going to say now is 
               <br />
               contained in this report... Speaking about the 
               <br />
               United States and our ﬁshing industry, I believe, 
               <br />
               as the report states, that the American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> 
               <br />
               ment and people will give serious and sym- 
               <br />
               pathetic consideration to any representation 
               <br />
               made by this country, if it was run by a duly and 
               <br />
               properly constituted government (that’s in the 
               <br />
               report, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chairman),</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman What part of the report are you 
               <br />
               quoting from? If members would only quote the 
               <br />
               part of the report on which they wish to base their 
               <br />
               observations... 
               <br />
               Mr. Watton ....Page 27, last paragraph: 
               <br />
               We are of the deﬁnite view that if proper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               representations were now made, by a proper- 
               <br />
               ly constituted government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               that the American government as well as the 
               <br />
               American people whom we consider fair and 
               <br />
               just, would certainly seriously consider 
               <br />
               giving Newfoundland some favourable tariff 
               <br />
               concessions for our ﬁshery products. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Now the observations on that 
               <br />
               portion of the report, Mr. Watton. You were 
               <br />
               about to make one? 
               <br />
               Mr. Watton I agree with that. That’s all I want 
               <br />
               to say about it —— I agree with it. I could go on to 
               <br />
               some length regarding the ﬁsheries, but it has 
               <br />
               been dealt with very competently by other 
               <br />
               speakers. But what I want to express is that I do 
               <br />
               agree with the Report of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               on our economic position, in their review of our 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, past, present and future. That’s what I 
               <br />
               want to get across, Mr. Chairman... 
               <br />
               I can see nothing in the future of our principal 
               <br />
               industries to give me cause for gloom and
