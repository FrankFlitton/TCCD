               <br />

               <br />
               conclusion to draw from an examination of our 
               <br />
               ﬁnances and economy is this. In the past our 
               <br />
               economy was not able in normal times to provide 
               <br />
               the revenue to support the public and social ser- 
               <br />
               vices that other western peoples enjoy. There is 
               <br />
               no evidence at this moment that would seem to 
               <br />
               indicate we may expect that our economy will be 
               <br />
               able to do the like for the normal times of the 
               <br />
               future. Indeed, everything would seem to indicate 
               <br />
               that our only hope of ever coming by such ser- 
               <br />
               vices would be by subsidy from the outside. I say 
               <br />
               that without seeking to prejudice the argument 
               <br />
               for one form of government or another. I state it 
               <br />
               as an inevitable conclusion to be drawu from our 
               <br />
               history and our foreseeable prospects, and I do 
               <br />
               urge that to whatever form of government we 
               <br />
               now go forward, we do advance with our eyes

               Mr. Smallwood I don’t intend today to discuss 
               <br />
               the subject that Mr. Keough has just discussed so 
               <br />
               brilliantly and in such choice language — the 
               <br />
               question of whether or not Newfoundland is self— 
               <br />
               supporting and of what chance there is of her 
               <br />
               being self-supporting in the years to come. That 
               <br />
               I will leave for another occasion. But I would like 
               <br />
               to review the Report of the Finance Committee

               Finance Committee or to Major Cashin if we 
               <br />
               failed to show by our interest and by our debate,

               borrowing they did; what was the amount of the 
               <br />
               public debt; and what was the amount of the

               <br />
               would fall into five ten-year periods, from 1900-

               the export of all the goods exported from New-

               the public expense. And the taxation that the
