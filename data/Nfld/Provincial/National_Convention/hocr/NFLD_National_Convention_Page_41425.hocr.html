               Mr. Cashin Eventually we have been successful 
               <br />
               in eliciting from the Canadian government after 
               <br />
               a period of over three weeks a reply in connection 
               <br />
               to my questions on the Newfoundland Savings 
               <br />
               Bank. Again I will read the question: 
               <br />
               I. I give notice that I will on tomorrow ask 
               <br />
               the Commissioner for Finance and/or the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government that, in the 
               <br />
               event of Newfoundland’s becoming a pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Canada, what would happen to the 
               <br />
               deposits now laying in the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Savings Bank? ' 
               <br />
               2. Would the Newfoundland Savings Bank 
               <br />
               continue as at present and would the 
               <br />
               depositors continue to receive the same rate 
               <br />
               of interest on their deposits as they now 
               <br />
               receive? 
               <br />
               The Canadian government in meir generosity 
               <br />
               sees ﬁt to send us the following reply: 
               <br />
               1. Monies on deposit in the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Savings Bank at the time of union would 
               <br />
               remain the property of the depositor. 
               <br />
               2. While Parliament has legislative jurisdic- 
               <br />
               tion over banks and banking, inclusive of 
               <br />
               savings banks, there is no federal statute pur-

               authorities. 
               <br />
               That is not a reply to my question. My question 
               <br />
               was, “Would the Newfoundland Savings Bank 
               <br />
               Continue as at present and would the depositors 
               <br />
               receive the same rate of interest as they receive 
               <br />
               now?" Therefore that question is not answered 
               <br />
               yet, and this Convention is drawing to a close. I 
               <br />
               can put only one construction on it -— they are 
               <br />
               net going to receive the same rate of interest. I 
               <br />
               know they will say the Province of New- 
               <br />
               foundland will have to look after it, but will the 
               <br />
               depositors receive 2.7% interest which they are 
               <br />
               receiving today? There has been no reply. And 
               <br />
               there is not a statement that it will continue, even.
