               less of our desire to knock the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, what we have to decide is what 
               <br />
               bearing will this Mining and Exploration Com- 
               <br />
               pany have on the future ability of this country, its 
               <br />
               people and its government, to be self-supporting? 
               <br />
               Personally, I am quite satisﬁed. I have my 
               <br />
               doubts about the ﬁshery, doubts about other ac— 
               <br />
               tivities. But so far as Labrador is concerned, I say 
               <br />
               cheerfully and willingly that this, as Major 
               <br />
               Cashin says, is the biggest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long«range</span> thing that 
               <br />
               has come to this country: so big that we get lost 
               <br />
               in the details of these acts. Let us not get lost in 
               <br />
               the details. If this company will provide a town 
               <br />
               of 35,000, its wages will provide the future 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland with an amount of 
               <br />
               maybe 15 million a year. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Before we go any further on the 
               <br />
               matter, I would like to draw your attention to the 
               <br />
               memorandum which was prepared by Mr. Eric 
               <br />
               Cook. As a result of a meeting which we had, it 
               <br />
               was suggested that we ask Mr. Cook to prepare a 
               <br />
               memorandum of the situation as he saw it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cook is solicitor for the Labrador Mining 
               <br />
               and Exploration <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Company,</span>

               [The memorandum was read1 ] 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins That figure of $125 million 
               <br />
               Mr. Cook assures me, will be for the railway and 
               <br />
               the mine in Newfoundland. He is satisﬁed that is 
               <br />
               the figure that will be spent in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               alone.

               With respect to the income tax, you have 
               <br />
               before you the Income Tax Consolidation Act, 
               <br />
               1944. When Mr. Allen was before the Commit- 
               <br />
               tee, we asked what the position would be if the 
               <br />
               Labrador Mining and Exploration Company was 
               <br />
               controlled by a parent company, which was a 
               <br />
               steel company, and they were selling ore to the 
               <br />
               steel company at a price lower than the regular 
               <br />
               price. Mr. Allen’s answer was that if returns 
               <br />
               came in with the price of ore marked $4 a ton and 
               <br />
               the real price was $6. he might not know it, but 
               <br />
               he would send it to Mr. Claude Howse, who 
               <br />
               would give him the proper price. Mr. Howse says 
               <br />
               they get weekly prices. He says if the ore market 
               <br />
               was artiﬁcally depressed, if all the big companies 
               <br />
               got together and depressed prices, nothing could 
               <br />
               be done about it; not only Newfoundland, but no 
               <br />

               Newfoundland rather than pay Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               because Newfoundland taxes are less than 
               <br />
               Canadian corporation taxes... His point was 
               <br />
               there would be no reason for the companies to 
               <br />
               diddle the returns; they would have to pay bigger

               <br />

               Mr. Miller I am open to convincing on the 
               <br />
               Labrador deal. I would like to make certain it is 
               <br />
               not a raw deal. I rather resent the approach made 
               <br />
               to this matter by some speakers. Some people 
               <br />
               went so far as to say that it was not our business 
               <br />
               whether we got a good deal or a bad deal. Now 
               <br />
               that’s wild. Newfoundland’s present position is 
               <br />
               probably entirely due to the fact that in the past 
               <br />
               we did not get deals that were so good. We now 
               <br />
               come to a stage today where we made com- 
               <br />
               parisons, and we have worked a lot on this and 
               <br />
               we are still open to conviction. Some speakers do 
               <br />
               not want to hear it. Why? They argue that it is not 
               <br />
               in our economic interest. Can you convince me 
               <br />
               that if we get 15 cents per horsepower it is as good 
               <br />
               as $1 per horsepower? We might have one mil- 
               <br />
               lion horsepower. I can’t see why we refuse to 
               <br />
               agree or disagree after we consider it, but you 
               <br />
               actually refuse to consider the information that 
               <br />
               we humbly place at your disposal. It is immaterial 
               <br />
               to me, but we put it to you as fairly and plainly as 
               <br />
               possible. 1 would prefer not to deal with it here, 
               <br />
               and I still think it can be dealt with better out of 
               <br />
               here, but I am open to conviction and I hope there 
               <br />
               are many others too. We have been a long time 
               <br />
               on this Mining Report and a lot of people 
               <br />
               wondered what we were doing. Some people said 
               <br />
               we were not doing very much, and sometimes I 
               <br />
               felt the same, because we could not get all we 
               <br />
               wanted and if at the last minute something shows 
               <br />
               up and we have not formed an opinion on it we 
               <br />
               waive the right to go thoroughly into it, but that
