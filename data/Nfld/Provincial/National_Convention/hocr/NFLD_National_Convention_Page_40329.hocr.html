               Mr. Hickman I am not in the blueberry industry 
               <br />
               and I don’t know much about it, but I understand 
               <br />
               the decrease in the blueberry production was 
               <br />
               mainly caused by the volume of employment at 
               <br />
               the bases, and the people did not have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neces</span> 
               <br />
               sity of going blueberry picking. That was the 
               <br />
               main factor in blueberry production, the price 
               <br />
               was deﬁnitely set, and perhaps as unemployment 
               <br />
               increases, which we trust it won’t, it may bring 
               <br />
               back a greater production. That is the answer you 
               <br />
               get from businessmen engaged in it.

               Mr. Smallwood I wonder if Mr. Bailey could 
               <br />
               tell us something in connection with wool. I 
               <br />
               followed his argument on herring with great in- 
               <br />
               terest. I thought it was completely sound...but 
               <br />
               now about this wool. He suggests importing wool 
               <br />
               from Australia as the United States does and as 
               <br />
               Canada does. If we were to import wool from 
               <br />
               Australia to manufacture into blankets and men’s 
               <br />
               suits, does he suggest that that is an economic 
               <br />
               proposition for export, or is he picturing merely 
               <br />
               importing enough wool to supply our own needs? 
               <br />
               And has he considered the cost of a plant large 
               <br />
               enough to do that? Has he worked that thing out? 
               <br />
               Mr. Spencer I have noticed that this report does 
               <br />
               not say anything about our local shipbuilding 
               <br />
               industry. Can Mr. Hickman tell us if that is 
               <br />
               covered by another committee. In view of the 
               <br />
               importance of this to the ﬁsheries I don’t think it 
               <br />
               should be overlooked.

               <br />
               we could add local industry as an enemy. I think 
               <br />
               we should encourage every local industry, 
               <br />

               happier people and happier homes. Our people

               Mr. Ashbourne Rather than import raw wool 
               <br />
               from Australia and New Zealand I would be in 
               <br />
               favour of raising it in Newfoundland ourselves, 
               <br />
               even though we have to subsidise every man who 
               <br />
               keeps sheep, and the time may come when the 
               <br />
               government pays them to do it. I realise that the 
               <br />
               Committee had quite a job owing to the lack of 
               <br />
               statistics. One of the things the govemmentmight 
               <br />
               look into how is the formation of a bureau of 
               <br />
               statistics. It already has the personnel, and let it 
               <br />
               be simpliﬁed so that we can get government 
               <br />
               statistics, not only for these local industries, but 
               <br />
               upon everything pertaining to the economy of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland.

               When Mr. Bailey was speaking about wool, I 
               <br />
               was thinking of the amount of hams and bacon 
               <br />
               used in Newfoundland, and I am of the opinion 
               <br />
               that we don‘t raise enough pigs. Talking about 
               <br />
               sealskins, Mr. Smallwood mentioned my name 
               <br />
               just now. It is quite true that I had a pair of 
               <br />
               sealskin boots. We had quite a number of harps 
               <br />
               and hoods, and the price was about 63 cents for 
               <br />
               a damaged skin, so we decided to send some of 
               <br />
               them to Harbour Grace and have them tanned. It 
               <br />
               was an expensive process, and we have not yet 
               <br />
               got rid of all those skins, but we used them in the 
               <br />
               manufacture of certain articles like pouches, pur- 
               <br />
               ses, school bags and also for furniture, leather for 
               <br />
               chairs, etc. It was quite suitable and I feel sure 
               <br />
               there is quite a market for that in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               but not in sufficient volume or quantity to take
