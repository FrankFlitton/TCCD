               this Economic Report, but the reason I raised the 
               <br />
               point is that I am doubtful as to whether or not the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee is the correct committee to 
               <br />
               make this report, or if they are, should not they 
               <br />
               be aided by at least the chairmen of the various 
               <br />
               natural resource reports which we have had, such 
               <br />
               as Fisheries, Mining, and the others. I think it 
               <br />
               would be wise if some men from these other 
               <br />
               committees were added to the Finance Commit- 
               <br />
               tee. I think they should be assisted by some 
               <br />
               members of the other committees that worked on 
               <br />
               the real natural resources of this country.

               Mr. Cashin When we meet tomorrow in the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee we will discuss that point and 
               <br />
               will be able to give a report as to what we feel 
               <br />
               should happen, or think should happen in the 
               <br />
               future in connection with this Economic 
               <br />
               Report... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman ....The Economic Committee 
               <br />
               has the right to invite members of other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commie</span> 
               <br />
               tees, and particularly of committees which have 
               <br />
               already tabled reports, or even to go outside of 
               <br />
               that altogether... The Committee is empowered 
               <br />
               to call before them all such persons and obtain 
               <br />
               everything which they may consider necessary 
               <br />
               for the proper framing of the report. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, that’s the very point 
               <br />
               I was getting at... 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I feel we can leave it to the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee to decide that. Now, with respect to this 
               <br />
               notice of motion, I did propose to give it in this 
               <br />
               form: 
               <br />
               I give notice that I will on tomorrow move 
               <br />
               that further discussion of the Report of the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee be postponed until the 
               <br />
               Economic Report of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               has been presented. 
               <br />
               But in view of the fact that this would be the only 
               <br />
               business tomorrow in the event of its being 
               <br />
               passed, I would like the indulgence of the House 
               <br />
