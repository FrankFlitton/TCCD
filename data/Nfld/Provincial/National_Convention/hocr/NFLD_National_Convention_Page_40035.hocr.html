               be set loose at the much bigger and more fun-

               damental job of ﬁnding out for the ﬁrst time in

               450 years just what is the national income of

               <br />
               ought not to be called upon to bear. What will the

               people have left to live on when the taxation is 
               <br />
               taken from them? Who knows? No one. We 
               <br />
               know what is taken from them roughly, but we 
               <br />
               don’t know what they are left with. I am thinking 
               <br />
               of a man who made exactly a study of this kind 
               <br />
               of thing in New Zealand and Australia, and who 
               <br />
               is at this moment making it for the city of New 
               <br />
               York, and I don’t think the best is any too good. 
               <br />
               With no ulterior motives this is purely a matter of 
               <br />

               <br />
               will give us that kind of help

               Mr. Hollett After my friend Mr. Smallwood, I 
               <br />
               hesitate to speak on this matter. We have had 
               <br />
               experts dealing with the economics and ﬁnances 
               <br />
               of this country over the past 12 years, and probab- 
               <br />
               ly for many years before, and many of these 
               <br />
               experts have made up graphs, tabulated ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> based opinions on the ﬁgures and graphs

               all like to know the actual national income of this 
               <br />
               country. That is a job deﬁnitely for a statistician, 
               <br />
               but one which is going to take a much longer

               that we have no authority to engage a statistician,

               <br />
               of putting it down in bold ﬁgures is not going to 
               <br />
               help us tremendously, or make up our minds. The

               various committees you are going to appoint to

               country will be able to bring forward enough 
               <br />
               facts and ﬁgures to enable us to go into the matter, 
               <br />
               and I oppose the motion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam Mr. Chairman, I agree with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> 
               <br />
               Hollett. Although there may be a necessity of 
               <br />
               bringing in an expert, I think that is exactly why 
               <br />
               we were elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> to make a study, in our own 
               <br />
               way, of the economic position of this country. As 
               <br />
               our previous speaker mentioned, we have already 
               <br />
               had too many experts, and I think we are quite 
               <br />
               capable of doing the job. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Is the Convention ready for the 
               <br />
               question? Proposed by Mr. Smallwood and 
               <br />
               seconded by Mr. Vincent that the Convention 
               <br />
               request the government to appoint a competent 
               <br />
               statistician to better enable us to ascertain the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial and economic status of the country. 
               <br />
               Those in favour say “Aye”. Contrary “Nay”. The
