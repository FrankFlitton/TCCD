               Commission government and responsible

               government, they asked them that question. No. 
               <br />
               said the British government, that is not so, the 
               <br />
               Convention can recommend other suitable forms 
               <br />
               of government. The National Convention Act, 
               <br />
               they tell us, clearly authorises the Convention to 
               <br />
               make recommendations as to possible future 
               <br />
               forms of government in addition to Commission 
               <br />
               government and responsible government. And 
               <br />
               the British government told the delegation some- 
               <br />
               thing else. They said that if the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               people should vote for responsible government, 
               <br />
               then from that minute that government would be 
               <br />
               completely responsible for Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               finances. The British government would no 
               <br />
               longer take the responsibility they took for New- 
               <br />
               foundland when we went under Commission 
               <br />
               government in 1934. If we vote for responsible 
               <br />
               government, then we are cut off without even the 
               <br />
               proverbial shilling; we’ll be completely on our 
               <br />

               There's nothing surprising in that statement,

               <br />
               went broke. There are people in this country who 
               <br />
               remember that now. It was a desparate situation

               <br />
               fronted the Newfoundland government. The 
               <br />
               cabinet met, I believe it was Sir William 
               <br />
               Whiteway who was prime minister, they met day

               <br />

               <br />
