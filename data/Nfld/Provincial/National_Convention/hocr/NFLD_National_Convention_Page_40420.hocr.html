               far the government has not been able to say what

               <br />
               $85,000 for 110 tons. Originally, when Mr. Dunn 
               <br />
               was here, the government intended building

               <br />

               individual ﬁsherman. They all can get a license 
               <br />
               to pack. Therefore if you get $3 million for her-

               <br />

               <br />
               and it makes him independent. I hope if UNRRA 
               <br />
               does go out, the Fisheries Board will be able to 
               <br />
               get contracts from time to time. Our herring has

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrl</span> Hickman On page 4 of Appendix .1: “when 
               <br />
               one considers the quantity of herring which I 
               <br />
               have found in the Bay of Islands area, coupled 
               <br />
               with the experiences gained by the herring 
               <br />
               ﬁshery in British Columbia, there is no reason for 
               <br />
               any boundary lines and the present prohibiting of 
               <br />
               the use of purse seiners in this area should be 
               <br />
               abolished.” I was wondering, in view of Mr. 
               <br />
               Gammon’s report, could it be possible to use 
               <br />
               purse seiners unrestrictedly? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Crosbie Ithink the position is this. We had 
               <br />
               the right to use purse seiners inside Blow-Me- 
               <br />
               Down and Liverpool Brook. Last year the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men objected and we took the seines out of the 
               <br />
               water. Last July an agreement was made between 
               <br />
               the Fishermen’s Union and the company that for 
               <br />
               the present year we would not operate inside 
               <br />
               Blow—Me-Down and Liverpool Brook. Actually, 
               <br />
               from the legal point of view, you could go ahead 
               <br />
               and use the seines if you wanted to. Until last fall, 
               <br />
               in the Bay of Islands, no one knew the quantity 
               <br />
               there. The ﬁshermen thought the herring moved 
               <br />
               out and they had to wait for them to come inside. 
               <br />
               Actually, from researches we made, the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men were getting a great deal of ﬁsh in the 
               <br />
               Humber ﬂats; there are large quantities also in 
               <br />
               Mclvers. The ﬁgure we give is 150,000 tons. Mr. 
               <br />
               Gammon said it should be 450,000. I said that 
               <br />
               was too big a joke to give the public.
