               on the facts that are contained in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report...</span> Sir, 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee was perfectly right in 
               <br />
               beginning their survey of the country’s ﬁnances, 
               <br />
               not at l934 but rather back early in the century, 
               <br />
               because it is quite impossible to understand the 
               <br />
               story of Newfoundland since 1934 unless we 
               <br />
               understand her story for some years before 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1934.“.</span> I propose to take the period 1920 down 
               <br />
               to the present time, because that period is within

               Mr. Smallwood That is exactly the position I 
               <br />
               take. We have been doing that in all the reports... 
               <br />
               The practice of the government in its accounting 
               <br />
               since 1934 has been this: on the one side, under 
               <br />
               the heading of “Revenue” they place everything 
               <br />
               they received, and on the other side under the 
               <br />
               heading of “Expenditures” they place everything 
               <br />
               they spent. Whether public money is spent on 
               <br />
               ordinary account or current account, capital or 
               <br />
               reconstruction or special account, it is all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex‘</span> 
               <br />
               pended... There is no more point in the practice 
               <br />
               of showing the total expenditures as capital or 
               <br />
               ordinary than there is to call what was spent in 
               <br />
               October different from what was spent in 
               <br />
               November.... The table showing the expenditures 
               <br />
               of the government for that year should show 
               <br />
               every dollar and every cent they spent. Similarly, 
               <br />
               on the revenue side every dollar that the govem~ 
               <br />
               ment receives goes into what is called the Con- 
               <br />
               solidated Revenue Fund —- abbreviated CRF.... 
               <br />
               So when a table is compiled showing what money 
               <br />
               the government has received in a year, every cent 
               <br />
               they received should be in that table, and every 
               <br />
               cent which they have spent. The Commission of 
               <br />
               Government has done exactly that since 1934.... 
               <br />
               Unfortunately, in taking the reports of the 
               <br />
               Auditor General from 1920 to 1934 that cannot 
               <br />
               be done, because it was the practice up to 1934 
               <br />
