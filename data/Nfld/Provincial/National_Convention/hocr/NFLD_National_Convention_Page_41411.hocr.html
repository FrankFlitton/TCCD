               Mr. Chairman The actual position is this: cer- 
               <br />
               tain members here, in addressing themselves to 
               <br />
               the business before the Chair, intimated to me 
               <br />
               they had a distinct preference for one of the two 
               <br />
               forms of government contained in the motion. 
               <br />
               That was deﬁnite. But before they were prepared 
               <br />
               to support the motion, they wanted an assurance 
               <br />
               from me that they should have the opportunity of 
               <br />
               recording their preference. I assured them it was 
               <br />
               my duty to do that. Surely, if I do it twice I cannot 
               <br />
               be criticised. If I postpone doing it now, and some 
               <br />
               members do not get the opportunity of expressing 
               <br />
               their preference, I might be open to fair criticism 
               <br />
               for not doing it now. If your preference is for the 
               <br />
               form contained in the motion not yet before the

               Mr. Smallwood Point of order. Next order of

               order no. 2. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins This is part of no. 2. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy Order no. 1 is not disposed of. There

               <br />
               sir. I am not going to be dictated to. We should

               decide on order no. I ﬁrst and then tackle order

               no. 2.

               Mr. Bradley I do not know what all this fuss is 
               <br />
               about. There is no reason for it. If a member wants 
               <br />
               to record his preference he can do so now, accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the Chairman. He has the right if he so 
               <br />
               wishes. If the Chairman wants to give the mem- 
               <br />
               bers the opportunity of recording their 
               <br />
               preference, I do not see any reason why it cannot 
               <br />
               be done. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy You or Mr. Smallwood have no right

               to interfere. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley You do not know what you are 
               <br />
               talking about.

               Mr. Chairman I want to rule now on your point

               of order. I do not think in the light of standing 
               <br />

               <br />

               the right of stating his preference as between 
               <br />
               these two. If members want to do it now or
