               an expenditure of only $15 million for the

               the beginning, and they must necessarily be only 
               <br />

               be $19.5 million, call it $19 million, and the 
               <br />
               revenue should be $13.5 million; that leaves you

               I realise that in mentioning reconstruction, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood did say, when the question was 
               <br />
               raised on roads, that $3 million would be 
               <br />
               withdrawn annually from the surplus of $28 mil- 
               <br />
               lion which would be deposited with the Canadian 
               <br />
               government, as provided in the Grey Book, at an 
               <br />
               annual interest of 2 5/8%.... If we withdraw that 
               <br />
               amount for eight years we would withdraw $24 
               <br />
               million. Now the surplus is only $28 million. On 
               <br />
               page 3 of the Grey Book we have to freeze 
               <br />
               one-third of that, which we can’t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">touch.</span> That’s 
               <br />
               part of the terms. If we freeze one-third, that‘s 
               <br />
               over $9 million, that brings it down to $18 million 
               <br />
               surplus. So you can only draw your $3 million a 
               <br />
               year for six years, not eight, and the last two years 
               <br />
               you can’t have anything to draw, if I understood 
               <br />
               his explanation yesterday.... I contend that we 
               <br />
               should not touch that surplus; it should be there 
               <br />
               for some day when we may need it. There has 
               <br />
               been no large amount provided for emergencies, 
               <br />
               or able-bodied relief. I hope we won’t see the 
               <br />
               dole, but there is nothing for that. Because if 
               <br />
               times are going to be poor, and there’s going to 
               <br />
               be bread lines or soup kitchens, no matter if we 
               <br />
               are on our own or with Canada or the United 
               <br />
               States, our surplus should not be touched. We 
               <br />
               should not start off presuming that we are going 
               <br />
               to use $3 million of it each year. If we do that,

               <br />
               was put in, that in eight years they would set up 
               <br />
               a royal commission to review the financial posi-

               form and scale of additional financial assistance, 
               <br />
               because we will need one. We will be insolvent, 
               <br />
               or so close to it that, perhaps, our only “out"

               would be to transfer the Labrador, for a price, to 
               <br />
               Quebec or the Canadian government. If that is the 
               <br />

               of the terms offered. l can‘t see any equitable

               ticularly in the last four years of the first eight. I 
               <br />
               don’t know how we are going to increase it with 
               <br />
               our present mileage of roads. The estimate in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               $1.25 million for roads, expenditure for the year.

               that we can use some of the withdrawals from the

               <br />
               fail to see where we can, out of revenue, do any

               construction on roads, or any other such service.
