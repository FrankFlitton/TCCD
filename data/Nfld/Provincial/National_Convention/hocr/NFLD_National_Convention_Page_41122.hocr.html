               Canadian experts as individuals who knew more 
               <br />
               about our country than we do ourselves. We are 
               <br />
               sick and tired, Mr. Chairman, of hearing about 
               <br />
               experts in this country. Nicholas Murray Butler, 
               <br />
               the late President of Columbia University in New 
               <br />
               York gives the deﬁnition of an expert as follows: 
               <br />
               “An individual who knows more and more about 
               <br />
               less and less.”

               Anyhow, let us see how these estimates from 
               <br />
               these Canadian experts stand up against the hard 
               <br />
               facts. Today we are collecting $10.5 million an- 
               <br />
               nually in personal income tax, corporation tax, 
               <br />
               and death duties (or, as they call it in Canada. 
               <br />
               “succession duties”). The Canadians say that 
               <br />
               under confederation they expect to collect from 
               <br />
               these sources about $11 million annually. Now, 
               <br />
               I ask, is this reasonable? Is this an accurate es- 
               <br />
               timate in view of the actual position? The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               point is that, under confederation, this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span> 
               <br />
               field of taxation would be far larger than it is now. 
               <br />
               Also, the Canadian rate of taxation would be 
               <br />
               higher. Just consider, for instance, the matter of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland income tax. With us, this tax <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap«</span> 
               <br />
               plies to single persons earning over $1,000 year- 
               <br />
               ly. But in Canada it takes in everyone who is 
               <br />
               single and not married, earning over $750 yearly. 
               <br />
               In Newfoundland a married man does not pay 
               <br />
               income tax on earnings up to $2,000 yearly. In 
               <br />
               Canada, it takes in persons earning over $1,500 
               <br />
               annually. The ordinary clerk on Water Street 
               <br />
               earning $1,000 a year if he is a single man, or if 
               <br />
               he is a married man and earning $1,500, under 
               <br />
               the income tax law he is not allowed to put in his 
               <br />
               own income tax; the Canadian government does 
               <br />
               not trust the employee; it is deducted off his 
               <br />
               salary each month. In Canada today there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80‘</span> 
               <br />
               odd million in refunds to be made, some of them 
               <br />
               to persons who are dead and buried and I hope 
               <br />
               are in heaven, and to whom the income tax 
               <br />
               refunds are no good. These were taken by the 
               <br />
               Canadian government and used during the past 
               <br />

               <br />
               these Canadian experts say that they expect to

               collect only $3.2 million from personal income 
               <br />
               tax annually, that the rest of it is incorrect? I asked 
               <br />
               about that the other day and the answer they gave 
               <br />
               me was evasive. They told me, in so many words, 
               <br />
               to read the Grey Book and I would get the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">infor»</span> 
               <br />
               mation, as if I had not read it. The most insulting 
               <br />
               document that ever entered the doors of this 
               <br />
               assembly. Mr. Chairman, I say they will collect 
               <br />
               not less than $4 million annually or nearly $1 
               <br />
               million in excess of the ﬁgure they give. And the 
               <br />
               same thing applies to corporation tax and succes- 
               <br />
               sion duties, they will also be higher than the 
               <br />
               misleading ﬁgures given us. And there is another 
               <br />
               feature. With us, no death duties attach to life 
               <br />
               insurance policies made payable to beneﬁciaries. 
               <br />
               But this is not so in Canada. If we enter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederv</span> 
               <br />
               ation we will have to pay death duties or succes- 
               <br />
               sion duties on these policies. And we were told 
               <br />
               we were not going to have any new taxes! And 
               <br />
               as we know, in this country there are some 
               <br />
               hundreds of thousands of dollars paid bene— 
               <br />
               ﬁciaries annually by Canadian life insurance 
               <br />
               companies. Here again we have an instance 
               <br />
               where, under confederation, new taxes would be 
               <br />
               imposed on Newfoundlanders, and consequently 
               <br />
               we have another source whereby the taxation 
               <br />
               payable to Canada would be increased. Mr. Fog- 
               <br />
               will made a breakdown of these taxes. The ex- 
               <br />
               perts did not come down here and tell us all about 
               <br />
               these taxes, neither did they give the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation any information. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood said that there will be much 
               <br />
               duty free goods coming in here and that will 
               <br />
               decrease revenues correspondingly. I want to say 
               <br />
               that all kinds of goods are coming in here today 
               <br />

               <br />
               pay duty on them entering Canada. Did these 
               <br />
               experts take the invoices in the Customs? Did 
               <br />
               they get the points of origin of things? Certainly
