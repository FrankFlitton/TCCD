               It is evident to me the government never saw 
               <br />
               the Quebec act. There was no copy of the Quebec 
               <br />
               act in this country until a few days ago... Our 
               <br />
               government never took the trouble to ﬁnd out 
               <br />

               I can’t understand some of those who get up 
               <br />
               in an elder statesman style, and suggest that this 
               <br />
               act will redound to the benefit of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> We 
               <br />
               have got to think not of the beneﬁts we will get 
               <br />
               in the next ten years, but of the beneﬁts of that 
               <br />
               iron ore deposit 50 years hence. Mr. Higgins has 
               <br />
               drawn to your attention they way in which the 
               <br />
               iron ore deposits in the States have been depleted. 
               <br />
               We have a deposit in the Labrador and we don’t 
               <br />
               know the extent of it, but we are told they are sure 
               <br />
               of 260 million tons of ore, and they have only 
               <br />
               scratched the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surface.</span> We have a deposit which, 
               <br />
               if properly handled by the government, could 
               <br />
               insure to the present population of this country 
               <br />
               something which will certainly redound to their 
               <br />
               beneﬁt in the future. I therefore can‘t agree with 
               <br />
               the people who get up, and more or less 
               <br />
               sanctimoniously say, “We can’t do anything, the 
               <br />
               act is made and we will have to put up with it. We 
               <br />
               hope they will make a proﬁt, and if they do we 
               <br />
               shall get 5%.” If we don't get 5%, we will get 
               <br />
               nothing. Some say, “Yes, you will have a town 
               <br />
               down there and you will get the profits that way." 
               <br />
               I can’t see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> It will take a good many years 
               <br />
               before we get a few thousand Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               working down there in Labrador. We have not got 
               <br />
               2,500 Newfoundlandcrs to go down there and 
               <br />
               mine for a good many years to come They want 
               <br />
               to mine, and they will get men from Canada, 
               <br />
               Poland, Czechoslovakia and other places, They 
               <br />
               want the ore, and they can’t wait until we get the 
               <br />
               miners to send there. lcan’t see that it will mean 
               <br />
               much to Newfoundlanders.

               It is my opinion that we should go on record

               <br />

               you, gentlemen, it is up to us to bring it to the 
               <br />
               notice of the Commission of Government and the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce, what we as a Mining Commit- 
               <br />
               tee think, and I think the majority of the Conven— 
               <br />
               tion will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree“.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy ....Although we agree that profits are 
               <br />
               very limited on iron ore, yet I cannot believe that 
               <br />
               10 cents per ton is an unreasonable charge to 
               <br />
               make for royalty. It is so insigniﬁcant that I 
               <br />
               cannot believe that any company would attempt 
               <br />
               to go there if they did not have a reasonable 
               <br />
               assurance they would make a greater proﬁt than 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> I realise we are not miners or great indus- 
               <br />
               trialists, but our concern over these matters has, 
               <br />
               I am sure, been motivated by a keen sense of our 
               <br />
               responsibility to the people who sent us here, in 
               <br />
               which matters the Commission of Government is 
               <br />
               apparently very little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concerned.</span> I can assure the 
               <br />
               Convention and the people that the changes made 
               <br />
               in 1944 have caused us many headaches, and we 
               <br />
               can only hope that some good will come to this 
               <br />
               country as a result of the changes. We have the 
               <br />
               railway and water-power acts to be drafted, and 
               <br />
               I hope that the government responsible will see 
               <br />
               to it that we get a deal more conducive to the best 
               <br />
               interests of the people of Newfoundland... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman i <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">don‘t</span> know how long this 
               <br />
