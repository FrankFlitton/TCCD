               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Raddy</span> I don’t think my ﬁgures are wrong 
               <br />
               about the Tobacco Co. or the Butter Co., but we 
               <br />
               don’t know about the Standard Manufacturing 
               <br />
               Co. or some of the others. 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie It is easy enough to find out. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill I would like to ask if the Committee 
               <br />
               did break down the fourth column, “Wages, 
               <br />
               Salaries and Commission"? What part would be 
               <br />
               wages? 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman The answer to that question is 
               <br />
               that that column includes wages and salaries, or 
               <br />
               the compensation for work done which in one 
               <br />
               form or another was paid out to their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">employees.</span> 
               <br />
               It was not broken down. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill That’s all the information you 
               <br />
               have? It is not broken down into wages, commis— 
               <br />
               sion, etc.? 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman No, it was not. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill Do you know what is the total 
               <br />
               number of employees? Does that include all 
               <br />
               employees in a particular industry, including 
               <br />
               directors, etc.? 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman Well, the question asked was, 
               <br />
               would they give the total number of employees. 
               <br />
               I presume that would include directors if they had 
               <br />
               any. In most cases there are only from three to 
               <br />
               five. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill In asking that question I was inter- 
               <br />
               ested because in Mr. Liddell’s report he made a 
               <br />
               survey of employees in the manufacturing firms 
               <br />
               in St. John’ s for March and April 1939. You 
               <br />
               have got it forJanuary to December, which is also 
               <br />
               quoted in his report, that is a total of 31 concerns 
               <br />
               in St. John’s. In a further report which he made 
               <br />
               he has it from 64 firms in St. John’s. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman Did he include all employers? 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill No... He gives a total of males and 
               <br />
               females in that table, that is for firms employing 
               <br />
               15 to 50; 22 firms reported, males and females, 
               <br />
               and ﬁrms employing from 50 to 150, for males 
               <br />
               and females. I thought perhaps that was available 
               <br />
               to the Committee, but I understand now that it is 
               <br />
               not included in the report. He gives the average 
               <br />
               returns for all firms in his survey. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge I would like to see as many local 
               <br />
               industries in this country as we can possibly get. 
               <br />
               It has been my duty for the past eight or ten years 
               <br />
               to inquire as to what those particular industries 
               <br />
               can afford to pay by way of wages. Then we 
               <br />
               would seek the wages that we think that industry 
               <br />

               <br />
               protection tariff, or subsidy as I call it. In Canada 
               <br />
               they use that word A lot of people are complain~ 
               <br />
               ing about the high cost of living, but I have had 
               <br />
               nobody yet tell me that anybody has complained 
               <br />
               about ways and means of getting protection of 
               <br />
               profit. Let’s look at our local industries here in 
               <br />
               St. John’s —— the clothing factory for instance. I 
               <br />
               wonder would anybody be honest enough to tell 
               <br />
               us what it costs the White Clothing Factory to 
               <br />
               make a suit of clothes, and what they charge our 
               <br />
               people in the outports for it? Most of us have an 
               <br />
               idea. I don’t know what committee this would 
               <br />
               come under, but I hope that in the near future 
               <br />
               some of this will be brought up. Then talk about 
               <br />
               the cost of living. I know why it is, we have too 
               <br />
               many like Ananias and Sapphira here — they 
               <br />
               keep back part of the price! If I was challenged 
               <br />
               on this I can willingly give more particulars. 
               <br />

               <br />
               dustries Committee I think I should add a few 
               <br />
               remarks to what has already been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said.</span> When I 
               <br />
               was selected as a member of this Committee I 
               <br />
               took it as a coincidence that I should serve as a

               that have enjoyed protective tariffs, than 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am...</span> 
               <br />
               I am a person who has passed through the hard 
               <br />
               school of knowing how to raise a large family in 
               <br />
               an outport with all the odds against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him,</span> I come 
               <br />
               from the rank and file, an orphan at the age of 14 
               <br />
               years, when my father was lost at sea in pursuit 
               <br />
               of a living by fishing which left me stranded. 
               <br />
               For 45 years I have been trying to eke out a 
               <br />
               living by fishing, lumbering, trapping, importing 
               <br />
               dry goods and exporting fresh salmon and raw 
               <br />
               furs. It can be expected of me to know something 
               <br />
               about the conditions under which we live, and 
               <br />
               how present and past governments have been the 
               <br />
               means of upsetting our economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">structure.</span> I am 
               <br />
               firmly convinced that one of the principal pests 
               <br />
               that ate the props from under our economic struc- 
               <br />
               ture was the protective tariff. It ate the life out of 
               <br />
               our main industries, particularly the fisheries. 
               <br />
               The fishermen do not have any protection. They 
               <br />
               are obliged to sell their product in competition 
               <br />
               with similar products throughout the world and it 
               <br />
               is not altogether the juice that a fisherman gets 
               <br />
