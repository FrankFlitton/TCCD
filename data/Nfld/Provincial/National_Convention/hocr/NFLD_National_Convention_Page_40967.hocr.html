               Mr. Chairman It is not a question of a fancy 
               <br />
               picture at all. It is important or relatively unim-

               other members think otherwise, and I am not

               million on the survey of this country, I think it 
               <br />
               would be one of the most important things in our 
               <br />
               history.... If we got the money, go ahead, but let 
               <br />
               our people understand that it is the province that 
               <br />
               would be going ahead, and these people are going 
               <br />
               to help. Now if the federal government promised 
               <br />
               to come down here and put in a survey, then we 
               <br />

               <br />
               words on this clause is this: Mr. Smallwood said

               <br />
               section in this Grey Book, and 1 want to point out 
               <br />
               that survey has been in operation in Canada for 
               <br />
               70 or less years, and we know the results in 
               <br />
               Canada. What can we expect from this idea of 
               <br />
               confederation if this is the most important see~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               like, or Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, if nothing 
               <br />
               better has resulted from these surveys, then why 
               <br />
               is this the most important section in this book? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It is the most important section 
               <br />
               because Mr. Smallwood says so. but it may have 
               <br />
               no importance at all so far as you or l are con- 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt On the question of an economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sur»</span> 
               <br />
               vey, I certainly agree with Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Smallwood.</span> What 
               <br />
               I was trying to find out from reading section 22 
               <br />
               is how far the public services of Canada would 
               <br />
               be of assistance in bringing about a proper 
               <br />
               economic and ﬁnancial survey of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as well. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood They don‘t mention a ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               survey. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt No, I know they don‘t, but i think that 
               <br />
               is something necessary to be done. I raised some 
               <br />
               doubt the time before when the public services 
               <br />
               sections were read, those public services which 
               <br />
               would apply to Newfoundland. I am sorry this 
               <br />
               debate came up this afternoon because I have 
               <br />
               been making a survey of these services, and this 
               <br />
               afternoon I am only going to refer to one section. 
               <br />
               and that comes under the Public Health and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wel~</span> 
               <br />
               fare Department. There are l7 services 
               <br />
               enumerated there. Four of those are treated here 
               <br />
               separately, all of them relating to financial 
               <br />
               benefits of one kind or other. They are: the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treat»</span> 
               <br />
               ment of sick and injured mariners; old age pen-

               sions; pensions for the blind; family allowances. 
               <br />
               Eight of these services are purely consulting ser— 
               <br />
               vices. Eight of them. The balance are like this: 
               <br />
               food and dmg standards; investigation and re- 
               <br />
