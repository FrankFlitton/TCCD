               not completely out off, if ﬁnancial stringency

               leaving a number of worksunﬁnished and would

               development of the country is concerned. We 
               <br />
               have applied the term “special expenditure” to 
               <br />
               certain recoverable advances which we are

               Members will no doubt wish to consider this 
               <br />
               memorandum at greater length. As is explained 
               <br />
               in the opening paragraphs of the memorandum, 
               <br />
               the schemes which are not already in hand must 
               <br />
               be regarded as tentative. Progress would depend 
               <br />
               entirely on the availability of funds and par— 
               <br />
               ticularly on the state of current revenue, out of 
               <br />
               which it would be hoped to meet as large a part 
               <br />
               as possible of such reconstruction expenditure, 
               <br />
               with the object of conserving the island’s surplus 
               <br />
               balances to meet the needs for a rainy day. It is 
               <br />
               pointed out in the memorandum that, while a 
               <br />
               considerable number of the schemes would not 
               <br />
               involve additional recurring costs of main— 
               <br />
               tenance, in other cases such a consequence must 
               <br />
               be considered. This is of particular importance in 
               <br />
               the case of new roads, which call for heavy 
               <br />
               recurring expenditure in maintenance. 0n the 
               <br />
               other hand, some of the schemes should lead to 
               <br />
               increased revenue or the saving of expense. I 
               <br />
               haVe previously referred to special expenditure, 
               <br />
               which amounts in the estimates for this year to 
               <br />
               approximately $3 millions. Over $2 millions of 
               <br />
               this is in respect of loans for housing purposes; 
               <br />
               $250,000 is for loans for the development of the 
               <br />
               ﬁshing industry; and the balance is required to 
               <br />
               ﬁnance operations at the Gander Airport, the cost 
               <br />
               of which we hope to recover. This is a matter 
               <br />
               about which the Commissioner for Public 
               <br />
               Utilities and Supply will be able to give you 
               <br />
               further information.

               <br />
               growth of revenue from $9.6 millions in 1934-35 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194546.</span> Present indications are that actual 
               <br />
               revenue in the current year will exceed the es-

               <br />
               tions are in advance of the revenue which we had 
               <br />
               received in the corresponding months of last 
               <br />
               year. We are still experiencing a “boom" 
               <br />
               economy which has not yet begun to recede. How 
               <br />
               long we can expect this happy state of affairs to 
               <br />
               continue is a matter of conjecture. In any event, 
               <br />
               we can, I think, expect a considerable increase 
               <br />
               over the level of revenue attained in the years 
               <br />
               before the war. Just as the depreciation in the 
               <br />
               value of money has increased government expen- 
               <br />
               diture and earnings generally, so we may expect 
               <br />
               a corresponding increase in ad valorem customs
