               I note the small amount the government has

               spent or is going to spend on research. It is a great 
               <br />
               pity. The ﬁsheries have been and will continue to 
               <br />
               be the mainstay — surely we should invest a little 
               <br />
               money in that vital aspect of it. I have not much 
               <br />
               to say about co-operatlon. I think it is a

               worthwhile movement and is contributing a great

               <br />
               I wish it all success. Another lastpoint, the matter

               of insurance for ﬁshermen, some sort of guaran-

               <br />
               state of affairs in 1947 that the primary producers 
               <br />
               are in such a precarious position. I would like to

               <br />
               it by persons engaged in the fresh fish trade. 
               <br />
               There are in St. John’s something like 1,000

               shops, maybe more. Quite a few of them are

               beginning to sell fresh ﬁsh.... The point is this: 
               <br />
               in Canada and the United States, and I imagine 
               <br />
               in Great Britain, shops selling fresh ﬁsh are re-

               facilities... I am wondering if there are any 
               <br />
               regulations on it. Is anything being done to 
               <br />
               protect the quality of ﬁsh after it leaves cold

               Mr. Job Until quite recently all or most of it was

               sold to one or two ﬁsh shops. Recently they are

               remark Mr. Harrington made when he said there

               controversy whatsoever. A remark was made that

               tion was right when they adopted that. It is an 
               <br />
               accomplished fact. The government has decided 
               <br />
               they are going to put the road through. It was most 
               <br />
               unfortunate that the name of the man who has 
               <br />
               established a plant there should have been intro- 
               <br />
               duced. 1am sure that gentleman would be the last 
               <br />
               to think there was a move on his part to get the 
               <br />
               road through. l do not think that even that 
               <br />
               gentleman thinks that because he wants to extend 
               <br />
               his plant in Burin, the government should extend 
               <br />

               <br />
               then got up and made a second speech. There are 
               <br />
               two questions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> what are the ﬁsheries worth to 
               <br />
               the country, and what are they worth to the

               people? Can they provide a decent living for the 
               <br />
               people engaged in it? I think the ﬁrst has been 
               <br />
               covered by the Committee. I am not going into 
               <br />
               that $25.25 or $24.75 millions. We take that with 
               <br />
               the knowledge there is an element of guesswork 
               <br />
               in any such estimate, and the Committee has done 
               <br />
               a good job in making that estimate. 1 also feel we 
               <br />
               have the right idea in being enthusiastic about 
               <br />
               branching out into newer forms of fishery.

               With regard to the second question — how 
               <br />
               much will the ﬁsheries be worth to the people 
               <br />
               engaged in it? That depends to a greater extent 
               <br />
               upon ourselves. I would like to say that even at 
               <br />
               high prices, even when conditions are at their 
               <br />
               best, in many parts of this country the ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               have not been providing a decent standard of 
               <br />
               living for the people engaged in them. There are 
               <br />
               several reasons for this. The high cost of credit 
               <br />
               that was stressed here. There are methods of 
               <br />
               handling and the attitude many people have 
               <br />
               towards the articles which they themselves 
               <br />
               produce. Five years ago the situation came up in
