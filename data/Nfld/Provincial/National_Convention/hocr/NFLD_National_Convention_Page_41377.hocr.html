               I quote you these two things, and I don’t call 
               <br />
               it my scripture, but you might call it that if you 
               <br />
               wish. I quoted ﬁrst from the Evening Telegram 
               <br />
               to show the opinion which the people in this 
               <br />
               country must have held in February, 1934. I am 
               <br />
               sure that’s quite plain to all of you. The editor was 
               <br />
               expressing the opinion not only of himself, but of 
               <br />
               the whole country, that Newfoundland had 
               <br />
               received a pledge from the British government 
               <br />
               that it would receive back its place amongst the 
               <br />
               dominions when it proved itself equal to the 
               <br />
               responsibility. And I quoted also Mr. Emrys-

               Evans, Undersecretary of State for the 
               <br />
               Dominions in 1943. Evidently the opinion which 
               <br />
               our people had in 1934 was also the opinion held

               Now I wish to make another statement of my 
               <br />
               own, which I shall endeavour to prove...mat if 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins had included in his motion any more 
               <br />
               forms than the two which he has or possibly one 
               <br />
               of them slightly amended, then he would have 
               <br />
               made the Convention Act ultra vires of the Let— 
               <br />
               ters Patent 1933—34. That is the statement which 
               <br />
               I hope to prove and that is why I said I agree 
               <br />
               wholeheartedly with Mr. Bradley when he made 
               <br />
               that statement. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman Do I understand your position is 
               <br />
               that had the motion been enlarged on by Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins by including another form of govern— 
               <br />
               ment, or an amended form of government, then 
               <br />
               the National Convention Act would be ultra 
               <br />
               vires?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett Yes, if he had included three forms, 
               <br />
               or four forms, then I say he would have made the 
               <br />
               Convention Act ultra vires of the Letters Patent 
               <br />
               of 1933-34. Now I have the Consolidated 
               <br />
               Statutes. There are four volumes, but I have only 
               <br />
               brought in one, because I find there the Letters 
               <br />
               Patent from 1832 down to 1905 and 1917, includ- 
               <br />
               ing 1832, and 1855 and also 1876, and I take it 
               <br />
               that these Letters Patent were our constitution. I 
               <br />
               take it that around these Letters Patent are 
               <br />
               wrapped our very laws. These Letters Patent 
               <br />
               themselves gave our past legislators the authority 
               <br />
               to create these acts, every one of them. Not one 
               <br />
               of them could have been made unless there had 
               <br />
               been the Letters Patent to give the legislator 
               <br />
               authority, or the Governor authority to sign these 
               <br />
               acts. Whether you agree with me or not, that is 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely my opinion. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, sir, 1933. Up to that time the Letters 
               <br />
               Patent 1876 to 1905 were actually the constitu— 
               <br />
               tion of this country. In 1934 these were 
               <br />
               suspended, and we had the Letters Patent 1934 in 
               <br />
               their place. I take it therefore as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self‘evident</span> that 
               <br />
               all acts of law or otherwise that have been made 
               <br />
               by the Commission of Government since that 
               <br />
               time are made under and by virtue of the Letters 
               <br />
               Patent, 1934. I want, sir, your opinion on that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is correct. I think the effect 
               <br />
               of the Letters Patent of 1934 was to suspend our 
               <br />
               free political institutions under the several acts to 
               <br />
               which you have drawn our attention. I think that’ s 
               <br />
               a very safe and inescapable conclusion.
