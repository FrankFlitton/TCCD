               Mr. Chairman, our position now is the same 
               <br />
               as it was in 1932. So I think that the great un-

               solved problem of Newfoundland is the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               be solved, it will be solved only by a government

               <br />
               not demand modiﬁcations. No, we took it all 
               <br />
               down, hook, line and sinker, and we appointed a

               crossed the t’s. Let us not make that mistake

               <br />
               all we have to do is insist on it.... Let us all agree 
               <br />
               that this form of Commission government must 
               <br />
               be stopped. Does it automatically resolve our 
               <br />
               problems to scrap this system? What shall we 
               <br />
               have to replace this present form? Responsible 
               <br />
               government, you say. Yes, responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment, but only in the sense that the government 
               <br />
               is responsible to a parliament elected by the 
               <br />
               people. The principle of responsible government 
               <br />
               is right. It is sound. No other form of government 
               <br />
               is right, or can succeed, but we are unworthy if 
               <br />
               we fool ourselves into the belief that the adoption 
               <br />
               of this sound British and democratic principle 
               <br />
               will automatically solve our problems. 
               <br />
               Responsible government is the normal thing 
               <br />
               in the British Empire. It is practised in the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, in Northern Ireland and in Eire, and in 
               <br />
               Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and 
               <br />
               Canada. Under responsible government the 
               <br />
               government executives are responsible to parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. Parliament is elected by the people, and the 
               <br />
               government can hold ofﬁce only as long as it 
               <br />
               commands the conﬁdence of parliament. Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment itself, having been elected by the people, 
               <br />
               and having to answer to the people again when 
               <br />
               the term is up, is necessarily responsible to the 
               <br />
               public. That is the glory of responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govemu</span> 
               <br />
               merit; but it also possesses some dangers. Is it 
               <br />
               possible to set up a system that will prevent the 
               <br />
               evils of 1920 - 1934, or at least the more serious 
               <br />
               of those evils? Let us not make the mistake of 
               <br />
               attributing to responsible government the many 
               <br />
               evils and weaknesses which in fact are the results 
               <br />
               of other causes altogether. But having guarded 
               <br />
               against making that mistake we may yet honestly 
               <br />
               recognise the dangers that do lie in the practice 
               <br />
               of responsible government —— recognising them 
               <br />
               so as to start preventing them, or cataloguing 
               <br />
               them, or classifying them, and then devising 
               <br />
               ways and means of heading them off. We have 
               <br />
               two great sources of knowledge in our effort to 
               <br />
