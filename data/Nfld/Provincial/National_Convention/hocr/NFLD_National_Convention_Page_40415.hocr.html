               them... I feel the Committee has done a good job 
               <br />
               and we want to get on with it, but I also feel very 
               <br />
               strongly about this matter of putting the ﬁsher~ 
               <br />
               man off with such a small allocation, some as low 
               <br />
               as $100 and $500 each — the top men get $700 
               <br />
               each. Then they turn around and give men who 
               <br />
               want to start farming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> very often men who 
               <br />
               know nothing about it —~ $6,000 to $7,000. I will 
               <br />
               say, as I said before, that time will prove that the 
               <br />
               $6,000 will be more like $10,000. If they had 
               <br />
               given those poor ﬁshermen one of these little 
               <br />
               boats, these ﬁshermen, after they were dis- 
               <br />
               charged, if given that $1,000, plus the bounty, 
               <br />
               could have built their boats and owned them. It 
               <br />
               would have been an asset to the country. I know 
               <br />
               what these men from Bonavista and Trinity are 
               <br />
               up against, they have to go offshore to get their 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. I am firmly convinced that if the government 
               <br />
               had spent half that money to rehabilitate the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen and created a job somewhere else for 
               <br />
               the others, the money would have been spent in 
               <br />
               a better way. I would like to see more cold 
               <br />
               storages and more bait depots all over the 
               <br />
               country. The ﬁshing industry is still the backbone 
               <br />
               of this country. I have been around South 
               <br />
               America, Jamaica and Cuba; there are very few 
               <br />
               cold storages there, they are like ourselves. The 
               <br />
               fresh ﬁsh industry is only in its infancy. We have 
               <br />
               not enough sharp—freezing facilities to take care 
               <br />
               of all the fresh ﬁsh. I was a ﬁrm believer in the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board, but like all other departments of 
               <br />
               government it has gotten out of control; it is 
               <br />
               costing more than it should for the service 
               <br />
               rendered.

               Mr. Vincent For the ﬁrst hour I thought the

               <br />
               another in Bonavista Bay? Or do they all conform 
               <br />
               to one hard and fast rule? That is important. I have 
               <br />
               an interest in the Labrador salt codﬁshery. In 
               <br />
               1946 a schooner in which I had a large interest 
               <br />
               discharged her cargo at a certain ﬁrm at St. 
               <br />
               John’s. I left this Convention chamber one eve- 
               <br />
               ning and went down to the schooner. It was 
               <br />
               raining hard. One of my friends across the way 
               <br />
               took me down in his car and he remarked it would 
               <br />
               be a poor day for handling, inspecting or culling 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsh.</span> Am'ving at the pier, what do 1 ﬁnd? 15 or 20 
               <br />
               men on the wharf opening barrels and packing 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. When I went on board I said to the captain, 
               <br />
               “It is not a good day for handling ﬁsh, is it?” He 
               <br />
               said, “Do not say anything, this is coming out 
               <br />
               No.1 Labrador — top grade." That is a very 
               <br />
               essential article of food and 1 am not going to 
               <br />
               stand for the ﬁshermen being blamed for some of 
               <br />
               the curing. I was told that one of the inspectors of 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Board was on the wharf that day. 
               <br />
               That does not tend to create a good market for our

               <br />
               St. John’s, ﬁshermen waiting before they can get 
               <br />
               a chance of landing their ﬁsh, and that fish in hot
