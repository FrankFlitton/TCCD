               connection with the salmon ﬁshery. The English 
               <br />
               market had been lost; none of the people who had 
               <br />
               been marketing salmon had made any arrange- 
               <br />
               ments with the American market; where I hap- 
               <br />
               pened to live the people had been salmon ﬁshing 
               <br />
               for years and then found there was no way to 
               <br />
               dispose of the salmon. No one wanted them, so 
               <br />
               they thought. These people learned their lesson 
               <br />
               the hard way. I want to assure the Convention that 
               <br />
               they will never be caught in that position again. 
               <br />
               They have an organisation that will put it on the 
               <br />
               market for them. It seems to me that while it is 
               <br />
               not quite self-evident, while we ought to have a 
               <br />
               certain amount of faith in the produce of the 
               <br />
               country and in the ﬁsheries, I, at any rate, do not 
               <br />
               hesitate in going so far out on a limb as to say that 
               <br />
               barring absolute blank catches, the ﬁsheries can 
               <br />
               be so organised as to give a decent living to the 
               <br />
               people engaged in it.... If I did not think that, I 
               <br />
               would clear out of this country. We have to have 
               <br />
               a different approach from anything in the past... 
               <br />
               While I concur with the government’s putting 
               <br />
               more money into research; while I have nothing 
               <br />
               but the highest esteem for people who have faith 
               <br />
               enough to build cold storage industries and try to 
               <br />
               develop new markets; I feel there is one essential 
               <br />
               factor in the long or perhaps in the short run, the 
               <br />
               success or failure of our Newfoundland ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               will depend to a very great extent on the people 
               <br />
               who are engaged in the primary production. 
               <br />
               There are two ways we can get their interest

               in their own welfare more than they have shown 
               <br />
               in the past: one is through educational methods,

               successful when the fishermen are shareholders 
               <br />
               of the enterprise and when their income depends 
               <br />
               as much on the successful marketing operation as
