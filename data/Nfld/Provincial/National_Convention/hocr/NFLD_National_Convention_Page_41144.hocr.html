               I admit that I have strongly stressed on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion in this Convention, and before 
               <br />
               this Convention ever met, the importance and 
               <br />
               value to Newfoundland of the potential wealth of 
               <br />
               Labrador.... During my recent two weeks in 
               <br />
               Canada I made enquiries about this whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">busi«</span> 
               <br />
               ness, and was invariably told by mining men and 
               <br />
               other business interests that all Canada wants 
               <br />
               Newfoundland for is for the iron ore of Labrador, 
               <br />
               as well as the 50 or 60 million cords of timber 
               <br />
               which is available there for the manufacture of 
               <br />
               pulp and paper. Canada today, even though she 
               <br />
               is in serious ﬁnancial straits, has great national 
               <br />
               ambitions for the future. Canada is struggling to 
               <br />
               be one of the future powers of the world. Canada 
               <br />
               is sparsely populated. Her per capita population 
               <br />
               per square mile is less than that of our country. 
               <br />
               Canada carries a huge national debt, far too great 
               <br />
               for its present population of something over 12 
               <br />
               million people. There is only one redemption for 
               <br />
               this Dominion to the west of us, and that is 
               <br />
               increased population. In order that Canada may 
               <br />
               continue to expand, and equitably place the cost, 
               <br />
               she must increase her population to not less than 
               <br />
               20 million. That is necessary if Canada hopes to 
               <br />
               survive and develop as a nation. By the inclusion 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland in the Canadian federation, 
               <br />
               Canada would be in the position of controlling 
               <br />
               the steel production of the entire North American 
               <br />
               continent. This would be her salvation from an 
               <br />
               economic standpoint. I say that our Labrador 
               <br />
               possession must be guarded for the future genera- 
               <br />
               tions of Newfoundland. I realise that strong in- 
               <br />
               fluences are at work, both governmental and 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial, to rob from Newfoundland her God- 
               <br />
               given rights. We, as a people, owe it to the future 
               <br />
               generations yet unborn, to guard those interests 
               <br />
               handed to us by a kindly Providence.

               This whole Labrador business looks to me 
               <br />
               something like the deal made between Russia and 
               <br />
               the United States when Russia sold Alaska for 
               <br />
               about $7 million. Like Labrador, Alaska was 
               <br />
               considered a barren <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wasteland.</span> and the Russians

               thought they were making a good deal; but hardly

               was the ink dry on the contract when Russia had

               Before concluding my remarks on this budget 
               <br />
               presented by Mr. Smallwood, let us see what 
               <br />
               would be our total revenues and total expendi— 
               <br />
               tures for the period of 12 years, by which time the 
               <br />
               transitional grant will have been eliminated and 
               <br />
               the Province of Newfoundland would be ex- 
               <br />
               pected to administer its own affairs and balance 
               <br />
               its accounts through the avenue of further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxae</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At the rate of $19.5 million annual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expendi~</span> 
               <br />
               ture, we would have spent at the end of 12 years 
               <br />
               the enormous sum of $234 million. During the 
               <br />
               same period, our revenues derived from subsidies 
               <br />
               and other sources based on Mr. Smallwood’s own 
               <br />
               ﬁgures would amount to slightly over $116 mil— 
               <br />
               lion, exclusive of transitional grant. Now if we 
               <br />
               add the transitional grant for 12 years on the basis 
               <br />
               outlined in the Grey Book, we ﬁnd that Canada 
               <br />
               would pay the province an additional $26.25 
               <br />
               million. These two amounts would total $142.5 
               <br />
               million, which would leave a deﬁcit on ordinary 
               <br />
               account of over $90 million. This means that if 
               <br />
               we were to be in a position to balance our pro- 
               <br />
               vincial budget, we would have to impose taxes of 
               <br />
               an additional $7-8 million per year. However, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has compiled this budget of his 
               <br />
               to include all our surplus as revenue. In this case, 
               <br />
               we would be in the position of having to raise, in 
               <br />
               extra taxation, over $60 million for the 12 year 
               <br />
               period, or an annual increase in taxes of $5 mil- 
               <br />
               lion annually. On the other hand, if we adopted 
               <br />
               this sort of policy, we would not be able to extend 
               <br />
               our roads to foster the tourist business, we would 
               <br />
               have to leave our hospitals and other buildings as
