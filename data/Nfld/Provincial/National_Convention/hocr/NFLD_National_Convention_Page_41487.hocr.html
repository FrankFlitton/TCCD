               gathered here it is so given. We keep this night a

               a matter of supreme importance to the people of

               It may well be that this will be the last time in

               my life that I shall speak in this storied chamber. 
               <br />
               Certain I am that I shall have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further</span> occasion 
               <br />
               to speak during this Convention And so, sir, I 
               <br />
               must crave your indulgence for a moment, before 
               <br />
               I address myself to the motion in order that I may 
               <br />
               set the record straight on a matterin which I seem 
               <br />
               to have been much misunderstood. For the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of all those who have not been listening 
               <br />
               to what I have said in this Convention, but who 
               <br />
               may think that they have been, I wish to make the 
               <br />
               categoric statement that I have never said that 
               <br />
               what comes ﬁrst and before all else in life is three 
               <br />
               square meals a day. It just so happens that I 
               <br />
               believe in God. And any man who believes in 
               <br />
               God must, in consequence, admit to a hierarchy 
               <br />
               of values in which the spiritual and moral take 
               <br />
               precedence over the material. I am quite aware 
               <br />
               that there are more important things in life than 
               <br />
               three square meals a day. The causes for which 
               <br />
               all generations of men have suffered persecution, 
               <br />
               for which they have endured torture and death, 
               <br />
               for which they have fought and gladly died, have 
               <br />
               drawn not upon the stomach for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspiration.</span> True 
               <br />
               it is that men have fought and died and done 
               <br />
               murder in their time for food. But to bear witness 
               <br />
               to the good and the true and the beautiful — to 
               <br />
               bear witness to these things, men have starved.

               It will perhaps help to explain my insistence 
               <br />
               upon the importance of three square meals a day 
               <br />
               if I say that, in the ﬁrst instance, I came into this 
               <br />
               chamber fully determined to insist upon that very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing.</span> I knew in advance that we should hear 
               <br />
               much of sacred heritage. I knew that there would

               be much pointing to these hallowed walls. I knew 
               <br />
               that we should hear much calling to witness of all 
               <br />
               those who were giants in their day and genera- 
               <br />
               tion. Indeed, I was afraid that we should hear so 
               <br />
               much of all these that we should hear of nothing 
               <br />
               else. I was afraid that we should work ourselves 
               <br />
               up into such ecstasies about the glories of our 
               <br />
               land and past, as to completely forget that there 
               <br />
               had gone into the making of that glory, in addition 
               <br />
               to much blood, sweat and tears, much hunger, 
               <br />
               much bitterness of spirit born of being out at the 
               <br />
               elbows and down at the heels. And so I did 
               <br />
               promise myself away back at the beginning to 
               <br />
               remind this Convention every now and then that 
               <br />
               sacred heritage is not enough — that it is also of 
               <br />
               some importance that the people eat. And to keep 
               <br />
               me reminded of my promise to myself, I brought 
               <br />
               into this house with me a monitor to sit at my 
               <br />
               elbow —— a monitor whom I have called my last 
               <br />
               forgotten fisherman on the bill of Cape St. 
               <br />
               George.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Need I say it has notbeen a particular, speciﬁc, 
               <br />
               solitary individual in whose name I have spoken 
               <br />
               so frequently, but rather a symbolic ﬁgure, a 
               <br />
               ﬁgure symbolic of all the ﬁshermen in all the 
               <br />
               harbours, on all the islands, on all the bills of all 
               <br />
               the capes of this country. Time and again I have 
               <br />
               undertaken to remind this Convention of that 
               <br />
               symbolic forgotten ﬁsherman whose shadow is 
               <br />
               across all our history. I have spoken of the grim 
               <br />
               Gethsemane he has endured, of how great has 
               <br />
               been his historic difﬁculty in making ends meet, 
               <br />
               of how it has not been easy for him to bring up 
               <br />
               his children in the fear and love of God, and with 
               <br />
               their bellies empty. I am satisﬁed that I have done 
               <br />
               the most that I could in his name, and I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that I have been right in doing so. For 
               <br />
               the person of my last forgotten ﬁsherman on the 
               <br />
               bill of Cape St. George is just as sacred to me as 
               <br />
               the person of the most revered statesman who 
               <br />
               ever sat in this house. I am convinced that I have 
               <br />
               not been in error in insisting upon three square 
               <br />
               meals a day for my symbolic ﬁsherman. And in 
               <br />
               doing so I have thought that three square meals a 
               <br />
               day for him are not without reference to the 
               <br />
               spiritual. For I believe that other things being 
               <br />
               equal, a man can the more easily save his immor— 
               <br />
               tal soul on a full stomach than on an empty one. 
               <br />
               I wouldn’t be surprised if that was part of what
