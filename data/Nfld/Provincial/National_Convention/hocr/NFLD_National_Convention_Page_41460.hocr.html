               the Government of Canada can offer. No

               Canadian government could possibly offer

               Newfoundland better terms, not even if an

               I would like to repeat again what I did say on that

               occasion to which Mr. Smallwood made answer. 
               <br />
               I quoted from the reply from the Canadian 
               <br />
               government to our request for these discussions. 
               <br />
               “The Canadian government is of the opinion that 
               <br />
               the questions to be discussed with the delegation 
               <br />
               are of such complexity and of such signiﬁcance 
               <br />
               for both countries that it is essential to have a 
               <br />
               complete and comprehensive exchange of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">infor~</span> 
               <br />

               curate appreciation of the position may be gained 
               <br />
               on each side.” I drew your attention to the word-

               ing of this reply and, in particular, “the questions

               - As you are aware, our delegation had no 
               <br />
               expert assistance of any kind. Application 
               <br />
               was made to the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               for such assistance, but the application was 
               <br />
               refused. On the Canadian side, the cabinet

               members designated to take part in the dis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the civil service of Canada. Moreover, the 
               <br />
               problem of confederation had been under 
               <br />
               active study by this particular group since 
               <br />
               October of last year. Actually, Canadian 
               <br />
               government ofﬁcials have been studying the 
               <br />
               proposition for some years.

               no such assistance during the discussions. In

               What you say, is the proper approach? In

               my opinion before union should be recom-

               <br />

               <br />
               and advise the effect such Union would have. 
               <br />
               The heads of these departments would then 
               <br />
               confer with a delegation having full powers 
               <br />
               to negotiate. In other words, the case for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would be carefully prepared 
               <br />

               I trust that my fellow members of the

               any reflection on them when I say that the

               delegation was not competent to discuss the

               the case of Mr. Smallwood), that none of us

               I must frankly confess that the offer we

               <br />
               fully conﬁdent that a delegation properly in—

               formed, assisted by competent advisers, and 
               <br />

               received I say that with full knowledge of 
               <br />
               what I am saying. From information I 
               <br />
               gathered from various sources during our 
               <br />
               visit to Ottawa, I am certain that the Canadian

               properly presented Again I repeat with full 
               <br />
               knowledge of what I am saying, that we can 
               <br />
               still get a better offer or, if you will, more
