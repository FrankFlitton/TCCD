               Firstly, because the report of the royal

               commission and the proposals of His 
               <br />

               ness and great sympathy with our situation

               throughout its many pages, and because the 
               <br />
               offer is an especially generous one.

               <br />

               <br />
               form of representation, and I also believe that 
               <br />
               when the need is evident, this will not be

               <br />
               beyond doubt that our present form of full

               responsibility is not suited to a large country 
               <br />

               our population is so scattered and isolated 
               <br />
               and out of touch with its fellow citizens, that 
               <br />
               it is extremely difﬁcult for it to understand

               As you are aware, sir, it seems to be clear from

               opinions expressed at this Convention that New- 
               <br />
               foundland interests have been, in some cases,

               government, though an admittedly very friendly 
               <br />
               one. Owing to the secrecy of the Commission’s 
               <br />
               deliberations we do not know to what extent our 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Commissioners fought for our in—

               <br />
               as Newfoundlanders they did their bestin at least 
               <br />
               mildly protesting against long leases; and 
               <br />
               probably felt that anything stronger than a mild 
               <br />
               protest would be, and perhaps was quite useless 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Commission. Moreover, it must not be forgot— 
               <br />
               ten that they must have been inﬂuenced while the 
               <br />
               war was in progress by the fact that everything 
               <br />
               was of minor importance except steps for win-
