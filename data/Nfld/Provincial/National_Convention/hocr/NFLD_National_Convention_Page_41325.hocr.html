               In mentioning this I have a panicular aspect 
               <br />
               of our future in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mind.</span> I am convinced that our 
               <br />
               economic future, or some security of it, lies with 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">USA.</span> I say this for obvious reasons. The USA 
               <br />
               is one of the largest purchasers of our products, 
               <br />
               particularly of our newsprint and ﬁsh <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">products,</span> 
               <br />
               The USA, in turn, can supply practically all, if 
               <br />
               not all of our requirements. The USA is the most 
               <br />
               powerful and richest country in this world. There 
               <br />
               is still a tremendously large undeveloped market 
               <br />
               in that country for our products, a market that, if 
               <br />
               assisted by an economic union with the United 
               <br />
               States (under which there would be reciprocal 
               <br />
               arrangements), might mean unlocked-for 
               <br />
               developments of our industries, particularly 
               <br />
               processed ﬁsh of various kinds, a development 
               <br />
               that could mean much to our country. We could 
               <br />
               buy a lot more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">needed»</span> goods from that great 
               <br />
               country in return. We have the Americans here 
               <br />
               now in the bases they have established, and in 
               <br />
               return for a beneﬁcial arrangement with them, I 
               <br />
               see no reason why these bases and facilities could 
               <br />
               not be further extended, thereby providing an 
               <br />
               increased volume of employment for some of our 
               <br />
               people, and in return giving to the US a more 
               <br />
               beneﬁcial defence system and a less restricted 
               <br />
               action in the planning of defences, which would 
               <br />
               be to our advantage as much as to theirs. This 
               <br />
               would be a negotiated agreement, only possible 
               <br />
               through a government of Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               elected by the people. In addition to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pos»</span> 
               <br />
               sibility of an economic tie-up with the US, I 
               <br />
               believe it would be possible to re-open discussion 
               <br />
               on the question of the present bases which they 
               <br />
               have in Newfoundland today. It is impossible for 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government to do this, as 
               <br />
               they, through the British government, signed the 
               <br />
               original bases agreement and to them the matter 
               <br />
               is closed. Our own government would, however, 
               <br />
               be in a position to ask the consideration of the US 
               <br />
               to the question of discussion between them and 
               <br />
               our own elected government on the matter. I have 
               <br />
               reason to believe that Newfoundland, through a 
               <br />
               government of the country, would receive a sym- 
               <br />
               pathetic hearing, and in the light of our desire to 
               <br />
               negotiate an economic union, and to further offer 
               <br />
               them extension of or increases in bases, it is not 
               <br />
               beyond the bounds of possibility that we could 
               <br />
               secure some yearly rental for the bases now al- 
               <br />
               ready occupied. Even a rental small to them 
               <br />

               would be of no small assistance to us. The USA 
               <br />
               does not have to re—open the question of the 
               <br />
               leases, but I believe that there is a great possibility 
               <br />
               of their so doing, for the reasons I have just 
               <br />
               mentioned. Some members will endeavour to tell 
               <br />
               you that this suggested economic union is not 
               <br />
               possible, because the USA has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favouredvnation</span> 
               <br />
               treaties, whereby any facilities or beneﬁts in 
               <br />
               duties or import restrictions of goods going into 
               <br />
               their country, must be offered to these other 
               <br />
               nations, on the same basis as negotiations might 
               <br />
               be concluded with us. That might have been true 
               <br />
               not only in fact, but in effect in 1939 and prior to 
               <br />
               that year. Today, conditions and world problems 
               <br />
               are different from those of prewar days. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s strategic position, while per- 
               <br />
               haps realised, has never been acknowledged so 
               <br />
               openly as today. The advancement in war tactics 
               <br />
               as well as the discovery of such terrible weapons 
               <br />
               as the atom bomb, have made not only the USA 
               <br />
               but every country extremely conscious of their 
               <br />
               vulnerability, and the USA has realised and ap- 
               <br />
               preciated this fact for some time. Consequently 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, in its geographical position, is of 
               <br />
               tremendous importance to North America. This 
               <br />
               factor has changed the conditions of 1939 and 
               <br />
               prior to that, and for that reason alone they might 
               <br />
               very well consider, and be anxious to do so, the 
               <br />
               question of an economic arrangement with this 
               <br />
               country. There is no need for me to further outline 
               <br />
               the beneﬁts to our industries, both in New— 
               <br />
               foundland and the Labrador, that could well 
               <br />
               materialise from such a union with America, if 
               <br />
               we had a government of our own to make the 
               <br />
               negotiations, as the USA could not enter into 
               <br />
               these discussions until such time as the people of 
               <br />
               this country have responsible government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res«</span>

               Before concluding, I would like to tell you, in

               addition to the above beneﬁts of responsible

               government which they experienced in earlier 
               <br />
               years. I consider that a responsible government
