               pointed out, if this amendment to the amendment 
               <br />
               does not go through we might be here until May 
               <br />
               next. Personally I would like to see it ﬁnished 
               <br />
               next week, if possible, because I realise that the 
               <br />
               people who came here for this Convention are of 
               <br />
               the ordinary common people like myself. It is not 
               <br />
               going to affect the businessman how long we are 
               <br />
               here, and I do not say that with prejudice, but any 
               <br />
               unnecessary delays will naturally come on the 
               <br />
               Bell Island miner or the labourer of St. John’s or 
               <br />
               the men in the woods, and for that reason I am 
               <br />
               prepared to work night and day to get through 
               <br />
               with this Convention. I have often worked harder. 
               <br />
               I know what it is to go in the mines and work night 
               <br />
               and day. But I would like to be clear on this matter 
               <br />
               now before the Chair before I vote. I am going to 
               <br />
               vote for this amendment, even if it means we are 
               <br />
               to be here until next May or June, because I want 
               <br />
               to let those who sent me here know that I am 
               <br />
               doing all in my power to protect their interests 
               <br />
               and the interests of the people all over New- 
               <br />
               foundland as well. Furthermore I am voting for 
               <br />
               the amendment because I realise that by being too 
               <br />
               hasty we might be doing harm instead of good. I 
               <br />
               am opposed to confederation as I am a ﬁrm 
               <br />
               believer in the land of my birth, and will not be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed until Newfoundland possesses a respon- 
               <br />
               sible form of government, so as to make it a better 
               <br />
               place to live in with the least expenditure... 
               <br />
               Mr. Northcott Mr. Chairman, I want to vote for 
               <br />
               the amendment because I think it will give the 
               <br />
               Convention time to put its own House in order, 
               <br />
               and give the various committees time to assemble 
               <br />
               the facts and present their reports and debate on 
               <br />
               them...

               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, I feel that we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aln</span> 
               <br />
               lowed this debate to come down to too narrow a 
               <br />
               vision, as some people are thinking of the bit of 
               <br />
               heat it engendered. I think that, looking at the 
               <br />
               problems of Newfoundland, the Convention 
               <br />
               should ﬁnd out what is in our own country before 
               <br />
               going to another for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms.</span> I agree that some time 
               <br />
               or other in the future we could ﬁnd what the terms 
               <br />
               of confederation would be, but there is no need 
               <br />
               of rushing this issue. I do not want it thought that 
               <br />
               we are keeping valuable information from the 
               <br />
               people, but with such an important issue as con- 
               <br />
               federation with Canada or anywhere else there 
               <br />
               should be nothing left undone to ascertain the true 
               <br />
               facts, and we ought to have good terms ourselves 
               <br />
               to offer. I for one will support the amendment.

               Mr. Fogwill Mr. Chairman, I would like to have 
               <br />
               an explanation on the terms of reference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conv</span> 
               <br />
               tained in the act of 1946 regarding what forms of

               government should be placed before the people. 
               <br />
               I think we should know whether confederation is 
               <br />
               included in the forms of government to be placed 
               <br />
               upon the ballot paper if a national referendum is 
               <br />
               recommended by this Convention. Frankly I do 
               <br />
               not know what the terms of reference are or if this 
               <br />
               Convention is going to conﬁne itself to any 
               <br />
               specific number of forms of government to be 
               <br />
               balloted for.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Fudge I have listened very carefully to 
               <br />
               those who have spoken and I am wondering what 
               <br />
               prompted me to come here, because the whole 
               <br />
               matter is so confusing. I had an idea that our duty 
               <br />
               was to take stock after doing business for a period 
               <br />
               of 13 years, and that after doing that we should 
               <br />
               be able to ﬁnd out as near exactly as possible 
               <br />
               what our assets are. But, unfortunately, this mat- 
               <br />
               ter of confederation slipped in and the whole 
               <br />
               thing has been interrupted so far as stock—taking 
               <br />
               is concerned. It appears to me, as a judge of all 
               <br />
               trades, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro»confederates</span> have a boat for 
               <br />
               sale and that boat is called the Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               before there is a bid on it at all, it is pronounced 
               <br />
               100 years behind the times, leaky and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rotten,</span> 
               <br />
               How can you expect to make a sale and a good 
               <br />
               deal with it? In supporting this amendment of 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney I wish to go on record that I am 
               <br />
               prepared to defend this country to the best of my 
               <br />
               ability and I say let us ﬁnd out all the facts of our 
               <br />
               own country before taking it to another to auction 
               <br />

               Mr. Ballam Mr. Chairman, I have not spoken in 
               <br />
               this debate, except for a few minutes this after- 
               <br />
               noon, but I still say we have had too many 
               <br />
               speeches and too much time wasted. If we had 
               <br />
               less pussy-footing the debate on this resolution 
               <br />
               would have been over long ago. I think the whole 
               <br />
               issue has been made confusing, and I think that 
               <br />
               terms from Canada should be obtained,.otherwise 
               <br />
               the Convention will be remiss in its duty. The 
               <br />
               only point I can see in prolonging the debate is to 
               <br />
               decide when a delegation should be sent to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Otu</span> 
               <br />
               tawa. That is why I support the resolution. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">How</span> 
               <br />
               ever, though I am not a politician, perhaps it 
               <br />
               would be a good thing if this matter would be 
               <br />
               shelved until January next and, with this in mind, 
               <br />
               I could vote for Mr. Bradley’s amendment, as the 
               <br />
               machinery must be put in motion and the facts
