               Mr. Hollett I think you know my attitude 
               <br />
               regarding the whole confederation idea. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">main»</span> 
               <br />
               tain we are not a competent body to deal with it. 
               <br />
               I always felt we had no authority to do it and I 
               <br />
               still hold that. I suppose if I followed my con- 
               <br />
               science I would try to keep the thing from coming 
               <br />
               in here at all; but we did vote to send the delega- 
               <br />
               tion to Ottawa, and as a result His Excellency has 
               <br />
               chosen to send us some documents which he got 
               <br />
               from Mr. King. I therefore think we are duty 
               <br />
               bound to do something... The point <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Higgins 
               <br />
               raised is well taken. There were seven men on 
               <br />
               that delegation and either one, of course, would 
               <br />
               be eligible to take the chair. I have no objection 
               <br />
               to Mr. Smallwood’s taking the chair and piloting 
               <br />
               it through. Would you tell me this, sir, are you not 
               <br />
               in a similar position as the Speaker of the House 
               <br />
               of Assembly in the position which you hold now? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No. If i were Speaker of the 
               <br />
               House, I would not be occupying the committee 
               <br />
               chair at all. There would be a chairman of com- 
               <br />
               mittees to whom the thing in the ordinary course 
               <br />
               would go. I am in the paradoxical position of 
               <br />
               having to leave the equivalent of the Speaker’s 
               <br />
               chair, take the chair of committee, come back and 
               <br />
               report to myself; it is most unusual.

               Mr. Chairman I am not so sure about my posi- 
               <br />
               tion here.... There is nothing in our Standing 
               <br />
               Orders which permits me to appoint a chairman. 
               <br />
               I therefore hold our Standing Orders are silent on 
               <br />
               that point. That being so, I must take refuge in the 
               <br />
               mles of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               which brings me to Rule 122: “in forming a 
               <br />
               Committee of the Whole House, the Speaker 
               <br />
               before leaving the Chair shall appoint a Chairman 
               <br />
               to preside who shall maintain order in the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee." That order presupposes the appointment 
               <br />
               of a chairman to preserve order in committee, 
               <br />
               which I have been doing heretofore. Therefore

               is to say, appoint a chairman of the committee for 
               <br />
               the purpose of maintaining order. In the House of 
               <br />

               how long the debate will continue. Is it possible,
