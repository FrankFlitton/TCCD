               levied by Newfoundland. differences in the

               composition of imports must also be kept in 
               <br />
               mind. In 1945, the ratio of import duties 
               <br />
               collected to total imports into Canada was 
               <br />
               only 10.6%, and in I944 it was still lower at

               <br />
               these ﬁgures were greatly affected by heavy

               <br />
               I judge from that the figure taken is 10%. it does

               not make sense to me.
