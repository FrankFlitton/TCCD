               that we have nearly 1,200 veterans of the late war 
               <br />

               that we have thousands on the dole. I wonder if 
               <br />
               he knows that the price of ﬁsh fell last year and

               <br />

               <br />
               Chairman, just let the price of ﬁsh take a serious 
               <br />
               fall and this country would be on the broad of her 
               <br />
               back. Would he call that situation one in which 
               <br />
               we hold a pat hand? He may, but I certainly don’t.

               I turn to my good friend Mr. Bailey. Now I 
               <br />
               won‘t take much time replying to Mr. Bailey. 
               <br />
               He’s got it in his head that because most of the 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada go in heavily for municipal 
               <br />
               or town councils, therefore Newfoundland must 
               <br />
               if she becomes a province. He knows that towns 
               <br />
               or municipal councils have their own local taxes. 
               <br />
               So, from this he can’t be persuaded that we won’t 
               <br />
               have to have local taxes, whether we want to or 
               <br />
               not. It's no use my arguing with Mr. Bailey, 
               <br />
               because “A man convinced against his will/Is of 
               <br />
               the same opinion still." Mr. Bailey has his mind 
               <br />
               made up that whether we like it or not, we must 
               <br />
               have all our 1,300 little settlements governed by 
               <br />
               town councils or county councils. And why? 
               <br />
               Because that’s the way they do it in most of the 
               <br />
               other provinces. Now, in a way Mr. Bailey is a 
               <br />
               shrewder opponent of confederation than all his 
               <br />
               friends in this House put together. I pay him that 
               <br />
               compliment. He’s shrewd enough to realise that 
               <br />
               the only way, the only way to turn our people 
               <br />
               from confederation is to convince them that 
               <br />
               they’ll all have to have these town or county 
               <br />
               councils, that they’ll have to pay taxes on their 
               <br />
               little spots of land, on their homes, houses and so 
               <br />
               on, even their ﬁshing gear. If he can convince 
               <br />
               them of that, they’re not going to vote for con- 
               <br />
               federation; and he knows it, so that’s why he 
               <br />
               always talks about that. But incidentally, sir, it's 
               <br />
               time for Mr. Bailey to make up his mind on one 
               <br />

               point. In the one breath he tells us that we’ll be 
               <br />
               taxed to death if we go into confederation and in 
               <br />
               the next breath he tells us that we’ll be wards of 
               <br />
               Canada living on the people of Canada. Which of 
               <br />
               these two statements does he want us to believe? 
               <br />
               Or does he want us to believe both? Perhaps he 
               <br />
               has one eye on the people in Newfoundland who 
               <br />
               are scared of all those terrible taxes. For them, he 
               <br />
               has a lot of talk about how we’ll be taxed to death, 
               <br />
               and the other eye he keeps on the proud people 
               <br />
               amongst them; for them, he has a lot of talk about 
               <br />
               our being too proud to live on Canada. Now 
               <br />
               which does he mean? We’ll be wards of Canada, 
               <br />
               living on Canada, or does he mean that we’ll be 
               <br />
               taxed to death by Canada? He can’t have it both 
               <br />
               ways. Both these statements can’t be true and Mr. 
               <br />
               Bailey really should make up his mind. Oh, I’m 
               <br />
               sorry, I got Mr. Bailey mixed up with Mr. Hig— 
               <br />
               gins. I got my notes mixed. I’ll come back to Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins. I’m sorry if he felt neglected.

               Sir, Mr. Higgins tells us that an elected 
               <br />
               government would get better terms for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, better terms then the Ottawa delega- 
               <br />
               tion got. Now, would the members of a 
               <br />
               delegation to Ottawa be better men merely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be»</span> 
               <br />
               cause they had been elected to a government 
               <br />
               before they went to Ottawa? Would they be 
               <br />
               smarter because they were members of a cabinet? 
               <br />
               Would the Government of Canada take them 
               <br />
               more seriously then they took the Ottawa delega— 
               <br />
               tion? The answer to all these questions is, “No”. 
               <br />
               Let’s look at this Ottawa delegation. Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               is one of the greatest lawyers this country ever 
               <br />
               produced - an eminent King’s Counsel, a 
               <br />
               former Solicitor General, a former member of the 
               <br />
               cabinet -— would he have been a better man? 
               <br />
               Would he have been treated with greater respect 
               <br />
               if he had gone there as a cabinet minister? Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins himself is a practising barrister and 
               <br />
               solicitor, a King’s Counsel, incidentally. Would 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins become automatically a better man, 
               <br />
               merely by becoming a member of an elected 
               <br />
               government? Mr. Ashbourne is one of the best 
               <br />
               known and most widely respected businessmen 
               <br />
               in this country. He’s a former member of the 
               <br />
               House of Assembly, a university man, an ex- 
               <br />
               army officer of World War I. Would it make him 
               <br />
               a better man just to become a member of a 
               <br />
               government? About the Reverend Mr. Buny, I 
               <br />
               will say nothing more than the fact that he is a 
               <br />
               university graduate, and the man who is probably
