               a position to rule on this question because there

               are three schools of opinion amongst the Ottawa

               Therefore, since i can‘t get unanimity of opinion, 
               <br />
               all I can do is to say that we will go on as we have 
               <br />
               been going, and if any member is going to refer 
               <br />
