               Mr. Hollett tells us that the Canadian and 
               <br />
               British governments are trying to get New- 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation, and that in this they 
               <br />
               are being aided and abetted by the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government. If Mr. Hollett can convince our 
               <br />
               people of that — that the British government and 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government would like New— 
               <br />
               foundland to go into confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> then he 
               <br />
               will do more than any other hundred men to 
               <br />
               convince our people that confederation is the best 
               <br />
               thing for us. I hope Mr. Hollett and Major Cashin 
               <br />
               are right, I hope the British government and the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government are both in favour of 
               <br />
               confederation. Our Newfoundland people are 
               <br />
               much more likely to be guided by the British 
               <br />
               government and by the Commission of Govem- 
               <br />
               ment than they are by Major Cashin and Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett. If the British government and the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government are for confederation, 
               <br />
               and Messrs. Cashin and Hollett are opposed to 
               <br />
               confederation, then I’ll be happy.

               Mr. Hollett asks why these microphones were 
               <br />
               put in this building. That is an easy one, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman. The microphones were put here so that 
               <br />
               what we say could be broadcast to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> 
               <br />
               What we say is broadcast so the people can hear 
               <br />
               it. They are given to hear it so that they can get a 
               <br />
               good idea of what they would he in for, if we got 
               <br />
               the kind of government that a majority of the 
               <br />
               members here want the country to have. Why, 
               <br />
               that fact alone makes the broadcasting of our 
               <br />
               proceedings worth at least a million dollars to our 
               <br />
               people.

               Mr. Vardy tells us that the large number of

               <br />
               question of confederation in the referendum must 
               <br />
               be protected against themselves. They must be 
               <br />
               protected against themselves, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Vardy says.

               But isn’t that what Mr. Alderdice did, when he 
               <br />
               refused to let the people decide on the question 
               <br />
               of Commission of Government, although he had 
               <br />
               promised them that he would let them decide the 
               <br />
               question? He protected the people against them- 
               <br />
               selves, and now Mr. Vardy wants to protect the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people against themselves. Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, never in my life in this country have I 
               <br />
               heard the pure doctrine of Fascism and Nazism 
               <br />
               so neatly put as in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that/statement</span> by Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vardy.</span> 
               <br />
               It is the very essence of dictatorship that a handful 
               <br />
               of men set out to protect the people against them— 
               <br />
               selves. Or is it the new democracy we have had 
               <br />
               preached at us in this Convention? This is the 
               <br />
               strangest doctrine I ever heard — that Mr. Vardy 
               <br />
               wants to protect the people against themselves. 
               <br />
               Then Mr. Vardy says, “The people did not 
               <br />
               authorise us to deal with this confederation mat~ 
               <br />
               ter.” This, from a member who on two occasions 
               <br />
               voted here in the Convention to send the delega- 
               <br />
               tion to Ottawa to get the terms of confederation! 
               <br />
               When Mr. Vardy voted twice to send for the fair 
               <br />
               and equitable basis of union, or the terms, what 
               <br />
               was in his mind? Did he mean the terms to be 
               <br />
               gotten and then thrown into the wastepaper bas- 
               <br />
               ket? Or did he mean them to be dealt with by us? 
               <br />
               The people, sir, did authorise us to deal with this 
               <br />
               confederation matter, for they authorised us as 21 
               <br />
               Convention to deal with all forms of government 
               <br />
               that might be suitable to the people. To deal with 
               <br />
               them — not to decide them, but to let the people . 
               <br />
               decide. But Mr. Vardy says to the people of 
               <br />
               Trinity North, “No, good people, I won’t let you 
               <br />
               deal with this confederation matter. I will not let 
               <br />
               you vote on it. I am trying to protect you against 
               <br />
               yourselves." And sir, the people of Trinity North 
               <br />
               will remember those words at the right time. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy And they will remember you, too. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I turn now to Mr. Higgins. Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins touched on the question of divorce. This 
               <br />
               is an important matter and I am not going to waste 
               <br />
               time discussing any details. The position is very 
               <br />
               simple. We have no divorce law in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and I hope we never shall. If we go 
               <br />
               into confederation we will take no divorce law in 
               <br />
               with us, for we have no divorce law. What about 
               <br />
               after we get in? Will we pass a divorce law then? 
               <br />
               No, we will not. Will Canada pass a law for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, to grant divorce in New- 
               <br />
               foundland? No, sir, Canada will not. The Govem-
