               the Convention as a whole, and not merely from 
               <br />
               one member and I wonder if Mr. Hollett meant it 
               <br />
               to be that way, or was that a thought that he did 
               <br />
               not have in mind at all? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins All questions come from the Con~ 
               <br />
               vention, sir. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, if I might reply to 
               <br />
               that. As you know, the question arises from a 
               <br />
               meeting of the Steering Committee, which was 
               <br />
               held yesterday afternoon, and that Committee 
               <br />
               agreed such information should be obtained. I 
               <br />
               therefore felt it was proper that the enquiry 
               <br />
               should be laid on the table to be passed on to the 
               <br />
               Department of External Affairs. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Irleft</span> it therefore 
               <br />
               to your discretion, as to whether it should go or 
               <br />
               not. That’s why I worded it that way. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Well, Mr. Hollett, and 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, obviously the ﬁnal pronounce- 
               <br />
               ment upon the matter must of necessity be made 
               <br />
               by the Information Committee, and anything I 
               <br />
               say at this time is not necessarily binding upon its 
               <br />
               members. As I see this question, Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               Isee nothing whateverthe matter with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itr</span> It begins 
               <br />
               with the covering words, “I give notice that I will 
               <br />
               on tomorrow...”, and then it goes on to say, “Now 
               <br />
               therefore will the said Department of External 
               <br />
               Affairs inform the National Convention...” Here 
               <br />
               is information sought by a member of the Con- 
               <br />
               vention to be placed before the Convention as a 
               <br />
               whole. Idon’t see how this can be construed as 
               <br />
               being a request from the Convention. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sir,</span> Read on a little further 
               <br />
               if you will. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman “Now therefore will the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of External Affairs inform the National 
               <br />
               Convention...$9,400,000.” 
               <br />
               Mr. Smailwood Yes sir, read on a little further. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That’s all there is to it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwoud My understanding was that the 
               <br />
               Convention desires to know something, that 
               <br />
               those words appear in it. Not the questioner, but 
               <br />
               the Convention. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No, unless I am reading the 
               <br />
               thing altogether wrong. Here is a question... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Sir, I am not objecting to the 
               <br />
               question, you understand. As I heard it read, there 
               <br />
               occurred in it words to the effect the the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion desired certain information. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No, put simply Mr. Hollett <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re.</span>

               moment I see nothing wrong with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isn’t</span> it properly a 
               <br />
               question for the Information Committee? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Yes, except that Mr. Hollett has 
               <br />
               asked me to express an opinion at this time; and 
               <br />
               also arising out of the point raised by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, I felt I might go beyond my job 
               <br />
               and express my opinion on it. The matter will 
               <br />
               come before the Information Committee tomor- 
               <br />
               row, as I said before. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman. I am not quite right 
               <br />
               on the powers of the Information <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Committee.</span> 
               <br />
               Maybe I have developed an entirely different 
               <br />
               opinion of what its powers were: but as l remem- 
               <br />
               ber, its duties were to see that there was no 
               <br />
               repetition of questions. Not only that, but they 
               <br />
               would direct the questions to the proper division 
               <br />
               of government, or to the proper government in 
               <br />
               this case, and, as I remember it, that is as far as 
               <br />
               their authority went. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman You are wrong on the second 
               <br />
               point. The Information Committee can be 
               <br />
               responsible for directing specifically requested 
               <br />
               information into the hands of any particular ofﬁ~ 
               <br />
               cial or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcials.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Well, sir, that’s how I remember it. 
               <br />
               Some questions might be termed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“double-ban</span> 
               <br />
               relled“. and the Committee were to send the 
               <br />
               relevant portion to one department and the same 
               <br />
               with the balance to the other department; but as I 
               <br />
               see it they have no power whatever to interfere in 
               <br />
               any questions that are put by the delegates to this 
               <br />
               Convention, and that is what is happening. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I don’t know what you mean by 
               <br />
               interfering. This Information Committee was ap- 
               <br />
               pointed, I understand, by my predecessor, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Justice Fox, at the request of the government, 
               <br />
               who decided that there had to be some son of a 
               <br />
               sifting arrangement set up. In fact, ifl am proper- 
               <br />
               ly informed, they declined to answer or to deal 
               <br />
               with any questions unless they were first dealt 
               <br />
               with by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subcommittee</span> of the Convention. To 
               <br />
               that end an Information Committee was ap- 
               <br />
               pointed by Mr. Justice Fox, and its duty is to 
               <br />
               avoid repetition and to otherwise facilitate the
