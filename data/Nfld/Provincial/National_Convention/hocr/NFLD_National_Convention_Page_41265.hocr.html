               account of a trial of a famous Dutch painter. This 
               <br />
               man was on trial for collaboration with the Ger— 
               <br />
               mans when they were in Holland. He was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac‘</span> 
               <br />
               cused of selling to them some of the world’s 
               <br />
               famed Dutch paintings. His defense was that the 
               <br />
               paintings were not genuine, but were all fake. 
               <br />
               Experts were called in, not Canadian experts, to 
               <br />
               express their opinion, and experts agreed that the 
               <br />
               paintings in question were genuine, 200 to 300 
               <br />
               years old. The accused Dutchman was in a tough 
               <br />
               spot. In order to clear himself he dumbfounded 
               <br />
               the experts by showing how he did it; how he 
               <br />
               mixed the paint to make them seem 100 years old, 
               <br />
               and how he prepared the canvas to give it an aged 
               <br />
               appearance. And before the eyes of the experts 
               <br />
               he showed that the pictures, supposed to be 
               <br />
               genuine, were really fake pictures; and while he 
               <br />
               himself was a faker, that those who believed the 
               <br />
               pictures were genuine fools to have been taken 
               <br />

               I am not insinuating in any way that our good

               parable inasmuch as what seems to be a genuine

               thing to many people, when closely examined is 
               <br />
               not genuine at all. There have been times since 
               <br />
               this Canadian business has been debated and as I 
               <br />
               listened to Mr. Smallwood’s description of 
               <br />
               Canada, I have wondered if it were not some 
               <br />
               never—never land that he was talking about, or the 
               <br />
               lost Atlantis that some of the poets have written 
               <br />
               about. Mr. Smallwood’s description of that 
               <br />
               country leaves an overall picture of a present-day 
               <br />

               <br />
               According to the Canadian index from which I 
               <br />
               give these ﬁgures, in 1945 the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment collected in taxes an average of $142 per 
               <br />
               capita. This you will please note does not include 
               <br />
               the various provincial and town taxes, which are 
               <br />
               numerous and add up to a large ﬁgure per person. 
               <br />
               In Newfoundland in 1945, the per capita tax 
               <br />
               collected by our government amounted to $115 
               <br />
               per person, or just about a quarter of the amount 
               <br />
               collected by the Candian federal government. 
               <br />
               And please bear in mind, that outside of St. 
               <br />
               John’s and the other places where there are town 
               <br />
               councils, there are no additional taxes in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Now apart from the federal tax in 
               <br />
               Canada the provinces imposed additional taxes, 
               <br />
               and there are I believe eight of these taxes, the 
               <br />
               most important ones being gasoline tax, liquor 
               <br />
               tax, corporation tax, public domain tax and the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada subsidies system. Referring 
               <br />
               to the liquor tax, I am very much afraid that under 
               <br />
               confederation our good old Newfoundland 
               <br />
               screech would even be taxed. During the past 
               <br />
               year I have been meeting and talking to quite a 
               <br />
               few Canadian businessmen and others here in St. 
               <br />
               John’s, and I have been inquiring about the tax 
               <br />
               situation in Canada. They relate a long litany of 
               <br />
               taxes, some of which I never have heard before,
