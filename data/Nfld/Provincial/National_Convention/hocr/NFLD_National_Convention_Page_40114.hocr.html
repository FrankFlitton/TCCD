               Mr. Newell Mr. Chairman, the question of

               <br />
               though, until yesterday, it has not during the 
               <br />
               present century been a very live issue. It is never-

               theless a matter on which there is a wide diversion 
               <br />
               of opinion; it is also, perhaps, inevitable that the 
               <br />
               matter should come before this Convention. This 
               <br />
               country is in a state of change. Sometime next 
               <br />
               year our people are going to be called upon to 
               <br />
               vote for the form of government they desire. 
               <br />
               Many of us have not given much thought to

               possible forms of government over the past 
               <br />
               decade. Others have, and perhaps have already

               secured sufﬁcient information to make up their 
               <br />
               minds. Whatever conclusions these people have 
               <br />
               reached, and it is no secret that we have delegates 
               <br />
               here who have deﬁnitely made up their minds, we 
               <br />
               must see that they are given every opportunity to 
               <br />
               put their case before the Convention and the 
               <br />
               country, and that they are given a sympathetic

               hearing at the proper time.

               I have stated hitherto that I cannot conceive of

               any political democracy succeeding unless it is 
               <br />
               based on economic democracy. I hope to have an 
               <br />
               opportunity of enlarging on that thesis. I am 
               <br />
               therefore prejudiced, if you will, to the extent that 
               <br />
               before any form of government is adopted by this 
               <br />

               me but little. The issue cannot be evaded, if only 
               <br />
               because there are enough people in this country 
               <br />
