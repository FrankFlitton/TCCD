               ideal form of government would be a complete 
               <br />
               democracy. But a complete democracy is not 
               <br />
               practicable. The device of government by elected 
               <br />
               representatives is, however. as close as a modern 
               <br />
               state can come to straight democracy. What, he

               says, are the distinctive characteristics of the 
               <br />
               form of government best fitted to promote the 
               <br />
               interest of any given people? One of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               conditions on which good government depends 
               <br />
               is found in the qualities of the human beings 
               <br />
               composing the society over which the govem- 
               <br />

               The ﬁrst question in respect to any political 
               <br />
               institution is how far it tends to foster in the 
               <br />
               members of the community various desirable 
               <br />
               qualities, moral and intellectual. The government 
               <br />
               which does this the best has every likelihood of 
               <br />
               being the best in all other respects, since it is on 
               <br />
               these qualities, so far as they exist in the people, 
               <br />
               that all possibility of goodness in the practical 
               <br />
               operation of the government depends. The other 
               <br />
               constituent element of the merit of a government 
               <br />
               is the degree in which it is adapted to take ad— 
               <br />
               vantage of the amount of good qualities which 
               <br />
               may at any time exist, and make them instrumen- 
               <br />
               tal to the right purposes. The superiority of 
               <br />
               popular government rests upon two principles. 
               <br />
               The first is that the rights and interests of any 
               <br />
               person are only secure when the person interested 
               <br />
               is himself able and disposed to stand up for them. 
               <br />
               The second is that the general prosperity attains 
               <br />
               a greater height and is more widely enjoyed in 
               <br />
               proportion to the amount and varieties of the 
               <br />
               personal energies enlisted in promoting it. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Human beings are only secure from evil at the 
               <br />
               hands of others in proportion as they have been 
               <br />
               and are self—protecting; and they only achieve a 
               <br />
               high degree of success in their struggle with 
               <br />
               nature in proportion as they are self-dependent, 
               <br />
               relying on what they themselves can do, either 
               <br />
               separately or in concert, rather than on what 
               <br />
               others do for them. “It”, says Mill, “we consider

               the inﬂuence of a form of government upon char-

               <br />
               government over every other still more divided 
               <br />
               and indisputable. The question really depends on 
               <br />
               another and more fundamental one, namely, 
               <br />
               which of two common types of character, for the 
               <br />
               general good of humanity, it is the most desirable 
               <br />
               should predominate, the active or the passive 
               <br />
               type; that which struggles against evils or that

               Now, are we Newfoundlanders of the passive 
               <br />
               type of character? It would seem so. “For”, as 
               <br />
               Mill says, “there can be no doubt that the passive 
               <br />
               type of character is favoured by the government 
               <br />
               of one or a few (such as seven men appointed by 
               <br />
               one man 2,000 miles away — Commission of 
               <br />

               <br />
               with the idea of government by commission, by 
               <br />

               <br />
               will agree with me on that.

               Irresponsible rulers (i.e. irresponsible to the 
               <br />
               people) need the quiescence of the ruled more 
               <br />
               than they need any activity but that which they 
               <br />
               can compel. The only government that can freely 
               <br />
               satisfy all exigencies of the social state is one in 
               <br />
               which the people participate. Any participation

               in government, even in the smallest function, is 
               <br />
               useful. And I want to indicate there, what part in 
               <br />
               the government today do our people share? What

               part do they take in the government of this

               We are all like the man to whom Mr. Keough 
               <br />
               referred yesterday: we do not care who sits in the 
               <br />
               seat of government as long as we get three square 
               <br />
               meals a day. Think that over and ask yourselves, 
               <br />
               do we or do we not want to be ruled by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis</span>

               sion of Government? But participation by the

               people in government should everywhere he as 
               <br />
               great as the general degree of improvement in the 
               <br />
               community will allow; and nothing less can be 
               <br />
               more desirable than the admission of all the

               people to a share in the sovereign power of the
