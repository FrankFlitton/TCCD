               Lastly. gentlemen, I am going to surprise you 
               <br />
               by telling you of two statements Lord Addison 
               <br />
               made with which I agree one hundred per cent. 
               <br />
               At the ﬁnish of our last interview, one statement 
               <br />
               was, “God bless Newfoundland”; and when one 
               <br />
               delegate replied, “God help Newfoundland”, he 
               <br />
               replied, “God helps them that help themselves.” 
               <br />
               Whether or not Lord Addison realised it, he hit 
               <br />
               the nail on the head, because if we are not 
               <br />
               prepared to help ourselves and ﬁght for a better 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, irrespective of class and creed, 
               <br />
               through co—operation together, we have no right 
               <br />
               to expect help from others, and if we do, we 
               <br />
               certainly have no right to expect manna. So I say 
               <br />
               to us all as Newfoundlanders, let’s forget petty 
               <br />
               jealousies, and pull altogether for Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland only. I am conﬁdent that if we 
               <br />
               do, our standard of living will be much higher, 
               <br />
               and many of our problems will disappear like 
               <br />
               chaff before the wind. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Butt ....The report of the delegation is clear 
               <br />
               and unmistakable, printed so that everybody can 
               <br />
               read it for themselves, but there are certain im- 
               <br />
               pressions arising outof the visit to England which 
               <br />
               I would like to pass on. Before doing so, however, 
               <br />
               and I do this rather tentatively, I must say that it 
               <br />
               sounds to me that some of the remarks of 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood came perilously near to non- 
               <br />
               sense. He said, “The British government have 
               <br />
               really done something which ought to stir our 
               <br />
               emotions and bring tears to our eyes when they 
               <br />
               said they would be responsible for our ﬁnances 
               <br />
               if we stay under Commission of Government.” 1 
               <br />
               read that statement of Lord Addison’s, and to my 
               <br />
               mind it has absolutely no meaning unless we are 
               <br />
               going to wait until Britain can say, “We have the 
               <br />
               dollars to help you”, or until all the surplus dollars 
               <br />
               we have are gone, because the position is that the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom has told us that she has not got 
               <br />
               the dollars to help us, but she said, “You are a 
               <br />
               prosperous country —— you have the dollars”. I 
               <br />
               cannot understand how anyone can think in terms 
               <br />
               of the form of government we are going to have 
               <br />
               in ten or 15 years from now in the changing world 
               <br />

               of the present. I contend that that statement of 
               <br />
               Lord Addison has no meaning unless you think 
               <br />
               in terms of ﬁve or ten years time.

               Another thing, I am not a ﬁnancier, but some— 
               <br />
               thing else which sounds like nonsense to me is 
               <br />
               this, “The principle of a guarantee of a 
               <br />
               govemment’s loan cannot hold true when we 
               <br />
               have responsible government." In 1933 or 1934 
               <br />
               when we gave up (shall I say?) our responsible 
               <br />
               government, the United Kingdom government 
               <br />
               guaranteed our loan. What was done in effect was 
               <br />
               this: an act was passed which said that the 
               <br />
               Government of Newfoundland should issue ster- 
               <br />
               ling bonds, on the back of which the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom put her guarantee. It appears to me that 
               <br />
               no matter what form of government we have in 
               <br />
               the future that guarantee stands. I can’t see how 
               <br />
               they can get out of it if we hold them to it.... I said 
               <br />
               before, other documents speak for themselves, 
               <br />
               but there are one or two observations which I 
               <br />
               would like to make on the treatment accorded to 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland delegation by the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As an example, I am going to take the method 
               <br />
               of procedure which I consider to be pretty poor. 
               <br />
               First we had a meeting which was nothing more 
               <br />
               than “How do you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do",</span> At the second meeting it 
               <br />
               was clear that it was only going to be a general 
               <br />
               discussion of the problems, and we got a 
               <br />
               transcript of this document which we could study 
               <br />
               afterwards until the next meeting. What actually 
               <br />
               happened was that we were presented with this 
               <br />
               document on behalf of the British government 
               <br />
               and Lord Addison said, “You may consider this 
               <br />
               as my mature consideration, and not much 
               <br />
               change will be made in it anyway.” As a result of 
               <br />
               that the Newfoundland delegation were deter- 
               <br />
               mined they were going to have something to say, 
               <br />
               and so we put in this memorandum... We were 
               <br />
               told then in no uncertain terms, “You have no 
               <br />
               business to be talking about these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things”....</span> 
               <br />

               Now let us turn to the document. First of all 
               <br />
               there was the sterling debt. I had in my mind the 
               <br />
               position of the British government and people 
               <br />
               when we approached them on the sterling debt, 
               <br />
               but I also had in mind Newfoundlanders who, for 
               <br />
               the last 200 years, have suffered plenty and more 
               <br />
               than that because of debt, which we contracted I 
               <br />
               grant you. At one stage of the game we were 
               <br />
               paying half our revenues and a little more in 
               <br />
