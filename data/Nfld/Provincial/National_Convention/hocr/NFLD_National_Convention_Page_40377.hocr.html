               Kingdom. But I would point out, ﬁrst, our politi- 
               <br />
               cal afﬁliations with England demand that this

               <br />
               for the past 13 years; secondly, the Governor in 
               <br />
               Commission made no stipulation as to the subject

               Mr. Harrington <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, on the night of

               Wednesday, October 20, 1943, at aJubilee dinner 
               <br />
               in the Newfoundland Hotel, I proposed a toast to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. In my toast, besides many other 
               <br />
               things, I said: “In spite of even the latest sample 
               <br />
               of mismanagement, every bit as deliberate as the 
               <br />
               former anti-settlement laws in its eventual pur-

               <br />
               today, through a combination of world events is 
               <br />
               standing on the threshold of our inevitable des-

               tiny, the geographical centre of the empire of the 
               <br />
               air." The “latest sample of mismanagement” 
               <br />
               referred to, was as everyone knew, the regime 
               <br />
               known as Commission of Government. It was 
               <br />
               with a sense of vindication that I heard members 
               <br />
               of this Convention during the debate last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Decem»</span>

               <br />

               connection with the sections of the report dealing 
               <br />
               with Gander and tourism, and I made particular 
               <br />
               note of Mr. Higgins’ expressing himself in words 
               <br />
               to this effect: “It seems as if the Commission of

               efforts; that a dictatorship, however benevolent, 
               <br />
               was a monument of shame to people who had 
               <br />
               governed themselves, wisely or unwisely, well or

               <br />
               that in my opinion there was only one course 
               <br />
               open to us, namely, that we should seek to return 
               <br />
               immediately to full responsible government. 
               <br />

               Early in the spring of 1946 I was asked to take 
               <br />

               <br />
               choice I took the negative side. The debate, which 
               <br />
               took place in a well-known literary association 
               <br />
