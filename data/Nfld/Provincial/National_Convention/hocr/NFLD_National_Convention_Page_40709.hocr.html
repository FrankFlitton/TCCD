               They go on then to mining and refer to 
               <br />
               Wabana, with a payroll of $4 million or there- 
               <br />
               abouts. They also refer to the contract of ore for 
               <br />
               Great Britain of about 750,000 tons. We never 
               <br />
               did ship very much ore to Britain prior to the war, 
               <br />
               and we took that up over in London with the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce, and they assured us that they 
               <br />
               would do everything in their power to see that this 
               <br />
               would be continued in the future. Then we have 
               <br />
               Buchans. The lead and zinc and copper which 
               <br />
               they produce always ﬁnds a ready market, and 
               <br />
               they have a payroll of $1 million. La Manche, 
               <br />
               they tell us, is about to be opened up, at least they 
               <br />
               hope to open it up and ﬁnd some lead there. Then 
               <br />
               they refer us to the story we have heard about the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Labrador. All of us now have 
               <br />
               heard of the Labrador Mining and Exploration 
               <br />
               Co. The thing is so vast, and so huge, that one’s 
               <br />
               mind fails to grasp it. It is anticipated by this 
               <br />
               company that they hope to ﬁnd enough ore in a 
               <br />
               year or so to warrant them spending $150 million 
               <br />
               to open up the iron ore deposits down there. That 
               <br />
               again would not come within the three year 
               <br />
               period for which the Finance Committee has 
               <br />
               made a forecast.

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, this new develop- 
               <br />
               ment on Bell Island, whereby they are shipping 
               <br />
               ore to Great Britain, is really a peace-time in- 
               <br />
               dustry, something that has grown out of peace, 
               <br />
               not out of war. There again you will see that the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee was justiﬁed in being op- 
               <br />
               timistic with regard to mining conditions. The 
               <br />
               same applied, of course, to the pulp and paper 
               <br />
               industry. They are continuing. The war has been 
               <br />
               over for two years and still they have all they can 
               <br />
               produce sold for the next ten years; so we see that 
               <br />
               when the Finance Committee took a glimpse at 
               <br />
               that industry they were justiﬁed in being optimis-

               tion. The contracts that are made with the paper 
               <br />

               years, or is it not a question of price? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I don’t know. In fairness to Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollettl understand he is simply commenting on 
               <br />
               the contents of the Economic Report. He was not 
               <br />
               a member of the Economic Committee, and he 
               <br />
               takes it just as is. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I could answer that, but I think Mr. 
               <br />
               Butt could look that up himself and ﬁnd out. I fail 
               <br />
               to see how any company or individual would 
               <br />
               make a contract for ten years at any ﬁxed price, 
               <br />
               but having due regard to conditions in the United 
               <br />
               States, and the lack of paper in the United States 
               <br />
               and Mexico and these places, I do think that the 
               <br />
               price of newsprint in the future will not go below 
               <br />
               $90 a ton, but will probably reach the amount of 
               <br />
               $100 a ton... Then they took up the matter of 
               <br />
               agriculture and referred to the new agricultural 
               <br />
               development on the west coast, and arrived at the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the value of agriculture was in the 
               <br />
               vicinity of $15 million. That in itself is quite an 
               <br />
               item, which the Finance Committee were right 
               <br />
               and proper in looking at with an optimistic View. 
               <br />
               And then they came to our basic industry ~— 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries. They gave an exhaustive survey of 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries... They pointed out that in the new 
               <br />
               methods of curing, freezing, putting up the ﬁsh 
               <br />
               in ﬁllets and shipping it away, the enterprising 
               <br />
               ﬁrms here in St. John's and elsewhere have in- 
               <br />
               vested the amount of $6 million. Now I put it to 
               <br />
               you that these enterprising men are not going to 
               <br />
               invest $6 million unless they themselves have an 
               <br />
               optimistic View of the future, not only for three 
               <br />
               years but for a much longer period. I think the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee were right and proper in the 
               <br />
               conclusions they came to with regard to that. 
               <br />
               Take herring. i remember the days when herring 
               <br />
               was caught in a seine and brought in and dumped 
               <br />
               on an American vessel’s deck and frozen, and it 
               <br />
               was only in the winter when you could sell them 
               <br />
               anywhere, and they were taken out of the country 
               <br />
               right away and shipped to foreign markets. Now 
               <br />
               they have created all sorts of industries. Not only 
               <br />
               do we Scotch-pack them, not only do we ﬁllet 
               <br />
               herring and make herring oil, but we do almost 
               <br />
               everything with herring, and there again 
               <br />
               enterprising businessmen have put their money 
               <br />
               and brains into the development of the herring 
               <br />
               ﬁshery along lines whereby it will not only assure 
               <br />
               a living to the people who catch herring and cure 
               <br />
               them, but also it will offer them something in 
               <br />
               return. Lobster. Ijust have to look down at my
