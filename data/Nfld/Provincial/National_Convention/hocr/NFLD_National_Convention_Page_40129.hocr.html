               of the day, I should like to clarify a situation to

               revenue of recent years have been due to 
               <br />
               wartime conditions, to examine the position 
               <br />

               He says the terms of reference do not permit of a

               consider a delegation to Ottawa or anywhere else

               Mr. Chairman I do not think, Major Cashin, 
               <br />
               that His Excellency had in mind when he used 
               <br />
               that expression, the competency or otherwise of

               <br />

               <br />
               you have quoted is germane to the ruling which 
               <br />
               I gave yesterday. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin The point I am making, His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency says, “the terms of reference do not permit 
               <br />
               a roving commission.” 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman You want an interpretation of 
               <br />
               “roving commission”? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yes.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I do not think you want to con- 
               <br />
               strue that expression too literally. It means what 
               <br />
               it says. I would say what His Excellency perhaps 
               <br />
               had in mind was that we were conﬁned within 
               <br />
               certain deﬁnite limits by virtue of the terms of 
               <br />
               reference. We have to regard those terms of ref— 
               <br />
               erence in ascertaining what our powers are... I 
               <br />
               conﬁrm my ruling of yesterday, that I think it is 
               <br />
               perfectly competent for this Convention, if it so 
               <br />
               desires, to send a delegation to Ottawa, if the 
               <br />
               Canadian government is prepared to receive such 
               <br />
               a delegation, to ascertain the terms and the basis 
               <br />
               of which the Canadian government would be 
               <br />
               prepared to consider federal union with Canada; 
               <br />
               in the same way, it is perfectly competent for this 
               <br />
               Convention to ascertain any other fact. It really 
               <br />
               amounts to the eliciting of information, and one 
               <br />
               of the primary duties as well as the patent 
               <br />
               authority and right of this Convention is to elicit 
               <br />
               information on basic facts. Is that clear, Major 
               <br />
               Cashin? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Quite clear, but I have not gotten 
               <br />
               the definition of a “roving commission” yet. As
