               past as a people was an experience we would care

               <br />
               have heard since this Convention opened over a 
               <br />
               year ago. He showed beyond all question that 
               <br />
               balanced public accounts —— even surpluses <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—~</span> 
               <br />
               are neither the cause nor the proof of a sound

               economy. They are not necessarily even the 
               <br />
               result of such an economy, for the public ac-

               <br />

               Before I mention any of the figures which this 
               <br />
               report contains, perhaps in the interests of peace 
               <br />
               it may be well for me to reassure any who may 
               <br />
               incorrectly interpret my criticism as charges of 
               <br />
               dishonesty. Let me say at once that l have no 
               <br />
               intention whatever of charging anyone of falsify- 
               <br />
               ing ﬁgures or of a deliberate attempt to deceive. 
               <br />
               For my purposes it is completely unnecessary, 
               <br />
               and I am quite willing to accept the position that 
               <br />
               in their calculations and their predictions they 
               <br />
               believed the former were correct, and the latter 
               <br />
               were rational <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deductions.</span> Moreover, if I am to 
               <br />
               assume that every calculation and every predic- 
               <br />
               tion which this report makes has been placed 
               <br />
               there with dishonest intent, it surely follows that 
               <br />
               1 credit its framers with infallibility; for if all their 
               <br />
               inaccuracies are dishonest and known to them 
               <br />
               when they make them, it necessarily follows that 
               <br />
               they themselves are never in error. That is a 
               <br />
               supernatural faculty with which I must decline to 
               <br />
               credit them, or even this whole Convention when 
               <br />
               speaking as a whole, if we can ever reach that 
               <br />
               apparently far-distant goal where this body will 
               <br />
               speak as a unit. I prefer to assume that in their 
               <br />
               figures and mathematical calculations they may 
               <br />
               be in honest error, like ordinary mortals, and that 
               <br />
               in their predictions they have allowed their op- 
               <br />
               timism and enthusiasm to outstrip their philo- 
               <br />
               sophy.
