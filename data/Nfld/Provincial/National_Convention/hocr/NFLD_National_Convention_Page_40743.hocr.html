               point that I had in mind was that there may be 
               <br />
               some little discussion as to what particular time 
               <br />
               it should come before the House. I am not speak- 
               <br />
               ing for myself. This matter, which is a very 
               <br />
               important one,... but in my mind there is a ques- 
               <br />
               tion as to whether or not the discussion on that 
               <br />
               document should come immediately after the 
               <br />
               discussion on the Economic Report, or whether 
               <br />
               it should come up when we go into the matter of

               <br />
               thought that I had in mind. There is absolutely no

               question whatever of any ulterior motive what-

               Mr. Chairman Thank you very much, but what 
               <br />
               the House does on any of these motions is some— 
               <br />
               thing, of course, I have yet to ascertain; but in 
               <br />
               fairness to Mr. Bradley I have to point out that if 
               <br />
               the suggestion made by Mr. Higgins were taken 
               <br />
               it obviously follows that his motion loses the 
               <br />
               priority it now has. It was designed by him to 
               <br />
               follow on the conclusion and termination of the 
               <br />
               debate on the Economic Report. Now what you 
               <br />
               do about it of course when it comes before you is 
               <br />
               something I make no comment on. I am in the 
               <br />
               position now where I cannot, at this time, permit 
               <br />
               the motion which is presently on the order paper 
               <br />
               to be side-tracked by some other business which 
               <br />
               is not yet before the House. It is open to the 
               <br />
               interpretation, Mr. Higgins, although I am quite 
               <br />
               sure that that’s the last thing you had in mind. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I can give you my assurance thatl 
               <br />
               will not insist on precedence over Mr. Bradley’s 
               <br />
               motion. He deﬁnitely can have precedence as far 
               <br />
               as I am concerned in debating the motion.

               Mr. Bradley I don’t know whether there is a 
               <br />
               suspicion in the minds of any of those gentlemen 
               <br />
               who object to it in its present form that it is my 
               <br />
               intention to attempt to slide the discussion of this 
               <br />
               communication from the Canadian government 
               <br />
               in the middle, as it were, of the discussion upon 
               <br />
               the Economic Report. I have been accused of 
               <br />
               dishonesty in this House before, and I am 
               <br />
               prepared to contemplate the possibility of a 
               <br />
               similar charge again. I gave a distinct under- 
               <br />
               standing this afternoon that I had no intention 
               <br />
               whatever of trying to supersede the discussion fo 
               <br />
               the Economic Report. My resolution was to 
               <br />
               receive this communication and to move the 
               <br />
               House into a committee of the whole on tomor- 
               <br />
               row. If that motion had carried, and maybe it will, 
               <br />
               I don’t know, the position would be that we 
               <br />
               would have received the communication, and 
               <br />
               there would appear on tomorrow’s order paper an 
               <br />
               order to the effect that I would move the House 
               <br />
               into a committee of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole...</span> If that motion is 
               <br />
               not carried in its present form, then I have to give 
               <br />
               notice of another motion, which clearly will bring 
               <br />
               my motion behind the motion of Mr. Higgins in 
               <br />
