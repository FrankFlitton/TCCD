               geographical position in the last war, we will

               <br />
               next, and we will pay both in manpower and cash. 
               <br />
               All this we are only too conscious of, and it would 
               <br />
               be folly on our part to ignore these unpleasant 
               <br />
               facts. I presume this Convention will, in due 
               <br />
               course, bring in an Economic Report based on the 
               <br />
               substance of the findings of the various commit- 
               <br />
               tees... Regardless of how critical we may be over 
               <br />
               the construction or interpretation of certain ac- 
               <br />
               tions by the powers ruling us, we do agree on the 
               <br />
               main basic principles. As far as the cost of 
               <br />
               government goes, this has increased in every 
               <br />
               country out of all proportion to what the people 
               <br />
               should be called upon to pay. Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               not the exception and the public are only too 
               <br />
               conscious of this unpleasant fact; but it is the duty 
               <br />
               of the next government to cut not only the number 
               <br />
               but the cost to a minimum, more in harmony with 
               <br />
               the requirements and earnings of our people. We 
               <br />
               have studied the ﬁgures for over a year, and 
               <br />
               believe it or not our people are interested in 
               <br />
               hearing our conclusions and have expected this 
               <br />
               whole business to wind up long ago. Nine out of 
               <br />
               every ten of our listening public are well in- 
               <br />
               formed on the cost of all governments and none 
               <br />
               of the whole 100% would do much better if they 
               <br />
               were there. Newfoundlanders generally are 
               <br />
               wondering, “Where do we go from here?” If I

               Mr. Chairman We are not discussing forms of

               <br />

               <br />
               of the island as and from 1934. Then after that 
               <br />
               you will go on to consider the question of future

               a paragraph. I have heard other members discuss

               Mr. Chairman, if our cash balances were ap~ 
               <br />
               plied to our liabilities, our per capita debt would 
               <br />
               be in the vicinity of something like $115 per head 
               <br />
               — a very healthy position indeed. Two of our 
               <br />
               staple industries, paper and mining, never were 
               <br />
               in a healthier condition. Our ﬁshing industry has 
               <br />
               received an unexpected setback, as it was 
               <br />
               generally felt the past spring that prices would be 
               <br />
               as good as last year, but in reality, apart from the 
               <br />
               matter of exchange, the average price received by 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen is really about $2 less, $1 directly 
               <br />
               on the price and at least $1 on the cull. I fear the 
               <br />
               price of ﬁsh will gradually come down; but 1 am 
               <br />
               optimistic enough to believe that great strides 
               <br />
               will be made in the matter of modern curing, 
               <br />
               handling and marketing, and the millions from 
               <br />
               the fish-eating countries who have migrated to 
               <br />
               the central and western states will be reached 
               <br />
               with our ﬁsh products packed and cured under the 
               <br />
               most modern and sanitary conditions. The Mar- 
               <br />
               shall Plan will, if accepted, leave many millions 
               <br />
               of American dollars in Newfoundland for herring 
               <br />
               and other sea products to be shipped to Europe in 
               <br />
               a similar manner to the UN RRA pack, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">replac.</span> 
               <br />
               ing it in perhaps a bigger way. Our lumber <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               dustry has taken a temporary slump, but we have 
               <br />
               no surplus of lumber to cause any real anxiety in 
               <br />
               this respect. New industries are cropping up in 
               <br />
               many of the larger outports as well as St. John’s. 
               <br />
               absorbing many of the men who have been left 
               <br />
               idle through most of the base works being 
               <br />
               ﬁnished.

               The general overall picture is as bright for us

               as for any other country we know. Yet I would 
               <br />
               not say that Newfoundland will always run as a

               neighbours on the continent — but looking back
