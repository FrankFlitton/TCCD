               It is my opinion— <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,Sma11wood</span> has his— that 
               <br />
               this should not go into current revenue, but into

               In reference to roads, I know that the $1 mil- 
               <br />
               lion allowed in Mr. Smallwood’s budget was for 
               <br />
               maintenance. I have looked at all these ﬁgures. 
               <br />
               That was my contention, that there was only $1 
               <br />
               million for roads, and that has to be for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">main»</span>

               <br />
               provincial set-up for roads, but what I was saying 
               <br />
               was that there was nothing for new roads that will 
               <br />

               Now, sir, on that reconstruction, Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood gives me credit for now believing in Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Govemmentpolicy. If Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               has followed me closely, I brought out the fact 
               <br />
               that that deﬁcit of approximately $5.8 million 
               <br />
               would be brought about by reconstruction at the 
               <br />
               rate of $2.5 million, and the educational cut, and 
               <br />
               the public health cut, if we maintain the present 
               <br />
               standards that we are doing today in reconstruc- 
               <br />
               tion; and I presume it would be the purpose of 
               <br />
               any government in the next few years to carry on 
               <br />
               as we have been doing to ﬁnish the buildings we 
               <br />
               have started, and complete these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">services.</span> That 
               <br />
               was my point, if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continue,</span> But if you want to 
               <br />
               wipe out the $2.5 million, and take the estimate I 
               <br />
               originally made of $2 million for public health, 
               <br />
               and $1 million for education, it still brings it up 
               <br />
               to $18 million, and that’s without any reconstruc- 
               <br />
               tion deﬁcit. You have the same thing, and that 
               <br />
               will bring it up to a $4 million deﬁcit. You have 
               <br />
               got to add that to the $1 million already provided 
               <br />
               for in Mr. Smallwood’s estimate. That brings it 
               <br />
               to $5 million that you have got to get from the 
               <br />
               people in some form in addition to the taxation 
               <br />
               they have to pay to the federal government. 1 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt All the headings with the exception of 
               <br />
               5-4, in my opinion are all maintenance, in spite 
               <br />
               of the fact that improvements and reconstruction 
               <br />
               of roads and bridges were under that heading. 1 
               <br />
               will explain the difference. The maintenance of 
               <br />
               roads, that is the ﬁrst item of $1 million, will be 
               <br />
               the pay for any maintenance men who are ﬁlling, 
               <br />
               cutting, spreading gravel, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc;</span> under 5-3, the 
               <br />
               improvement and reconstruction of roads and 
               <br />
               bridges, there is a slight separation. It could very 
               <br />
               easily go into maintenance of roads and bridges, 
               <br />
               because that would include such things as the 
               <br />
               replacement of ordinary bridges by, say, concrete 
               <br />
               bridges, and the replacement ofordinary wooden 
               <br />
               bridges by new wooden <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bridges,</span> it would also 
               <br />
               take in side cuts where you have sharp curves. 
               <br />
               You would take these off and you would also fill 
               <br />
               in, for instance, where you have very soft ground, 
               <br />
               so that if we are going to improve our roads at all 
               <br />
               — and there is an important point to remember. 
               <br />
               by improving and not putting it under ordinary 
               <br />
               maintenance, you are thereby saving a lot of 
               <br />
               money in the future by upkeep of roads. On this 
               <br />
               sub-heading alone, apart from the $1 million and 
               <br />
               a very small section which would be used in the 
               <br />
               construction of new roads, roughly $2 million is 
               <br />

               <br />
               tenance, and I think $1,270,000 is quite wrong. 1 
               <br />
               would go a little further. and if my memory serves 
               <br />
               me wrong I would like to be corrected, but I 
               <br />
