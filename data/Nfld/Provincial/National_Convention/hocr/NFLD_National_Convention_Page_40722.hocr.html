               What of the future? The best forecast that can 
               <br />
               be made is only an opinion. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               accept the opinion of the Committee as to the 
               <br />
               future. They have given us what was described, i 
               <br />
               believe in one of our documents at Ottawa, as an 
               <br />
               educated “guesstimate”, and I believe today in 
               <br />
               the letter we have had from the Hon. Mr. King he 
               <br />
               describes it as an “informed guess." Whether it is 
               <br />
               an “educated guesstimate" or an “informed 
               <br />
               guess”, it is as good as any statistician-economist 
               <br />
               can do for us at the present time. However, to go 
               <br />
               back to this “guesstimate”. Let us look at what 
               <br />
               the businessmen think of the future, because 
               <br />
               that’s the only way we in this country can gauge 
               <br />
               what the future is likely to be. If the businessmen 
               <br />
               of the country are willing to put money into their 
               <br />
               businesses, backing the future of the country, 
               <br />
               then we can be fairly safe in saying, “These men 
               <br />
               do not take chances with their money unless they 
               <br />
               have a fairly good idea of what they are doing.”

               <br />
               a philanthropist in a big way. You are building 
               <br />

               being built by Connors Brothers at Petries, as

               businessman Mr. Crosbie blowing his money 
               <br />

               ﬁshery corporations that are being incorporated

               a fairly correct assumption. The present market

               assuming continuous large scale production by 
               <br />

               say with respect to the ore deposits of Labrador

               is that they may very well profoundly alter the

               whole economic position, as the Bell Island and 
               <br />

               has been most conservative in estimating die

               cording to the Amulree Report in 1934 the gross

               public debt was $101 million, and the gross

               public debt at March 31, 1947, was roughly
