               <br />
               but a lot of it now has no timber on it at all. We 
               <br />
               mentioned here that they have had advances from 
               <br />
               the government in 1934 of $200,000. The 
               <br />
               government has a ﬁrst mortgage on that property 
               <br />
               and it has been reduced to about $140,000. This 
               <br />
               year they are shipping around 7,000 cords of 
               <br />
               wood. At the same time there is a foreign export 
               <br />
               on the property from the other side, and it is 
               <br />
               impossible to secure the necessary capital to do 
               <br />
               much manufacturing. There are possibilities of 
               <br />
               other parties trying to obtain leases, in fact in the 
               <br />
               hands of the government today are requests for 
               <br />
               leases, but they would not give us the necessary 
               <br />
               information. There is one for a pulp mill on the 
               <br />
               southwest coast, to be fed by timber from 
               <br />
               Labrador. Some people may ask why they can’t 
               <br />
               put the mill in Labrador. That place, particularly 
               <br />
               Hamilton Inlet, is closed to navigation about 
               <br />
               seven months of the year, and it would mean a 
               <br />
               great deal of capital expenditure to provide 
               <br />
               storage facilities for that length of time. I would 
               <br />
               be glad to give any information I can about it.

               Mr. Smallwood It is only now I am beginning 
               <br />
               to realise how important this report is, or, if Major 
               <br />
               Cashin won’t mind my saying so, how important 
               <br />
               it is not, but ought to be. Long before we come to 
               <br />
               discuss forms of government we have to make 
               <br />
               some appraisal, some estimate of What we have 
               <br />
               got in the country, including timber. This report 
               <br />
               is supposed to tell us clearly what are the resour- 
               <br />
               ces of Newfoundland and Labrador so far as 
               <br />
               timber is concerned; how much of mose resour-

               <br />

               <br />
               much are in the hands of private owners, how 
               <br />
               much still in the hands of the Crown. We are 
               <br />
               supposed also to know, and so far as timber in 
               <br />
               Labradoris concerned this is more important than 
               <br />
               what is now being done, what is likely to be done 
               <br />
               in the future. Labrador -— 110,000 square miles;

               Someone said here last night something about

               optimism about Labrador, and my reply was that 
               <br />
               it was not a case of being optimistic or pessimis-

               Labrador is concerned this report is practically

               <br />

               at least we should have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">truth.</span> Take this map.

               We should all have a copy of that. It should be

               published in the papers and the public of New-

               a map showing water power alienated we ought 
               <br />
