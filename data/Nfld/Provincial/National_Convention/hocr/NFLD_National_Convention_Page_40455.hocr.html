               There is another market in the Argentine

               which we could get into, they have cold storage

               facilities there already. We can take from them 
               <br />
               wheat, corn and cheaper grains, also linseed and 
               <br />

               <br />
               $20 million and we have that money. Surely if 
               <br />
               the Iceland government is going to spend $40 
               <br />
               million on the reorganisation of their ﬁshery, and 
               <br />
               they have only a population of 130,000, we can 
               <br />
               invest less than $20 million with our population 
               <br />
               of nearly three times that number. There is not a 
               <br />
               tree on leeland, whilst we are assured of at least 
               <br />
               $16 million in wages from our forests, and the

               mill which last year used 120,000 pounds of

               Australian wool, and that was getting it the dear

               imported direct the mill would probably be able 
               <br />

               If I may quote the Cabot and Lodge couplet, “Too

               <br />

               <br />
               Bowrings spoke to God.” I am not speaking 
               <br />
               disparagingly or irreverently of these gentlemen, 
               <br />
               but that is the pedestal our folks have put them 
               <br />
               on, and then blamed them when things went 
               <br />
               wrong. Now we want leadership from all classes.

               ﬁsh is going to have a hard time. A wholesaler

               asked me in Grimsby, “God, man. how do you

               are mostly caught within ten miles of the freezing 
               <br />

               <br />
               before it is frozen." Nothing in the world can take 
               <br />
               place of Newfoundland shore dried ﬁsh, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">espe»</span> 
               <br />
               cially after three weeks of the caplin. When we

               get central curing stations with artiﬁcial drying, 
               <br />
               then we will hold our own with the world. Throw 
               <br />
               a Newfoundland ﬁsh down anywhere, after you 
               <br />
               have cleaned the blood, guts, and blubber off the 
               <br />
               napes, washed it with running water, dried it hard 
               <br />
               and made it white, and it will sell itself. if the 
               <br />
               regulations apply to the merchant they must 
               <br />
               apply to the fishermen as well. We have had 40 
               <br />
               years of propaganda trying to get fishermen to 
               <br />
               take the entrails off fish, and still this is not done, 
               <br />
               even though they know this is one of the reasons 
               <br />
               why our ﬁsh won’t sell. Let the government put 
               <br />
               out an order that next fall ﬁsh with blood and guts 
               <br />
               and liver on it will not be permitted to be pur~ 
               <br />
               chased by the merchant, and that ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               producing that kind of ﬁsh must take it home 
               <br />
               again, and I’ll venture to bet that you will get 
               <br />
               clean ﬁsh. Then we are suffering too much today 
               <br />
               from the saying, “It’s good enough for the 
               <br />
               blacks." Fish from all other fish producing 
               <br />
               countries is white, why not Newfoundland fish?

               The custom ofgrinding ﬁsh into packages by the
