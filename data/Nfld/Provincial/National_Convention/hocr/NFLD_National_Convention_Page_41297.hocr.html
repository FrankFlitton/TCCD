               royal commission presided over by Lord Amul-

               time that in the last election for responsible

               <br />
               dice won by a sweeping majority, and only two 
               <br />
               of the opposing party were elected, the present 
               <br />
               member from Green Bay1 and the member from 
               <br />
               Bonavista, Mr. Bradley, and voicing all your sen- 
               <br />
               timents, I say we are all glad to have Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               back with us today. There was also elected for the 
               <br />
               Alderdice party at that time Mr. KM. Brown, 
               <br />
               another member of this Convention, although not 
               <br />
               with us just now unfortunately; and also at that

               election we have another member of this Con-

               vention contesting a seat, in the person of the 
               <br />
               representative from Bonavista Centre, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood. His opponent at that time was Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quinton,</span> I feel fairly safe in saying that had Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood been elected at that time it is possible 
               <br />
               that we would never have lost responsible 
               <br />
               government, because we all know, particularly in 
               <br />
               this House, what an ardent exponent of respon— 
               <br />
               sible government Mr. Smallwood was all 
               <br />
               through the years of Commission government, 
               <br />
               and up until a short time before this Convention 
               <br />
               opened. In newspaper articles, which I would 
               <br />
               read to you if permitted, Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               demonstrated himself as the most eager advocate 
               <br />
               of responsible government. In his “Barrelman” 
               <br />
               programmes he spent many years helping along 
               <br />
               the cause and, in fact, it was not until he came in 
               <br />
               close contact with residents of Canada at Gander 
               <br />
               that his ardour cooled, until now he is the most 
               <br />
               destructive opponent of responsible government 
               <br />
               as we knew it in 1934. Who among us here will 
               <br />
               forget his damning speech at the introduction of 
               <br />
               his confederation resolution on October 28, 
               <br />
               1946‘! Let me quote from that speech: 
               <br />
               Compared with the mainland of North 
               <br />
               America we are 50 years, in some things 100 
               <br />
               years, behind the times. We live more poorly, 
               <br />
               more shabbily, more meanly. Our life is more 
               <br />
               of a slruggle. Our struggle is tougher, more 
               <br />
               naked, more hopeless. In the North American 
               <br />
               family Newfoundland bears the reputation of 
               <br />
               having the lowest standard of life, of being 
               <br />
               the least progressive and advanced of the 
               <br />
               whole family. A metamorphosis steals over 
               <br />

               Convention. The commission under Lord Amul- 
               <br />
               ree was constituted by a royal warrant dated 
               <br />
               February 17, 1933. It consisted of William War- 
               <br />
               render MacKenzie, Baron Amulree, Charles 
               <br />

               Stavert with Peter Alexander Clutterbuck as

               <br />
               St. John’s on March 13, and began its sessions on 
               <br />
               March 20, 1933. During its collection of 
               <br />
               evidence, it also visited Canada, arriving there on 
               <br />
               April 29, and leaving on May 27, 1933. During 
               <br />
               that time the commission had interviews with the 
               <br />
               Canadian government and took evidence of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wit-</span> 
               <br />
               nesses. They adjourned their sittings in July and 
               <br />
               began to compile a report which was presented 
               <br />
               on September 14, 1933.2 This report, which was 
               <br />
               the basis for the formation of our present Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government, was contained in a 
               <br />
               volume of 283 pages, complete with maps and 
               <br />
               other exhibits.

               As you are aware, the reason for this commis- 
               <br />
               sion was the inability of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government at that time to pay the interest on the 
               <br />
               bonds. A number of people in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               thought and still think that there would have been 
               <br />
               nothing wrong in Newfoundland defaulting on its 
               <br />
               bond interest at that time, and as events proved 
               <br />
               later, some of the major countries of the world 
               <br />
               did so. However, little Newfoundland could not 
               <br />
               do so because it would be a disgrace to the 
               <br />
               Empire. I would quote to you paragraph 513 of 
               <br />
