               report which deals with the Spending of many 
               <br />
               millions of dollars. The Committee felt it wanted 
               <br />
               this information to help the Convention deter-

               mine the status of the country economically and 
               <br />
               ﬁnancially. So far the report has not been debated 
               <br />
               from that standpoint. We have not said one word

               <br />
               the report very interesting and instructive, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly to those of us who can hardly remember 
               <br />
               when we saw a road last. The question of com- 
               <br />
               munication is an important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one.</span> It is a ﬁne thing 
               <br />
               to open up this country by a transinsular road; but 
               <br />
               we should also give thought to opening up the 
               <br />
               country inside Newfoundland as well. There are 
               <br />
               vast stretches being impaired economically due 
               <br />
               to the lack of communications. There are parts of 
               <br />
               this country where ﬁshermen are impaired in 
               <br />
               getting bait because on a day that is too stormy to 
               <br />
               go in a boat, there is no other way to get it. Large 
               <br />
               sections have practically no roads. The section I 
               <br />
               know best has nothing but barely community 
               <br />
               roads, you have to stretch the imagination to call 
               <br />
               some of them roads. There are no inter-com- 
               <br />
               munity connections... I would like for us to give 
               <br />
               some thought to that. Another thing is the miles 
               <br />
               of road privately owned, but yet used by the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public.</span> For instance the Bowater company has 
               <br />
               built a considerable number of miles of road and 
               <br />
               done a great deal to open up the remoter parts of 
               <br />
               the country. They deserve a great deal of credit 
               <br />
               for it. Our road policy should dovetail into the 
               <br />
               policy of these companies in such a way that one 
               <br />
               might augment the other. It does not come within 
               <br />
               the scope of this Convention to discuss these 
               <br />
               things. But the economic policy of the future of 
               <br />
               roads whether public or private is a very impor- 
               <br />
               tant consideration.

               Mr. Hollett On page 21 — “It will thus be seen 
               <br />
               that there are 1,063.3 miles of motorable road on 
               <br />
               the Avalon Peninsula, and 978.8 miles in the 
               <br />
               remainder of the Island.” I can understand why 
               <br />
               my friends across the way should hang their 
               <br />
               heads. When I think of the millions of dollars 
               <br />
               spent on the Avalon Peninsula, I should have 
               <br />
               expected the Commission of Government, since 
               <br />
               they started road building, would have built more

               outside. I come from the beating heart of the 
               <br />
               country. We have very few roads — 42 miles to 
               <br />
               Botwood; four miles of paved road to the golf 
               <br />
               course, a few other miles to Badger; that is all 
               <br />
               apart from the track leading to Halls Bay. 1 am 
               <br />
               thinking of that part of the country. The govem- 
               <br />
               ment did think of it. They actually started out to 
               <br />
               build a road, four miles to the golf course — they 
               <br />
               left off there. The next year they decided to pave 
               <br />
               the road from Grand Falls to Botwood. They 
               <br />
               spent one whole year renovating and recondition— 
               <br />
               ing, spent thousands of dollars making it ready to 
               <br />
               pave next year. The next year they forgot about 
               <br />
               it. If they did start now, they would have to spend 
               <br />
               hundreds of thousands of dollars to recondition it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again.</span> That is the kind of treatment we got. Not 
               <br />
               that by talking about it I expect it is going to mean 
               <br />
               anything. I think if the $20,000 spent on roads 
               <br />
               were spent on the welfare of the country general— 
               <br />
               ly, it would have been better. Speaking of roads 
               <br />
               (and I am going to be called a heretic for saying 
               <br />
               this) I am wondering if we are not barking up the 
               <br />
               wrong tree when we prate about roads. For the 
               <br />
               last 40 years we have heard what would happen 
               <br />
               if we had a system of roads throughout. I am 
               <br />
               beginning to doubt it, because if there was any 
               <br />
               truth in it, surely the people by now would have 
               <br />
               had the roads. What do we get if we do get 
               <br />
               transinsular roads? I was wondering if it would 
               <br />
               help any if we put the road there, although it is 
               <br />
               bound to come some day. Who will use it? Where 
               <br />
               will they go? What shall they carry? Would it be 
               <br />
               much cheaper to use the railway? When I think 
               <br />
               of the waste of public money on roads — money 
               <br />
               just dug into the earth! If half the money used on 
               <br />
               roads had been used to help the ﬁshermen catch 
               <br />
               their ﬁsh, then we would have been much better 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off.</span> I do say the report is, factually, an excellent 
               <br />
               one; but as to the future, it is in the air. They plan 
               <br />
               on putting a road to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Port-aux»Basques;</span> all I can 
               <br />
               say is, God help the surplus if they do it by the 
               <br />
               method they are spending now.

               Mr. Higgins We have to admit that there has 
               <br />
               been a lot of money spent around the Avalon 
               <br />
