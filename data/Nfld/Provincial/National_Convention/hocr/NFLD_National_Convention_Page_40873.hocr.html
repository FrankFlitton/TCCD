               Mr. Vardy That is exactly the view I’ve taken 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, and so far as we’ve gone I believe 
               <br />
               that most of the members have agreed fairly well 
               <br />
               in that respect. But I was a bit puzzled at the 
               <br />
               beginning, wondering if we wouldn’t in a very 
               <br />
               short time reach a deadlock. But I feel that I 
               <br />
               would appeal to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood — rather than 
               <br />
               get sore at him —- to try to cut short the various 
               <br />
               explanations. I have no wish in the world to cut 
               <br />
               short this debate. I voted, as you all know, to send 
               <br />
               a delegation to Canada on each occasion the 
               <br />
               resolution came up. Ihave no regrets along these 
               <br />
               lines except that there were certain disappoint- 
               <br />
               ments in the length of time it took. But we’re into 
               <br />
               this thing now and I believe we should let the 
               <br />
               public know the facts to the best of our ability, so 
               <br />
               that eventually they will be able to arrive at the 
               <br />
               proper conclusions and digest the various bits of 
               <br />
               information as we hand it out to them. I feel that 
               <br />
               everyone of us should go all out to make a very 
               <br />
               special effort to wind up the work of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion before the end of the year. I really think we 
               <br />
               have wasted some time. So I think we should be 
               <br />
               very conscious over this fact and when we rise to 
               <br />
               our feet, try to be as constructive as possible and 
               <br />
               let the people know the truth as we see it. In that 
               <br />
               way only will we be able to do justice to the 
               <br />
               districts we represent and the country as a whole. 
               <br />
               Now I believe we’re moving on to old age pen- 
               <br />
               sions.

               <br />
               we do. But while Captain Bailey did raise the

               to that. Where do we find the exemption in these

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Vardy seemed a little 
               <br />
               doubtful about the actual amount of money that 
               <br />
               would be paid out in Newfoundland, to children 
               <br />
               under 16, in family allowances each year. We had 
               <br />
               in 1945, 117,000 children under sixteen. That is 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial from the census of 1945. Because our 
               <br />
               population is increasing at the rate of 1.1% per 
               <br />
               year, that would make today a little over 1 17,000 
               <br />
               children under the age of 16. The average taken 
               <br />
               based on actual experience is $6 a child each 
               <br />
               month. The amount varies according to the 
               <br />
               child’s age. It’s $5 a month up to the age of six; 
               <br />
               $6 over the age of six and under ten; $7 over ten 
               <br />
               and under 13; $8 over 13 and under 16. When I 
               <br />
               say under 16, I mean, up to the last day before the 
               <br />
               sixteenth birthday is counted as 15 years of age. 
               <br />
               Now, there are little reductions. When you pass 
               <br />
               the fourth child in a family, that child gets a dollar 
               <br />
               less per month and the ﬁfth child 1 think the same. 
               <br />
               The sixth child is cut by $2. But the average is 
               <br />
               taken universally in all government records, 
               <br />
               based on their experience, at being $6 a month. 
               <br />
               Well, 1 17,000 children in Newfoundland in 1945 
               <br />
               at $6 is $702,000 a month or $8,424,000 a year. 
               <br />
               And the actual amount will increase accordingly, 
               <br />
               as our population is increasing at the rate of 1.1%. 
               <br />
               So it’s a fair anticipation that in mree or four 
               <br />
               years, instead of l l7,000 children under 16, it’ll 
               <br />
               be well over 120,000; in another three, four or 
               <br />
               ﬁve years it’ll be up around 125,000; and as that 
               <br />
               number grows. so will the amount of money paid 
               <br />
               out. That’sjust in reply to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Vardy. I am not
