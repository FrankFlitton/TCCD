               Dominions Ofﬁce is to implement that resolution 
               <br />
               which we pass in that form, then they must put 
               <br />
               that question to the people of Newfoundland: 
               <br />
               “Which of these two forms do you choose?" 
               <br />
               Now, having voted by a majority to ask the 
               <br />
               British government to ask the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland that question, how can we in common 
               <br />
               sense introduce a third? If we were to adopt 
               <br />
               another resolution to bring in a third form of 
               <br />
               government, then we destroy the original motion 
               <br />
               which has been carried. it is a complete negation 
               <br />
               of the motion which we carried ﬁrst. How can we 
               <br />
               ask them to choose between two and then place 
               <br />
               a third on the ballot paper? It is completely sense- 
               <br />
               less. Not only is that so, but the effect of the 
               <br />
               passage of such a resolution would be in fact to 
               <br />
               conﬁne the decision of this Convention to two 
               <br />
               forms, and we could not add another without ﬁrst 
               <br />
               rescinding the ﬁrst resolution. Here we have a 
               <br />
               resolution adopted by this Convention to place 
               <br />
               two forms of government as alternatives before 
               <br />
               the people of the country. How can you add a 
               <br />
               third, without rescinding a prior resolution? It is 
               <br />
               a complete negation of the prior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution.</span> In

               <br />
               if we adopted it. I made the second point in

               Mr. Croshie [agree with Mr. Bradley, but being 
               <br />
               a layman and not a lawyer, whatI want to know 
               <br />
               is why we discussed this resolution for four or 
               <br />
               ﬁve days, and at this point this question arises? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It was raised this afternoon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley I can give Mr. Crosbie some light 
               <br />
               on that. Possibly I am at fault. As you know, for 
               <br />
               the last two months I have not been in the pink of 
               <br />
               condition. When Mr. Higgins made his first 
               <br />
               resolution, or gave notice of motion before the 
               <br />
               Christmas vacation, Ihad read the resolution and 
               <br />
               was frankly of the opinion that it was entirely 
               <br />
               outside our province and should not be received. 
               <br />
               When I returned, some eight or ten days late, after 
               <br />
               the Christmas vacation, I was informed that Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins had withdrawn his motion and substi- 
               <br />
               tuted another one which was, in effect, to place 
               <br />
               Commission government and responsible 
               <br />
               government upon the ballot. With that resolution, 
               <br />
               in substance, I was in complete accord. I did not 
               <br />
               bother my head any further about it. I did not even 
               <br />
               bother to read the resolution. Yesterday after— 
               <br />
               noon I was sitting here at my desk and the order 
               <br />
               paper was here, and quite by accident I picked it 
               <br />
               up and read it. As soon as Iread it I saw where, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, it was completely outside our 
               <br />
               jurisdiction to receive any such resolution or vote 
               <br />
               on it. I drew it to the attention of this house at the 
               <br />
               earliest possible date.

               Mr. Crosbie I agree with Mr. Bradley’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex«</span> 
               <br />
               planation. From my point of View, we are 45 men 
               <br />
               here, and I do not think any one of us wants to 
               <br />
               railroad anything through. If there is, I do not 
               <br />
               want to be a party to it. I know that one or two 
               <br />
               members are sick, but the members present can 
               <br />
               settle this thing between ourselves. I do not think 
               <br />
               anyone here is trying to block any form of 
               <br />
               government. After all, as I said, we had a political 
               <br />
               econornist— he was over there where Mr. House 
               <br />
               is now sitting —— he stayed here a week or ten days 
               <br />
               and we have not seen him since. I am not a 
               <br />
               lawyer, but to me it is just plain ordinary sense 
               <br />
               for us to settle this discussion. I think we can 
               <br />
               settle the question and go on.
