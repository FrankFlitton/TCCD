               Ever since the Convention opened, I have 
               <br />
               been approached by students and ex-students of

               the Memorial University College asking me to

               <br />
               request until the present time, because I wished 
               <br />
               to survey the position as carefully as possible, and 
               <br />
               to give some consideration to die grounds upon 
               <br />

               I think one can take it for granted that there is 
               <br />
               an increasing demand for university education. 
               <br />
               The number of students at the Memorial Univer- 
               <br />
               sity College this year is 432; of these, 181 are 
               <br />
               teachers in training; the remainder, 251 persons, 
               <br />
               is a body of students who can take the ﬁrst two 
               <br />
               years of their university course there, and will 
               <br />
               then have to proceed elsewhere —— if they can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«—</span> 
               <br />
               to complete it. Many of you have read the 
               <br />
               numerous letters that have appeared in the daily 
               <br />
               papers from students who are bitterly disap- 
               <br />
               pointed that this September they must either ter- 
               <br />
               minate their university studies, or go to a 
               <br />
               Canadian or American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">university.</span> Their appeal 
               <br />
               cannot remain unheeded. But I have come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the need for a university is not 
               <br />
               based upon the claims of these students alone, but 
               <br />
               on a deeper, fundamental need. This country 
               <br />
               needs a university. A university acts as a natural 
               <br />
               co-ordinating centre of education, and at the 
               <br />
               present time the need for this is a basic one. There 
               <br />
               is no body of Newfoundlanders more sincere in 
               <br />
               their work or devoted to their profession, than the 
               <br />
               educationalists and teachers of this country, and 
               <br />
               they themselves are acutely conscious that the 
               <br />
               establishing of a university would polarise our 
               <br />

               seem that there are one or two conditions

               indispensable to its success. In the ﬁrst place 
               <br />
               it must be in personnel and equipment of such 
               <br />
               a standard that it will command the recogni-

               tion of outside universities, and secondly it 
               <br />
               must be a Newfoundland university in the 
               <br />

               of many universities abroad, as to embrace 
               <br />
               within its scope and ambit those institutions 
               <br />

               <br />
               in this way can it become a genuine New-

               foundland institution, which will have the

               co-operation and support of all sections in the

               beneﬁts of such a university be accessible to 
               <br />
               all, the establishment of scholarships would 
               <br />
