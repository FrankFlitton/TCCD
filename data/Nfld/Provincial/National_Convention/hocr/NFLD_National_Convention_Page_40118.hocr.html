               of us then, mistakenly identifying himself as a

               Daniel Webster and an Abe Lincoln rolled into 
               <br />
               one, and falsely assuming an authority that was 
               <br />
               never vested on him, get up and say, “You can’t 
               <br />
               vote for Commission, I positively hate it, and I 
               <br />

               <br />
               for union with Canada.” To me its very obvious 
               <br />
               that a few of us have improperly imagined that 
               <br />
               we are the be—all and the end~all here. I won’t 
               <br />
               repeat that much-quoted text from the terms of 
               <br />
               reference, Mr. Chairman, for your lucid explana- 
               <br />
               tion of said terms at the outset of the Convention 
               <br />
               made it clear beyond a doubt that this assembly 
               <br />
               has no right to restrict the choice of the people of 
               <br />
               this country or limit the issues. For my part, I 
               <br />
               know nothing that might even remotely suggest 
               <br />
               confederation would be an extremely good or 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely bad issue to put on the ballot in the 
               <br />
               forthcoming referendum. I am not going to 
               <br />
               believe, nor will I be convinced that any member 
               <br />
               of this assembly is in the least cognisant with the 
               <br />
               text of the terms that may be offered us, apart 
               <br />
               from the outmoded BNA Act which does give us 
               <br />
               recognition in sections 146-147.

               Some of us may be concerned about narrow 
               <br />
               nationalism, I am not; others may be worrying 
               <br />
               about their place in that administration of tomor—

               am deeply concerned that the boys and girls of

               tomorrow grow up in an environment that is 
               <br />
               much better than that of their forebears. I am 
               <br />
               concerned that the government that will help 
               <br />
               shape our future be a government that will work 
               <br />

               <br />
               who sent us here are looking to this Convention 
               <br />
               for something constructive. They do not expect 
               <br />
               that we will revert to the days of useless 
               <br />
               recriminatlon and name-calling; they expect 
               <br />
               some deﬁnite recommendations. We must justify 
               <br />
               our existence, but we must not seek to unneces- 
               <br />
               sarily lengthen the life of this assembly, or it 
               <br />
               might well be that this costly experiment may 
               <br />
               cause our fellow—countrymen to lose their 
               <br />
               patience. We were given a deﬁnite assignment a

               Mr. Roberts This being my ﬁrst time to address 
               <br />
               this assembly, I hope you will be patient if I do 
               <br />
               not stick strictly to parliamentary procedure. In 
               <br />
               seconding the amendment I did not do so with 
               <br />
               any intimation of not getting Canada’s terms for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I considered the time inoppor- 
               <br />
               tune; when all committee work is ﬁnished and we 
               <br />
               have a picture of the ﬁnancial state of the country, 
               <br />
               then will come the time to approach Canada. I 
               <br />
               was elected by acclamation and did not have to 
               <br />
               canvass my district for any political plank. But, 
               <br />
               contrary to the admissions of some of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers, I did come here with an idea of the form of 
               <br />
               government I would like to see in this country. I 
               <br />
               am not going to disclose it at this time. But I may 
               <br />
               say I am not an advocate for confederation. This 
               <br />
               does not necessarily mean I would not favour 
               <br />
               confederation or any other form of government, 
               <br />
               if it can be shown me that it would be better for 
               <br />
               the country. So in due time I hope the proper 
               <br />
               authorities will ﬁnd out for us what Canada’s 
               <br />
               terms are. After all, as Mr. MacDonald said, we 
               <br />
               have a large number of people in this island who 
               <br />
               are sympathetic to the idea of confederation, why 
               <br />
               not give them a chance to learn more about it? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It was said by a member of this Convention 
               <br />
               that Canada’s terms would be so favourable we 
               <br />
               would become confederates overnight. I am in- 
               <br />
               clined to take this with a grain of salt. When we 
               <br />
               read the history of. this country and see the raw 
               <br />
               deals we have always received, confederation 
               <br />
               may be another one of those deals. If we approach 
               <br />
               Canada as Mr. Smallwood would have us, saying 
               <br />
               we are a poor, ignorant, ill-clad, diseased, starv- 
               <br />

               <br />
               generous terrns?1 would say “No”.

               I resent the expression that we are such a 
               <br />
               people; it’s true we have some cases as he has 
               <br />
               described. I have seen people in such dilapidated 
               <br />
               shacks here in this city, that it’s unbelievable they 
               <br />
               could live there, especially during the winter 
               <br />
               months. I never saw the like in an outport — as 
               <br />
               bad as we are supposed to live. But the same 
               <br />
               exists in the city of Ottawa with all its fabulous 
               <br />
               wealth. A relative of mine, a Newfoundland 
               <br />
               woman who became the matron of a large hospi~
