               of this Convention. And the other day Mr. Har- 
               <br />
               rington gave a similar presentation to you. I am 
               <br />
               quite certain you are all fully aware that there is 
               <br />
               a pledge, spoken on behalf of the British govem- 
               <br />
               ment by the Secretary of State for Dominions 
               <br />
               Affairs at that time, Mr. Emrys-Evans, who in 
               <br />
               words retailed to you by Mr. Hollett (and I have 
               <br />
               not the form in front of me) to the best of my 
               <br />
               knowledge said, “The whole policy of the British 
               <br />
               government is centered around that pledge." And 
               <br />
               in my opinion “the machinery” mentioned by Mr. 
               <br />
               Emrys~Evans must have been and could only 
               <br />
               have been this National Convention —— the 
               <br />
               machinery which the British government was 
               <br />
               going to set up to enable the people of this country 
               <br />
               to make their choice if they wanted responsible 
               <br />
               government returned or not. There can be no 
               <br />
               doubt whatsoever, Mr. Chairman, in your mind, 
               <br />
               as a lawyer, or in my learned friend Mr. Bradley’s 
               <br />
               mind, as a lawyer, and in your gentlemen’s 
               <br />
               minds, who by this time are practically sea 
               <br />
               lawyers, that this is correct. That legislation, 
               <br />
               thank God, is our magna carta. Had that statement 
               <br />
               not been made, had that legislation not been in 
               <br />
               the form it was in, then truly we might have been 
               <br />
               in a tough spot in Newfoundland. That is our 
               <br />
               charter of liberty, that when we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self~support—</span>

               government.

               I do not intend at this late hour to go over again 
               <br />
               all the reasons so very carefully detailed by mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this Convention. I congratulate the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> 
               <br />
               bers of this Convention for the very fine 
               <br />
               presentations that have given us in the past few 
               <br />
               days of the reasons why they were going to 
               <br />
               recommend that these forms of government be 
               <br />
               put on the ballot paper. At the same time, while 
               <br />
               it appears to be apparent that this motion is going 
               <br />
               to pass unanimously, it would appear the only 
               <br />
               member who spoke against it, as far as I could 
               <br />
               ascertain, was my learned friend Mr. Bradley, 
               <br />
               and with the substitution of the new motion I take 
               <br />
               it that that meets with his approval. His basic 
               <br />
               objection appeared to be the form of the motion.

               I cannot help drawing the Convention’s atten- 
               <br />
               tion to the inconsistency of some members here 
               <br />
               who stated they are going to vote for this motion 
               <br />
               recommending two forms of government —— 
               <br />
               responsible government and Commission of 
               <br />

               making the recommendation, state they do not

               believe in either form. It is rather an extraordinary 
               <br />
               thing that, gentlemen, to have 16 or 18 members 
               <br />
               making up their minds how they are going to 
               <br />
               advise their fellow-countrymen to do something 
               <br />
               they themselves would not do. Truly, “inconsis—

               Now as I said, it appears that a great majority 
               <br />
               are going to support this motion and it would also 
               <br />
               appear that on the preference vote a great 
               <br />
               majority are going to state their preference for 
               <br />
               responsible government. To those others of you, 
               <br />
               those who whilst voting for the motion are not 
               <br />
               particularly inclined to express their preference 
               <br />
               — to those I particularly address myself, to con- 
               <br />
               vince you why you must support this motion and

               express your preference for responsible govern—

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment,</span> I say that because the second last speaker, 
               <br />
               Rev. Mr. Entry, in giving his reasons against 
               <br />
               responsible government, talked about the fear 
               <br />
               that was in his bones, and I want to take the fear 
               <br />
               out of Rev. Burry’s bones, and out of all the bones 
               <br />
               of all the members who have any hesitancy about 
               <br />
               expressing preference for the only form of 
               <br />
               government we should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommend.</span> The best 
               <br />
               way I can do that is to quote to you the words of 
               <br />
               the high prophet himself, Mr. Smallwood. These 
               <br />
               words are entirely Mr. Smallwood’s and I hope 
               <br />
               he will understand that in quoting him I have 
               <br />
               every reason to congratulate him on the excellent 
               <br />
               verbiage, and the complete way he put the case 
               <br />
               for those who are backing responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment. I want to play back the record. The voice 
               <br />
               is that of Mr. Higgins, the words are those of J. 
               <br />
               R. Smallwood:

               We have the resources. God was good to 
               <br />
               us when He made Newfoundland. Our coas— 
               <br />
               tal waters are literally alive with ﬁsh of all 
               <br />
               kinds; why, if all the fish teeming in our 
               <br />
               waters were to swim at one time into our 
               <br />
               greatest bay —— Placentia Bay - they would 
               <br />
               ﬁll the great indraught until there was not a

               We have as yet barely scratched the surface

               of our fish resources. Our water powers, both
