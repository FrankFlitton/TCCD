               Two thousand possible square miles not taken up, 
               <br />
               which altogether means 12,200 square miles of 
               <br />
               inaccessible timber area, of which l0,000 
               <br />
               sq. miles has been taken up.... In Newfoundland 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               cords of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wood.</span> In Labrador we have 12,200

               <br />

               You all know how glad I would be to be able 
               <br />
               to put up a very good story about the timber areas 
               <br />
               in Labrador, but it has often been said here that 
               <br />
               we have got to be realists.... I appreciate that the 
               <br />
               Committee was at a serious disadvantage and 
               <br />
               probably cannot possibly get the information, but 
               <br />
               I would not like to give the impression that we 
               <br />
               have a vast timber area in Labrador, and find out 
               <br />
               in the next few years we were mistaken. This is 
               <br />
               not a scientiﬁc survey, but I feel that with my own 
               <br />
               knowledge of Labrador this 50 million cords of 
               <br />
               timber in the country is too high, and I wonder if 
               <br />
               we should look into the future thinking that we 
               <br />
               have that much timber capable of being turned 
               <br />
               into money which will flow into the treasury in 
               <br />
               the foreseeable future.

               I would like to have the optimism that has been 
               <br />
               expressed by so many when speaking about the 
               <br />
               timber area in Labrador. They tell me of the great 
               <br />
               wealth in Labrador, but I don’t think we have the 
               <br />
               wealth in the timber areas of Labrador that we 
               <br />
               think we have, and I think as a Convention we 
               <br />
               ought to find out the exact facts. This is based 
               <br />
               upon what we know, and upon information that l 
               <br />
               have after being in Labrador all these years...

               Mr. Jackman With all due respect to the Com-

               mittee I can’t concur with this report as it stands. 
               <br />
               It is really too incomplete as I see it. We have to 
               <br />
               assess the true value of our assets if we are going 
               <br />
               to agree on the form of government we want. A 
               <br />
               report like this is not sufficient to form an opinion 
               <br />
               of the genuine value of one of our greatest assets 
               <br />
               —— Labrador.... I have heard it said that there are
