               United States with a population of almost ten 
               <br />
               times that of Canada has a greater per capita debt;

               either Canada or the United States. But does that 
               <br />
               say they'll ever default as we did? They can raise 
               <br />
               their loans and get along. We know that in 
               <br />
               England there had to be an austerity programme. 
               <br />
               but we know something of the great ﬁght she 
               <br />
               put up and what she’s gone through. I believe that 
               <br />
               if we join up with Canada that there will be more 
               <br />
               Canadian tourists coming down here. That is a 
               <br />
               thing we want <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> more tourists. We have a 
               <br />
               wonderful climate here. Those of us who were 
               <br />
               members of the Ottawa delegation know some- 
               <br />
               thing of the heat that is experienced up there, and 
               <br />
               what a relief it would be to get out and get down 
               <br />
               to a place like Newfoundland in the summer time; 
               <br />
               and these people have the money. We saw their 
               <br />
               cars up there, cars from the States coming down 
               <br />
               through Canada — tourists spending their 
               <br />
               American money. I believe that they’d come to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland too, enjoy our climate, our natural 
               <br />
               beauty and our ﬁshing. But we want a road joined 
               <br />
               up with the Humber valley, and if we become a 
               <br />
               province of Canada, we can make a national park 
               <br />
               over there somewhere, and Canada keeps up the 
               <br />
               roads in national parks. I believe that with this 
               <br />
               ferry that the Canadian government will put on 
               <br />
               the Gulf to bring across the cars to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, that there will be a lot of Canadian and 
               <br />
               American money coming into Newfoundland...1 
               <br />
               Now the question is can we do that ourselves? 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie this afternoon has spoken about 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries. I would like to refer to the ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               as well. It was a very sad thing that happened 
               <br />
               when we were in Ottawa this year, the death of 
               <br />
               the Hon. Frank Bridges, who was Minister of 
               <br />
               Fisheries for Canada... It was certainly very 
               <br />
               pleasant to meet such a man.... I believe that we 
               <br />
               would have had quite a bit more information 
               <br />
               about the ﬁsheries if it hadn’t been for the death 
               <br />
               of Mr. Bridges. I would like to read from infor- 
               <br />
               mation that has been placed on the desks of 
               <br />
               members... It says here that the “Deputy Minister 
               <br />
               of Fisheries pointed out that there was in Canada 
               <br />
               a growing movement in support of regulatory 
               <br />
               measures of the type enforced in Newfoundland.

               “would not be disposed to interfere with the

               would represent an improvement over present

               regulations, and therefore would not be likely to 
               <br />
               repeal Newfoundland legislation in order to 
               <br />
