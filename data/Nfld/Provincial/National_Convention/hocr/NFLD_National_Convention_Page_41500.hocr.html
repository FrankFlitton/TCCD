               vote for the motion, for all the motion asks me to 
               <br />
               do is to be in favour of letting the people decide.” 
               <br />
               If I were an anticonfederate, that is whatl would 
               <br />
               say, and the people would respect me for saying 
               <br />
               it. Why, sir, even the anticonfederates amongst 
               <br />
               our people are expecting all the members of the 
               <br />
               Convention to vote in favour of this motion. 
               <br />
               They’ll be ashamed of their anticonfederate 
               <br />
               leaders if they vote to deprive the people of their 
               <br />
               chance to decide the matter. That is the first point 
               <br />
               I wanted to make today, sir; that it is the duty of 
               <br />
               every member of the Convention to vote for this 
               <br />
               motion to submit the confederation question to 
               <br />
               the people themselves

               The second point I want to make is connected 
               <br />
               with a remark made by Mr. Banﬁeld when he 
               <br />
               seconded the motion. Mr. Banﬁeld said that the 
               <br />
               people of the southwest coast are all in favour of 
               <br />
               confederation. He said they are looking forward 
               <br />
               to referendum day to cast their votes for con— 
               <br />
               federation. Well, I have heard how strong the 
               <br />
               people are for confederation up on that great 
               <br />
               coast, and what Mr. Banﬁeld said was no surprise 
               <br />
               to us. But Mr. Banﬁeld must not run away with 
               <br />
               the idea that it is only on the southwest coast that 
               <br />
               there are confederates. I come from the west 
               <br />
               coast, the best coast in this country today. And I 
               <br />
               can tell you there are confederates on our coast 
               <br />
               too. Out on the west coast we have many good 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders who are just waiting for the 
               <br />
               chance to mark their “X’s” for confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada. And I can tell you this: our west coast 
               <br />
               people are not going to be very pleased with any 
               <br />
               members who cast their votes against letting the 
               <br />
               people decide the question. We have a strong 
               <br />
               sense of fair play out on the west coast, sir. We 
               <br />
               believe in playing the game. We believe in giving 
               <br />
               the other fellow a chance. Live and let live. I 
               <br />
               won’t go so far as to say that every man and 
               <br />
               woman on the west coast is in favour of con— 
               <br />
               federation, but I will say this: that even those who 
               <br />
               are against confederation are all in favour of 
               <br />
               letting the question be settled by all the people in 
               <br />
               the referendum.

               To tell you the truth, Mr. Chairman, I cannot 
               <br />
               understand some men’s line of thought. I know a

               certain district here on the Avalon Peninsula that 
               <br />
               is very strong for confederation. I do not know a 
               <br />
               great deal about the Avalon Peninsula, or the 
               <br />
               districts that make it up, but this one particular 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman, I can see a great many good 
               <br />
               reasons why our country should become one of 
               <br />
               the provinces of Canada. I have given some - 
               <br />
               thought to the matter — I have tried to sort out 
               <br />
               my ideas on the subject. And let me say this first 
               <br />
               of all: I would be strongly opposed to confedera— 
               <br />
               tion if it meant that Canada was going to annex 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, if it meant that Canada was just 
               <br />
               going to take us over, body and bones. I do not 
               <br />
               want our country to be annexed or taken over by 
               <br />
               any country. If confederation meant that the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada would take us over and 
               <br />
               run us, then I for one would be opposed to con- 
               <br />
               federation. But confederation does not mean that 
               <br />
               at all. In fact, it means anything but that. Con- 
               <br />
               federation is a partnership. It means that New— 
               <br />
               foundland would become a province in the 
               <br />
               Canadian union. And even that does not state it 
               <br />
               clearly, Mr. Chairman, for Canada is not just a 
               <br />
               uniOn of provinces. It is a federal union. I will 
               <br />
               explain what I mean. It so happens that I was the 
               <br />
               second man to become president of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Federation of Labour. I was for years 
               <br />
               president of an important union in Comer Brook, 
               <br />
               and as such I played some part in forming the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Federation of Labour. My union 
               <br />
               was only one of quite a number of unions in this 
               <br />
               country at that time. When the suggestion came 
               <br />
               up to form the federation, did it means that all 
               <br />
               those unions would be joined together to form 
               <br />
               one union? Is that what the Federation was, an 
               <br />
               amalgamation of all the individual unions? Did 
               <br />
               the Federation simply annex all those unions and 
               <br />
               form them into one union? No, that is not what 
               <br />
               happened at all. Every union kept its own rules 
               <br />
