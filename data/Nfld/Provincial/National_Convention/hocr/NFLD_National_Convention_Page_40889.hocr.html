               <br />

               <br />
               they are going to erect sanatoria, they will also 
               <br />

               there is not sufﬁcient personnel in Newfoundland

               <br />
               dues by province for ﬁscal year 1946-47. Then it 
               <br />
               gives a table of revenue and expenditure and 
               <br />
