               <br />
               defence now of many years standing. This pattern

               American expansion, of which schemes for 
               <br />
               defence form an aspect, has been continuous 
               <br />
               from the days of the first settlements and the 
               <br />
               doctrine of isolation has had little to do with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it....</span> 
               <br />
               Since World WarI at least, the motive in most of 
               <br />
               this expansion has been plain —— to add to the 
               <br />
               security of the continental United States... The 
               <br />
               east coast, far the most important, for some 
               <br />
               curious reason, has been the most neglected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> 
               <br />
               perhaps because of a half-conscious perception 
               <br />
               of Great Britain as a barrier against predatory 
               <br />
               Europe. Yet it must have been evident to keen 
               <br />
               students that the United States sooner or later 
               <br />
               would have to have Atlantic offshore defences 
               <br />
               comparable with those it possesses in the Paciﬁc. 
               <br />
               That process was begun in the summer of 1940 
               <br />
               with the acquisition of bases in Bermuda and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and extended in 1941 with the 
               <br />
               moves into Greenland and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iceland.</span> The United 
               <br />
               States has thus very consistently throughout its 
               <br />
               history followed a policy of securing control of 
               <br />
               all outposts from which threats to its security 
               <br />
               might be made. Its conception of outposts has 
               <br />
               grown with the increase in the range and effec- 
               <br />
               tiveness of the instruments of war. Where the 
               <br />
               conception will eventually lead American arms, 
               <br />

               The nation whose fortunes are most intimately 
               <br />
               bound up with Newfoundland is Canada. It is 
               <br />
               abundantly clear that it must be a major aspect of 
               <br />
               Canadian policy to ensure the retention of New- 
               <br />
               foundland in friendly hands and to see that even 
               <br />
               the friendliest of hands do not arrange things to 
               <br />
               her disadvantage. So long as Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               a simple British possession and there was no 
               <br />
               doubt of Great Britain’s sea supremacy in the 
               <br />
               Atlantic, issues of sovereignty did not arise. 
               <br />
               Canadians were slow to grasp the changing posi- 
               <br />
               tion of Great Britain in sea power and the way in 
               <br />
               which that change might affect them. The whole 
               <br />
               issue was focused sharply in June, 1940. The fall 
               <br />
               of France and the possible fall of Great Britain 
               <br />
               was quickly reflected in Canada’s assumption of 
               <br />
               responsibility for the defence of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and in her increase of her forces there. This was 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst direct Canadian intervention in New- 
               <br />
               foundland.
