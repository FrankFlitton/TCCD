               asked for 15 or 20 minutes this afternoon. Well,

               he is long past that time, and to me it seems awful

               funny to have to sit back here and have your ear

               <br />
               facts. One of the facts we must face is this: that 
               <br />
               between 1920 and 1940, the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland failed to take in enough 
               <br />
               revenue to meet their expenses. They failed by 
               <br />
               $60 million to do it for 20 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years...</span> There is a fact, 
               <br />
               and it is a fact I suggest to you in trying to 
               <br />
               anticipate to what extent the next 20 years will 
               <br />
               duplicate the 20 years from 1920 to 1940. We 
               <br />
               have got to face these facts... Whatever form of 
               <br />
               government we have in the future we know that 
               <br />
               from 1920 to 1940 this country went broke $60 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood The answer is this: at the very

               time that Newfoundland went on the rocks the 
               <br />

               <br />
               about as badly as this country did. New~ 
               <br />
               foundland, as we all know, lost self—govemment

               because we went <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">broke,</span> Great Britain stepped in 
               <br />
               and took our government from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use</span> In Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan the Government of Canada loaned the 
               <br />
               Government of Saskatchewan I think $90 mil- 
               <br />
               lion. That was in the depression days of 1929-31. 
               <br />
               This year, in 1947, the federal government made 
               <br />
               a deal with Saskatchewan... They signed a deal 
               <br />
               giving them some 20-odd years to pay half of it, 
               <br />
               and the other half the federal government has 
               <br />
               forgiven altogether.... Saskatchewan came out of 
               <br />
               it very well, and they did not lose their govern- 
               <br />
