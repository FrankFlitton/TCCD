               In some respects the position of Chairman is

               exceptional Because of his position it would be

               justified or not, has the effect of destroying his

               <br />
               report of the London delegation when I made a

               form of our conversations with the British 
               <br />
               government. May I say I appreciate very highly 
               <br />
               the co-operation of the two members of the

               <br />
               It was the ﬁrst of its kind and I was willing to

               attribute it to the heat of debate. Now another

               such occasion has arisen, and I have to inform this

               Convention that I have not the slightest intention

               gone far to bring democratic institutions into
