               Mr. Bailey Apparently, according to this, the 
               <br />
               federal government will take over the Clarenville 
               <br />
               vessels? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood That is what it seems. 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington Just one question comes to 
               <br />
               mind. Clause 5, section (1), “the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Railway, including steamship and other marine 
               <br />
               services.” That is official. That is in the proposed 
               <br />
               arrangements. In Volume 2, page 69,1 reference 
               <br />
               is made to the condition of the property of the 
               <br />
               railway and steamship services. The second para- 
               <br />
               graph should have been read in connection with 
               <br />
               the rehabilitation that is likely to have to take 
               <br />
               place in connection with the railway and steam- 
               <br />
               ship service. That is provisional. That is not 
               <br />
               guaranteed. They presume certain works would 
               <br />
               have to be done. There is no guarantee they will 
               <br />
               be done, once we become a province. Was this 
               <br />
               memorandum prepared by the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood That is a memorandum 
               <br />
               prepared for the cabinet of Canada by the railway 
               <br />
               and steamship ofﬁcials of that government, the 
               <br />
               President of the Clarke Steamship Company, and 
               <br />
               the Vice-President of the Canadian National 
               <br />
               Railways. They prepared it. If the Canadian 
               <br />
               government were to offer, in this document, to 
               <br />
               take over the railway and steamship service, they 
               <br />
               wanted to have some idea of what they would be 
               <br />
               taking over, and whether it had been making 
               <br />
               money or losing it; what condition it is in; how 
               <br />
               much money would likely have to be spent to put 
               <br />
               it in good condition, if it is not in good condition. 
               <br />
               They asked their authorities, railway experts, to 
               <br />
               prepare a memorandum; in the next ten years, $10 
               <br />
               million would have to be spent to put the railway 
               <br />
               system in good condition. The rails would need 
               <br />
               to be renewed, ballast renewed, embankments 
               <br />
               and cuts widened. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Hailing?</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No. That is for all of them: 
               <br />
               It would appear that the rails would need to 
               <br />
               be renewed on the whole of the railway 
               <br />
               within a period of ten years, and that at the 
               <br />
               same time ballast should be renewed, em- 
               <br />
               bankments and cuts widened, drainage res- 
               <br />
               tored or improved and that a majority of the 
               <br />
               bridges would need renewing. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman There is $7 million covering 
               <br />
               rolling stock.

               Mr. Smallwood Yes. “It may be hazarded that 
               <br />
               the cost of rehabilitating rolling stock over a 
               <br />
               ten-year period would be of the order of $7 mil— 
               <br />
               lion." That is $17 million the railway expects it 
               <br />
               would need to spend. Commander Edwards, 
               <br />
               Deputy Minister of Transport, who was one of 
               <br />
               the Canadian government committee, met with 
               <br />
               us on this railway question. He has been in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and knows our railway system. He is 
               <br />
               an expert railway man. This memorandum is 
               <br />
               based on the data we brought up to them; some 
               <br />
               of it we got afterwards, at their request; and also 
               <br />
               of their own knowledge. They have a fairly good 
               <br />
               knowledge of the railways of other countries... 
               <br />
               This memorandum, as Mr. Harrington says, is not 
               <br />
               an undertaking, it is not a bond; it is not in the 
               <br />
               terms. The Canadian government has been in- 
               <br />
               formed by their own experts that $17 million 
               <br />
               would have to be spent to make it shipshape over 
               <br />
               a period of years. I would draw Mr. Harrington’s 
               <br />
               attention to the fact that freight rates would 
               <br />
               presumably be reduced; express rates would 
               <br />
               presumably be reduced; passenger rates would 
               <br />
               presumably be reduced. That is the opinion of the 
               <br />
               railway experts of Canada. They assume that if 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada takes over the system, 
               <br />
               and makes it part and parcel of the Canadian 
               <br />
               National Railways, naturally they will have the 
               <br />
               same freight, same passenger, same express rates 
               <br />
               as in Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Harrington is right, it is not 
               <br />
               guaranteed. Personally I have no doubt about it; 
               <br />
               still, it is not so stated in the terms.

               Mr. Job When Mr. Smallwood was talking
