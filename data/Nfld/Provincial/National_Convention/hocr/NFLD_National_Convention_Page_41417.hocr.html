               send a delegation to Ottawa to ask for the terms

               <br />

               more reasonable? Could anything be more 
               <br />

               majority to send a delegation to Ottawa to seek 
               <br />
               the terms of union. That delegation, which the 
               <br />
               Convention voted to send, and which the Con- 
               <br />
               vention elected, cost the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20,000.</span> Major Cashin says it is $30,000. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I think it cost $400,000. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Over $20,000 came out of the 
               <br />
               public chest to get these terms for the people’s 
               <br />
               consideration, and what could be more 
               <br />
               reasonable than to submit the terms to the people? 
               <br />
               We do not own these terms, Mr. Chairman. The 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people paid for them, and the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people own them. They have 
               <br />
               every right to pass judgement on the terms. They 
               <br />
               have every right to decide whether they will join 
               <br />
               the Canadian family of provinces or try to stagger 
               <br />
               along on our own. That is all my present resolu— 
               <br />
               tion or motion does. It only asks that confedera— 
               <br />
               tion on these terms be submitted to our people for 
               <br />
               their verdict, for their decision. Let the people 
               <br />
               decide, says my motion. Let the people say 
               <br />
               whether they will have confederation. Could any- 
               <br />
               thing be more reasonable?
