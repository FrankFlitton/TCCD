               sional politicians are in for a rude jolt when the 
               <br />
               people next go to the polls. Iam not trying to build 
               <br />
               up a case for confederation, but the charge made 
               <br />
               by some few that there is not a strong sentiment 
               <br />
               in favour of union with Canada is fantastically 
               <br />
               unmre. If I were asked to voice an opinion I 
               <br />
               would content myself with saying that there is a 
               <br />
               strong warning of caution against a reversion to 
               <br />
               the unrestricted politics of the past. I know noth- 
               <br />
               ing of what confederation might offer. I have 
               <br />
               bothered very little about it, yet in fairness to a 
               <br />
               large minority of my intelligent fellow 
               <br />
               countrymen I would like to see the approach 
               <br />
               made to Ottawa, and if terms are offered it would 
               <br />
               be unfair to dispose of them without a thorough 
               <br />
               and honest examination. If they offer political

               stability and promise of future security, better

               set a date until we receive a reply from the United

               <br />
               we are going to get a reply the next day. It may 
               <br />
               be a week or two and in the meantime I think the 
               <br />
               bulk ofour reports will be concluded. The Steer—

               <br />

               <br />
               to decide; Ijust suggest these considerations for 
               <br />
               thought, but the Convention must do as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pleases.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett The phrase was purposely left more 
               <br />
               or less elastic. We could not say whether or not 
               <br />
               the Convention would be satisﬁed to allow a 
               <br />
               delegation to proceed to Great Britain before all 
               <br />
               the reports were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> It was felt by some that 
               <br />
               possibly if we had the meat out of these reports 
               <br />
               which have not yet been filed, and had the finan- 
               <br />
               cial side of the Financial Report and not the 
               <br />
               economic, that the Convention might allow the 
               <br />
               delegation to proceed as soon as word was 
               <br />
               received. The government of Great Britain is a 
               <br />
               pretty busy organisation and would want to fix 
               <br />
               the date when they would receive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> If we em— 
               <br />
               body a statement saying that the delegation 
               <br />
               should not proceed until all the reports were in it 
               <br />
               would be impossible for them to fix a set date. I 
               <br />
               felt that if we made it elastic then if we got 
               <br />
               permission to send a delegation with the reports 
               <br />
               already in and the meat out of the others, and the 
               <br />
               financial side of Major Cashin’s report, then I 
               <br />
               think that we might be prepared to go. We will 
               <br />
               have to have sessions, without the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">microphones,</span> 
               <br />
               to draw up the questions which will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked.</span> If

               Mr. Higgins and Mr. Job will suggest some 
               <br />
               amendment I will be perfectly happy to have it
