               they added our capital expenditure into the ordi- 
               <br />
               nary expenditure. To prove my point that those 
               <br />
               ﬁgures are correct, we’ll pick the total expendi- 
               <br />
               tures and total revenues for the 50 years ap- 
               <br />
               proximately down in this paper here. And I’d like 
               <br />
               the members of this house to notice. The total 
               <br />
               expenditures and total revenues -— revenue 
               <br />
               $464,531,403, total expenditures $469,...so, so. 
               <br />
               That shows a deﬁcit there, doesn’t it, of $5 mil— 
               <br />
               lion. One would imagine therefore that our public 
               <br />
               debt today was only $5 million, whereas it’s 
               <br />
               around $75 million. Consequently it goes to show 
               <br />
               that these other expenditures, which prior to the 
               <br />
               advent of Commission government were not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               cluded in ordinary expenditures, were included 
               <br />
               as capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">account.</span> Now, where did that other $70 
               <br />
               million go? Here’s where it went. It didn‘t go to 
               <br />
               pay the ordinary running expenses of the country 
               <br />
               at all. We built a railway that has cost New- 
               <br />
               foundland over $45 million up to the present 
               <br />
               time. Since we took it over in 1923 it has cost us 
               <br />
               roughly $30 million. But prior to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New!</span> 
               <br />
               foundland paid $15,000 a mile, if my memory 
               <br />
               serves me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right.</span> We built all our public buildings, 
               <br />
               all our lighthouses, a lot of schools around the 
               <br />
               country. We paid $45 million in the ﬁrst war 
               <br />
               including interest up to the present time. And this 
               <br />
               one we spent$10—15 million. Now whatdoes that 
               <br />
               mean? That means for 50 years that we operated 
               <br />
               this country practically on ordinary expenditure 
               <br />
               for nothing, and that those assets which we have 
               <br />
               to our credit — forget the war — today represent 
               <br />
               $36 million. I’ll put it that way because, as I 
               <br />
               pointed out yesterday, if we took the $35-36 
               <br />
               million in cash we have at the present time, and 
               <br />
               devoted it towards the reduction of our whole 
               <br />
               debt, our net debt would be between about $36 
               <br />
               million in round ﬁgures. Now that’s entirely dif~ 
               <br />
               ferent. The Amulree report, yes it shows it, but it 
               <br />
               didn’t show what was spent on capital and what 
               <br />
               was spent on ordinary. They piled it all on to 
               <br />
               ordinary expenditure. And I knew that’s how Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood was evidently misled.

               Mr. Cashin Certainly we did. But in ordinary 
               <br />
               operating of the country that‘s what we spent, 
               <br />
               $12,898,000. Now how did we spend the other 
               <br />
               money? It was on capital account. We re—railed 
               <br />
               part of the railway. We charged it up to capital 
               <br />
               account. We built roads charged up to capital 
               <br />
               account... If you get the Auditor General’s report 
               <br />
               you’ll ﬁnd that he outlines what they actually 
               <br />
               spent on capital account. But this here showsjust 
               <br />
               ordinary expenses, which is entirely different 
               <br />
               than capital expenditures. And when Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood points out we exported $45 million 
               <br />
               worth of ﬁsh or whatever it might be, and that we 
               <br />
               spent that year — they took out of the country 
               <br />
               probably $25 million and he says that’s 50% of 
               <br />
               what we exported that we spent. He must remem- 
               <br />
               ber ordinary account and what we spent on capi- 
               <br />
               tal account. Take this year, we spent $13 million 
               <br />
               over this past year. How did we spend it? We 
               <br />
               don’t buy ships every year. We don’t have to 
               <br />
               replace a new ship that costs a million dollars 
               <br />
               again next <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> That’s a capital expenditure, and 
               <br />
               should be written off accordingly each year, in 
               <br />
               the course of 20 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> Now that’s entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent from the way people have been trying to 
               <br />
               convey the expense. And Amulree was the worse 
               <br />
               offender.

               Mr. Smallwood Now we have Major Cashin’s 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explanation.</span> But l would ask him this question. 
               <br />
               Here is presented to the Convention the Report 
               <br />
               of the Finance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Committee.</span> And on page 112 it 
               <br />
               says, “We give herewith the annual revenues and 
               <br />
               expenditures of the country from the ﬁscal year 
               <br />
               1898 to the ﬁscal year 1946, both years in- 
               <br />
               clusive.” Then it gives it, revenue and expendi~ 
               <br />
               ture. Now what I want to ask Major Cashin is this, 
               <br />
               whatever you call it, whether it’s ordinary, capi- 
               <br />
               tal, or whether it‘s reconstruction expenditure, 
               <br />
               whatever heading it falls under, it’s all expendi- 
               <br />
               ture —- I doubt if Major Cashin has in this table 
               <br />
               here any ﬁgures, I know they’ re there throughout 
               <br />
               the report, sure, year by year, but in this table I
