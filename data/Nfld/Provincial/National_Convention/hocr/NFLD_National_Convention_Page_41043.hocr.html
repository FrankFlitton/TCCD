               <br />
               education of our children has been backward.

               suppose! Do you remember those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">days?....</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood will say no more repairs to 
               <br />
               schools, no more erection of school buildings. if 
               <br />
               we are going into confederation. I would suggest 
               <br />
               that instead of the $3,107,700 which 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has cut out for Education, it 
               <br />
               should be $4 million, because we all know that 
               <br />
               the Education Department today is budgeting for 
               <br />
               a $4 million expenditure next year. Why Should 
               <br />
               we deprive this country ofthat budget, simply to 
               <br />
               become a part and parcel of the Dominion of
