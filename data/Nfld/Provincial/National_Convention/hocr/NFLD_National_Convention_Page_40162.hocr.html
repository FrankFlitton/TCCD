               all in favour of responsible government. I am not

               one of those, and I am not one of those with much 
               <br />
               faith or belief in Commission government. I do 
               <br />
               not deny that they have done some good things 
               <br />
               for this country. How could they be here for 12 
               <br />
               or 13 years without doing some good? I believe 
               <br />
               the people should have some say in the govem- 
               <br />
               ment of their country, and that is why I am willing 
               <br />
               and anxious to get all the facts about union with 
               <br />
               Canada. I do not pretend I know anything about 
               <br />
               such union and its benefits, or disadvantages, that 
               <br />
               is why I am anxious to at least hear the terms, so 
               <br />
               that we can discuss and debate them. and if we so 
               <br />
               desire have it placed on the ballot paper for the 
               <br />
               electorate to make the final decision. I am not a 
               <br />
               confederate, neither am I anti-confederate, but I 
               <br />
               can assure this house that if the people support 
               <br />
               the terms at the referendum, Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               most assuredly will have their elected repre— 
               <br />
               sentatives; they would then have their elected 
               <br />
               prime ministers, and be given a chance to throw 
               <br />
               them out, and elect someone else after four years 
               <br />
               of their stewartship. Someone may say that 
               <br />
               responsible government would give us that. Yes 
               <br />
               it would, but how would it give it? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Would responsible government have any hope 
               <br />
               of success when the hard times came again? Or 
               <br />
               would it mean that we would be on our own 
               <br />
               again. with nobody to come to our rescue? I think 
               <br />
               Iknow already what the outcome would be. What 
               <br />
               I and our people want to know is this: under 
               <br />
               confederation, would we have help in case of 
               <br />
               need? That is another reason why 1 am so anxious 
               <br />
               to get the terms and conditions of confederation 
               <br />
               without too much delay. Now so far as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Penney’s amendment is concerned, it’s all right

               for one thing only, and that is to give the resolu-

               matter put on the shelf. They are determined to 
               <br />
               have the terms, as many telegrams from my dis—

               isn’t willing to hang around here all through the 
               <br />
               winter helping to spend $1,000 a day of the 
               <br />
               people’s money. It’s all very well to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pooh~pooh</span> 
               <br />
               such a small matter but $1,000 a day sounds like 
               <br />
               a lot of money in a district where they haven’t 
               <br />
               even got a doctor, such as Green Bay district, 
               <br />
               although 25 years ago they had two. To some 
               <br />
               people a $1,000 a day may sound like a very small 
               <br />
               amount. They may be willing to stay here for a 
               <br />
               whole year spending this money, but so far as the 
               <br />
               people of Green Bay are concerned I think they 
               <br />
               would much rather see some of this money going 
               <br />
               to help them with the new cottage hospital that 
               <br />
