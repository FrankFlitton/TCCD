               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, I happened to be a

               member of that delegation. I have a clear 
               <br />
               memory... I attended the ﬁrst meeting of that 
               <br />
               conference over there, and to my recollection I 
               <br />
               don‘t remember Lord Addison saying that we 
               <br />
               were to keep these things conﬁdential. That is my 
               <br />
               recollection. I do remember him saying, the last 
               <br />
               day we were there, ﬁve or six minutes before we 
               <br />
               disbanded, that we’ve had very ﬁne talks <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>

               tween ourselves, and these are conﬁdential talks. 
               <br />
               These were his exact words. That was five 
               <br />
               minutes before we disbanded. That is the posi~ 
               <br />
               tion. There were matters in connection with
