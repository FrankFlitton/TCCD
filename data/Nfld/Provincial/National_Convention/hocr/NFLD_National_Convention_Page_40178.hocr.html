               <br />
               compiled statistically... While we have not any 
               <br />
               deﬁnite assurance from the department, it is prob- 
               <br />
               able that these teachers were only working for six 
               <br />
               months. Also in 1944 there were 31 teachers 
               <br />
               getting between $300 and $400. There were none 
               <br />
               so low as these in 1945. Also in 1944 there were 
               <br />
               some getting between $400 and $500, and there 
               <br />
               were none in 1945. In other words there were 273 
               <br />
               teachers getting less than $500, whereas in 1945 
               <br />
               there are none. That makes the situation quite 
               <br />
               different. It is regrettable that we did not have this 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               and learn to write, so I did not get much of a start 
               <br />
               in life. I am glad that we have this before the

               I ﬁrmly believe our system of education is

               <br />
               this should be stressed strongly, that we should 
               <br />
               get together and cut out the cost of the overhead, 
               <br />

               <br />
               up to every Newfoundlander to see that this sys- 
               <br />

               I know a man who left one of our outports a 
               <br />
               number of years ago, and although he started 
               <br />
               from scratch, by the time he was 35 years old he 
               <br />
               was head of one of the largest construction firms 
               <br />

               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world.</span> I believe if we put in the Scotch system 
               <br />
               of education it would not be so expensive. There 
               <br />
               is nobody today that can face the world better 
               <br />
               than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotchman.</span> If you go into a shipyard in

               the States every second man there is Mac, the 
               <br />
               architect, the manager, the ofﬁce worker, be- 
               <br />
               cause he is the best equipped for every job. In the 
               <br />
               far-ﬂung parts of the Empire, everywhere you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd the Scot. If he comes from the Hebrides 
               <br />
               or wherever he comes from, it is all the same, they 
               <br />
               are all educated and can take their university 
               <br />
               course, and wherever he goes he can carry on his 
               <br />
               education and pick up everything necessary. That 
               <br />
               is why Scotland today has the smallest percent- 
               <br />
               age of illiteracy in the world. I believe something 
               <br />
               can be done in this country; after all, it is what 
               <br />
               Newfoundland desires today.
