               <br />

               <br />
               course, does not include the salaries of the judges 
               <br />
               of the Supreme Court, the federal government 
               <br />
               would pay that. These are other expenditures of 
               <br />
               the court which the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland would have to pay: “14 assistant 
               <br />
               magistrates —— $38,374 a year.” The reason for 
               <br />
               that is that in the estimate you will ﬁnd under 
               <br />
               4 (1), under the heading, “Magistrates“, seven 
               <br />
               district magistrates, and then you will ﬁnd, 14 
               <br />
               assistant magistrates As these seven district 
               <br />
               magistracies would become county courts, or 
               <br />
               district courts, and be paid for by the federal 
               <br />
               government, Newfoundland would then have to 
               <br />
               take care of the 14 assistant magistrates. So here 
               <br />
               in this table of mine, “14 asst. magistrates — 
               <br />
               $38,374 a year, three shorthand typists...”.... The 
               <br />
               penitentiary is the $69,533 that we are presently 
               <br />
               spending, but the difference between $69,500 
               <br />
               and $34,500 is accounted for by the fact that the 
               <br />
               cost of operating the penitentiary would be 
               <br />
               shared by both governments, which would repre- 
               <br />
               sent a saving to the Government of Newfound— 
               <br />
               land. “Travelling Magistrates -— $17,900”

               each Mounted Policeman, the full cost to the

               <br />
               much more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that...</span> We can get 50 of them,

               brought into Newfoundland from Canada. 11 
               <br />
               means that 50 of our Rangers can be enlisted in

               the RCMP, given their training and stationed in

               <br />

               <br />
               which brings the vote for Rangers down to 
               <br />
