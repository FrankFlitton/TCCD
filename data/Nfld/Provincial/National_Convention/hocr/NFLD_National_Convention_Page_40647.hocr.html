               ing home the first time, they came to a land 
               <br />
               suddenly aware of the public amenities of the 
               <br />
               industrial civilisation on the mainland New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders were looking with envious eyes at 
               <br />
               the standards and services of the nations on the 
               <br />
               other side of the fence, and soon they were want-

               Government did the best that it could with the 
               <br />
               little it had. It managed to provide a few more 
               <br />
               miles of road and a few other pathetic odds and 
               <br />
               ends. But that extra effort was the last straw that 
               <br />
               broke the camel’s back. Notwithstanding all the 
               <br />
               blame that has been heaped upon their heads, it 
               <br />
               was not so much our politicians who failed us in 
               <br />
               that hour as our economy. Came the Commis— 
               <br />
               sion, and for seven years, it did little better than 
               <br />
               the politicians. I have always thought that the 
               <br />
               Commission would have done much better if it 
               <br />
               had acted as a commission. It had the power, had 
               <br />
               in the beginning the goodwill of the people. Ithad 
               <br />
               a better chance to do a more notable job than any 
               <br />
               government this island has ever had. But it fell 
               <br />
               short of what it might have accomplished. Some- 
               <br />
               where along the line it seems to have become 
               <br />
               more concerned with heeding the dictates of its 
               <br />
               ear to the ground, than proceeding with the 
               <br />
               reconstruction paths to which it was committed, 
               <br />

               And then the seven years of plenty were upon

               us. The phrase is more euphonious than exact, but 
               <br />
               I have yet to be convinced that what the war

               brought to this land may rightly be termed 
               <br />
               prosperity. I still agree with myself in what I said

               at the beginning of this Convention <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> that all that

               came of the war jobs and the war dollars, was that

               a few more Newfoundlanders than ever before 
               <br />
               came a little closer than ever before to achieving 
               <br />
               a decent standard of living. For the most part, in

               most instances, where there was something over 
               <br />
               and to spare it went to replace and to restore what 
               <br />
               had rotted and mildewed away during the depres-

               more concerned to control living costs, New-

               foundland might have been better served.

               Government has latterly shown, and is showing 
               <br />
               a belated and ponderous concern with the cost of 
               <br />
               living. It was rushing around frantically to lock 
               <br />

               Our continuing ability these last years to

               balance the budget and have a couple of million 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnance. The phenomenon is all the more remark-

               able in that the budgets of these last years have

               drastic change with all that has gone before. If

               In the past our economy was never equal to
