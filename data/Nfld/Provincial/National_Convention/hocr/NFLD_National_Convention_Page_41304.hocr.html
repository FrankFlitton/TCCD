               However, as the ﬁrst and most important part 
               <br />
               of this resolution can be properly taken care of by 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst duly elected government, I am prepared 
               <br />
               to support the motion as it stands, as our people 
               <br />
               must perforce either want selfgovemment or they 
               <br />
               do not want it, and I am fully prepared to accept 
               <br />
               their judgement on the matter. There is one 
               <br />
               reason why I would agree to putting Commission 
               <br />
               of Government on the ballot paper. At any time 
               <br />
               after 1936 to 1941, when we began to feel the 
               <br />
               effect of the war time prosperity, it is the general- 
               <br />
               ly accepted opinion that the big majority of our 
               <br />
               people would have readily agreed to the return to 
               <br />
               self—govemment without modifications. Under 
               <br />
               the unprecedented prosperity of our country, 
               <br />
               through circumstances over which the Commis~ 
               <br />
               sion of Government had neither influence nor 
               <br />
               control, a large number of our people have lost 
               <br />
               sight of the true causes for the inﬂux of foreign 
               <br />
               capital and the high prices for our commodities, 
               <br />
               and they have been giving credit to a form of 
               <br />
               government of which neither the personnel nor 
               <br />
               the form had anything whatever to do with it. I 
               <br />
               do not quarrel with anyone who disagrees with 
               <br />

               me, not even the members of the Commission 
               <br />

               <br />
               most of them on the Commission at present are 
               <br />
               ﬁne men, and I have a high opinion of them; but 
               <br />
               they and others who have served that unpopular 
               <br />
               body have agreed openly that the form is wrong 
               <br />
               for any country in this modern age, when all 
               <br />
               people, regardless of race or creed, are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clamoue</span> 
               <br />
               in g for the right to choose the form of government 
               <br />
               under which they will live. But for the fact that I 
               <br />
               know our surplus would be gone in four years 
               <br />
               unless it could be locked up outside their reach, I 
               <br />
               would like to see them suffer for some of the sins 
               <br />
               for which I know the government of that four 
               <br />
               years will be held responsible, but for which 
               <br />
               resettling world conditions will be to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blame.</span> By 
               <br />
               that time I feel we will have our feet on terra firma 
               <br />
               and be able safely to carry on without the aid of 
               <br />
               any surplus. 
               <br />
               For the last time in this Convention I shall 
               <br />
               repeat paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Atlantic Charter: 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2.</span> They desire to see no territorial chan— 
               <br />
               ges that do not accord with the freely ex~ 
               <br />
               pressed wishes of the peoples concerned 
               <br />
               Territorial changes did take place in New- 
               <br />
               foundland without the freely expressed wishes of 
               <br />
               the people. If it was the wish of the people, 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders were not consulted and these 
               <br />
               wishes were therefore never expressed. 
               <br />
               3.They respect the right of all people to 
               <br />
               choose the form of government under which 
               <br />
               they will live; and they wish to see sovereign 
               <br />
               rights and self-govemment restored to those 
               <br />
               who have been forcibly deprived of them. 
               <br />
               What greater authority could we have that our 
               <br />
               cause is just, that we are not infringing on the 
               <br />
               rights of others, than the signed statement of these 
               <br />
               two great world leaders and statesmen? This 
               <br />
               famous declaration was made in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               waters. So far, I refuse to believe they were not 
               <br />
               sincere; but less than two months from now will 
               <br />
               prove whether it was an empty, fake promise to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland or a friendly sincere pledge, con- 
               <br />
               scious of the very great wrong that had been 
               <br />
               perpetrated against our people. I stated in my 
               <br />
               radio address of December 20, 1947, “Great 
               <br />
               Britain has a solemn obligation to perform 
               <br />
               toward Newfoundland, that obligation must and 
               <br />
               will be kept or she will be condemned forever in 
               <br />
               the eyes of the civilised world. No political ex- 
               <br />
               cuse will save her. We, the people of New-
