               <br />
               Convention as to their ideas on certain things. I 
               <br />
               do believe there are occasions when this long- 
               <br />
               suffering public, which was referred to yesterday 
               <br />
               by a certain member of the Bar, might be spared 
               <br />
               arguments. I do say, as far as a certain member 
               <br />
               of this Convention is concerned yesterday, he 
               <br />
               said nothing more derogatory about the 
               <br />
               microphones than were said by anyone else. I do 
               <br />
               think they are serving their purpose provided they 
               <br />
               are not monopolised by one or two or a few. I do 
               <br />
               think it should be your prerogative to cutout the 
               <br />
               broadcasting at certain times. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge I agree with Mr. Hollett. I may say 
               <br />
               that this is the ﬁrst time I heard of anything 
               <br />
               coming in to ﬁnd out if we wanted this broadcast- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing.</span> It has been here for a long time, and now we 
               <br />
               have a letter asking if we wish to keep it. They 
               <br />
               did not ask us ﬁrst, and now, as far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, it can stay here... 
               <br />
               Mr. Hillier I support Mr. Higgins in what he 
               <br />
               said. As the microphones have been here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practi»</span> 
               <br />
               cally the full time for every session, I see no 
               <br />
               reason why they should be removed. I think they 
               <br />
               can serve a useful purpose if we, on our part, keep 
               <br />
               as near to the point as possible. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins To bring the matter to a head, I move 
               <br />
               that we request the Broadcasting Corporation, from 
               <br />
               today, to have the microphones in this chamber. 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell I would like to second that motion. 
               <br />
               If I might speak brieﬂy, there are one or two 
               <br />
               things I would like to point out. First of all, we 
               <br />
               should look at this logically, and not be carried 
               <br />
               away by anything that anyone says here or some- 
               <br />
               where else. If people want to exercise their 
               <br />
               freedom of speech, let them go ahead and do it. 
               <br />
               There are one or two things that appear to me, and 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst is that broadcasting is about the only 
               <br />
               means of having accurate reporting of what goes 
               <br />
               on here. If we do not broadcast proceedings, the 
               <br />
               only reporting we can rely on is newspaper 
               <br />
               reporting, and they, not being machines, cannot 
               <br />
               give full reports of what transpires here, and the 
               <br />
               people on the outside have to rely on secondhand 
               <br />
               information of what somebody else heard, and 
               <br />
               will not really get a full and accurate report. 
               <br />
               The other point is this: I feel that if we have 
               <br />
               any reason for refusing to broadcast our proceed- 
               <br />
               ings, in other words if we put the microphones 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               out, I don’t see why we should let the public 
               <br />
               occupy the galleries. I don't think there is any 
               <br />
               necessity for the Convention being conducted in 
               <br />
               secret. If it is not being conducted in secret, and 
               <br />
               if people care to exercise the privilege of coming 
               <br />
               here in person, then I think everybody should be 
               <br />
               allowed in through the microphones and broad- 
               <br />
               casting.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Finally, whether or not we express ourselves 
               <br />
               too fully (it has been argued that some of us do 
               <br />
               express ourselves too fully because of the 
               <br />
               microphones, and its also been argued that we 
               <br />
               don’t express ourselves as fully as if they were 
               <br />
               not here), I don’t think the presence of the 
               <br />
               microphones should affect in any way at all the 
               <br />
               orderly conducting ofour business. and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> we, as 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing our business in an orderly way in the presence 
               <br />
               of the microphones, I don’t think we would be 
               <br />
               capable of doing it if the microphones were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out...</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy I wish to support the motion, and 
               <br />
               frankly I do not see any other way that we can 
               <br />
               impart the knowledge that we glean here on the 
               <br />
               affairs of the country to the people, except over 
               <br />
               the radio. I fail to see in what way it excuses us 
               <br />
               from making any fair, full or frank statement in 
               <br />
               this Convention. It deﬁnitely does not save us in 
               <br />
               any way, because if we make a libelous state- 
               <br />
               ment, it is still libelous whether the microphones 
               <br />
               are here or not, and the only way that we could 
               <br />
               come out in the open and make statements not for 
               <br />
               the public would be for the Chairman to call a 
               <br />
               secret meeting. I know that the Convention was 
               <br />
               referred to yesterday in a very low manner, but I 
               <br />
               say that the public of Newfoundland can be the 
               <br />
               best judges of that.
