               that Newfoundland’s entry into such a union 
               <br />
               would be immeasurably more advantageous as a 
               <br />
               sovereign nation than as a province of Canada. 
               <br />
               That rapidly approaching possibility is alone al- 
               <br />
               most enough to convince us of the wisdom of not 
               <br />
               taking such an irrevocable step as confederation.

               But enough of that digression. Now on this 
               <br />
               matter of Canadian terms. I have asked, “What 
               <br />
               terms?” The foolish argument is advanced that 
               <br />
               some of us are afraid to get the terms because they 
               <br />
               will be so good that only a fool would refuse to 
               <br />
               accept them. So say the confederates — it is just 
               <br />
               as well to give them their names, to call a spade 
               <br />
               a spade. An equally foolish argument is advanced 
               <br />
               by some anticonfederates, namely, “If we don’t 
               <br />
               get the terms, even the anticonfederates will 
               <br />
               begin to get suspicious and wonder about this 
               <br />
               vision of utopia that the Convention is trying to 
               <br />
               veil from the eyes of the people." Again I ask, 
               <br />
               “What terms?” The British North America Act 
               <br />
               lays down the conditions under which New- 
               <br />
               foundland may expect to be admitted into the 
               <br />
               Canadian confederation. It is alleged New— 
               <br />
               foundland will get special considerations through 
               <br />
               this Convention, which same Convention has not 
               <br />
               even the power much less the right to negotiate. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood himself in a letter in The Daily 
               <br />
               News some weeks ago, in reply to a letter of Mr. 
               <br />
               Bailey’s, admitted that we already knew 95% of 
               <br />
               the terms, it was the other 5% we had to find out 
               <br />
               about. Even admitting that narrow margin be- 
               <br />
               tween our present position and our position in 
               <br />
               confederation, it is plain from the committee’s 
               <br />
               report of the interview with Commission of 
               <br />
               Government that the 5 %, the special concessions, 
               <br />
               cannot even be discussed by a delegation; I refer 
               <br />
               you to page 2 of said report,1 which says that 
               <br />
               “Your Committee was advised that the words ‘or 
               <br />
               what other fiscal, political or economic arrange- 
               <br />
               ments may be possible,’ appearing in clause 3 of 
               <br />
               the resolution, should not be included in any 
               <br />
               enquiry or in the terms of reference of any delega- 
               <br />
               tion to the Dominion of Canada as these are 
               <br />
               matters entirely for discussion between govern- 
               <br />
               ments.” In other words, we are told indirectly that 
               <br />
               to properly negotiate satisfactory terms for entry 
               <br />
               into confederation we must do so through a 
               <br />
               proper government, and that, as far as I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span>

               <br />
               underlying this indecision about the merits of 
               <br />
               confederation as a form of government, the fear 
               <br />
               of some members in this assembly that in the 
               <br />
               event of confederation not being on a referendum 
               <br />
               the country will approve the status quo and these 
               <br />
               members will never get into politics. I do not 
               <br />
               share this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fear.</span> I think the majority of our people 
               <br />
               will repudiate Commission government when the 
               <br />
               time comes. If I am wrong, and they do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not,</span> then 
               <br />
               as much as it is against my grain, I will abide by 
               <br />
               their decision. Others will claim that if we get 
               <br />
               back responsible government we will never again 
               <br />
               hear tell of confederation. That is absurd. Any 
               <br />
               man or group of men can form a confederate 
               <br />
               party and go to the country. lfthat democratic fact 
               <br />
               and right is not convincing enough proof of the 
               <br />
               absurdity of the above claim, then I believe it is 
               <br />
               within the right of this Convention to put respon-
