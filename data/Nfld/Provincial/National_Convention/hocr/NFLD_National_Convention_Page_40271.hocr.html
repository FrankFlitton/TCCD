               The Education Committee brought in its

               we ought to have debated it longer. The Forestry

               day and they are bringing in a supplementary 
               <br />
               report. It deals with one of the basic resources of 
               <br />
               the country. Now in comes the Transportation

               that is in the reports, cold-blooded and with no

               adjectives —— for instance, note the model of

               <br />
               debate which makes them live, that makes the 
               <br />
               facts and ﬁgures get up and dance. Suppose we 
               <br />
               adopt another method, suppose we brought in all 
               <br />
               nine reports and debated them; suppose we ap- 
               <br />
               pointed a new committee —~ a report consolida- 
               <br />
               tion committee —— to knock all reports into one. 
               <br />
               Suppose we slapped that at the country — there 
               <br />
               would be a lot of mental indigestion. If we give 
               <br />
               it report by report, the country and ourselves will 
               <br />
               understand it better. So when we make our 
               <br />
               recommendations at last, it will not hit the 
               <br />
               country between the eyes as a surprise: they will 
               <br />
               have foreseen it, they will have anticipated it. I

               <br />
               they do not realise what a monumental thing it is.

               We are educating the people of Newfoundland

               while educating ourselves. We must always

               remember not to get lost in a forest of facts and 
               <br />
               statistics — always bearing in mind that what we 
               <br />
               want to know is this: what is it going to cost the 
               <br />
               future government of Newfoundland, and where 
               <br />
               are we going to ﬁnd it? We do not want people 
               <br />
               to think we are bogged down in the forest of 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins Before we get too far in the woods, 
               <br />
               and if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood is out of them, I wonder if 
               <br />
               he would revert to a question I asked earlier. I 
               <br />
               wanted to know the Committee’s opinion of the 
               <br />
               usefulness of the radio~telegraph as against the 
               <br />
               old land line and the comparative cost of both 
               <br />
               services. My own impression is that the present 
               <br />
               radio-telegraph service is very much slower, so 
               <br />
               far as individuals getting messages is concerned. 
               <br />
               It does not appear to have been gone into in the 
               <br />
               report.
