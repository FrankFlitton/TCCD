               Mr. Smallwood We are at clause 1 . In this docu- 
               <br />
               ment there are 23 clauses. We are at the shortest 
               <br />
               one of them all. It might be very useful if we 
               <br />
               determine in advance that very point. A clause is 
               <br />
               given. An explanation of that clause is contained 
               <br />
               in the Black Books —- that is, the report brought 
               <br />
               back by the delegation. There is no suggestion 
               <br />
               that we take up those two thundering great 
               <br />
               volumes, begin at the ﬁrst page and read through 
               <br />
               to the end.... The background of the Grey Book 
               <br />
               is in the Black Book. The Black Book explains 
               <br />
               the Grey Book. What is the use of telling the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland that “Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will have, as from the date of union, the status of 
               <br />
               a province” if you do not explain what is the 
               <br />
               status of a province?

               <br />
               is unambiguous and unequivocal, and is general-
