               would not be able to get along with the budget

               made by the Commission of Government

               extra hospitals, the General Hospital which is not

               Western Memorial Hospital. The late Sir John

               Puddester told us in committee here about 12 
               <br />

               ing then and would spend this year, they would 
               <br />
               require considerably more money to maintain the 
               <br />
               service, and that the maintenance cost would be 
               <br />
               considerably more. 1 think, if my memory serves 
               <br />
               me correctly, that it would run at least another $1 
               <br />
               million more. I may be wrong, perhaps Major

               Mr. Hickman So that would bring it up to about 
               <br />
               $7 million odd. And I understand now that they 
               <br />
               anticipate another million extra, which will be a

               <br />
               remember, in the early days of the Convention, 
               <br />
               we were given a reconstruction program by the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government, and in there they 
               <br />
               planned to spend $59 million or $60 million in 
               <br />
               ten years. That would be about $6 million per 
               <br />
               year that they had planned, providing the funds 
               <br />
               were there, to spend on reconstruction. Suppos- 
               <br />
               ing we cut that in half, making it $3 million for 
               <br />
               reconstruction; yet in this budget there is only 
               <br />

               is Education which roughly is $500,000 over and 
               <br />

               <br />
               and above the provincial budget. We will cut that 
               <br />
               down to $1.5 million. which will bring it down to 
               <br />

               on today‘s basis. The reconstruction which the

               <br />

               <br />
               $2.5 million, on that total it brings us to a $4.5 
               <br />
               million expenditure, and l have tried to be con- 
               <br />
               servative in this, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4.5</span> million over and above the

               expenditure which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood provided for 
               <br />
               in yesterday's budget. If you add that 10 the $15 
               <br />
               million expenditure which he anticipated you get 
               <br />
               approximately <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$19.5</span> million. That would be our

               expenditure if we have to spend on the same basis 
               <br />
               as we have the last few years, if we maintain the 
               <br />
               same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">services.</span> There is no large provision there 
               <br />
               for relief, but I will come to that later on.

               concerned Mr. Smallwood can argue forever on 
               <br />
               that point, but 1 will never be convinced that

               <br />
               money for the boats, taken from the money we 
               <br />
               accumulated, belongs to current <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue.</span> 1 know 
               <br />
               that last year the government did that. but they

               were wrong too, like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Smallwood.</span> You can 
               <br />
               argue till the cows come home, but it is not the

               right principle. l have yet to see a balance sheet

               that did not separate capital from ordinary expen-

               <br />
               shown in this provincial balance sheet should 
               <br />
