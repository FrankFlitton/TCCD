               that Newfoundlanders were about the best

               Mr. Harrington On the ﬁrst page where you 
               <br />
               state the uses of ﬂuorspar, as a ﬂux for open— 
               <br />
               hearth steel, etc., I understood that one of the uses 
               <br />
               of this ﬂuorspar is for certain war equipment. I 
               <br />
               was told it was used for goggles. I was wondering 
               <br />
               if that had anything to do with the increase in 
               <br />
               production and the drop in production, around 
               <br />
               1943 it is only 12,900 tons, and in 1944 it is up 
               <br />
               to 21,000, and then again when the war was over 
               <br />
               it dropped to 18,000.

               Mr. Higgins You mean not so many goggles 
               <br />
               were sold?

               Mr. Harrington Well, not only goggles; I

               thought that was only one of the items.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Higgins No, I think it was because they 
               <br />
               could not meet competitive prices. They are 
               <br />
               sending ﬂuorspar in from Mexico much cheaper 
               <br />
               than we can produce it here. Even with that long 
               <br />
               haul from Mexico they still seem to be able to sell 
               <br />
               much cheaper. I presume it is the labour price that 
               <br />
               makes the difference.

               Mr. Burry That’s the way I understood it. In 
               <br />
               1946 they did not export anything to the United 
               <br />
               States because they could not meet the price.

               Mr. Hickman Have they any association with

               any large manufacturing company in the USA?

               <br />
               the going was very hard, and it was only real

               believe, Mr. Hollett, that the road between Burin
