               You’llremember, Mr. Chairman, thatin 1940- 
               <br />
               4l our expenditures were roughly $16.25 million 
               <br />
               a year. And they gradually kept going up. year 
               <br />
               after year, year after year, and in including that 
               <br />
               $21 million we had taken into consideration 
               <br />
               what might have happened under another form of 
               <br />
               government, if at that time that such a form of 
               <br />
               government had control of the affairs of New— 
               <br />
               foundland. We certainly would not have driven 
               <br />
               our expenditure up from $16 million to what it 
               <br />
               was at that time, around $30 million, but we 
               <br />
               would have tried to level off that expenditure, and 
               <br />
               once we realised that the cost of living had gone 
               <br />
               up we felt that that expenditure should properly 
               <br />
               have tapered off, and should not have gone above 
               <br />
               $21 million. I’ll go a little further now and say 
               <br />
               $22 million a year. We would have tried to keep 
               <br />
               her down because in good times its always good 
               <br />
               government to put away something for a rainy 
               <br />
               day.... Consequently, we would have tried to save 
               <br />
               some money. Our taxation on the ordinary neces- 
               <br />
               saries of life is not particularly high, and whilst 
               <br />
               the cost of living is high, the taxation per capita 
               <br />
               in the country is not as much as some people 
               <br />
               would imagine it is. And our idea of having 
               <br />
               expenditures of $21—22 million would have left 
               <br />
               us considerably more money in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treasuryl</span> it 
               <br />
               looked to me, and it looked to all of us, that as 
               <br />
               more money came in it gave an incentive to the 
               <br />
               government to start doling it out in all directions. 
               <br />
               You must remember that there were millions of 
               <br />
               dollars spent for which we got no value whatever. 
               <br />
               True we built roads, but how many dollars, how 
               <br />
               many cents in dollar value did we get from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">build</span> 
               <br />
               ing roads? True, we built the vessels, vessels that 
               <br />
               cost nearly $3 million and should have cost, and 
               <br />
               were estimated to cost just $1 million dollars. 
               <br />
               These are things, if we go into details, which 
               <br />
               show that it shouldn’t have gone over $21-22 
               <br />
               million, and will prove what I’ve asserted. Ordi- 
               <br />
               nary common sense and good, sound, economic 
               <br />
               government would have held that expenditure 
               <br />
               down to $22 million, and if we had held it down 
               <br />
               to $22 million the statement I made the other day 
               <br />
               about having around $60 million in the treasury 
               <br />
               would have been a reality. But they didn’t do it, 
               <br />
               and now we’re in a position where the expendi~

               tures are driven up. We arrived at a stage one time 
               <br />
               before in our history, and I was unfortunately in 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcial capacity at that time, when expendi- 
               <br />
               tures were up for ordinary government and we 
               <br />
               found we had to try and cut down our expendi- 
               <br />
               tures to try and square our accounts. We couldn’t 
               <br />
               do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> Therefore I hold that in good times, good 
               <br />
               government will try and be economical and 
               <br />
               saving and thrifty, because there are cycles in the 
               <br />
               world where you have good times for ﬁve or six 
               <br />
               years, then it turns over to bad times. Well, a good 
               <br />
               government will make provision in the good time 
               <br />
               to carry us over in the bad time. And when bad 
               <br />
               times arrive you’re able to weather the storm. 
               <br />
               That might have been in the past one reason why 
               <br />
               we were unable to carry on, not so much because 
               <br />
               we had incurred liabilities that we shouldn’t have. 
               <br />
               I don’t want to repeat those things again this 
               <br />
               afternoon, butl still hold that at no time during 
               <br />
               the past ﬁve or six years should the ordinary 
               <br />
               expenditures of Newfoundland have gone above 
               <br />
               $21~22 million a year. And I’m rather generous 
               <br />
               then, because one of the Commissioners for 
               <br />
               Finance, a little over a year ago, told us that to 
               <br />
               ordinarily operate Newfoundland, it shouldn’t 
               <br />
               cost any more than $23 million, when they were 
               <br />
               slapping money in all directions. I don’t want to 
               <br />
               go into details this afternoon of where it went, 
               <br />
               because it would occupy this house, and I’d have 
               <br />
               to bring all these Auditor General’s reports back 
               <br />
               and find out where many millions of dollars have 
               <br />
               gone. But if sound government, government of 
               <br />
               our own, people who were interested in our own 
               <br />
               affairs, who wanted to provide for the future, had 
               <br />
               taken the necessary care, I feel that our ordinary 
               <br />
               annual expenditures should never have risen 
               <br />
               above $22 million and not $21 million. I’m 
               <br />
               prepared to change it to $22 million.
