               are two statements to which I would direct your 
               <br />
               attention. “This matter”, it says, the matter of 
               <br />
               Gander, “was also taken up with the Dominions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce by the British delegation on its recent visit 
               <br />
               to London. The result effected, as you are 
               <br />
               aware, savings to the treasury of the country of 
               <br />
               some $500,000." That, as I understand the situa- 
               <br />
               tion, is not at all in accordance with the facts, 
               <br />
               which are these: that before the London delega— 
               <br />
               tion went across the Atlantic at all the New- 
               <br />
               foundland government announced that a special 
               <br />
               commission was coming from the Ministry of 
               <br />
               Civil Aviation in London to inquire into Gander, 
               <br />
               and a statement would be made. The statement 
               <br />
               was made, namely, that the British government 
               <br />
               would absorb two-thirds of the operating loss on 
               <br />
               Gander, and the Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               would absorb the other third. So it was not the 
               <br />
               result of any work or suggestion of the London 
               <br />
               delegation whatsoever in any shape or form that 
               <br />
               this arrangement was made.

               The second point is this: “For”, it says, “if we 
               <br />
               were rid of this airport liability it would effect a 
               <br />
               further saving of not less than $750,000 in our 
               <br />
               annual expenditure.” 1 don’t follow that at all. 
               <br />
               The total operating loss at Gander is estimated to 
               <br />
               be $750,000, of which $250,000 is to be paid by 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland government. Not three 
               <br />
               quarters, but one quarter of a million dollars, 
               <br />
               unless, in that sentence, the Committee wishes to 
               <br />
               convey the thought that the capital expenditures 
               <br />
               being made at Gander in the last two years are 
               <br />
               going to continue indefinitely, and therefore, 
               <br />
               with capital expenditure on the one hand and that 
               <br />
               $250,000 on the other it comes to $750,000.

               On page 10 the Committee gives us its es- 
               <br />
               timate of the government’s expenditure for three 
               <br />
               years to come, and the amount is roughly $25 
               <br />
               million. They have brought it from $27.25 mil- 
               <br />
               lion, which they tell us is what the present 
               <br />
               government is now spending on ordinary ac- 
               <br />
               count, to roughly $25 million, and they have 
               <br />
               brought it down by saving $1.25 million in the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               debate is over, but even allowing for all that it 
               <br />
               stands at $25 million. Then we find them estimat-

               <br />

               Now number one, that $5 million is a purely 
               <br />
               hypothetical sum of money. It does notexist, only 
               <br />
               in a man’s mind... The ﬁrst question is this: we 
               <br />

               <br />
               pensions for three years. What about the fourth 
               <br />
               year? Do you cut it out or stop it? Are you going 
               <br />
               to give old age pensions only if you have a 
               <br />
               surplus? Must our worn out toilers wait until the 
               <br />
               government has a surplus before you increase old 
               <br />
               age pensions? Is it something that you think of 
               <br />
               only when you have spent all your money, and if 
               <br />
               you have everything you can think of, and you 
               <br />
               have a bit left over, well then you will give the 
               <br />
               worn out toilers a little bit more, out ofa surplus, 
               <br />
               not an ordinary expenditure at all, but just purely 
               <br />
               a surplus?
