               <br />
               also spoke strongly against the Dominion 
               <br />
               government plan, and described it as “the scut- 
               <br />
               tling of confederation". MacDonald of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia pointed out that the provinces were left 
               <br />
               with “great and growing obligations" to their 
               <br />
               people, but to meet them the only exclusive ﬁels

               are real estate and automobiles in the hands of 
               <br />
               their owners. He expressed the view that the 
               <br />
               provinces had made a bad bargain in confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. He predicted, and these are his words, that 
               <br />
               “Provincial autonomy will be gone, provincial 
               <br />
               independence will vanish, provincial dignity will 
               <br />
               disappear, provincial governments will become 
               <br />
               mere annuitants of Ottawa, provincial public life 
               <br />
               — and I do not think these words are too strong 
               <br />
               — will be debased and degraded”. Premier Mc- 
               <br />
               Nair of New Brunswick Spoke like MacDonald 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia against the proposals. Premier 
               <br />
               Garson of Manitoba in his address made remarks 
               <br />
               which show only too clearly the differences <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be.</span> 
               <br />
               tween the provinces, particularly between the 
               <br />
               provinces of Ontario and Québec and the com 
               <br />
               paratively poor provinces, as did also Premier 
               <br />
               Hart of British Columbia. Premier Jones said that 
               <br />
               PEI had entered confederation upon the under- 
               <br />
               standing that it would receive from the federal 
               <br />
               government such subsidies as would enable it to 
               <br />

               cial government without resorting to direct taxa— 
               <br />
               tion. “The subsidies paid in the past to Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island", he said, “and the amount now 
               <br />
               offered are totally inadequate.“ Premier Douglas 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan expressed great disappointment 
               <br />
               over the Dominion govemment’s proposals and 
               <br />
               stressed the need for an emergency grant to meet

               such crises as drought, crop failure and agricul- 
               <br />
               ture relief. Premier Manning of Alberta stated 
               <br />
               that the proposals failed to meet the conditions 
               <br />
               which his government thought necessary for a

               that in spite of the objections raised by the nine 
               <br />
               provincial premiers, the Dominion government 
               <br />
               would stand firm and had no intention ofmodify— 
               <br />
               ing the proposals. I would ask you to look at your 
               <br />
               Grey Book again, and see what Premier King 
               <br />
               says about the proposals: "it is the best we can 
               <br />
               offer”. His speech only served to increase the 
               <br />
               anger of the premiers, and particularly so ofthose 
               <br />
               of Ontario and Quebec. Said Mr. Duplessis, “if 
               <br />
               the Ottawa proposals are in the nature of a ‘take 
               <br />
               itor leave it‘, I will leave it and take my train back 
               <br />
               to Quebec.” You will ﬁnd that he did do that. 
               <br />
               Premiers MacDonald, Manning and Douglas also 
               <br />
               spoke that day, as also did Premier Drew of 
               <br />
               Ontario; and when the conference adjourned, the 
               <br />
               word “failure“ could be written across the whole 
               <br />
               proceedings. Manning attacked what he called 
               <br />
               “the uncompromising rigidity" of the Dominion 
               <br />
               government. Their attitude, he said, was “in- 
               <br />
               defensible" and he laid the responsibility for 
               <br />
               failure on the doorstep of the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Drew of Ontario complained, as had 
               <br />
               Duplessis, of the ‘take it or leave <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it”</span> attitude of 
               <br />
               the Canadian government. He commended to 
               <br />
               Finance Minister llsley the careful reading “of a 
               <br />
               book called Mein Kampf." He said he would ﬁnd 
               <br />
               there clearly set out the formula that the authority 
               <br />
               of small individual states ought to be diminished 
               <br />
               and their power invested in a central government. 
               <br />
               Mr. llsley, he said, had spoken of a “heavy 
               <br />
               obligation“ involved in carrying health <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in'</span> 
               <br />
               surance, baby bonuses and old age pensions, but 
               <br />
               it happens, he said. that there were to be ﬁnanced 
               <br />
               by new levies upon the taxpayers. He, Mr. Drew, 
               <br />
               was certainly opposed to double taxation in any 
               <br />
               and every ﬁeld. Subsidies, repeated Mr. Duples- 
               <br />
               sis, cannot compensate for permanent rights. 
               <br />
               Centralisation gave birth to bureaucracy, and 
               <br />
               bureaucracy was the enemy of democracy.
