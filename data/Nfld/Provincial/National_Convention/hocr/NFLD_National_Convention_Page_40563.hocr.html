               <br />
               any company is not prepared to pay 10 cents a ton 
               <br />
               on all iron ore mined in Labrador. I am sure if the 
               <br />
               government had said, “You must deﬁnitely pay 
               <br />
               10 cents a ton on the iron ore you take out of 
               <br />
               Labrador", it would have happened, and the deal 
               <br />
               would have gone through. The western world 
               <br />
               needs the iron ore. If they had to pay $1 they 
               <br />
               would have paid it to get the iron ore.

               The same thing applies all down through the

               years. You will notice the various companies

               some 10 cents a horsepower, some nothing. Now 
               <br />
               this is a similar agreement ~— it is a little better, 
               <br />
               we are getting 15 cents a horsepower. I am not 
               <br />
               satisfied with a one~sided agreement. The 
               <br />
               government will get very little royalty; any com-

               is going to do. They know they are going to make

               money. There are so many ways to diddle the

               That is their comment. One big thing that has 
               <br />
               arisen out ofthatcorrespondence is that the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government must have been fully 
               <br />
               informed of the possibilities in Labrador at that 
               <br />
               time... It would appear the government did have 
               <br />
               full knowledge in 1936, when they made that 
               <br />
               agreement. The Mining Committee has now 
               <br />
               evidence of prospecting in the area at that time. 
               <br />
               A group had made application for concessions in 
               <br />
               Labrador under the Small Concessions Act, 
               <br />
               whereby no person could get more than 100 
               <br />
               square miles. The amended act had to be passed. 
               <br />
               Prior to that, we are informed, an agreement had 
               <br />
               been made by letter with Sir John Hope Simpson, 
               <br />

               The concession from the Quebec government 
               <br />
               was in 1942; the Quebec act was passed in 1946; 
               <br />
               and as we have explained, as a result of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cor»</span>

               respondence and interviews the amended act of

               <br />
               made a better deal than we did; but as the acts are

               binding it is impossible for all practical purposes 
               <br />

               We are extremely doubtful whether any great 
               <br />
               amount will accrue to the country from royalties. 
               <br />
               We point out that if the company takes up 
               <br />
               100,000 square miles, they pay $120,000 a year, 
               <br />
               they have 35% corporation tax, and water-power 
               <br />
               at IS cents. The greatest return to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be the employment the company would 
               <br />
               give. The main reason for going into so much 
               <br />
               detail is because we believe whatever value this 
               <br />
               body may have is in publicising the facts of the 
               <br />
               agreement, and we may make recommenda- 
               <br />
               tions, as you may properly do today, whereby in 
               <br />
               consideration of the new application that has 
               <br />
               been made by the company for the export of 
               <br />
               water—power, it might be conditional upon the 
               <br />
               power tax being put up to $1 to equal Quebec, 
               <br />
               and chiefly that the town be in Newfoundland- 
               <br />
               Labrador; because with the different methods of 
               <br />
               earning money, apart from mining, it would be of 
               <br />
               great benefit to whatever country the town is in. 
               <br />
               For that reason we feel we have not overstressed 
               <br />
               it and we feel it is only ﬁtting and proper that it 
               <br />
               should be brought through us to the attention of 
               <br />
