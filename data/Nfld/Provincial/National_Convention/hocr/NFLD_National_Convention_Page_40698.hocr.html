               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I was saying, 
               <br />
               when the House rose for a short recess, that that 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman in Fair Island, Bonavista Bay would 
               <br />
               not appreciate at all this rosy and optimistic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pic</span> 
               <br />
               ture of Newfoundland. Nor would the ﬁsherman 
               <br />
               in Plate Cove West who says in his letter to me, 
               <br />
               “The people here never saw worse times in the 
               <br />
               worst years of the depression than they are now. 
               <br />
               They are starving slow but sure." And so I could 
               <br />
               quote letters from many parts of Bonavista Bay 
               <br />
               and from many other bays and many other coasts. 
               <br />
               And if you were to tell the ﬁshermen on the north 
               <br />
               side of Bonavista Bay, and more especially those 
               <br />
               skipper men, who are amongst the finest breed 
               <br />
               that this country ever produced, who are ﬁnding 
               <br />
               it necessary now to sell their schooners and gear 
               <br />
               to get enough money to live on after three years 
               <br />
               of failure of the Labrador ﬁshery, if you were to 
               <br />
               tell them that they have nothing to worry about, 
               <br />
               that the last 50 years were good years, and the 
               <br />
               next 50 years will be good, they would only laugh 
               <br />
               in your face, they would not believe it any more 
               <br />
               than I believe it. If you were to tell the ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               who came back from the water and from 
               <br />
               Labrador this year, only to find that their ﬁsh was 
               <br />
               not worth a single, solitary dollar incash, that it 
               <br />
               was only a receipt which could not name a price 
               <br />
               in many cases, that Newfoundland was on a ﬁrm 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foundation,</span> these men too would refuse to believe 
               <br />
               you, and with every good reason.

               Now I want to pass on to page 6 of the report.

               It tells us that the country should have a mercan- 
               <br />
               tile marine. Now I am not going to argue whether 
               <br />
               we should or should not, whether we should have 
               <br />
               our own local bottoms to do our own foreign 
               <br />
               trade. That is a big subject. It has been debated a 
               <br />
               good many times, but I want this House to be on 
               <br />
               its guard against taking the ipsy-dipsy and unsup- 
               <br />
               ported and unproved word of the Economic Com- 
               <br />
               mittee on this question. I remember an article by 
               <br />
               Mr. H.R. Brookes of the firm of Job Bros, a man 
               <br />
               who has had a great deal of experience with 
               <br />
               shipping, I remember a conversation here be— 
               <br />
               tween Mr. Bailey and the Hon. R.B. Job on this 
               <br />
               very question. This is a very, very vexed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques“</span>

               tion, not one on which we can speak glibly. And 
               <br />
               yet in comes the Finance Committee, bravely as 
               <br />
               though there were never any questions on it, as 
               <br />
               though there was only one side to it. It is obvious, 
               <br />
               according to them, that we should start a mercan- 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Just one point if I may.... I think

               in fairness to the compilers of this report I should 
               <br />
               again remind you that opinion is merely a matter 
               <br />
               of judgement upon which men may reasonably 
               <br />
               differ, and I do not feel that in the expression of

               an opinion merely that the Committee, or the 
               <br />

               the position where they had to defend a mere 
               <br />
               question of opinion. If they were making it a 
               <br />
               statement of fact, yes. Then, of course, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inde~</span>

               Mr. Smallwood Well, it is obviously a state-
