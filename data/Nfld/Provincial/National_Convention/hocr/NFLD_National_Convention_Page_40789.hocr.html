               $4.03. There’s where the government broke faith 
               <br />
               with our people, for this and only this could have 
               <br />
               stabilised the price of codfish for 1947. And that, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, is what I mean when I say we do 
               <br />
               not ﬁght back. Further, no loss to our treasury 
               <br />
               need be incurred as it is unquestionable that the 
               <br />
               pound will recover given time, and we having no 
               <br />
               immediate need for our surplus, could await that 
               <br />
               time. Just such a transaction suggests the 
               <br />
               feasibility of holding some of our surplus in 
               <br />
               pounds sterling — an amount say equivalent to 
               <br />
               the interest~free loan, though not with the Crown 
               <br />
               Agents but in a special trading fund. It em- 
               <br />
               phasises the selection of business where and 
               <br />
               when it best serves our country. In other words 
               <br />
               our purchases should get channelled in the direc- 
               <br />
               tion where they are best calculated to stabilise our 
               <br />
               economy. Can we do this? Most certainly we 
               <br />
               can.... I am urged to suggest what machinery of 
               <br />
               government would be necessary to affect this. As 
               <br />
               I see it an actively functioning department of 
               <br />
               supply and a foreign exchange advisory board 
               <br />
               would be sufﬁcient. We are years behind in at— 
               <br />
               tending to these matters. If we are to protect the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen’s catch of 1948 as well as our other 
               <br />
               exports to sterling purchasers, it is essential that 
               <br />
               we act along these lines immediately. No one 
               <br />
               need get hurt. In fact, it would be good for all. 
               <br />
               But presently, a line of low grade com~ 
               <br />
               modities is saturating our shelves. Where it isn’t 
               <br />
               low grade it is high grade, too high for the 
               <br />
               economy of our people. Our people have been on 
               <br />
               a spending spree. Some confuse that with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> 
               <br />
               ard of living. The proﬁts have been eagerly 
               <br />
               garnered, and I have good reason to believe are 
               <br />
               being smuggled out of this country to go on 
               <br />
               deposit in United States and Canadian banks. 
               <br />
               How then, unless this is stopped, can we have our 
               <br />
               local investments made and our local industrial 
               <br />
               life developed? This is not an anticonfederate 
               <br />
               argument. The question of government is far 
               <br />
               from my mind. It is my suggestion, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, of possible methods of dealing with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">situa</span> 
               <br />
               tion which makes our economy vulnerable. I say 
               <br />
               this, because our trade with Canada has been, is, 
               <br />
               and will continue to be the greatest of all deter- 
               <br />
               rents to Newfoundland’s progress. It has been so 
               <br />
               under past and present governments, it can be 
               <br />
               only increased if by chance we subjugate oursel- 
               <br />
               ves as a province of the Canadian government.
