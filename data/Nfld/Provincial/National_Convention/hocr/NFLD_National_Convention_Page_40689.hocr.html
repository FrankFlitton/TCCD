               document which we have before us today would 
               <br />
               not be what it is. I contend, gentlemen, that this 
               <br />
               is the ﬁnest piece of work of its kind ever 
               <br />
               produced in this country especially when we 
               <br />
               realise that no experts were made available to the 
               <br />
               Committee, and that they had but limited access 
               <br />
               to facts relating to the govemment’s ﬁnance. It 
               <br />
               would be well for the members of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion and the country in general to study it careful— 
               <br />
               ly, covering as it does in detail the history of our 
               <br />
               ﬁnances and matters relative thereto over a 
               <br />

               divided into periods affected by the various

               economic changes which occurred, and which of 
               <br />
               necessity affected the ﬁnance picture. It is my 
               <br />
               opinion that if any one of the reports of this 
               <br />
               Convention is to materially assist us in reaching 
               <br />
               a decision, this Report of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               is of paramount importance, in conjunction of 
               <br />
               course with the economic side of the picture. Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, it is mere folly to waste time in 
               <br />
               criticising the report; rather should we spend 
               <br />
               more time in trying to learn something from it by 
               <br />
               asking questions and discussing them in an intel- 
               <br />
               ligent manner in the light of the facts presented 
               <br />
               therein. Major Cashin, in his review on Thursday, 
               <br />
               cemented on the high revenue of the present 
               <br />
               ﬁscal year to date, and remarked that by the end 
               <br />
               of the year it may exceed $40 million. This is well 
               <br />
               in excess of the $37.5 million in the budget 
               <br />
               estimates, which incidentally was by far die 
               <br />
               greatest ever anticipated in this country. 70% of 
               <br />
               this estimate has been realised in six months, and 
               <br />
               this has been achieved in spite of certain duty 
               <br />
               reductions made in the past year. The chief 
               <br />
               source of revenue is still customs and excise,

               <br />

               man in this Convention to state definitely

               self-determination. We may have this now for the

               time in our long history. Our finances are sound, 
               <br />
               our economy is more diversified and our strategic

               Mr. Newell A little while ago I asked a simple 
               <br />
               question and when I finished somebody else 
               <br />
               started to talk about something else, and I think 
               <br />
               the point may have been overlooked. Before we 
               <br />
               close I’d like a simple <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">answer,</span> The question is 
               <br />
               this, in reference to a statement that it is the 
               <br />
               considered opinion of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               that at no time during the period from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4041</span> to 
               <br />
               45 -46 should the total expenditures of the country 
               <br />
               have exceeded the sum of $21 million, what I 
               <br />
               want to know is this. In making that statement, 
               <br />
               was the Committee considering that the present 
               <br />
               services which our government is providing 
               <br />
               could have been provided on $21 million, or were 
               <br />
               they looking at it from the point of view that we 
               <br />
               could have done with fewer services, which 
               <br />
               would have reduced the expenditures to $21 mil- 
               <br />
               lion? I’m not arguing the point one way or
