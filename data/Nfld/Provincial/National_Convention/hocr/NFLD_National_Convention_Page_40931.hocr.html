               discussing this matter of grants from one

               unsound principle; in fact, I think I used the 
               <br />
               expression that it was a vicious principle to

               one. I would he in favour, as were the other seven

               <br />
               provincial meeting. I got two clear impressions. 
               <br />
               One has not been mentioned here at all, the 
               <br />
               question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principle.</span> That is, many people in 
               <br />
               Canada, including well-known people in public 
               <br />
               life there, felt that by these tax agreements, and 
               <br />
               by allowing the central government to control the 
               <br />
               finances to a greater extent, you would be 
               <br />
               destroying the whole basis of federal government 
               <br />
               and create a unitarian state. That is what they 
               <br />
               disagreed with. I believe Mr. King felt the same 
               <br />
               way some years ago. Another thing I noticed was 
               <br />
               this; whenever Mr. King was present at that meet- 
               <br />
               ing he was careful to say very little. These were 
               <br />
               two different impressions. The question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prin»</span> 
               <br />
               ciple we ought to consider, for the simple reason 
               <br />
               that if you put any more control into the hands of 
               <br />
               the federal government, then you are going to get 
               <br />
               more dictation from the central government, and 
               <br />
               your province is governed by remote control 
               <br />
               rather than if you kept more control in your 
               <br />
               province itself. I believe very ﬁrmly, if you are 
               <br />
               going to develop a country, no matter how small, 
               <br />
               it has to be done by the people themselves, as 
               <br />
               close as you can get to the people —— build it up 
               <br />
               from the small unions like local councils. When 
               <br />
               you get finances centralised in one government a 
               <br />
               long distance away, it makes it more expensive 
               <br />
               on the taxpayer. That came to my mind when Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood referred to the possibility of losing 
               <br />
               some of our services. I do not think it is likely that
